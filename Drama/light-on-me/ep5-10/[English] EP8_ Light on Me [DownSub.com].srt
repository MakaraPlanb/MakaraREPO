1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,319
Saebit Student Council Alliance Trip!

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,480
During the two days we're with...

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:07,240
Saebit Girls High School's
student council,

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,279
I, Namgung,

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,800
am going to make a girlfriend.

6
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:12,519
Give me a round of applause!

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,199
Clap.

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,839
I'm a fool for expecting otherwise.

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,679
I, Namgung, will not receive criticisms.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,039
I will only take questions.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,159
Do you have any specific plans?

12
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:36,560
You could say that my face is a plan.

13
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:37,799
It's quite...

14
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,759
specific, you know.

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,119
Do we have to keep listening?

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,200
Gosh. This is why it's hard to talk to
people who have never dated.

17
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,640
You've never dated anyone?

18
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,920
It's nice to meet someone who's like me.

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,359
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,480
- Namgung, you need to watch--
- Oh, that's right.

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,519
Oh Tae-Gyeong.

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,439
Did you meet Da-On that day?

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,719
What?

24
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,640
Yes, I did.

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,319
It rained a lot that night.

26
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,200
That's right.

27
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,280
I was going home
since we didn't go to karaoke,

28
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,799
it started raining like crazy.
My uniform got soaked,

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,159
and my mom yelled at me.

30
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,879
Did you get caught in the rain?

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
No.

32
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,879
I didn't get caught in the rain at all.

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,000
You can be honest with me.

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,680
You're allowed to.

35
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,519
Gosh, you're so reliable.

36
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,480
Okay. I'll try to be honest with you.

37
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,680
Wait. It's raining.

38
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,039
I'll get going now.

39
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,560
Hold on, Tae-Gyeong.

40
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,810
Take this with you.

41
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,719
If I take this,
you have to walk in the rain.

42
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,439
It's fine. I like walking in the rain.

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,479
I'll get going.

44
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,280
I'll see you on Monday.

45
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,439
See you tomorrow.

46
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,439
You said you'll be honest.

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,280
Da-On, how can you be late
on a Monday morning?

48
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,199
Did the sun rise in the west today?

49
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,159
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:21,039
I'm sorry, guys. Did you wait long?

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,560
It's okay.

52
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,879
While you were gone, I held the meeting.

53
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,560
There's no need to be moved.

54
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,360
I just said useless things.

55
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,199
Good job, Namgung.

56
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,199
What is this? Are you sick?

57
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,719
Did you catch a cold?

58
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,120
No. I'll be better
after I take some medicine.

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,159
I'm fine.

60
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,680
No, you're not. You don't look well.

61
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,199
Do you want to leave early
and go see a doctor together?

62
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,319
I'm not suggesting it
because I want to leave early.

63
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,080
I am seriously worried about you.

64
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,199
Goodness. I'm fine.

65
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,759
Okay. Let's start our meeting.

66
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,400
(Tae-Gyeong. Come find me if you have
any questions. Come even if you don't.)

67
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,519
(Tae-Gyeong. Come find me if you have
any questions. Come even if you don't.)

68
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,050
"Even if you don't".

69
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,279
Is this a different one?

70
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,480
This is fun.

71
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,920
You think it's fun?

72
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes. Are there any other ones?

73
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,680
There are a lot.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,759
This one is a talking dog.

75
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,639
- This is hilarious.
- It's really talking.

76
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,480
It sounds like it's talking.

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,610
This is so funny.

78
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,360
What is that?

79
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,959
Hold on.

80
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,360
It's an umbrella and some medicine.

81
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,839
Does someone have a cold?

82
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,170
Why'd they leave it there? How scary.

83
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,839
They should've said something.

84
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,360
Do you think it's a ghost?

85
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,519
What are you talking about?

86
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,000
Give it to me.

87
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,839
This won't do. Walk me home today.

88
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,800
I'm scared.

89
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:45,240
Sin Da-On. What are you thinking about?

90
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,279
What?

91
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,160
It's nothing.

92
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,759
I'm not feeling well. I should go home.

93
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,759
Let's go. Take your bag.

94
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,959
(Namgung Si-Un)

95
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,360
Oh, my.

96
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,199
Are you lost?

97
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,480
You scared me!

98
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,360
Why did you scream upon seeing my face?

99
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,839
Give me some time alone.

100
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,800
I need to calm my mind and body.

101
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,560
What's wrong with you?

102
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,439
What was I thinking upon seeing
someone who's like family?

103
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,399
You're so noisy!

104
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:15,480
(Saebit Boys High School)

105
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,600
What is this?

106
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,199
Did you do something wrong?

107
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,759
What are you talking about?
It's not like that.

108
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,319
No, it's not.

109
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,240
You're only nice to me
when you feel bad.

110
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,519
You're really tactless you know.

111
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,480
Never mind then.

112
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,600
I didn't do anything wrong,

113
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,240
so don't be mistaken about anything.

114
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,920
No way.

115
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,680
What was I thinking?

116
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,199
I wish I could erase my memory.

117
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,519
What are you talking about?
You're so noisy.

118
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,040
Hey. Do I need your permission
to talk with my own mouth?

119
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,480
Yes. Shut your mouth.

120
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,720
What is it? Are you feeling sick?

121
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,160
This is the first time you
didn't have a comeback.

122
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
Good morning, guys.

123
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,120
Why aren't you on the bus?

124
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,399
Sin Da-On.
Do you know what Namgung did to me?

125
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,959
What? What? What did I do?

126
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,959
Hey. I was in the middle of talking!

127
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,680
Hey.
Can you stop addressing me like that?

128
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,600
I'm older than you.

129
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,399
Why are you guys fighting?

130
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,439
He started screaming like he saw
a monster when he saw me.

131
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,839
He must've forgotten what he looks like.

132
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,799
This won't do. Hold hands.

133
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,519
- What?
- What? No.

134
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,399
You guys fight too much these days.

135
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,759
If you don't want to stand here
for 30 minutes while holding hands,

136
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,039
Shake hands and make up.

137
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,759
As expected from Da-On.
That's a great idea.

138
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,639
Come on. Shake hands.

139
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,399
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

140
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,120
Did you just get here?

141
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,639
You worked so hard already.

142
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,240
All you need to do is
get on the bus and have fun.

143
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,279
Oh, right. Da-On.

144
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,210
Take this and give it to anyone
who gets carsick.

145
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,279
Okay.

146
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,960
Guys, get on the bus. I'll go on last.

147
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,799
- Okay.
- Okay.

148
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,879
Your eyes will burn a hole in him.

149
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,090
Right.

150
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,240
What?

151
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,759
If you didn't hear it, forget it.

152
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,559
I'll see you later.

153
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,240
Let's go.

154
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,480
Can I sit here?

155
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,679
Of course.

156
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,879
Give me your bag. I'll put it up.

157
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,879
This is the most exciting time.
Right before we leave.

158
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,519
It's my first time...

159
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,279
going somewhere in a group,
so I'm really excited.

160
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,600
Thanks to you, my cold got better.

161
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,039
You're the one
who got me the medicine, right?

162
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,759
Thank you.

163
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,399
That's good.

164
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,200
You should put on your seatbelt.

165
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
You're right.

166
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,200
I guess there is something you can't do.

167
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,720
You're right.

168
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,279
How cool.

169
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,960
I thought you only went on trips
like this in college.

170
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,840
The student council goes on trips
sometimes to get close.

171
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,799
It's nice if everyone gets along.

172
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,519
Breaking news.
We're having a barbecue later!

173
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,120
Barbecue!

174
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:26,240
I heard there's a souvenir shop
a little further down.

175
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,360
I want to go there.

176
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,960
Da-On. I want to go there.

177
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:39,799
Okay. Let's go then.

178
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,600
You're so quiet that
I didn't realize you were here.

179
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,000
Thank you for realizing now.

180
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,080
Are you going straight to our lodgings?

181
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,360
Let's go to the souvenir shop together.

182
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,240
Okay. Let's go.

183
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,320
What? What's gotten into you?

184
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,159
You say something when
I refuse and when I agree.

185
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,440
Do you like things like that?

186
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,720
You surprised me.

187
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,960
It doesn't suit you,

188
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,519
but maybe that's why it does.

189
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,279
It's cute.

190
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,600
What are you talking about?

191
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,039
I saved you from getting sold
to Noh Shin-Woo.

192
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,759
Da-On.

193
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,080
The guys over there need your help
starting the fire to grill their meat.

194
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,039
Keep grilling. I'll be right back.

195
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,320
Don't they have hands?

196
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,960
They don't know how to do anything.

197
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,240
You're just like a little sister.
You must really love your older brother.

198
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,720
Can you stop saying that?

199
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,720
I dare you to say that to me
one more time.

200
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,480
I'll make sure you can
never eat meat again.

201
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:12,240
Mr. Seo. Save me.

202
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,200
So-Hee and Si-Un
seem to be really close.

203
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,120
Me and him? No way.

204
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,919
Why? The closer you are,
the more you fight.

205
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,759
Does that mean...

206
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,159
our relationship goes beyond family
and is filled with eternal love?

207
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,039
Can you take off that hat?
It's bothering me.

208
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,120
You don't know anything.
This is my plan.

209
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:39,639
Everyone is bothered by me,

210
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,240
but I'm ignoring it
and focused on eating.

211
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,360
It's a tip to eat a lot of meat.

212
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,840
Take your time.
Nobody is going to take it from you.

213
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,320
By the way,
when did you guys get so close?

214
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,519
What?

215
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,960
It's so nice to see you two being close.

216
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,960
Keep getting along.

217
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,720
Thank you.

218
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,519
Take your time.

219
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,080
I told you to take your time.

220
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,720
Should I leave?

221
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,119
Isn't that something
you should just do...

222
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,039
without asking about it first?

223
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,559
Tell me if you need anything else.

224
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,079
I'll get some medicine from Mr. Seo.

225
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,119
- You're nice.
- What are you talking about?

226
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,240
When Da-On said you were nice,
I said that there was no way.

227
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,559
But now I know.

228
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,440
Noh Shin-Woo is nice.

229
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,960
I'm not nice.

230
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,650
I'm just...

231
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,920
nice to people I like.

232
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,799
You're nice to me.

233
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,599
Then does that mean you like me?

234
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,650
No.

235
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,119
So what I mean is...

236
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:08,599
When I said I like you,
I don't mean that I like you like that.

237
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,680
There are various meanings behind
the word "like".

238
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,839
It's just...

239
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,839
I want to be nice to you.

240
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,170
I really don't like you.

241
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,319
I had a feeling.

242
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,359
What?

243
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,599
But...

244
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
I don't know why.

245
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,359
Why don't you like me?

246
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,650
You annoy me.

247
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:32,799
I know everything there is to know
about Sin Da-On.

248
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,519
But after he started hanging out with
you, there are things I don't know.

249
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,440
I don't like that.

250
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,119
Da-On isn't an object
that belongs to you.

251
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,359
So what?

252
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,200
Are you saying you're going to have him?

253
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,920
I'm just saying that
I want to help him...

254
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,359
and be nice to him.

255
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,410
Just like he does for me.

256
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,319
Sin Da-On is nice to everyone.

257
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,960
He lends his umbrella to people
when it rains,

258
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,759
and he teaches people things
they don't know.

259
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,650
He even shares food with people.

260
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,039
He does all of that
while smiling sweetly.

261
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,079
But that's not because
you're special to him.

262
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,890
He's just being nice.

263
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,440
It doesn't have a meaning.

264
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,119
"It doesn't have a meaning"?

265
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,440
Don't think that you're special to him.

266
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,480
The only person
that's special to Sin Da-On is me.

267
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,559
That hurts.

268
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,039
Nothing is working out for me.

269
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Hey, Oh Tae-Gyeong.

270
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,519
Are you okay?

271
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,319
You're bleeding.

272
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,079
Hey, are you okay?

273
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,440
What happened?

274
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,799
He's bleeding.

275
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,599
How did that happen?

276
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,119
- Goodness.
- Did someone hit him?

277
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,440
I'm fine.

278
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,960
How did you get hurt?

279
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,400
Did you fall?

280
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:57,359
I'm really okay, Noh Shin-Woo.

281
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,440
I just bumped my head a bit.

282
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:11,839
Let me see.

283
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,400
We should disinfect it first.

284
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,160
I'll do it.

285
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,759
I said I'll do it.

286
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,079
(Light on Me)

287
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:57,920
(Who am I to Sin Da-On?)

288
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,319
Isn't it hard to
suffer in silence alone?

289
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:03,759
(You're terrible at lying.
It's so obvious.)

290
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,400
You said that nothing belonged to you.

291
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,640
Can I belong to you?

292
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,720
(Light on Me)
