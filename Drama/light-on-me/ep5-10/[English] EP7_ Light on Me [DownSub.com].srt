1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,240
(- So...)
- Look at Tae-Gyeong's face.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,480
(- what's...)
- Are you okay?

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,919
(- going on here is...)
- This is too much.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,279
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:19,449
Gosh, you surprised me.

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,519
Woo Tae-Gyeong.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,839
I have something serious to ask you.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,760
What is it?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,359
You have to answer honestly.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,920
Okay. What is it?

11
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,079
So...

12
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,079
what...

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,479
do you want to eat today?

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,799
Why are you asking me
that all of a sudden?

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,840
Gosh. Don't ask me that.

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,560
Do you want pizza?

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Or... There's pizza,

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,840
and there's pizza.

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,159
Then pizza.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,079
Okay. Pizza.

21
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,840
What? Potato pizza? My favorite?

22
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,689
Okay.

23
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,879
What is this?

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
Da-On.

25
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,560
Tae-Gyeong. I have something to ask you.

26
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,760
What is it?

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,280
What...

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,840
is your favorite cake?

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,879
What?

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,959
A place with great cakes
just opened up in front of my house,

31
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,200
so I was going to get you
and the others some.

32
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,239
What's your favorite?

33
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,240
I like cake with whipped cream.

34
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,039
Is that so? Okay. I'll see you later.

35
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,159
What's going on?

36
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,240
No way.

37
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,090
What is it?

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,370
What?

39
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,240
Oh, right.
Aren't you going to ask me something?

40
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,520
Da-On and Namgung keep asking me
strange questions.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,039
Right. So...

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,599
Is there a color...

43
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,919
that you don't like for a party hat?

44
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,039
- What?
- You don't, right?

45
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,560
Come to the student council room
at 6pm tonight.

46
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,879
If they make it so obvious,

47
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,199
how am I supposed to react?

48
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,280
6pm.

49
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,919
Even if it's lame,
I have to act surprised.

50
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,680
What? What's going on?

51
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,879
Is there nobody in here?

52
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,610
Woo Tae-Gyeong, congratulations...

53
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,439
On becoming the newest member
of the student council!

54
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,050
(Congratulations on joining
the student council!)

55
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,839
(Tae-Gyeong joined the student council!)

56
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,759
Surprise! Were you surprised?

57
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,920
I was very surprised.

58
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,610
Da-On, our surprise was a success.

59
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,170
Here you go.

60
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,079
Be honest. It was obvious, right?

61
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,170
We tried to do it secretly,
but none of us have done this before.

62
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,079
To be honest, I figured it out,

63
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,170
but I didn't think you'd prepare it
like this.

64
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,519
Thank you, guys.

65
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,199
There's no need.

66
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,120
After you joined, the atmosphere
of the student council got a lot better.

67
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,170
Of course. We have to have
Tae-Gyeong in the student council now.

68
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,079
Don't you agree?

69
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,199
You can't leave even if you want to now.

70
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,639
Saying that there's too much work
or it's exhausting won't work.

71
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,040
I know that. It was hard for me to join.

72
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,439
I'm never leaving.

73
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,879
Then shall we cut the cake?

74
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,240
We can't let his face be clean
on a day like this.

75
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,959
Hurry up.

76
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,800
Hey. Just stay quiet.

77
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,040
It's the unspoken rule to smash cake
onto the newest member's face.

78
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,800
Woo Tae-Gyeong will like it too.

79
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,319
You didn't do that to me
during my welcoming party.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,319
I couldn't even sleep that night.
I was very upset.

81
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,680
Is that so? Then just a little.

82
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

83
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,079
Gosh, Shin-Woo. You're so hilarious.

84
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,439
Tae-Gyeong, are you okay?

85
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,439
Yes.

86
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,680
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

88
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:54,399
(Congratulations on joining
the student council!)

89
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,120
It's not over yet, is it?

90
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,519
Welcome, So-Hee.

91
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,120
Lee So-Hee? What are you doing here?

92
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,199
Right. She wanted to congratulate
Tae-Gyeong, so I told her to come.

93
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,240
Congratulations, Tae-Gyeong.

94
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,720
Thank you, So-Hee.

95
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,160
We'll see each other more often now.

96
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,240
Right. I guess so.

97
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,480
Okay.
It's time for Namgung's second surprise.

98
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,600
I will present him with a gift.

99
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,360
Give me a round of applause!

100
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,240
Ta-da.

101
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,680
What is it?

102
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,439
Gosh, you shouldn't ask that.

103
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,519
Unwrap it.

104
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,120
(Saebit Boys High School
Student Council's Ultimate Cutie)

105
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,120
Wow.

106
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,600
Designed by Namgung. What do you think?
Do you like it?

107
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,800
Right. Of course you like it.

108
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,360
There's only one in the entire world.
It's a custom design.

109
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,680
I did everything by hand...

110
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,879
That's enough already.
Stop bragging about it.

111
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,120
- Namgung. Thank you.
- Yes?

112
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,159
The more I look at it,
the better it looks.

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,559
Let's take a photograph.
We have to leave a record.

114
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,360
Okay. The photo zone...

115
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,960
will be right here.
Gather around, everyone.

116
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,039
Hey. Smile.

117
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,090
(Gyeong)

118
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,399
I said, smile.

119
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:01,960
(Gyeong)

120
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:10,159
(Gyeong)

121
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:23,279
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

122
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,639
Da-On. Nice.

123
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,480
(Gyeong)

124
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,120
There you go.

125
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,919
There we go. Let's take a photo now.

126
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:45,559
Da-On. Just be good at one thing.

127
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,120
Why are you so perfect? Right?

128
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,559
I agree.

129
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,960
Da-On, you're very cool.

130
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,039
Goodness.

131
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,600
What a nice image.

132
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,639
You must feel jealous.

133
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,679
- Aren't you going to take a photo?
- Right. We need to take a photo.

134
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,639
Okay. Gather around everyone.

135
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,960
How should we pose?

136
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,840
Should we make hearts?

137
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,240
Hearts? I think it's a great idea.

138
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,480
Like this?

139
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,960
Like this. A heart.

140
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,330
Okay. I'll take the photo now.

141
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,480
1, 2, 3.

142
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,799
Oh, my. I was just kidding.

143
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,039
Hold on. What should we do?

144
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,279
Smile. Hey, can you smile?

145
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,720
I'm going to take the photo again.

146
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,120
1, 2, 3.

147
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,399
Gosh. Look at this.

148
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,679
Look.

149
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,720
You came out nice in that.

150
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,279
Gosh.

151
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,720
The photo doesn't do me justice.

152
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,960
I agree. The camera doesn't
fully capture your handsomeness.

153
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,960
Are we out of drinks? I'll get some more
at the vending machine.

154
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,600
Let's go together...

155
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,919
Da-On. Let's go together.
I want something to drink too.

156
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,679
Tae-Gyeong, stay here.
I'll go with So-Hee.

157
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,679
It's already been a month since
Tae-Gyeong joined the student council.

158
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,360
Time flies.

159
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,879
- But Tae-Gyeong...
- Sin Da-On.

160
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,720
Do you...

161
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,559
like Woo Tae-Gyeong?

162
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,519
What?

163
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,759
No, I mean, you're always together,

164
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,440
and the way you look at each other
is no joke.

165
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,799
People would think you're dating.

166
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,279
We're just good friends.

167
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,919
People don't see it like that.

168
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,720
They'd all think it's strange.

169
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,720
To be honest, I was a bit surprised too.

170
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,600
Is that really it?

171
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,759
Yes. That's it.

172
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,120
Don't lie to me no matter what.

173
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,919
Okay?

174
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,960
Okay. I won't lie.

175
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,279
But then again, it doesn't make sense
for Sin Da-On would like Woo Tae-Gyeong.

176
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,480
Let's go.
The guys are probably waiting for us.

177
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,720
Okay.

178
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,399
Woo Tae-Gyeong.

179
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,039
What are you doing?

180
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,879
Well...

181
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,360
Your shoelaces were untied.

182
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,879
You're clumsy, so you trip often.

183
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,960
People like you must tie them well.

184
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,159
Thank you.

185
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,200
But why is Noh Shin-Woo
being so nice to me?

186
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,919
How strange.

187
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,000
What?

188
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,679
Noh Shin-Woo.

189
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,639
Do you...

190
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,279
feel bad for smashing cake in my face?

191
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,879
Yes. You hit the nail on the head.

192
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,200
Noh Shin-Woo is nice to me
when he feels bad.

193
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,679
Okay.

194
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,200
I get it.

195
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,519
What do you get?

196
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:42,240
(Saebit Boys High School
Student Council's Ultimate Cutie)

197
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Here. Try some of this.
It's really good.

198
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,720
Hey. What are you doing?
We're all family here.

199
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,240
How are we family?

200
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,840
What do you mean?
Da-On's the firstborn, I'm second,

201
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:04,919
you're the troublemaking younger sister.

202
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,120
Don't you agree, Da-On?

203
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,320
Da-On. Am I really
the troublemaking younger sister?

204
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,360
No. So-Hee's the cute younger sister.

205
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,159
I need to answer this call.

206
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,080
Eat this and cheer up,

207
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,799
our cute younger sister.

208
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,320
- Get that out of my face.
- Okay. That works for me.

209
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:46,159
Do you want to go to karaoke after?

210
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,559
Does anyone object?

211
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,600
Nobody? Then let's all together.

212
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,559
What is this?

213
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,159
- What is it?
- Didn't you get a message?

214
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,240
Oh, right. Your phone.

215
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,559
Something came up,
so Da-On's going home first.

216
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,480
- What happened?
- I don't know.

217
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,480
Isn't that Da-On's bag?

218
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,159
- I'll bring it to him.
- No.

219
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,840
I'll bring it to him.

220
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,480
His place is on my way home,

221
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,639
and I wanted to go home early...

222
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,639
because I'm tired.

223
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Hey.

224
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,000
I said I'll bring it to him.

225
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,840
Woo Tae-Gyeong can bring it to him.

226
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:44,279
It's late, so it's dangerous too.

227
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,519
More than that,
you have to go to karaoke with me.

228
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,879
Why would I go to karaoke with you?

229
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,080
You can't even sing.

230
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,279
I can't sing?

231
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,399
Hey. I'm better than you are.

232
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,879
My gosh.

233
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,759
I'll get going first.

234
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,650
Thank you guys for today.

235
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,559
Have fun, and I'll see you on Monday.

236
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,359
Don't go.

237
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,890
Let's go...

238
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,000
to karaoke together.

239
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,359
I'm really sorry.

240
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,559
Next time.

241
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,720
Gosh, I should've gotten it fixed.

242
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,559
Da-On!

243
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,319
Tae-Gyeong. What are you doing here?

244
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,200
Thank you.

245
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,119
I was in such a hurry that I forgot
I left my bag.

246
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,240
Why did you leave in such a hurry?

247
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,680
Well... It might sound strange to you,

248
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,079
but it's been a while
since my mother called me,

249
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,650
so I was excited. I thought
she wanted to have dinner together.

250
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,759
I guess that wasn't the case.

251
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,240
Right.

252
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,079
As usual, she just asked me for a favor
and hung up.

253
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,319
She has a lot of things...

254
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,279
that are more important than me.

255
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,119
I thought I was used to
her indifference towards me,

256
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,799
but I guess I'm not.

257
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,920
Nothing...

258
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,680
belongs to me at home.

259
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,759
Then why do you work so hard?

260
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:47,079
I don't want to disappoint my parents.

261
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,559
Plus, I hate disappointing people.

262
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,890
I feel a lot better after I told you.

263
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,799
For some strange reason,
I can tell you these things easily.

264
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,920
It's my first time talking about this.

265
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,960
You can be honest with me.

266
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,440
You're...

267
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,720
allowed to.

268
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,559
(Do you...)

269
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,920
(like Woo Tae-Gyeong?)

270
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:37,039
(Light on Me)

271
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,200
(Good morning, guys.)

272
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,119
(What is it? Did you do something
wrong?)

273
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,480
(- Can I sit here?
- Of course.)

274
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:46,000
When did you guys get so close?

275
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,119
Da-On isn't an object
that belongs to you.

276
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,079
(Don't think that
you're special to him.)

277
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,170
(The only person that's special
to Sin Da-On...)

278
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,000
is me.

279
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:11,119
(Light on Me)
