1
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,800
I'm pretty sure he saw me.

2
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,960
This is driving me crazy.

3
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,160
Noh Shin-Woo.

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,850
Why are you avoiding me?
You even ignored me.

5
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,759
When did I do that?

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,850
I didn't see you.

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,280
Was I mistaken?

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,679
I thought you were avoiding me.

9
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,280
Why didn't you come to
the student council room today?

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,799
I didn't see you all day.

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,399
I was just busy.

12
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,759
Okay. If you're busy, you should go.

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,719
Okay.

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,680
Did I do something wrong?

15
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:30,760
No. I didn't do anything.

16
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,159
Then why does it seem like
he's avoiding me?

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,560
I knew you'd be in here.

18
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,000
I can do this alone.

19
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,879
If we do it together,
you can finish sooner.

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,000
Plus, didn't I tell you to call me
when you do this?

21
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay. Thank you.

22
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,439
Oh, right. How are things with Shin-Woo?

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,810
It seems like you've gotten closer.

24
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,400
I thought we got closer,

25
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,919
but Shin-Woo
is suddenly avoiding me again.

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,919
Shin-Woo is?

27
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,639
Yes. It's very difficult.

28
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,370
I didn't do anything.

29
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,810
Maybe he's just a bit shy.

30
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,560
Shin-Woo is?

31
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,879
Shin-Woo gets shy really easily.

32
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,560
His ears are always red.

33
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,319
Then should I avoid him...

34
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,240
until he isn't shy anymore?

35
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,439
Better yet,

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,319
why don't you approach him
more aggressively?

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,639
"Let's hang out."
"Let's grab some food."

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,919
Like this.

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay. I'll try that.

40
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,439
I knew it.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,759
Whenever you say, "I'll try that",

42
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,360
I feel refreshed.

43
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,360
I like that.

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,120
Oh, right.

45
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:28,199
Did you show your parents your grades?

46
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,080
Weren't they really happy?

47
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,240
No. They didn't have much of a reaction.

48
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,919
They didn't have much of a reaction?

49
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,120
They're not the type of people
to express themselves.

50
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm used to that too.

51
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,080
To be honest,

52
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,400
I've never been complimented.

53
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,759
I had no idea.

54
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,039
Of course you didn't know.

55
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,839
It won't leave a scar.

56
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,240
(Administration)

57
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,800
Am I the only who sees
that Shin-Woo isn't here?

58
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,959
He'd always hide out here
because his classmates are noisy.

59
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,879
Did he make a new friend?

60
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,920
He must be busy these days.
The vice president has a lot to do.

61
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,730
Oh, right.

62
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,839
You still haven't gotten that fixed?

63
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,050
Can you even see what's on the screen?

64
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:08,240
I don't really look at my phone.

65
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,839
Plus, I can focus on my studies more,
so it's nice.

66
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,050
Imagine if my mom heard that.

67
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,079
I know. It's admirable.

68
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,959
What's wrong?

69
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,720
It's the first time...

70
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,160
someone touched my cheek
since I was a kid.

71
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,000
Gosh. You have really nice skin.

72
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,920
Of course, it's not as nice as mine.

73
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,839
- Wow.
- Stop looking at me.

74
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:02,839
Why? You didn't say anything
when Da-On touched you,

75
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,560
so why are you only saying
something to me?

76
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,920
Gosh. Namgung, are you jealous?

77
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,600
Hey. We were just talking about you.

78
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,959
From now on, if I want to see you,
I should talk about you.

79
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,040
You're here.

80
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,519
Yes.

81
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,639
Noh Shin-Woo. Good morning.

82
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,240
Oh, it's not good morning.

83
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,839
It's good afternoon.

84
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,120
Although it's not lunchtime yet.

85
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,439
The weather is quite nice.

86
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,759
There's no fine dust,
and there's a light breeze.

87
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,959
It's...

88
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,439
the perfect spring day.

89
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,120
Yes. You're right.

90
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,399
I'm sorry, but I'm going to study.

91
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,800
Yes. Tae-Gyeong's right.

92
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,480
Gosh, the weather is really nice today.

93
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,519
Do you guys want to go on a walk
after lunch?

94
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,720
- What do you think, Namgung?
- What?

95
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,519
Okay.

96
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,759
It's a bit tiresome,
but I feel like I should agree.

97
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,720
Okay. Let's go on a walk later.

98
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,279
A walk.

99
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,279
Okay. Let's go after lunch.

100
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,879
Sounds good.

101
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
Gosh.

102
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,680
Is something wrong?

103
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,240
I keep getting the wrong answer.

104
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,519
Let me see.

105
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,560
You can't put this equation in the back.

106
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,600
Bring it to the front
and transpose it with x.

107
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,039
Oh, is this how it's done?

108
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,450
Yes. This is a bit hard.

109
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
That's why there's a formula
to solve this.

110
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,679
Can I write on here?

111
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,639
Yes.

112
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,279
I'm just teaching this to you.

113
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,399
This isn't a cafe.

114
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,120
Aren't you being too noisy
in a space we all share?

115
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,840
What?

116
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,480
Shin-Woo. I was a bit loud, right?

117
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,360
I just need to teach him this.

118
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,679
I'll be done soon. Will that be okay?

119
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,919
Why are you starting a fight?

120
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,399
Since when the student council room
become a studying room?

121
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,919
The sounds from my game are louder.

122
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,519
No.

123
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,759
I was being loud. I'm sorry, Shin-Woo.

124
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,330
Yes, sir.

125
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,279
No. Do you need me to do something?

126
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,879
Yes. The library got new books,

127
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,799
and they asked for some help
organizing them.

128
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,879
They need two people.

129
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:41,210
Then I'll some people who are free
to the library.

130
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,120
Yes, sir. Okay.

131
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,450
Tae-Gyeong and Shin-Woo.

132
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,879
Can you guys help?

133
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,960
So what did you do wrong?

134
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,960
I didn't do anything wrong.

135
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:20,000
Wait. That's my favorite bread.

136
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,919
I knew it. Da-On got it for me...

137
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,159
Things were hectic that day,
so I forgot that I agreed to meet you.

138
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,450
The battery in my cell phone died,
so I couldn't call.

139
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,519
Gosh, is that what happened?

140
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,759
You're such a bad guy.

141
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,039
So-Hee. Don't forgive him.

142
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,210
Should I throw all of this out?
I'll go throw it out.

143
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,039
Be quiet.

144
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,159
Da-On.

145
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,039
I'm sorry, So-Hee. Don't be mad.

146
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,679
Don't do that again.

147
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,679
Okay. I won't.

148
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,480
Did you wait long that day?

149
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,720
No. I didn't wait.

150
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,039
I couldn't get in contact with you,
so I met up with my friends.

151
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,279
What? I saw you waiting for Da-On...

152
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,200
in the student council room...

153
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,279
Oh, yes. Nice.

154
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,600
This is my favorite.

155
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,960
This is a wise saying from
Mr. Namgung Si-Un.

156
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,480
"Knowledge is power."

157
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,799
Don't bring him with you next time.

158
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,360
Tae-Gyeong and Shin-Woo
are in the library to clean up.

159
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,519
He said he was bored,
so he came with me.

160
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,600
What kind of kid is Woo Tae-Gyeong?

161
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,559
He seems like he's close
with the guys...

162
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,919
and you.

163
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,080
He's really cute.

164
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,559
He has a unique charm.

165
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,399
Why would a guy say that another guy
is charming?

166
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,080
Why not?

167
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,039
You saw him that day.
He's really honest.

168
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,919
He has a refreshing charm.

169
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,919
I've never seen you say
that someone is charming.

170
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,320
Is that so?

171
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,519
So-Hee, if you want to get close with
Tae-Gyeong too, I'll help.

172
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,080
Okay. I got it.

173
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,279
Okay.

174
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,080
Right. I have to help out
with serving lunch, so I should go.

175
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,720
Are you serving lunch today?

176
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,039
Can you give me a lot later?

177
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,360
Okay. I'll see you later, So-Hee.

178
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,759
Okay. Message me.

179
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,440
Are you curious about Woo Tae-Gyeong?

180
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,960
What are you talking about? I'm not.

181
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,519
I think you are.

182
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,279
I told you I wasn't.
What's wrong with you?

183
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,639
You can eat all of this.

184
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,960
Hey, Lee So-Hee.
I'm sure you're aware of this too,

185
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,360
but Da-On takes good care of people.

186
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,039
I don't think Tae-Gyeong has ever met
anyone like him before.

187
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,600
That's why he listens
to what Da-On says.

188
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,519
Da-On also thinks he's cute.

189
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,000
That's as far as I know.

190
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,879
Why are you telling me this?

191
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,559
I need to repay you for the snacks.

192
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,039
I like that.

193
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,559
"I like that"?

194
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,480
I'm at a loss for words.

195
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,879
Did something happen today?

196
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,519
Did something upset you?

197
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,360
No.

198
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,120
Then did I do something wrong?

199
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,879
No, you didn't.

200
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,360
Then why are you acting like this?

201
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,960
What do you mean?

202
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,159
It's like we're back at square one.

203
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,639
Didn't we become a bit closer?

204
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,320
Am I the only one who thought that?

205
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,080
Lunchtime is almost over.

206
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,639
What?

207
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:06,279
Let's back at to work. We need to eat.

208
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,120
Okay.

209
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,240
Woo Tae-Gyeong.

210
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,320
There's nothing that you don't do.

211
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,399
Of course.
The school can't run without me.

212
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,080
Did you organize the library well?

213
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,720
Yes. Sure.

214
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,559
Did you make up with Shin-Woo?

215
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,519
No.

216
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,320
It's okay.

217
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,879
Here. Eat up and cheer up.

218
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,080
You want me to eat all of this?

219
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,440
Yes. Make sure to finish it.

220
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,679
Eat up, Tae-Gyeong.

221
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,399
Shin-Woo, you get this much too.

222
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,080
Do things in moderation.

223
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,799
What if there's nothing left?
You have to eat too.

224
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,399
Gosh. Okay. You nag so much, Shin-Woo.

225
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,000
You could be nicer.

226
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,480
You're always complaining.

227
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,360
What?

228
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,159
Guys! Over here.

229
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,519
So tell me.
Did you organize the library well?

230
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,440
Tae-Gyeong?

231
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,240
- No.
- No?

232
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,799
Let's say that you did.

233
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,200
Okay. What's your review
of today's lunch, Shin-Woo?

234
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,599
It's not that good.

235
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,559
Okay. Let's say that it's not that good.

236
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,079
You guys are going
to go on a walk later, right?

237
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,960
Do you want to get ice cream
before we go?

238
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,170
- No.
- No.

239
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,440
I'm sorry,

240
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,839
but what's wrong with you guys?

241
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,039
You guys were okay up until
a few days ago.

242
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,559
It's confusing because
you keep going back and forth.

243
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,559
What are you talking?
You're not done yet, right?

244
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,279
Gosh. I almost got indigestion.
You're just in time.

245
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:43,559
I'm so glad to see you today.

246
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,920
This looks good. Thank you for the food.

247
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,920
Right. Enjoy your meal.

248
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,799
Enjoy your meal.

249
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,799
You too, Shin-Woo.

250
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,519
Hey, Tae-Gyeong. Give me your hand.

251
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,650
My hand?

252
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,279
Open up your hand.

253
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,559
What? Hold on.

254
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,890
What is this?

255
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,960
Are you giving Woo Tae-Gyeong
your yogurt?

256
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,920
You always gave me your yogurt,

257
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,410
a benefit of serving lunch,
but you gave it to Tae-Gyeong today?

258
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,200
I always gave it to you in the past.

259
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,359
Let's let Tae-Gyeong have it today.

260
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,960
Our kind Namgung should share.

261
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,079
I'm sharing just this once.
But keep in mind...

262
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,039
that I'm really hurt.

263
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:51,920
Okay. I get it. I'll be sure
to give it to you next time.

264
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,890
Right. Tae-Gyeong.
Do you want to get tutored in math?

265
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,890
Do you know someone?

266
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,650
I do. He's the first in the school.
His name is Shin Da-On.

267
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,890
What?

268
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,319
I'll tutor you.

269
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,799
You will?

270
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,480
Yes. It was fun when I was helping you.

271
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,720
I get to review it too.

272
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,799
I would love that, but you're busy.

273
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,720
Gosh, it's fine.

274
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,920
Do you have time today? Do you want
to have a trial lesson after school?

275
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
Okay.

276
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,799
Are you done already?

277
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,119
Yes. I'll get going first.

278
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,240
Hey. Wait for us.

279
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,359
Aren't you going to
the student council room?

280
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,960
We agreed to go on a walk after lunch.

281
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,200
Right. We need to have ice cream too.

282
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,599
Forget it. Leave me out.

283
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,079
Shin-Woo. Hold on.

284
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:11,170
- Did he really hit him?
- What happened?

285
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,720
- That was harsh.
- What's going on?

286
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,279
I'm sorry.
I must've pulled on your arm too hard.

287
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,720
Are you okay? Did you get burnt?

288
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,039
Da-On. That's not the problem right now.

289
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,839
Are you okay? Isn't it hot?

290
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,119
I'm fine.

291
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,079
Did you have to push him away like that?

292
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,000
He could've gotten seriously hurt.

293
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,480
Also,

294
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,799
aren't you going to apologize?

295
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,279
You idiot.

296
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,519
Noh Shin-Woo.

297
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,240
If you have a problem with me,
say it to my face.

298
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,759
Don't let it out on the wrong person.

299
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,119
Let go.

300
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,119
What are you doing right now?

301
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,920
I tried to understand you until now.

302
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,759
But I can't hold back anymore.

303
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,880
I get that you hate me.

304
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,720
If you hate me, try to like me.

305
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,400
I'll do the same with you.

306
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,839
(Light on Me)

307
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,960
I have to deal with something
that's harder than math.

308
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,039
Over there. Isn't that Da-On?

309
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,200
Why are you so nice to him?

310
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,960
He's not really in the student council.

311
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,920
I can carry them too.

312
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,640
You're so greedy
when you can't even do it right.

313
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,440
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

314
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,519
I think that's only right.

315
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:54,200
(Light on Me)
