1
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,480
Why? Are you having trouble?

2
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:12,080
No.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,199
I have to deal with something
that's harder than math.

4
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,719
What?

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,359
Noh Shin-Woo is acting strange.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,079
What is this?

7
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:41,479
Are you cleaning?

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,079
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,759
It's not like that.

10
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,880
What is this?

11
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,920
It's super clean.

12
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,599
You surprised me.

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,159
Drink this.

14
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,640
What is this, Shin-Woo?

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,480
Why are you giving this to me?

16
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,120
You told me to try.

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,359
What did you say?

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,000
If you didn't hear it, forget it.

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,920
What's wrong with him?

20
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,719
Do you have something to say to me?

21
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,199
Well...

22
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,639
I've been wanting to tell you this.

23
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,479
Your...

24
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,530
fly is open.

25
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,479
What's wrong with him? Seriously.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,159
Shin-Woo has
a hard time expressing himself.

27
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,879
I bet he's thinking about
how he can apologize to you.

28
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:47,800
They say when a person changes suddenly,
it's time for them to die.

29
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,439
You don't think something will happen,
do you?

30
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,759
Goodness. Don't worry.

31
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,159
Do you like cake, Tae-Gyeong?

32
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,000
You should try it. It's really good.

33
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,120
Okay.

34
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,199
- It's good.
- Is it?

35
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,199
You've got some on your face.

36
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,520
Having something sweet is waking me up.

37
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,919
You have some on your face too.

38
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,280
What?

39
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,439
Over here.

40
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,319
Tae-Gyeong. I'm sorry.
Let me check my phone for a second.

41
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,399
It's been a while since I was someplace
other than home on the weekend.

42
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,279
Me too.
I usually stay home on the weekends,

43
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,319
so it's nice to come out like this.

44
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,360
Oh, right. Do you have any hobbies?

45
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,639
Hobbies?

46
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,399
Listening to music.

47
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,000
What about you?

48
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,959
I like to draw.

49
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,759
Gosh. Are you good at drawing?

50
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,120
I'm as good as others.
I'm not that great.

51
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,610
People who say that
are all really good at drawing.

52
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,279
Can you draw a picture of me next time?

53
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,120
Okay. I will.

54
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,839
Yes!

55
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,199
What about you?
What kind of music do you like?

56
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,839
I like indie bands.

57
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:24,170
I like indie bands too.

58
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,680
Let's exchange a list next time.

59
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,959
I know some really great unknown songs.

60
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,439
That sounds good.

61
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,959
I really like looking for indie music
that people haven't heard before.

62
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,439
So this is what having a friend is like.

63
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,959
You look for similar interests.

64
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,199
You want to know them better,
and that's fun.

65
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,839
Is this what a friend is?

66
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,759
Yes, that's right. That's what a friend.

67
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,959
I really like having friends.

68
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,959
Let's go. Let's have dinner as friends.

69
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,040
Do you like malatang?

70
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,399
I've never had it before.

71
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,240
Tae-Gyeong.

72
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,199
Just trust and follow me.

73
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,079
Let's go.

74
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,800
Let's go.

75
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,800
Why isn't he picking up?

76
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,879
Wait. Over there. Isn't that Sin Da-On?

77
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,079
Who is he with?

78
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,120
It's a guy.

79
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,040
What are two guys doing meeting up
on a weekend?

80
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,480
What would they do?

81
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,360
I guess they had something
to take care of.

82
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,279
- Let's go.
- Okay.

83
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,800
Hey.

84
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,079
You want us to clean all of this?

85
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,160
Please do this for me.

86
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,160
This room is changing into
the music room,

87
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,800
but I just found it they're starting
construction tomorrow.

88
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,920
Mr. Seo.
I think I'm coming down with a headache.

89
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,399
I'm sorry. In return,
I'll treat you to something delicious.

90
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,040
How about some meat?

91
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,800
You should've said that first.

92
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,759
Don't worry, Mr. Seo.
We'll make look as good as new.

93
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,480
Thank you, guys.

94
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,639
Don't get hurt and be careful.

95
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,319
What are you doing?

96
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,959
What do you think?
There was a lot of dust.

97
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,360
Is he starting with me again?

98
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,090
Move.

99
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,210
Hey.

100
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,399
I can carry them too.

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,879
Then stop bumbling about.

102
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,120
I get it. I'll carry them.

103
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,120
Just leave it up to me.

104
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,840
Gosh, just move over.
I won't let you take it from me again.

105
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,450
Forget it then.

106
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,210
My gosh.

107
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,399
You're so greedy
when you can't even do it right.

108
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,919
Go do something else.

109
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,720
- Give it to me.
- I don't want to.

110
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,759
Just carry the light box.

111
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,210
You can carry that.
I'm going to carry this.

112
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,120
- Give it to me.
- I'm going to carry this.

113
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,720
You can clean the garbage and follow me.

114
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:02,480
- They got close again?
- Give it to me. Carry the light one.

115
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,759
Da-On. They're leaving me out.

116
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:08,519
Gosh.
It's a good thing they're getting along.

117
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:11,210
- Clean the garbage and follow me.
- You're right.

118
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,559
- I can eat in peace later.
- Just carry something light.

119
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,639
I don't want to.

120
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,840
(Sin Da-On, "Family Portrait")

121
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:35,399
Wait. That's the drawing that Da-On
got an award for.

122
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,679
You got an award too?

123
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,480
He's no joke. It got the grand award
during the arts festival.

124
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,039
"Family Portrait".

125
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,480
It's been a while since I saw it.
I didn't know it was here.

126
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,480
"Family Portrait"?

127
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,840
What does it mean?

128
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,039
It doesn't have a meaning.
I didn't put much thought into it.

129
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,600
Da-On. Someone is looking for you.

130
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,159
Okay. I'll be right out. Hold on.

131
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,960
(Woo Tae-Gyeong)

132
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,000
(Woo Tae-Gyeong, Noh Shin-Woo)

133
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,360
Thank you.

134
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,320
Are you okay?

135
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,399
Give me your hand.

136
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,200
Excuse me, guys.

137
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,919
Can you go throw that out together?

138
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,320
Is it because of what I said last time?

139
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,039
To try to like me even if you hate me?

140
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,240
I never hated you.

141
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,679
I don't hate you.

142
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,960
I'm sorry I kept avoiding you.

143
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,720
So Woo Tae-Gyeong...

144
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,440
What?

145
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,960
- You can hit me until you're not mad.
- Okay. Close your eyes.

146
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,320
Close them tightly.

147
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,840
What are you doing?

148
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,519
Regardless of the reason,
this means you don't hate me.

149
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,159
That's fine then.

150
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,080
We're even for when I grabbed you
by the collar.

151
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,200
I'm going in first.

152
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,879
Why is this happening again?

153
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,879
Gosh. It's so noisy.

154
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,519
Is that Da-On's phone?

155
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,919
Yes. It's been ringing since earlier.

156
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,320
Some tenacious person keeps calling him.

157
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,759
I'll go give it to him.

158
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,960
I'm sorry.

159
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,159
Don't resent me too much.
It was too noisy.

160
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,799
I didn't say anything.

161
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,559
Where did he go?

162
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:10,039
Da-On.
Are you playing the field with me?

163
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,039
We've been talking
for the past few months,

164
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,879
but we're just good friends?

165
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,679
When you act nice to someone
you don't have feelings for,

166
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,440
it doesn't make that person happy.

167
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,960
Don't be like this from now on
to other people.

168
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,320
Well...

169
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,679
You kept getting phone calls.

170
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,559
Right.

171
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,440
Thanks.

172
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,519
Can't you just be good to the person
you like?

173
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,200
Then this won't happen again.

174
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,399
I'm sorry, Tae-Gyeong.

175
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,320
I'm a bit distracted right now,
so let's talk later.

176
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:24,399
Pretend you didn't just see that.

177
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,360
Hey. You're here.

178
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,759
- What about Sin Da-On?
- Someone came to see him, so he left.

179
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,720
Where's that other kid?
The temporary member.

180
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,240
Woo Tae-Gyeong?

181
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,720
He went to look for Da-On.

182
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,519
Namgung.

183
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,410
Is Da-On still nice to Tae-Gyeong
these days?

184
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,799
Yes. He even tutors him.

185
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,079
He tutors him?

186
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,119
Yes. He tutors him in math.

187
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,519
I bet they eat a lot of good food.

188
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,480
Gosh, I'm hungry.

189
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,720
What is that? Why is he so nice to him?

190
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,839
He's not really in the student council.

191
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,279
He's so annoying.

192
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:30,410
- What?
- Why do you always come here?

193
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,519
You're not
in the student council either.

194
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,240
See? It's upsetting to hear that, right?

195
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:43,119
Fine. I'll be nice to him.

196
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,890
How nice of you.

197
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,039
Noh Shin-Woo is always like this,
so whatever.

198
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,890
But Namgung.

199
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,000
Aren't you on my side?

200
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,599
I'm not on anyone's side.

201
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,960
Forget it.
You're totally on Woo Tae-Gyeong's side.

202
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,960
Da-On.

203
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,359
What's wrong with your face?
Did something happen?

204
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:14,119
Jung-Woo asked me for some help,
but I forgot because I got distracted.

205
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,799
He lectured me about that.

206
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:16,839
Is that so?

207
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,960
Guys. Eat up.

208
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,359
Shall we make a toast?

209
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,000
Sure. That's a great idea.

210
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,440
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

211
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,440
Okay, then.

212
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:49,799
What if we heat things up with a game
right about now?

213
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,170
Let's put in 1 piece of garlic,
2 pieces, 3, 4, 5 pieces.

214
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,559
And this piece of meat.

215
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,839
Ta-da.

216
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,519
Have you heard of the I Love You Game?

217
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,890
What kind of game is that?

218
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,359
You look at each other in the eyes
and say "I love you".

219
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,200
The first one to laugh loses.

220
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,839
Namgung is really good at it.

221
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,759
How do you play?

222
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:17,079
Gosh.

223
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,240
Learn the I Love You Game as you play.

224
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,200
The person who loses has to eat this.

225
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,119
I'll start.

226
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,519
Mr. Seo. I love you.

227
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,519
Da-On. I love you.

228
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:50,519
I love you, Woo Tae-Gyeong.

229
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,839
I...

230
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,519
I love you.

231
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,650
I love you.

232
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,799
He must be out of his mind.
Noh Shin-Woo said "I love you" to me.

233
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,119
- Isn't this how you play?
- You did a great job.

234
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,559
Si-Un. Open up.

235
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,039
My target was Noh Shin-Woo.

236
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,799
The person who wants to play
always ends up losing.

237
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,559
Here. Eat up.

238
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,759
Gosh, it's so spicy.

239
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,440
Stop... Stop laughing at me.

240
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,240
- Are you laughing too, Mr. Seo?
- Don't laugh.

241
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,079
Don't laugh.

242
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,240
I'm going to have dinner
before I come home.

243
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,440
No. With my friends.

244
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,359
Yes. I'll be home early.

245
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,170
Friends.

246
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,240
Gosh, I'm full.

247
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,519
Did you eat a lot?

248
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,410
Yes.

249
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,119
About what happened at school...

250
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,599
Oh, that?

251
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,200
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

252
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,400
You told me...

253
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,480
that what's good is good.

254
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,519
I think that's right.

255
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,119
Hey.

256
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,440
- You seem more comfortable with me.
- I do?

257
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,440
Yes. It's nice.

258
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,319
You don't have to be
so formal with me anymore.

259
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,200
I'll continue being formal with you
around other people.

260
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,640
It doesn't matter. We're all friends.

261
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,839
You can be comfortable around me.
You're allowed to.

262
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,720
We're friends.

263
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,000
I thought...

264
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,400
that was enough.

265
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,279
Namgung says you should come in.

266
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,240
He says we can't leave
until we finish eating.

267
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:17,799
Gosh. I can't eat anymore. I'm so full.

268
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,839
Gosh. Look at that.
There are so many stars.

269
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,680
Unskilled feelings grow uncontrollably.

270
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:37,960
I can't become friends...

271
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,799
with Sin Da-On.

272
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,519
(Light on Me)

273
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,279
(- Woo Tae-Gyeong.
- What are you doing?)

274
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,480
(Your shoelaces were untied.)

275
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:00,839
People like you must tie them well.

276
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,240
(Do you...)

277
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:05,319
(- Da-On.
- Nothing belongs to me at home.)

278
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,200
Da-On. Do you like Woo Tae-Gyeong?

279
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,240
(Light on Me)
