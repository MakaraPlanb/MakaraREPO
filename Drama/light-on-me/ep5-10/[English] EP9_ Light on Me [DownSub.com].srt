1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,279
Gosh, that stings.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,560
Does it hurt?

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,279
It stings a bit, but it's fine.

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,720
I can bear with it.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,399
Does it hurt a lot?

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,399
Are you done?

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,600
No. Noh Shin-Woo isn't good at anything.

8
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,320
Are you so talented that you
banged your head on a door?

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,039
Let me see.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,679
The scar isn't too deep.

11
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,840
You must've been surprised
because you bled.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,920
You just disinfected, right?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,039
Shin-Woo.

14
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,359
Do you want to finish up, or should I?

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,159
Can you finish up?

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,840
I'm not very good at this.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,519
I'll go check on everyone.

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,359
Okay. Go first. We'll be out soon.

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,959
Okay.

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,200
I'll finish it up quickly.
Just bear with it a little more.

21
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,200
I'm glad you came.

22
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,280
Gosh.
Shin-Woo would've done a good job too.

23
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,760
He did a great job disinfecting it.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,480
You're really nice.

25
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,439
Do you... Do you want to eat this?

26
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,240
I don't want any.

27
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,719
You said you didn't want any.

28
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,479
Don't change your mind later.

29
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,810
Namgung.

30
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,370
What?

31
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,810
Who am I to Sin Da-On?

32
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,599
What?

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,800
Do you think he would've run off...

34
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,400
in such a hurry
if he found out I got hurt?

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,120
He ran off like
he didn't care about anything else.

36
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,319
Hey. Of course.

37
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,360
You know his personality.

38
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,560
He would've run off like that
no matter who got hurt.

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,080
I know.

40
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,199
That's what upsets me.

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,919
It doesn't matter who they are.

42
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,120
He cares for everyone
and treats everyone the same.

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,599
I guess you were right.

44
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,960
Lee So-Hee is just...

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,159
Sin Da-On's younger sister. That's all.

46
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,879
Hey.
I was just kidding when I said that.

47
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,240
Plus, if you say it like that,

48
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,039
I seem like such a bad person.

49
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,599
Are you afraid of becoming a bad person?

50
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,080
Of course, aren't you?

51
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,080
No, I'm not afraid of that.

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,439
I just need to be a good person
to the person I like.

53
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,680
Hey. That hurts. What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

54
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,000
I told you because
I thought you were here to comfort me,

55
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,439
but I shouldn't have bothered.

56
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,280
You weren't helpful at all.

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,439
I'm a fool for expecting otherwise.

58
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,400
No, I was...

59
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,159
- I...
- Give it to me.

60
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,800
What?

61
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,120
What are you saying?
You said you didn't want it.

62
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,839
I want some now.

63
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,560
I don't feel bad about that at all.

64
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,050
I knew this would happen,

65
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,360
so I brought another one.

66
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,610
Why do you look so down?

67
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,439
It's nothing.

68
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,079
Fine.

69
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,120
Isn't it hard to
suffer in silence alone?

70
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,879
If it's hard, take it out.

71
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,680
If you just keep it inside,
you'll never know what you want.

72
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,480
Neither will other people.

73
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,050
Then you will become dull to it,

74
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,120
and eventually...

75
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,000
you'll forget about it too.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,040
Plus,

77
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,759
if you have that look on your face,

78
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:39,240
you make me want to give up
everything I have to help you.

79
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,560
I'm done.

80
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,480
Did it hurt?

81
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,959
It didn't hurt at all.

82
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,399
I think you're talented
at things like this.

83
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,040
Then from now on,

84
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,639
I should carry around a first-aid kit
just for you.

85
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,000
How did you get hurt anyway?

86
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,079
It looked like it hurt a lot.

87
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,519
Well...

88
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,759
I thought of something
I wanted to ask you,

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,439
so I was in a hurry.

90
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,480
What is it?

91
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,839
You're a kind person.

92
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,480
I know that...

93
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,839
you're nice to everyone equally.

94
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,319
But you don't pinch other people
on the cheek...

95
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,040
or...

96
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,360
pat them on the head...

97
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,360
like you did to me just now.

98
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,639
But why do you do that to me?

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,040
Do you do that just because
I'm like a little brother to you?

100
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,160
I want to know how you feel.

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,160
Is it really...

102
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,959
because I'm like
a little brother to you?

103
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,600
You are...

104
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,480
like a little brother.

105
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,680
You're a cute little brother
whom I feel comfortable around.

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,160
And?

107
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,079
Am I...

108
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,399
just a cute little brother
you feel comfortable around?

109
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,759
And...

110
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,959
You're someone I really like.

111
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,639
I see.

112
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,210
You should get some rest.

113
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,679
Da-On.

114
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,480
Can we talk?

115
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,799
Is Tae-Gyeong...

116
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,960
okay?

117
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes. He's fine.

118
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,519
We don't need to take him
to the hospital.

119
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,210
I've never seen you take care
of someone like that.

120
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,240
I guess...

121
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,519
you really like Tae-Gyeong.

122
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,559
I'm glad you guys seem to get along.

123
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,879
Are you really glad?

124
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,120
Of course. Why wouldn't I be?

125
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,480
I don't think you are.

126
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,919
What are you talking about?

127
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,159
Did you know?

128
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,399
You're terrible at lying.

129
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,480
- It's not like--
- It's so obvious.

130
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,799
I've known you for ages.

131
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,399
I tried my best to hide it,

132
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,519
but you're very keen.

133
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,039
To be honest,

134
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,960
I feel uncomfortable around Tae-Gyeong.

135
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,600
Do you feel like that too?

136
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,679
He's too honest.

137
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,759
I don't know how to treat him.

138
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,120
I always act like I'm fine
and nothing bothers me.

139
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,240
That's why I felt uncomfortable.

140
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,960
There's only one way to resolve
your issues with Tae-Gyeong.

141
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,159
Just be honest.

142
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,840
The thing you're
questioning yourself about...

143
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,919
is probably true.

144
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,840
No, it is.

145
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,120
That's how it was with me too.

146
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,480
Shin-Woo.

147
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:21,519
Why are you telling me this...

148
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,799
despite knowing all the answers?

149
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,080
If I don't tell you,

150
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,919
you won't know
for the rest of your life.

151
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,679
You need to know
the answer so that you...

152
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,200
and Woo Tae-Gyeong...

153
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,080
can be happy.

154
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,159
And...

155
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,120
It was frustrating to watch.

156
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,679
That's why I told you.

157
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,639
How long has it been?

158
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,080
- What?
- Since you started liking Tae-Gyeong.

159
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,120
What are you talking about?

160
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,840
Do you think I would tell people?

161
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,440
I don't care if you like boys
or whatever.

162
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,919
As long as it's not Sin Da-On.

163
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:52,519
I really want you and Woo Tae-Gyeong
to work out.

164
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,120
I'm being serious.

165
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,879
Do you want me to help you guys?

166
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,360
I have no intention
of asking you for help.

167
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,399
Why not? I'm saying you and I should
team up and end things.

168
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,919
I'll be with Sin Da-On,
and you can be with Woo Tae-Gyeong.

169
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,159
Be honest.

170
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,480
Do you think you can give up
on Woo Tae-Gyeong?

171
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,279
You can't, right?

172
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,240
That's what happens
when you like someone.

173
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,080
It's not a bad thing.

174
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,519
Do you want to the person you like to be
taken from you without trying anything?

175
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,200
Hey.

176
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
What?

177
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,080
What do you mean taken from me?

178
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,840
Just like Da-On isn't yours,
Tae-Gyeong isn't mine either.

179
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,960
You can't even
accept the help I'm offering.

180
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,480
Fine. You can give up and regret it
for the rest of your life.

181
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,200
I'm going to go after him.

182
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,279
When it's time for me to give up,

183
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,840
I will give up on my own.

184
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,600
I know my place.

185
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,279
Fine.
Don't do anything like a fool then.

186
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,440
I refuse to do that.

187
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,360
When did I fall asleep?

188
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,600
Tae-Gyeong, are you awake?

189
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,120
I heard that you got hurt,
so I came because I was worried,

190
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,840
but I fell asleep too.

191
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,000
How's your head? Is it okay?

192
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,519
Yes, it's fine.

193
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:08,639
By the way, how does it feel to
officially join the student council...

194
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,720
and go on a trip like this?

195
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,639
This must all feel so new to you.

196
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,080
Have you ever liked someone before?

197
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,600
Yes, of course.

198
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,120
Why? Do you like someone?

199
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Yes.

200
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,720
But I think it's one-sided.

201
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,399
I'm not sure how that person...

202
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,440
feels about me.

203
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,399
What if you confessed
your feelings for them?

204
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,639
That person might not be as honest
as you are.

205
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,960
Everyone is different.

206
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,000
If you only wonder whether or not
that person likes you,

207
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,360
you could end up losing them.

208
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,600
I see.

209
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,159
If you tell them how you feel honestly,

210
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,879
don't you think they'll be honest
with you too?

211
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,399
I guess it's about to start.

212
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,159
What?

213
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,120
I think this will be perfect.
Let's do it here.

214
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,919
Aren't you going to play too?

215
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,639
No.

216
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,120
Because I'm not good at anything,

217
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,279
I'm not good at playing either.

218
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,840
Hey, you know how to bear a grudge.

219
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,320
Is your forehead...

220
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,600
okay?

221
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Yes.

222
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,639
Watch where you go.
This isn't the first time.

223
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,519
Come to think of it, when we first met,

224
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,680
you told me to watch where I was going.

225
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,440
You know, when I poked your butt...

226
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,170
Hey.

227
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,440
In any case,
it wasn't a good way to meet.

228
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,599
I'm sure of it.

229
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,079
It was okay for me.

230
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,720
What?

231
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,559
You liked that I poked you in the butt?

232
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,410
My gosh. Stop talking about my butt.

233
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,680
Right. You've never dated before, right?

234
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,960
Why are you bringing that up now?

235
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:00,039
Have you ever liked someone before?

236
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,960
Do you think I would answer you?

237
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,000
Fine.

238
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,519
I wasn't expecting anything
when I asked.

239
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,920
Having the person I like...

240
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,559
like me back...

241
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,200
is probably really hard, right?

242
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,559
Guys. Are you guys talking about love?

243
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:43,170
If I were to give some words of wisdom
to those who've never dated,

244
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,079
first loves are divided
into two categories.

245
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,200
How many?

246
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,680
Two... Two categories.

247
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,279
You either regret it, or you don't.
It's these two.

248
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,599
Look. What do you need for
your first love to be successful?

249
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,680
Confession.

250
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:07,359
You need to confess your feelings
to move forward.

251
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,079
If you want to confess your feelings,

252
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,359
you need courage.

253
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,720
What do you need?

254
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,960
Courage.

255
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,440
That's right.
You guys are definitely my apprentices.

256
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,559
Anyways, most end up having regrets
after not doing anything,

257
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,440
but you'll end up regretting it
regardless of what you do.

258
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,650
That's why I'm saying
you should just be forward.

259
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,890
That was the advice
from a dating master.

260
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,359
I want to ask you to give me a round
of applause, but you won't, right?

261
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,650
Goodbye, then.

262
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,319
Da-On! I want to do that too!

263
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,890
I feel like I just heard something
really important.

264
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:01,960
Courage.

265
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,650
Let's go play with fireworks too.

266
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,319
Forget it. I'm tired.

267
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,920
I'm going to go in and sleep.

268
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,440
Fine. I'm going then.

269
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,279
I...

270
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,240
once fell in love at first sight.

271
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,680
(First loves divide
into two categories.)

272
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,680
You either regret it, or you don't.

273
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,000
It's these two.

274
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,480
(Most end up having regrets
after not doing anything.)

275
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,599
That's why I'm saying
you should just be forward.

276
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,319
If you want to confess your feelings,
you need courage.

277
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,759
Courage.

278
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,440
You were here. I was looking for you.

279
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,359
- For me?
- Yes.

280
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,410
I have something to say to you.

281
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,039
Really?

282
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,319
I have something to say to you too.

283
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,799
First...

284
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,480
Here.

285
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,240
That's not it.

286
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,160
This.

287
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,839
What is this?

288
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,759
It's yours.

289
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,519
Mine?

290
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,720
I just bought it because
I thought of you when I saw it.

291
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,799
I thought it would look good on you.

292
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,160
It's not that great of a present.

293
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,799
It's a big gift for me.

294
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,920
You said you got it because
you thought of me.

295
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:41,960
That was the first time anyone
has ever said that to me.

296
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,480
I'll wear this every day from now on.

297
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,039
I won't ever forget it.

298
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,559
Thank you for thinking about me.

299
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,400
You're really admirable, Tae-Gyeong.

300
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,920
To me,

301
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,839
thinking about you
isn't that big of a deal.

302
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,240
I just...

303
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,720
think about you every day.

304
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,920
You pop into my mind,

305
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,359
and then I keep thinking about you.

306
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,759
I like that I'm the only person
you pat on the head,

307
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,680
and I like that
you're only honest with me.

308
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,359
You once said...

309
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,400
that nothing belonged to you.

310
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,880
That's why...

311
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,359
I want to belong to you.

312
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,920
Can I...

313
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,920
belong...

314
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,920
to you?

315
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,359
(There's only one way to resolve
your issues with Tae-Gyeong.)

316
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,400
(Just be honest.)

317
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,720
Tae-Gyeong.

318
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,039
- The thing I wanted to say to you is--
- Da-On.

319
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,359
The owner here is asking about
something. I think you should come.

320
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,160
Oh, okay.

321
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,920
Tae-Gyeong. I'm sorry.

322
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,200
Let's be sure to talk later. Okay?

323
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,680
I'm sorry for being late.

324
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:15,920
Gosh, that's unbelievable.

325
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,039
Sin Da-On is gay?

326
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,079
No wonder.

327
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,319
He didn't do anything
when So-Hee was hitting on him.

328
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,039
Poor So-Hee. What will she do?

329
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,880
What are you talking about?

330
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,880
I asked what you were talking about.

331
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,759
So-Hee.

332
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,559
This is driving me crazy.

333
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,240
- The thing is...
- Well...

334
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,720
We were on a walk,

335
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,160
and we heard someone talking
on the second-floor terrace,

336
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,599
and it was Da-On.

337
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,799
But he was with the same guy
we saw him with last time on the street.

338
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:57,960
But...

339
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:01,119
But what? Hurry up and tell me.

340
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,359
They were standing like this.

341
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,200
They were staring
at each other lovingly.

342
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:14,440
It was a look that could only be
exchanged if they were dating.

343
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,519
They were holding hands
the entire time they were talking.

344
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,039
Da-On seemed really happy too.

345
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,359
But is Da-On really gay?

346
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,119
So-Hee,
you didn't know about this, right?

347
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,440
First, send me this photo.

348
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,400
I need to verify it.

349
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,440
(Light on Me)

350
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,400
(Is that new?)

351
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,279
Oh, this? I got it as a gift.

352
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:55,480
Shin-Woo,
are you worried about something?

353
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,279
What if the person I like
doesn't like me back?

354
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,799
(Is something going on with Da-On?)

355
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,440
You're acting paranoid.

356
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,200
(I want him to disappear.)

357
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,279
I don't want to see his face!

358
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,480
(Light on Me)
