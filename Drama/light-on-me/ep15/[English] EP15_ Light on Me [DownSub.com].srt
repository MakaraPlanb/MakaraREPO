1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,400
Have you been well?

2
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:09,890
Yes.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,919
What about you?

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:15,679
I...

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,960
haven't been doing well.

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,160
Why not?

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,719
I grew apart from the person...

8
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,920
that I really liked.

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,920
I know it's late,

10
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,320
but I wanted to tell you.

11
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,799
I'm sorry, Tae-Gyeong.

12
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,920
I like you,

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,240
but I kept getting scared
and running away.

14
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,200
I kept disappointing and hurting...

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,320
the person who liked me.

16
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,409
I was such a fool.

17
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,280
As long as you know it.

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,049
Do you know why I liked you?

19
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,959
When I'm with you,

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,239
I was in a good mood,

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,879
and I became happy.

22
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,640
You were kind and warm.

23
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,840
But as time passed and I saw you,

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,439
I felt sad for some reason.

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,959
It seemed like you were trying
really hard to be liked,

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,519
and you looked tired and unstable.

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,920
That's why I thought if I loved you...

28
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,040
you wouldn't try so hard.

29
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,439
But no matter what I did,

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,280
other things were more important to you
than me.

31
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,040
So you couldn't see me.

32
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,370
The person who comforted me
during those times...

33
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,479
was Shin-Woo.

34
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,960
I saw myself in Shin-Woo.

35
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,199
I saw what it looked like to truly
like someone.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,090
These days,

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,120
I want to return
those feelings to Shin-Woo.

38
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,240
Also, I was really happy
during the time that I liked you...

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,919
that the pain I felt was nothing.

40
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,199
So don't feel sorry.

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,879
Here. Repeat after me.

42
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:54,120
"Thank you for liking me."

43
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,680
I feel even worse
seeing you act like this.

44
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,879
Hurry up and repeat after me.

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,719
"Thank you for liking me."

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,639
Thank you for liking me.

47
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,120
- And I'm sorry...
- There you go again.

48
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,960
You can't say "I'm sorry" to me anymore.

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,680
Da-On. Can I...

50
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,520
ask you for a favor?

51
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,400
A favor?

52
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,199
What is it?

53
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,400
I want you to do
what you really want to do...

54
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,560
and find out who you really are.

55
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,639
That's my favor.

56
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,960
Then...

57
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,479
can I like you?

58
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,319
I didn't think I could say this,

59
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,959
but now I think I can say it
over and over again.

60
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,120
Tae-Gyeong.

61
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,399
I like you.

62
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,519
From now on, I'll try...

63
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,050
just like you did.

64
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,959
(Take a look at this when you get home.)

65
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,800
What should I do?

66
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,720
- Hi.
- Hi.

67
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,279
Tae-Gyeong.

68
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,920
Da-On.

69
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,920
Hi, Shin-Woo.
You're going to student council, right?

70
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,920
Let's go together.

71
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,439
Did you eat breakfast, Tae-Gyeong?

72
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,680
No. I overslept.

73
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,120
I thought you might've forgotten to eat,

74
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,959
so I bought one for you too.

75
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,040
If I knew you were here,
I would've bought three.

76
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,160
Here. Have mine.

77
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,560
No, it's okay.

78
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,879
Really? Here.

79
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,680
Let's go.

80
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,240
To the right. Over there.

81
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,800
Pull it.

82
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:40,959
(Welcome to Our Festival)

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,560
(New Light Prince Contest)

84
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,959
(Flower Booth, Namkung Over Flowers)

85
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,560
Ta-da.

86
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,360
Welcome.

87
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,800
This is Namkung Over Flowers.

88
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,079
Wow.

89
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,959
What?

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,360
I didn't know
you were interested in flowers.

91
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,000
I wasn't interested in it before,

92
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,399
but everyone tells me
that I'm as pretty as a flower,

93
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,360
so I wanted to do
something that fit that.

94
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:07,879
I prepared flowers that suit you too,

95
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,560
so come by later with Shin-Woo.

96
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,480
Are you done?

97
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,439
We're almost done setting up the booths,

98
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,839
so let's get what's left
in the student council room.

99
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,040
Yes, sir.

100
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,199
Okay.

101
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,720
Let's just get through today.

102
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,360
Did something good happen?

103
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,160
What? No. Why?

104
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,720
You seem to be in a good mood today.

105
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,240
Really?
It's my first time coming to Saebit Day.

106
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,199
I must be excited about that.

107
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,160
Hey...

108
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,920
How are things between you and Da-On?

109
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,120
Are you getting tutored by him again?

110
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,959
Yes. It's been a while,
so it's hard to catch up.

111
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,240
I might have to study all night.

112
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,160
All night?

113
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,120
You dummy. How could you forget
everything already?

114
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,319
My gosh.
Is that something I can control?

115
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
But still.
Thanks to the tutoring sessions,

116
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,360
the awkwardness between me and Da-On
is gone, so that's nice.

117
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,960
What do you think?

118
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,759
Do we still seem awkward?

119
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,799
Did something happen to you?

120
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,120
You're not really talkative today.

121
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,879
What should I say?

122
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,360
If that's what you think,

123
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,600
then I have to accept it.

124
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,600
Wow.

125
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,450
Is there a booth you want to check out?

126
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,879
Oh, right. Namkung asked me
to visit his booth earlier.

127
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,799
Please buy flowers.

128
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,039
I'll even wink at you for free.

129
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,679
We came without realizing.

130
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,039
Gosh, this suits you.

131
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,679
It's cute.

132
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,120
My gosh. Did you hear him?

133
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,879
Tae-Gyeong just said I was cute?

134
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,600
How is that cute?

135
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,480
Why? It's really cute.

136
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,519
Whoes idea was that flower?

137
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,600
It was my idea, of course.

138
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,720
I know exactly what I should do...

139
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,210
for people to like me.

140
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,879
Shin-Woo. Admit your loss.

141
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,399
I'm a bit cuter than you today.

142
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,360
I've never been cute.

143
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,639
No.

144
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,090
You're really cute.

145
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,559
Look at that. His ears are red again.

146
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,330
Oh, my. Do you think you could
get burned if you touch them?

147
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,039
Oh, right.

148
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,679
I left the bag with my clothes
in the student council room.

149
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,090
I'll go get it.

150
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,360
No. I know where I put it.

151
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,799
I'll be right back.

152
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,279
He said he had something for me,
so where is he?

153
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,240
- Where did you get it?
- I don't know.

154
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,679
I borrowed it from the girls.

155
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,679
- Really? Good job.
- Right?

156
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,399
I'm planning on giving someone flowers,

157
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:23,639
but I don't know which one to give her.

158
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,360
Can you choose one for me?

159
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,399
Me?

160
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,759
Who are you giving it to?

161
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,120
Someone. Just choose one for me.

162
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,879
Namkung, do you have someone...

163
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:39,240
My gosh. What are you talking about?

164
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,919
I'm going to give it to my mom.

165
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,039
Can't a son give his mom some flowers?

166
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Goodness. You're such a good son.

167
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,360
Let's see. This one.

168
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,840
This one is the prettiest.

169
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:56,240
Okay. This is your choice?

170
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,759
Okay.

171
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,919
- You can go now.
- Okay.

172
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Don't get distracted
and focus on selling flowers.

173
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Yes, sir.

174
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,679
Oh, my.

175
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,200
Were you hiding?

176
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,159
Yes.

177
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,399
I agreed to wait until Da-On
isn't mad at me anymore.

178
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,120
Until then, I'm going to self-reflect.

179
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Right.

180
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,559
Oh, right. Here.

181
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,039
Why are you giving this to me?

182
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,440
I thought it was for your mom.

183
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,840
Oh, my. You overheard everything.

184
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,600
So you're not going to accept it?

185
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,120
This is a rare item.

186
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,919
It's Da-On's favorite.

187
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,399
I was going to sell it and say
that it's Da-On's favorite,

188
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,919
but I decided to give it to you.

189
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,360
If you don't want it, forget it.

190
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,639
Thanks.

191
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,320
Bye.

192
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,759
She really likes it.

193
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,960
Right. She should at least smile
with those homely looks.

194
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,759
Where it?

195
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
I'm pretty sure I left it here.

196
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,879
Are you looking for something?

197
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,960
Da-On. Did you see...

198
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,200
a white bag filled with clothes?

199
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,080
I was in the auditorium all day,

200
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,879
so it's my first time in here.

201
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,720
Why? Is it missing?

202
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:47,679
Yes. I'm pretty sure I left it here,

203
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,360
but I can't find it.

204
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,840
What should I do?

205
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,600
Those are the clothes for the contest.

206
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,240
I need to find it.

207
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,320
Things are hectic,

208
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,279
so I'm sure it got mixed
in with something else.

209
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,919
I'll ask around. Don't worry.

210
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,639
You need to be in the auditorium an hour
before the contest,

211
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,679
so go and wait there.

212
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,120
Okay.

213
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,480
It's an hour before the contest.

214
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,320
Can all the participants come backstage?

215
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,639
Tae-Gyeong.

216
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,000
Shin-Woo.

217
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,919
You can't get dirty.

218
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,000
Get out of there.

219
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,679
They're doing the final rehearsals
in the auditorium,

220
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,600
so don't worry and go.

221
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,679
I'll find it for you.

222
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,639
Hurry up and go.

223
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
You haven't heard anything yet?

224
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,000
There are only 30 minutes left.

225
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,360
You couldn't find it?

226
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,480
I'm sorry. I wasn't helpful.

227
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:34,600
No. This is all my fault.

228
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,399
I should've taken better care of it.

229
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,039
I'm really sorry.

230
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,919
Don't be sorry about that.

231
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,440
I'm sure there's a way.

232
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,039
That's right, Tae-Gyeong.
Let's look for a different way.

233
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,759
Tae-Gyeong.

234
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
What?

235
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,000
What is this? Did you find it?

236
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:03,000
Is this it? Check it.

237
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,839
Yes, it is.
All the clothes are in here too.

238
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,720
Thank goodness.

239
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,920
Da-On. Where did you find it?

240
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,279
I thought it might've gotten mixed in
with the stuff for the booths,

241
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,759
and it was with the snacks
in the main booth.

242
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,960
Thank you so much, Da-On.

243
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,079
If it weren't for you,
I would've been in trouble.

244
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,079
It's fine. I'm glad we found it.

245
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,519
Hey, Tae-Gyeong.

246
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,920
What? Tae-Gyeong,
aren't you going to put makeup on?

247
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,170
Makeup?

248
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,440
You should at least put on
some base makeup and lipstick.

249
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,680
Everyone but you has makeup on.

250
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,839
Doesn't he already have makeup on?

251
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,519
Oh, wait. Is he handsome without it?
Like me?

252
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,519
My gosh. Can you be quiet?

253
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,170
Use this and give it back later.

254
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
You'll look a lot better
with some lipstick on.

255
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:24,279
I need to check out the Saebit Girls
High School booth, so I can't help you.

256
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,170
It's okay.

257
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,000
I've never done it before,

258
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,279
but I'll try.

259
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,200
Okay, I'll see you later.
Good luck out there.

260
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,559
Let's go.

261
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,759
I heard you came in first place in
the New Light Prince Contest last year.

262
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,170
Yes, I did.

263
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,079
If I participated,
I would've come in first place.

264
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,039
Oh, no.

265
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,650
Hey, Da-On.
People might start talking again.

266
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:10,410
It doesn't matter anymore.

267
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,480
Thank you.

268
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,680
I'll help you.

269
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,960
I can do it myself.

270
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,599
There you go.

271
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,839
I'll help him now.

272
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,119
I'm...

273
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,920
Tae-Gyeong's manager.

274
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,960
Okay.

275
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,839
Since you're Tae-Gyeong's manager today.

276
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:47,519
Tae-Gyeong, I'll come back later.

277
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,079
- Let's go.
- We did a great job.

278
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,599
- Do a good job.
- I always do.

279
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:15,119
Oh, sorry.

280
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,960
I just thought we were too close.

281
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,799
Thank you for earlier.

282
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,680
You went through so much trouble
because of me.

283
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,890
No. I didn't do my job
as your manager properly.

284
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,240
I should've taken better care of it.

285
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,599
I'm sorry for making you worry.

286
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,240
In any case,

287
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,920
can you stop moving your lips,

288
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,890
so I can finish putting this on you?

289
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,400
Okay.

290
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,079
We'll be starting in five minutes.
You need to go out now.

291
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,599
Oh, right.

292
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:27,440
Look at these.
They're the shoes you got me.

293
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,240
You told me to wear these
and not be nervous,

294
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,720
but I'm really nervous.

295
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:39,000
If you feel nervous on stage,

296
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,920
look at me while you talk.

297
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,160
There will be a lot of people in there,
so how will I find you?

298
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,720
I'll stand where you can see me.

299
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,240
Somewhere you can see me at once.

300
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,240
I'll get going.

301
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,240
You'll do great, Tae-Gyeong.

302
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,240
You can do it!

303
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,599
Gosh, you scared me.

304
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,599
I'm sorry. Did I surprise you?

305
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,039
A little.

306
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:57,480
I think my heart is racing faster
than before.

307
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,640
Are you nervous?

308
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,839
Yes. Very.

309
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,599
It's not that big of a deal.

310
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,160
Being confident is most important.

311
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:08,079
Did you think of an introduction?

312
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,200
That has to have impact.

313
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:13,160
Oh, no. I didn't think of anything.

314
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,759
What should I do?

315
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,799
There's nothing to it.

316
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:21,119
Be loud and articulate.

317
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,200
"I'm Woo Tae-Gyeong,
the newest member of student council."

318
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,599
Say that and capture the audience
with your smile.

319
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,759
Since you're supporting me,

320
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,640
I think I can do a good job.

321
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:39,039
Then I'll cheer for you loudly later,

322
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,240
so you can do well.

323
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,759
Da-On. Let's go.

324
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,880
I'll get going. Don't be nervous.

325
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:51,880
You can do it.

326
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,519
(It's time for the highlight
of Saebit Day.)

327
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,839
(New Light Prince Contest!)

328
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,079
We will start right now!

329
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,240
(I was a fool to not recognize
the New Light Prince.)

330
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:18,039
(I know what type you are.
You're my type.)

331
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,680
(You're my style.)

332
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,119
(New Light Prince Contest)

333
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:27,519
My special talent, as you can see,

334
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,279
is my face.

335
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,039
Give him a warm round of applause!

336
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,319
- You're so handsome!
- You're so handsome!

337
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:36,039
Tae-Gyeong is up next, right?

338
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,960
Where did Noh Shin-Woo go?

339
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,720
It's better if you don't know.

340
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,240
The next participant is...

341
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,240
a part of the Saebit Boys High School
student council.

342
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,599
Last year, the student body president,
Sin Da-On...

343
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,440
won with a huge margin.

344
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,039
Will this year's participant be able to
continue that legacy?

345
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,400
I'm excited to find out.

346
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,119
Woo Tae-Gyeong from Grade 11, Class 2.

347
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,400
Let's welcome him to the stage!

348
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,319
You're so handsome, Woo Tae-Gyeong!

349
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,759
Of course you're not as handsome as me!

350
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,279
You're so handsome!

351
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,680
Hello.

352
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,119
Hello.

353
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,079
I know it's sudden,
but do you have any special talents?

354
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,480
Special talents?

355
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,680
- No.
- Skip it.

356
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:48,160
- Skip it.
- Move on.

357
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,920
Right. Handsome people
don't have special talents.

358
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,400
Right. Let's move on.

359
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,319
Can you introduce yourself?

360
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,039
Right.

361
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,839
Well...

362
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,880

You're my type.)

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,559
(I'm going to get one of you.)

364
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:09,920
I'm...

365
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,599
- What's wrong with him?
- What's going on?

366
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,599
- What's taking him so long?
- What's with him?

367
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,720
- How long is he going to stand there?
- Is he okay?

368
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:24,640
- He's frozen.
- Is he okay?

370
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,319
- Darn it.
- What is he doing?

371
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:37,039
- What is he doing?
- What's taking him so long?

372
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:39,319
- He's ruining it?
- He should just get off stage.

373
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,920
Do we have to tell him what to say?

374
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,240
- Woo Tae-Gyeong!
- Just get off.

375
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,599
You can do it.

376
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,880
I'm...

377
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,920
the newest member of
Saebit Boys High School,

378
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,200
and my name is Woo Tae-Gyeong.

379
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,599
The winner of the New Light Prince
Contest, Woo Tae-Gyeong.

380
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,680
Everyone, give him a round of applause!

382
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:42,559
Congratulations, Tae-Gyeong.

383
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:45,240
I knew you would win.

384
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:49,920
Thank you for cheering for me.

385
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,480
You were the handsomest one up there.

386
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:55,359
I agree. All I could see was Tae-Gyeong.

387
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,000
As of today, I will accept that
Tae-Gyeong and I...

388
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,960
look alike.

389
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,480
You guys...

390
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,880
went through so much trouble
working all day.

391
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:11,799
It's late, so let's just clean up
and go home today.

392
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,279
But I'll make sure to treat you guys
to something really good next time.

393
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,599
- Barbecue?
- Barbecue.

394
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,599
Yes!

395
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,599
But where's Da-On and Shin-Woo?

396
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,359
Good question.

397
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,400
I haven't seen them for a while.

Is he sick?

Thank you,

401
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,319
Da-On.

402
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,519
Let's go,

403
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,480
Tae-Gyeong.

404
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,319
I was waiting for you.

405
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,480
Are you going to keep me waiting?
