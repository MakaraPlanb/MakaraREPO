00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,160
(Title: Saebit Day Plans,
Bazaar, New Light Prince)

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,839
Okay, guys. At the count of three,

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:09,970
you're going to choose someone, okay?

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,760
One, two,

5
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,399
three.

6
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,600
What are you doing, Shin-Woo?
Do you want to be the prince?

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,920
Yes!

8
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,320
Then, with a unanimous vote,

9
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,159
the participant for the New Light
Prince Contest this year will be...

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,399
Woo Tae-Gyeong!
Give him a round of applause.

11
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,920
Congratulations, Tae-Gyeong.

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,479
No way.

13
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,120
(Saebit Boy High School Meeting)

14
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,239
You guys planned it...

15
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:17,200
while I was in the bathroom, right?

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,159
You agreed to choose me, right?

17
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:23,560
What are you talking about?
What do you take us for?

18
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,879
When you were in the bathroom,
we didn't do anything.

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,680
We just sat here.

20
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,920
Right, Shin-Woo?

21
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,439
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,200
I knew it.

23
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,640
We need good teamwork to pull off a con.

24
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,239
Why are your ears so red?

25
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,120
They're like a lie detector test.

26
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,920
That's why I told you
we shouldn't do it.

27
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,159
I'm sorry, Tae-Gyeong.

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,640
But it's because you're the only person
that can do it.

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,799
But what's the New Light Prince?

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,040
Well...

31
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,400
Saebit Day is the charity event
hosted by Saebit Foundation.

32
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,920
During that event, the part
that raises the most donations is...

33
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,039
the New Light Prince Contest.
That's what they say.

34
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,840
If I were to give you more details,
it's exactly what it sounds like.

35
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,400
They choose the most handsome
and popular person for it.

36
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,039
It's tradition for someone
in the student council to do it.

37
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,400
Da-On, who couldn't make it
because of his exams,

38
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,919
won last year.

39
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,000
It was incredible back then.

40
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,960
In any case,
the New Light Prince this year...

41
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,090
will be Tae-Gyeong.

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,319
He's very handsome, just like me.

43
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,240
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,120
Why are you worried, Tae-Gyeong?

45
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,680
I'm sure you will win.

46
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:48,759
The best stylist ever, me, Namkung,
will help you,

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,919
so don't worry.

48
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,680
You don't have to wear your uniform.

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,599
I have to prepare an outfit
and go on stage all by myself?

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,879
I'm really bad at that.

51
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,759
Don't worry about that.

52
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,599
You will have a manager
to help you with everything.

53
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,000
Who is it?

54
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,199
It's Noh Shin-Woo.

55
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,039
What?

56
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,199
Shin-Woo will be Prince Tae-Gyeong's...

57
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,680
manager.

58
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,719
Give him a round of applause.

59
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,400
That's a great idea.

60
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,080
This is great, Tae-Gyeong.

61
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,120
Right.

62
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,039
Do you have time tomorrow?

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,360
Yes, of course.

64
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,560
Then do you want to meet at
K Shopping Mall at 12 tomorrow?

65
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,120
Sure.

66
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,599
What about lunch?
Are you going to eat first?

67
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,520
No. Let's eat together.

68
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,639
Okay.

69
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,960
- Also...
- What?

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,479
What are you going to wear tomorrow?

71
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,599
Why are you asking me about that?

72
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:03,599
I'm going to be dressed
in an effortlessly chic look.

73
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,919
What does it mean
to be effortlessly chic?

74
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm just going to wear whatever I see.

75
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,759
How have you never heard of
the effortlessly chic look?

76
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,960
Is that so wrong?

77
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,120
Everyone these days knows what that is.

78
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,800
- Do you know everything?
- Of course I do.

79
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,519
Plus, I'm not a picky eater.

80
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,120
Da-On. What are you doing?

81
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,680
Is that for me?

82
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,839
- What?
- Nothing. I'm just kidding.

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,240
Let's go eat
in the student council room.

84
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
(Chats, Noh Shin-Woo)

85
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,079
(Tae-Gyeong leave the chatroom.
Leave. Did you do it?)

86
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,439
(I'm not going to do it.)

87
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,240
Is he ignoring me?

88
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:28,120
(Enter search words.)

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,759
(The meaning of effortlessly chic)

90
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,879
(It means you're dressed up
but not too dressed up.)

91
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,040
(Dressed up but not too dressed up)

92
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,759
"Dressed up but not too dressed up"?

93
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,399
(The meaning of effortlessly chic)

94
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,079
What does that mean?

95
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,879
(Tae-Gyeong: Don't be late tomorrow.)

96
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,519
(Tae-Gyeong)

97
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,920
(Don't be late tomorrow.)

98
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,040
He's ignoring me again?

99
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,360
(Go to bed.)

100
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,399
Wait.

101
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,439
Darn it.

102
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,720
I read it right away.

103
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,199
What if he thinks I was waiting
for his text?

104
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,680
"How to go on a nice date".

105
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,319
(The first tip
on having a successful date.)

106
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,439
(Look at them in the eyes while having
a conversation.)

107
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,800
(Be sure to nod and show that
you can relate to them.)

108
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,480
(Cupid of Love's answer)

109
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,120
Tae-Gyeong.

110
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,160
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,240
Did you wait long?

112
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,879
Yes. Why were you so late?

113
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,680
I overslept.

114
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,959
You never oversleep.

115
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,240
I went to bed late last night.

116
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,199
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,160
Why are you laughing?

118
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,040
It's nothing.

119
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,920
I'm wondering if this is
your effortlessly chic look.

120
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,079
You got pretty dressed up today.

121
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,040
Were you late because
you were choosing this outfit?

122
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,639
I picked it out last night.

123
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,480
You picked it out last night?

124
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,360
So you overslept because
you were picking this out?

125
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,160
Be quiet. Let's go.

126
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,090
Teasing him is pretty fun.

127
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,120
What do you think about this?

128
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,120
(Look at them in the eyes while having
a conversation.)

129
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,600
(Be sure to nod and show that
you can relate to them.)

130
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,360
Is it okay?

131
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,559
What about this one?

132
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,559
What about this?

133
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,210
How about this?

134
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,330
Are you broken?

135
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,330
You don't want to be my manager, do you?

136
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,879
I mean, no. It's not that.

137
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,090
Fine. I'm glad you're being honest.

138
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,120
Let's just look around here and go.

139
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,840
No. Let's look at everything.

140
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,210
I didn't even eat.

141
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,159
We agreed to eat together.

142
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,919
I wanted these.

143
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,799
Does it clash with our concept?

144
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,519
Why do you keep doing that?

145
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,559
What?

146
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,720
You keep glaring at me.

147
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,559
And when I ask you something,

148
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,039
you just nod insincerely.

149
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,039
If you're going to do that,
just go home.

150
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,279
Are you mad?

151
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,799
Yes.

152
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,399
You came here to help me,

153
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,720
but you weren't helpful.

154
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,960
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,080
It's fine.

156
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,120
You must be tired
because you didn't get a lot of sleep.

157
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,159
You can go home after we drink this.

158
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,919
I'll just look around
some more by myself...

159
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
No!

160
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,799
I want to stay here...

161
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,559
with you.

162
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,159
I want to be here with you.

163
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, well...

164
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:27,080
After seeing the clothes you chose,

165
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,799
I thought you'd need some help.

166
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,080
Oh, right. Fine.

167
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,840
Here.

168
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,799
Are these for me?

169
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,879
Yes.

170
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,639
I just wanted to get you a present.

171
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,679
Wear these
and don't be nervous on stage.

172
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,559
As for the clothes...

173
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,399
You looked good in everything.

174
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,519
You have a small face,

175
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,600
you're pale,

176
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,679
and you're handsome.

177
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,720
Oh, right. Well...

178
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,480
I need to buy a hat.

179
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,399
Can you help me choose one out?

180
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,919
Oh, my. It's cute.

181
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,919
It looks really cute.
I'll take a photo for you.

182
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,480
Hey.

183
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,120
Do you...

184
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,200
want to take one with me?

185
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,759
Sure.

186
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,159
(Slightly less handsome Tae-Gyeong)

187
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,399
(What do you think of this hat?
Noh Shin-Woo picked it out.)

188
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,039
I chose a great manager for him.

189
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,039
- What?
- What?

190
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,679
Oh, well...

191
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,480
Tae-Gyeong...

192
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,879
is going to participate
in the New Light Prince Contest.

193
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,639
I thought he'd struggle on his own,

194
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,440
so I had Shin-Woo
help him has his manager.

195
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,399
I see. Good job.

196
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:33,039
How are things between
you and Tae-Gyeong? Did you guys talk?

197
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,360
- Not yet.
- Da-On!

198
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,519
- What?
- Don't look at me like that.

199
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:46,720
You look really sad,
so it makes you look handsomer.

200
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,000
You make me laugh.

201
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,639
Right. You should smile like that.

202
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,120
You're almost as handsome as me,

203
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,840
so when you smile, you look quite nice.

204
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,679
So?

205
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,240
When are you going to talk to him?

206
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,519
I want to talk to him in person,

207
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,039
but we never bump into each other.

208
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,720
That makes sense.

209
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:15,759
You can't come to the student council
room because of your exams,

210
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,159
and you're in a different grade.

211
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,279
Shin-Woo and Tae-Gyeong
are always together,

212
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,480
so they fight
and make up really quickly.

213
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,559
Are you going to contact him?

214
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,519
No. There's another way.

215
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,399
Right. You always know what to do.

216
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,000
I'll see you later, Namkung.

217
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,360
Where are you going all of a sudden?

218
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,559
Something suddenly came up.
I'm really sorry.

219
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:13,650
Gosh, we did a great job shopping today.

220
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,519
I'm going to win no matter what.

221
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm sorry.

222
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,839
I sincerely want to apologize...

223
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,410
for what I did to you.

224
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,920
I was envious of you.

225
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,759
I liked Da-On before you,

226
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,890
but it seemed like Da-On...

227
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:05,410
liked you more than me.

228
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,319
I thought that you were stealing
Da-On from me.

229
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,720
Da-On doesn't even belong to me.

230
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,759
I...

231
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,319
can't say that it's okay right now.

232
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,680
But it will become okay.

233
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,680
We have something in common.

234
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,599
We both really like Da-On.

235
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,119
I don't.

236
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,170
Who does something like that
to someone they like?

237
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,960
I have no right to like him.

238
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,440
Do you remember what you said to me?

239
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Hi. It's been three years
since I liked Sin Da-On.

240
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,170
My name is Lee So-Hee.

241
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:01,960
When I met you, this is what I thought.

242
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,599
"Gosh, she's so honest and cool."

243
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,480
That's when...

244
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,480
I wanted to become friends with you.

245
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,960
Out of all the people that I know,

246
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,240
you're the most courageous...

247
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,319
and coolest person.

248
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,240
So let's become friends one day, okay?

249
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,960
We could become friends from now on.

250
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,279
To celebrate becoming friends...

251
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Here.

252
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,240
What is this?

253
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,759
I heard you were participating
in the New Light Prince Contest.

254
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,410
Namkung told me.

255
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,410
Right.

256
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,039
I got it because I thought
it would look good on you.

257
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:59,319
Thank you, So-Hee.

258
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,319
Don't be.

259
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,319
I'm more grateful, Tae-Gyeong.

260
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,359
I'll get going.

261
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,079
Okay. Goodbye.

262
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,480
Okay. I'll see you around.

263
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:41,170
What are you thinking about?

264
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,519
Just...

265
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:47,920
I wonder what Da-On is doing right now.

266
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,359
So-Hee said it's been a while
since she saw Da-On too.

267
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,240
He doesn't answer her calls either.

268
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,079
Is he okay?

269
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,599
Do you miss him?

270
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,839
I just...

271
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:11,720
want to know if he's doing okay.

272
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,599
I'm worried.

273
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,359
I know you don't want to see me.

274
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,410
But can you just give me
a moment of your time?

275
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,279
After what happened between us,

276
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,960
I couldn't sleep,

277
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,839
and I couldn't eat.

278
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,880
I thought I'd be more tormented
if I didn't say anything.

279
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:11,680
I'm sorry for putting you through
all that pain...

280
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,839
just because I liked you.

281
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,680
I'm sorry for hurting
the person you like.

282
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,279
You can stay mad at me if you want,
and it's okay if you hate me.

283
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,720
But...

284
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,160
I'm not okay with you saying
you never want to see me again.

285
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,200
So-Hee.

286
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,960
I understand, so stop crying.

287
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,079
Your eyes are going to get swollen.

288
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,599
I don't hate you.

289
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,480
I'll take back what I said about
never seeing you again.

290
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,359
But...

291
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,200
I don't think we can
be good friends right now.

292
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,319
Right.

293
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:07,960
I can wait.

294
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,119
Were you going somewhere?

295
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,799
To meet someone.

296
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,640
Is it Woo Tae-Gyeong?

297
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,920
Tae-Gyeong is a good guy.

298
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,440
I can see why you like him now.

299
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,359
Right.

300
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:35,799
I know that Tae-Gyeong is a good guy.

301
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,960
That's why...

302
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,160
I'm going to start all over again.

303
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,960
You went through so much trouble
being my manager...

304
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,160
and shopping with me.

305
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,160
Thank you.

306
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:09,960
Thanks for the shoes too.

307
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,599
Hey, Tae-Gyeong.

308
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,000
Yes?

309
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,359
I'm sure you know this,

310
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,640
but I'm bad...

311
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,640
at expressing myself.

312
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,880
That's why when I met someone
as honest as you,

313
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,480
I thought it was interesting at first,
and I got curious,

314
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,960
and...

315
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,960
I wanted to spend more time with you.

316
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,799
So?

317
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:56,720
Right, so...

318
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,279
What I want to say is...

319
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:07,640
I...

320
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,519
am not disqualified as your manager,
right?

321
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,759
Right. You'll continue to be my manager.

322
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,119
You have to stay by my side every day
and answer all of my questions...

323
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,359
and do everything I tell you to do.

324
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,799
Hey, that's...

325
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,000
So...

326
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,960
don't worry and go home and sleep.

327
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,640
You didn't lose your job.

328
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,839
I had a lot of fun today.

329
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:45,000
I'll see you at school.

330
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,720
"Stay..."

331
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,000
"by my side."

332
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:19,119
He knows
how to make a person's heart flutter.

333
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,160
Hi,

334
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,359
Tae-Gyeong.

335
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:02,039
=Light on Me=

336
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,680
(How are things between you and Da-On?)

337
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,799
What do you think? Do we seem awkward?

338
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,480
It's an hour before the contest.

339
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:10,599
Where did it go? Where is it?

340
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,319
- Are you looking for something?
(- Did something happen?)

341
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,160
(Tae-Gyeong.)

342
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,119
Shin-Woo...
