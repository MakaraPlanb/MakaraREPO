1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,631
(Twenty years old, Early summer)

2
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,972
- Gosh.
- Look at that.

3
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,142
Gosh, look at that!

4
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,988
Surprisingly enough,

5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,200
my first love...

6
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,579
is among these three people.

7
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,625
(Light on Me)

8
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,545
(2 years ago)

9
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:01,436
- Hello.
- Hello.

10
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,313
Hi, Tae-Gyeong.

11
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,441
You're Woo Tae-Gyeong
from Grade 11 Class 1, right?

12
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,361
I'm your homeroom teacher, Seo Haet-Bit.

13
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,113
Let's get along.

14
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,323
Oh, okay.

15
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,164
That's how kids are like these days.

16
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,876
They hate adults, and they avoid them.

17
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,002
I see.

18
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,589
But he's quite strange.

19
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,925
Kids these days
would say he's a voluntary outsider.

20
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,219
He's notorious among the students.

21
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,308
I was worried about him,
so I talked to him once,

22
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,311
but he said he doesn't need friends...

23
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:46,148
or my help.
He then said goodbye and left.

24
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,943
So don't get hurt.

25
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,070
It hurts me if you do.

26
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,780
Okay?

27
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,117
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hey.

28
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,791
"I don't need friends." What a joke.

29
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,711
Hey. He can hear you. Stop.

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,757
Do you have something to say to me?

31
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,094
Right... Well... So the thing is...

32
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,598
If you do, can you say it louder?

33
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,308
I can't hear you.

34
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,060
No.

35
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,937
I don't have anything to say.

36
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:29,274
If you don't, speak softly.

37
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,863
Hey. I'm sorry.
I'll apologize on his behalf.

38
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,783
My friend likes to joke around.

39
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,826
Why...

40
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,914
are you apologizing on his behalf?

41
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,418
Because he's my friend, you punk.

42
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,879
That's why you don't have friends.

43
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,674
Stop it. Let's go. Come on.

44
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,056
"Friends"?

45
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,768
Hey.

46
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,522
Here. You dropped your wallet.

47
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,610
Thank you.

48
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,530
We're in the same class again.

49
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,785
I'm sorry,
but I've never seen you before.

50
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,078
What?

51
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,455
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Hey.

52
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,957
Did you write a review of a concert?

53
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,333
No. I was going to copy yours.

54
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,043
Gosh, want to die?

55
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,255
A review of a concert?

56
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:36,133
Yes. The one we had to do over break.

57
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,010
Isn't that too much?

58
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,430
How could they give us homework during
break? Are we in elementary school?

59
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,642
I...
I didn't hear about that assignment.

60
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,646
What? I announced it in our group chat.

61
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,859
Oh, I see. You're not in the group chat.

62
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,361
You weren't invited to it.

63
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:57,988
I see.

64
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,658
I'll invite you.

65
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,076
Let's go.

66
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,996
Can you show me your review?

67
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,170
There comes a day...

68
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,592
when the street you walk on every day...

69
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,513
seems different from usual.

70
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,811
Am I okay like this?

71
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,783
Excuse me.

72
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,871
Is this seat taken?

73
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,749
No, it's not.

74
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,710
Okay.

75
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,925
Enjoy your lunch.

76
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,387
- Don't worry about it.
- I can do it. I can eat it all.

77
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,681
- No, wait. Hey.
- Let me show you how much I can eat.

78
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,140
Hey. I'm telling you.

79
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,685
- Give me some.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

80
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,063
A day when
familiar things seem unfamiliar.

81
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,485
Am I okay like this?

82
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,200
Tae-Gyeong, you don't like beans either?

83
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,578
It's not that I don't like them,

84
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,163
I don't eat them.

85
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,667
I didn't eat them since I was young too.

86
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,961
My parents didn't say anything
about being a picky eater.

87
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,882
But one day,
I really wanted to try them.

88
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,260
So I got a spoonful and tried it.

89
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,305
What do you think it was like?

90
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,807
It has to be good...

91
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,477
so that you learn the lesson that
you shouldn't be a picky eater.

92
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:53,937
No.

93
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,898
It wasn't good.

94
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,568
But it was better than
I thought it would be.

95
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,778
I thought it would be disgusting.

96
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,949
So the lesson of this story...

97
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,494
isn't don't be a picky eater.
It's just try it.

98
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,663
It's better than you'd expect.

99
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,417
Think about something you'd never do,

100
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,296
and just try it.
Regardless of what it is.

101
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,050
You never know.
Something fun might happen.

102
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:32,809
Something I would never do...

Hey. You dropped this.

109
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,168
You dropped this!

110
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,249
My gosh.

111
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,211
I'm really sorry. Are you okay?

112
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,629
I think poked you a bit hard.

113
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,382
What are you talking about?
It didn't even touch me.

114
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,676
No. I'm pretty sure I did.

115
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,512
It must've hurt a lot. Let me see.

116
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:51,972
Don't touch me.

117
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,350
What? I'm sorry.

118
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,484
Your ears are really red.

119
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,778
It must've hurt a lot.

120
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,823
Just leave. Please.

121
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,284
Hey. I'll carry this for you
since you're in pain.

122
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,869
I'm not in any pain.

123
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:16,788
Also,

124
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,251
watch where you're going.

125
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,093
Right.

126
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:34,223
It's better to be alone than
become friends with someone like him.

127
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,308
Pass!

128
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,352
Watch out!

129
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,271
Are you okay?

130
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,483
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,193
I'm okay.

132
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,532
Luckily, I'm not bleeding.

133
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,828
Did you get hurt?

134
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,000
You must've been surprised.

135
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,504
Excuse me.

136
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,550
You're lucky he didn't get hurt.
What if he did?

137
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,009
It's dangerous to play in the hall.

138
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:14,972
I'll take the ball.

139
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,474
- Da-On.
- Can't you let it slide?

140
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,310
Just avoid playing in the hall.

141
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,187
Here.

142
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,772
Be sure to apologize to your friend.

143
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,901
I'll see you around, Woo Tae-Gyeong.

144
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,404
Thank you.

145
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:35,409
Hey. I'm sorry.
We should've been more careful.

146
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,995
It's okay.

147
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:42,416
Gosh, our school president is so cool.
I want to get close to him.

148
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,919
I heard he does people favors
all the time. He's very generous.

149
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,754
Nobody has ever seen him get mad.

150
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,756
I should've applied
to join the student council too.

151
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,341
Hey, let's go.

152
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,177
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:56,722 --> 00:10:00,475
A friend like that could be nice.

154
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,356
Please help me.

155
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,069
I've never had friends.

156
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:17,451
So I was thinking about
doing something...

157
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:22,039
I've never done before.

158
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:28,962
But I don't know how to start.

159
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,509
That's why I came to see you.

160
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,222
What is it?

161
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,765
What?

162
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,767
No, it's nothing.

163
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:46,480
So you want to make friends?

164
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:48,899
Yes.

165
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,485
Let's see.

166
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,238
Then Tae-Gyeong,

167
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,449
do you want to join the student council?

168
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,743
"Student council"?

169
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:04,581
Ever since Mr. Kim went on leave
last year, I've been in charge of it.

170
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,834
I think you'd be a perfect fit.

171
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,586
Then will I become a member
of the student council right away?

172
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,214
Well... If the kids agree.

173
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,384
I'm sure they'll like the idea.
They're all great kids.

174
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,469
There are a total of 20 members,

175
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,097
but there are only three people
that you need to remember.

176
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,394
You know the president,
12th grader, Sin Da-On, right?

177
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,939
He's always smiling, caring,
and take good care of people.

178
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,775
That's why he's really popular.

179
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,361
- What should we do?
- Da-On, can I borrow your gym suit?

180
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,196
Oh, it's in my locker.

181
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,573
Okay, thank you.

182
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,200
If you spend time with him,
you'll end up liking him too.

183
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,911
Oh, right. I'll give you the notes
you asked for last time.

184
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,788
As expected.

185
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,207
- You're the best, Da-On.
- Hey. Want to go to the store?

186
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:50,210
Next is the head of volunteer work,
11th grader, Namgung Si-Un.

187
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:53,005
Move over. Move.

188
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,175
How dare you get in the way of
the school president?

189
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,554
Mr. President. Let's go.

190
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,348
He's really sociable and funny,
so it'll be easy to become friends.

191
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,058
- Want some ramyeon?
- Hey. Come on.

192
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,686
He knows everything that goes on
at school,

193
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,229
so he can answer all your questions.

194
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:11,815
Lastly,

195
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:15,110
there's an incredible person
who controls those two.

196
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,071
He's the vice president,
11th grader, Noh Shin-Woo.

197
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,114
"Noh Shin-Woo"?

198
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,909
We still have some time.

199
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,453
I don't think anyone is in,

200
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,663
so let's just look around
the student council room.

201
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,631
What? You...

202
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,885
Do you know each other?

203
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,268
- Hello, sir.
-  Mr. Seo.

204
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,523
Who are you with?

205
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,567
You're Woo Tae-Gyeong, right?

206
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,419
I'm against it.

207
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,968
I knew it.

208
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,387
Why did you stall to say that?

209
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,972
I was thinking it over carefully.

210
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:26,515
Are you sure you did?

211
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,434
Forget it. You know it's over
when he acts like this.

212
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,936
He's quite stubborn, you know.

213
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,729
Forget it.

214
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:35,691
We're done, right?

215
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:37,776
I'm leaving.

216
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,320
- Hold on, kids.
- What's your reason?

217
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,949
Everyone else is okay with it,

218
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,618
so why are you the only one
who is against it?

219
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:51,707
There are so many reasons that
I don't feel like saying.

220
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,418
- Do you want me to tell you everything?
- Yes.

221
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,295
Don't leave anything out.

222
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,508
- Why must I do that?
- Gosh, Shin-Woo.

223
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,386
Tae-Gyeong, are you in Grade 11?

224
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,513
Yes, I am.

225
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,724
I see. You're the same age as Shin-Woo.

226
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,392
After school, we should all...

227
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,645
Da-On, don't try to
let it go like that again.

228
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,689
There's no reason for us
to spend time with him.

229
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:20,569
You should leave now.

230
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:24,990
Tae-Gyeong.

231
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:26,658
In the student council,

232
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,995
everyone needs to agree to decide on
something, so please be understanding.

233
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,497
I'll talk with Shin-Woo.

234
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,209
Tae-Gyeong.
Do you want to wait in your classroom?

235
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,378
Namgung. Go with him.

236
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:42,257
Da-On. How can you tell him
to go to his classroom right now?

237
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:46,094
When you get rejected like this,
you should have ramyeon at the store.

238
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,431
Let's go, Tae-Gyeong.
I'll relieve you of your stress.

239
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,809
I'm not going to leave...

240
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,897
until you tell me
why you're against me joining.

241
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,567
Fine.

242
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,361
If that's what you want.

243
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:07,699
First, the period to join
the student council is over.

244
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:11,161
The official period set by the school
was a week and half ago,

245
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,497
and if you wanted to join,
you should've joined then.

246
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,749
You should've applied and joined
fair and square.

247
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,669
What? I never applied.

248
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,088
Da-On just asked me to become
the head of volunteer work.

249
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,758
What is it? Was this a secret?

250
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,011
Namgung was famous since before
he came to school.

251
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,681
He knows a lot of people
and a lot of things.

252
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,685
It's important that the student council
is well-informed.

253
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,646
In other words,
I scouted him as the president.

254
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,025
So if you think about it,
our newest member...

255
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,777
was scouted by Mr. Seo,

256
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,613
so he can join.

257
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,073
Second,

258
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,327
we're at full capacity.

259
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,080
The maximum number of members
for student council is 20.

260
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,457
If that's the issue,
I think it will be okay.

261
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,668
I saw how much difficulty
you had last year,

262
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,212
I thought of increasing the number of
members for the next semester.

263
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:05,215
That's right, Shin-Woo.

264
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,426
Why are you nitpicking at everything?

265
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,719
Are you a nitpicker?

266
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,054
Student council is not a market.

267
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,890
You want to skip process
and add new people.

268
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,392
If anyone can join,
how is it the student council?

269
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,186
"Anyone"?

270
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,817
In any case, I'm against it.

271
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,157
- I don't want him to join.
- Shin-Woo, why are you being like this?

272
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,617
Tae-Gyeong must feel uncomfortable.

273
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,411
Right. Why do you keep opposing?

274
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,247
"I'm against it."

275
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,458
"I'm a Post-it." "I'm a Fitbit."

276
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,793
- What are you doing?
- "What are you doing?"

277
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,378
- My gosh.
- Gosh. Mr. Seo.

278
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,755
Hold on, guys.

279
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:48,967
I understand what you mean.

280
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:52,262
Let's pretend this never happened.

281
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,267
Hey, hold on.

282
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,528
I don't want to join either.

283
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:16,995
I don't like people...

284
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,498
who don't like me.

285
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:35,222
(Light on Me)

286
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,850
Even though Shin-Woo talks like that,
he's not a bad kid.

287
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:40,561
- I don't care to be friends with him.
- Why don't you like him?

288
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,521
You could tell he'll be tiresome
and sensitive.

289
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,648
Shin-Woo is a good kid.
He's considerate too.

290
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,359
Life is like that. Nothing comes easy.

291
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,528
I really hate you.

292
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:06,336
(Light on Me)
