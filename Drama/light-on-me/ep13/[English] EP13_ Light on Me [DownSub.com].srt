1
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:04,879
Go and be honest with him.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,400
Tell him you did it.

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,239
Are you the one...

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,719
who sent the photo?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,439
Was it really you?

6
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,600
Yes. I did it.

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,320
Why?

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,200
If there was a rumor that
you were dating Tae-Gyeong,

9
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,679
you would stop hanging out with him,

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,159
and you can always stop rumors from
spreading if you explain it.

11
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,359
That's why I did it.

12
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,560
Da-On.

13
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,840
You know that So-Hee can be thoughtless.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,240
- This incident...
- Namgung, can you leave for bit?

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,799
I have to talk to her in private.

16
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,719
Okay. I will.

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,439
You were just being as nice to
Tae-Gyeong as you are to everyone else,

18
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,120
but he was mistaken
and started liking you.

19
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,719
I knew you couldn't reject him,

20
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,480
so I was helping you.

21
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,120
Do you really think you were helping me?

22
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,200
If it weren't for me, you would've
gone further with Tae-Gyeong.

23
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,000
That would've spread,

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,079
and I made sure it would stop
before it got worse.

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,640
- I wanted you to come to your senses.
- I can't believe you.

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,280
What?

27
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,480
I can't...

28
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,959
believe in anything you say anymore.

29
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,640
Da-On. Why are you being like this?

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,960
I was just thinking of you...

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,280
If you were thinking,
you never would've done that.

32
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,000
Why are you being like this?

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,840
It's because I really like you.

34
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,090
I was doing it for you.

35
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,879
I know you worry about rumors, so...

36
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,039
Lee So-Hee.

37
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,639
Let's never see each other again.

38
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,719
But thanks to you, I realized...

39
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,520
what a fool I've been.

40
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,719
I don't care...

41
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,080
about rumors anymore.

42
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,280
Da-On.

43
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,360
Go in.
I have to go to the teachers' lounge.

44
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,039
Okay.

45
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,319
You never want to see me again?
What do you mean by that?

46
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,879
Wait inside the student council room.

47
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,840
I'll be right back.

48
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,759
Fine.
Then I'll take out my secret weapon.

49
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,280
Ta-da.

50
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,599
The store only gets ten of them a day.
It's a limited item. Cheese sausages.

51
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,479
I managed to get them at lunch.

52
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,199
There's nothing I'm incapable of.

53
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,240
Are you pitying me right now?

54
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,480
I'm giving it to you
so that you can stop crying.

55
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,759
You keep crying these days.

56
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,120
Plus, you did something bad.

57
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,319
Let's say I'm trying
to kill you with kindness.

58
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,439
But...

59
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,050
why did you do that?

60
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,730
You care about Da-On the most.

61
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,639
I wanted to...

62
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,519
get Tae-Gyeong away from Da-On.

63
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,839
But there was no way to do that.

64
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,920
I did it because I was mad.

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,519
Remember what I said...

66
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,199
at the school store that day?

67
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,050
I told you to stop acting childish...

68
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,050
and give up on what you can't have.

69
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,120
Did you get mad because of that
and do that?

70
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,959
I shouldn't have said that to you.

72
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,240
I was being rash.

73
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,560
I know that while
your methods were wrong,

74
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,199
you still care and like Da-On.

75
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,839
And that your feelings are real.

76
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,480
Do you know how I know this?

77
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,800
Because there's nothing you don't know?

78
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,920
No.

79
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,439
It's because I know
what kind of person you are.

80
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,920
And...

81
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,439
I believe in everything you say.

82
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,680
I know how you feel,
but leave Da-On alone for now.

83
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,000
He's probably in a lot of pain
because he trusted you.

84
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,120
Oh, Da-On. Hello.

85
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,720
Hey.

86
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,560
Do you know where Tae-Gyeong is?

87
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,360
Oh, him?
He went to the school store earlier.

88
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,839
Thanks.

89
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,720
Isn't it spicy?

90
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,480
Just looking at it makes my mouth burn.

91
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,959
It's spicy,

92
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,720
but I feel better after I eat
something spicy.

93
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,319
Spiciness is a sense of pain,
so your tongue thinks it's in pain.

94
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,959
Then your brain releases endorphins
to make you feel better.

95
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,040
Isn't that interesting?

96
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,839
Yes, it is.

97
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,279
Here, drink this.

98
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:38,600
So do you feel better now?

99
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,919
No.

100
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,330
I think I'll feel better
if I have one more.

101
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,210
Tae-Gyeong.

102
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,679
Yes?

103
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,000
So...

104
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,480
Instead of doing that,

105
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,639
do you...

106
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:06,450
- want to go karaoke?
- Karaoke?

107
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,159
Yes.

108
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,279
We have study hall today.

109
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,960
We'll get penalty points if we don't go.

110
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,559
It's okay to miss one day.

111
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,799
Noh Shin-Woo wants to skip study hall?

112
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,450
Skip study hall?

113
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:29,120

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,679
(Noh Shin-Woo, Thursday, April 14, 2021)

178
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:17,600
(Shin-Woo, I'm sorry,
but are you with Tae-Gyeong right now?)

179
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,559
(Noh Shin-Woo, Thursday, April 14, 2021)

180
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,600
(How is Tae-Gyeong doing?)

181
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,559
(Woo Tae-Gyeong is fine. Don't worry.)

182
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,840
Thank goodness.

183
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,200
Being too handsome is a problem too.

184
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,159
They gave us an extra hour for free.

185
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,960
That's hard to get
with an ordinary face.

186
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
It was because
they didn't have customers.

187
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,159
- It was really empty today.
- Right?

188
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,679
We were the only ones there.

189
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,000
Hey.

190
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,279
You guys are in sync with one another.

191
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,120
Are you telling me to leave?

192
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
What?

193
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,960
Fine.

194
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,840
Dating Genius Namgung
will excuse himself now.

195
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,240
Get home safe.

196
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,200
What are you looking at?

197
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,879
Thanks for today.

198
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,200
I feel a lot better thanks to you.

199
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,919
I'm going to pass out when I get home.

200
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,200
What if you get in trouble
for skipping study hall?

201
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Your homeroom teacher is really scary.

202
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,359
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

203
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,559
I went because I wanted to.

204
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,319
You're not asking me today.

205
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:25,890
About what?

206
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,200
You always ask me
why I'm being nice to you.

207
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,650
There are things you don't
need a reason for.

208
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,559
Things...

209
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,319
that are the answer in and of itself.

210
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,759
I'm sure there's someone out there...

211
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,119
who sees you...

212
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,559
as their answer
without needing a reason.

213
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,410
So are you saying that
there's someone out there...

214
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,839
who will like me for me?

215
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,599
Yes.

216
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,920
Don't be too upset,

217
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,240
- and don't be too mad at...
- I can't hear anything!

218
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,890
Noh Shin-Woo.
Just be my friend for today.

219
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,279
Just be on my side.

220
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,519
Shin-Woo. What are you doing here?

221
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,839
You... You're that guy
in the photo with Sin Da-On.

222
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,680
By the way, what were you guys
doing here alone? Were you on a date?

223
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,839
Gosh, you're no joke.
You're very capable.

224
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,960
We're on our way home
after going to karaoke.

225
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,279
You should go.

226
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,920
I need to take Tae-Gyeong home.

227
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,079
Oh, okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

228
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,759
Okay. Goodbye.

229
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:05,359
Let's go. I'll take you home.

230
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:09,440
I thought most people
would get flustered...

231
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,599
and feel awkward
about this kind of situation.

232
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,170
Are you okay about hanging out with me?

233
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,599
I don't care about those things.

234
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:23,200
Don't worry about it and let's go.

235
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,839
Mr. Seo. You're in early.

236
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,890
Yes.

237
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,170
Are you here to clean
the teachers' lounge?

238
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,279
I came early, so I mopped the floor.

239
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,359
Then did you put this here?

240
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,559
Yes. Thank you
for the drink you got me last time.

241
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,079
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

242
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,480
Every time I see you,
you seem very warm and kind.

243
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,599
I'm not sure if that's a good thing.

244
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,839
What?

245
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,799
I think being kind...

246
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,599
only ends up hurting
the people I care about.

247
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,559
I'm not sure anymore.

248
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,799
I thought everything I did was right,

249
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,920
but now it seems like it was all wrong.

250
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,650
I don't know who I am anymore.

251
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,240
Da-On. You're just Da-On.

252
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,079
There's no need to make it complicated.

253
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,079
If you hurt someone,

254
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,799
you can apologize to them sincerely.

255
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:53,920
If you think what you did was wrong,
you can try to do better.

256
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,319
In my eyes,
you seem like a great person.

257
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,359
Thank you, sir.

258
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,079
Right. Put your head up.

259
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Yes, sir.

260
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,759
Oh, right. You're going
to feed the cat today, right?

261
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,200
Yes, I am.

262
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,519
Then let's go together.

263
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:27,319
Why? Do you like cats too?

264
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,039
Oh, I'm going to get my cellphone fixed.

265
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,480
I don't even get alerts anymore.

266
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,799
I looked it up,
and there's a repair shop near there.

267
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,759
Okay. Let's go together.

268
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,799
I have PE next period,
so I'll get going.

269
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,890
I'll see you later.

270
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,279
Sin Da-On is notorious
for playing the field.

271
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,400
Wasn't he dating Lee So-Hee?

272
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,960
They always hang out together,
so I thought they were.

273
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,480
I don't think they are.

274
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:15,880
She's just being played with too.

275
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:22,519
Oh, is that so?

276
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,240
I didn't realize
I was being played with.

277
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:34,920
When did Sin Da-On ever play the field?

278
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,599
I'm curious now.

279
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,400
It's just something I heard.

280
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,480
Talk like you did before.

281
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,559
You made it sound like you were
played by him.

282
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,400
I'm sorry, So-Hee. We were mistaken.

283
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,000
Why are you apologizing to me?

284
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,920
- What?
- You can talk about me,

285
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,519
but don't talk about Da-On.

286
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,119
He doesn't deserve to be
treated like that by the likes of you.

287
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,400
Thanks...

288
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,000
for sending me a message yesterday.

289
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:21,640
I knew you would be worried.

290
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,519
I'm sorry about yesterday.

291
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,480
I know you said it for my sake,

292
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,079
but I ignored you and left.

293
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,839
I was trying my best to hide how I felt,

294
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,480
but it felt like I was caught,
so I got flustered.

295
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,799
You were right.

296
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:47,680
I was worried about what people thought,
so I hid how I felt.

297
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:51,640
I was afraid of facing him,
so I kept avoiding him.

298
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,440
Now that I think about it,

299
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,079
everything you said was true.

300
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,359
I always thought everything
I did was right,

301
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,640
but I was wrong.

302
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,200
That's why...

303
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,799
I'm going to meet with Tae-Gyeong.

304
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,119
I'm not going to think about myself...

305
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,599
or other people.

306
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:27,079
I'm just going to think
about Woo Tae-Gyeong.

307
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,440
What if...

308
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,640
Tae-Gyeong doesn't think
about you anymore?

309
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,720
I don't care.

310
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,119
It's time for me to get back...

311
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,559
all the pain I put Tae-Gyeong through.

312
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,960
Fine.

313
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,359
That way Tae-Gyeong...

314
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,039
can forget about you completely.

315
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:06,319
He needs closure to move on.

316
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,839
Closure?

317
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,960
Regardless of what I do,

318
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,359
he'll be thinking about you.

319
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,079
I really hate...

320
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,240
things like that.

321
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,319
(Buy and Sell Old Phones,
Repair Screens)

322
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,440
Gosh, I have so many messages.

323
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,960
(Noh Shin-Woo: Where are you?
Sorry. I'm on my way.)

324
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,480
(Noh Shin-Woo, Grade 11 Class 1)

325
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,359
Why did he send me so many messages?

326
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,000
(Hey. Did you get home safely?)

327
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,799
(I have something to give you.)

328
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,720
(Thank you for helping me today.)

329
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,039
(Hey. Did you get home safely?
Are you sleeping?)

330
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,279
(Tae-Gyeong, Call)

331
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,440
(I don't hate you.)

332
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,599
(It's just because I'm a fool.)

333
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,519
(Don't get hurt.)

334
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,039
(It's raining.)

335
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,200
(Don't walk in the rain.)

336
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,079
(I have something to give you.)

337
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:10,039
(Woo Tae-Gyeong. Where are you?
Can you show up already?)

338
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,440
(Stop worrying me.)

339
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,599
(Don't cry, Tae-Gyeong.)

340
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:31,200
Woo Tae-Gyeong!

341
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,480
(During the time
I couldn't see anything...)

342
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,440
(and I was unaware,)

343
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:47,319
(Noh Shin-Woo thought about me.)

344
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,960
(He talked to me.)

345
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,119
(The messages that remained unread...)

346
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:59,559
(and his feelings
that weren't relayed...)

347
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,839
(came pouring out to me...)

348
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,359
(all at once.)

349
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,279
- Noh Shin-Woo.
- What?

350
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,119
I saw that you sent me messages.

351
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,279
A lot of them actually.

352
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,759
What if I never saw them?

353
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,680
I didn't care.

354
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,440
I just...

355
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,319
figured you'd realize eventually.

356
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,640
Then...

357
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:40,119
were you thinking about me
all this time?

358
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:43,920
Yes.

359
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,160
Yesterday,

360
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:50,000
today,

361
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,839
and probably tomorrow.

362
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,319
I will continue thinking about you.

363
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,039

365
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:32,480
(- What's the Prince of Saebit?
- It's exactly what it sounds like.)

366
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:34,839
It's tradition for someone
in the student council to do it.

367
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,359
(I'm sorry. Did you wait long?)

368
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,359
What about Tae-Gyeong?
Did you talk to him?

369
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,880
(What are you thinking about?)

370
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,440
(What is Da-On doing right now?)
