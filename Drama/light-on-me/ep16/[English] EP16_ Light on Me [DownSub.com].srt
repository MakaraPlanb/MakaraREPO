1
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,810
Let's go,

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,759
Tae-Gyeong.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,280
I was waiting for you.

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,679
Are you going to keep me waiting?

5
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,640
Let's go.

6
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,159
About Da-On...

7
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,439
He went to the student council room
to take a nap.

8
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,200
Do you think he's still there?

9
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Really?

10
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,680
Hey.

11
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,799
Hey.

12
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:59,200
You can give that to me and go.

13
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,239
Go where?

14
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,280
You know what I'm talking about.

15
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,879
Gosh, this doesn't suit you.

16
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,759
Whenever I try to do something,

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,560
I always end up ruining it.

18
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,319
I'm scared.

19
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,479
So I'm just going to stay still.

20
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,090
Hey, So-Hee.

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,479
Where did all of your confidence go?

22
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,810
Even though Da-On kept putting up
walls against you,

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,840
you always broke them down. Where did
the invincible fork crane Lee So-Hee go?

24
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,439
Just...

25
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,680
make sure you act the same.

26
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,400
Don't overdo it.

27
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,759
You tend to overdo things...

28
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,159
when you get excited.

29
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:48,639
If you get it, put down the basket.

30
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Right now.

31
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,919
Go forward like that.

32
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Go!

33
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,080
What's this? It's not a chance
that you get every day.

34
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,199
You will run to him right now. Go!

35
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,120
I like the way you think today.

36
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,039
Hey.

37
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,840
Hey.

38
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,879
Did something happen?

39
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,280
Thank you...

40
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,719
for liking me.

41
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,719
Someone told me...

42
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,959
not to say sorry,

43
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,519
but to say thank you for liking me.

44
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,519
Right.

45
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,839
That's 100 times nicer to hear.

46
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,079
I found out
what I have to do from now on...

47
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,959
thanks to him.

48
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,399
I figured out...

49
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,800
how I should treat other people too.

50
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,920
But...

51
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,319
I don't know who I am.

52
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,680
So I'm going to find out.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm going to get to know myself...

54
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,610
instead of others.

55
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,199
I'll help you.

56
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,050
You know that there's nothing
I don't know about Sin Da-On, right?

57
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,279
I bet I know more about you than you do.

58
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,079
I'll tell you everything.

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,279
Do you want to do that?

60
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,639
Yes.

61
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,319
Then...

62
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,680
can we...

63
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,040
continue seeing each other?

64
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,360
Shin-Woo. I have a question.

65
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,560
The flower you put in your ear...

66
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,279
Was that your idea?

67
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,480
Was it because I told Namgung
that it was cute?

68
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,879
No. It's not like that.

69
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,040
You always say it's not,
but I know that I'm right.

70
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,199
If you know it, then why do you ask me?

71
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,160
Do you remember?

72
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,600
The day you caught me cleaning
the student council room...

73
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,920
in secret.

74
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,319
I asked you if your ears
always turned so red,

75
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,000
and you told me that
you really hated me.

76
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,519
You're overreacting.

77
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,399
I said that I hated you.

78
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,439
That's the same thing.

79
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,240
It's completely different.

80
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,439
Your ears are really red right now.

81
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,639
You said that you had to pretend
you didn't see things like this.

82
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,399
You're the one who said it.

83
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,600
Thank you for waiting for me.

84
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,839
And for having...

85
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,959
such honest ears.

86
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,920
How do you feel now?

87
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,279
Do you still hate me?

88
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,279
Well...

89
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,879
No.

90
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,959
I really like you.

91
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,319
I want to spend more time with you.

92
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,319
I always want to see you.

93
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,720
So can I...

94
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,040
walk you home today?

95
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,040
Are you teasing me?

96
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,560
What?

97
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,240
Never mind. Let's go.
You said you wanted to walk me home.

98
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,160
What are you doing?

99
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,450
Oh, right.

100
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,639
Here.

101
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,240
What is this?

102
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:00,399
I pretty much took your keychain,

103
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,360
so I got you one that looked similar.

104
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,120
Why aren't you saying anything?

105
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
The keychain that I gave you...

106
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,240
Yes?

107
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,799
I didn't just give it to you.

108
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,120
I bought it for you on the trip.

109
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,960
You bought it for me?

110
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,960
What? You gave it to me so nonchalantly!

111
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,679
Be quiet! Do you know what time it is?

112
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,450
I had no idea.

113
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,279
Noh Shin-Woo is this sweet?

114
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,720
Hey. You've dated before, haven't you?

115
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,639
Can you stop bringing that up?

116
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,210
So what?
I've never dated anyone before either.

117
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,600
Oh, wait.

118
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,090
I guess we can't say that anymore.

119
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,039
My gosh. Can you stop it already?

120
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,960
(This is...)

121
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,279
(the story of my first love.)

122
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,120
Stop smiling.

123
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,320
Hey. How can you keep a straight face
in front of me?

124
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,320
What do you want me to do?

125
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,120
Do you want me to do this?

126
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,279
Stop it.

127
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,559
- Stop it.
- Gosh.

128
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,799
Are they dating?

129
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,080
Is that Noh Shin-Woo?

130
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,039
I guess he is gay.

131
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,679
They're incredible.

132
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,919
Everyone's looking. They're so brave.

133
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,840
I know. You're so brave.

134
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,000
How could you talk about them
in front of everyone to hear?

135
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,039
I don't understand why everyone's so
interested in other people's business.

136
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,279
Whether they're dating men or women...

137
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,799
or elephants.
What does it matter to you?

138
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,440
Stop taking interest
in other people's dating lives,

139
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,080
and live your own life. Please.

140
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,919
Gosh, Namgung.

141
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,080
Nice one.

142
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,559
I'll get going.

143
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,720
Hey. Why did you hit me?
You should've hit them.

144
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,840
Gosh, she has such a strong punch.

145
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,399
Da-On,
can you lend me your vocabulary book?

146
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,519
You're done with it, right?

147
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,639
No, not yet.

148
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,360
I was studying. Sorry.

149
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,679
Da-On. Can I borrow your gym clothes?

150
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,159
I'm sorry. I didn't bring it today.

151
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,639
Da-On. Can you clean for me today?

152
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,279
I have a date with my lovely girlfriend
after school.

153
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,200
I have plans today after school too.

154
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,279
Sorry.

155
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,440
(Administration)

156
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,559
Oh, right. Da-On.

157
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:08,240
Can I push back our tutoring session?

158
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,559
- To when?
- Whenever you're free.

159
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,720
Shin-Woo wants to hang out.

160
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,080
Okay.

161
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,240
But why are we whispering?

162
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,080
If I do this, Shin-Woo gets really
curious about what I'm talking about.

163
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:36,200
He's always teasing me,

164
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,200
so I'm getting revenge.

165
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
I see.

166
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,720
What are you talking about?

167
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,159
We're not talking about anything.

168
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,720
Stop lying.
You were just whispering to each other.

169
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,639
Oh, that? We were talking about
our tutoring session.

170
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,399
Really?

171
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,639
Yes, we were talking about tutoring.

172
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,039
Let me join.

173
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,519
- What?
- Let me join.

174
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,039
I'm in second in math.

175
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,559
How annoying.
Being in 2nd is as good as being in 1st.

176
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,759
No. Teaching Tae-Gyeong alone
is a lot of work.

177
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,600
Then you should stop tutoring him.

178
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,720
Shin-Woo. Do you know
you act really weird sometimes?

179
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,240
Then pay more attention to me.

180
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,799
My gosh.
I can't bear to watch this anymore.

181
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,639
If So-Hee was here,
she would curse you out.

182
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,639
Oh, right.

183
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:39,600
You guys didn't forget
what day today is, right?

184
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,759
- Hello.
- Hey.

185
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,360
We have to buy something to eat too.

186
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,039
And we can decorate it like this.
We can put flowers up.

187
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,240
- That's what you said!
- Good morning, guys.

188
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,720
Hello, Mr. Seo.

189
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,200
Mr. Seo.

190
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,240
Is there anything
you'd like to eat today?

191
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,679
What?

192
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,840
For example, pizza.

193
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,639
Or pizza?

194
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,200
What about pizza?

195
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,000
Mr. Seo. What kind of cake do you like?

196
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,039
Cake?

197
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,519
What...

198
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,559
is your favorite color for a party hat?

199
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,240
Why... Why do you ask?

200
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,960
Oh, I'm just curious.

201
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,360
Well...

202
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,360
I like blue.

203
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,679
I see. Blue?

204
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,519
Thank you.

205
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:27,519
Mr. Seo. You're a picky eater.

206
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,480
What?

207
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,039
Tae-Gyeong is a really picky eater too.

208
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,559
Is that so?

209
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,840
I guess picky eaters are still picky
when they become adults.

210
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,919
Oh.

211
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,600
Tae-Gyeong. You haven't gone home yet?

212
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,679
Oh, right. Well...

213
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,559
I'm worried about something.

214
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,799
Worried?

215
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,039
Mr. Seo.

216
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,170
I'm sure you figured it out already,

217
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,960
but you have to act like
you're surprised,

218
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,480
so they won't get mad.

219
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:23,039
Act? Why?

220
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,519
What?

221
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,759
Stop stalling and talk to me,
Tae-Gyeong.

222
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,279
What's your worry?

223
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,119
Is it serious?

224
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,759
What's been bothering you
that you couldn't even go home?

225
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:37,240
It's a little strange to talk
in the middle of the hallway,

226
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,279
so should we go into
the student council room?

227
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,559
- Oh, well...
- Right. That's for the best.

228
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,279
Nobody would be in there right.

229
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,200
- Stop scribbling so much!
- What do you mean?

230
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,680
Do you want to die?

231
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,599
You're the one who wanted to do it.

232
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,279
I told you that I've never lost
in a game of rock-paper-scissors.

233
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,319
- You little...
- Use your words!

234
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,960
Guys, what is all of this...

235
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,410
(Happy birthday)

236
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,839

(Seo Haet-Bit)

238
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,680
Mr. Seo. Happy birthday.

239
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,359
One, two.

240
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,440

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,279
Mr. Seo. Blow out the candles.

245
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,839
Hold on.

246
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,039
You need to make a wish.

247
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,410
Oh, right.

248
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:13,799
Thank you. I'm so touched.

249
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,890
We're more grateful.

250
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,559
You took good care of everyone
in the student council.

251
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:22,720
Thanks to you,
I joined the student council,

252
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:25,519
and I made some great friends,

253
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,890
and my school life is a lot more fun.

254
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,890
I will never forget the warm words...

255
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,410
you've said to me.

256
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,720
Of course.

257
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,960
I will remember you until the day I die.

258
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,359
I can never forget you.

259
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,440
Me too.

260
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,519
I remember everything about you guys.

261
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,960
You don't know how happy I am to see
you all get along.

262
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,960
But did you really have no idea
we were throwing you a surprise party?

263
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,680
Yes. I had no idea.

264
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,839
My gosh, Mr. Seo.

265
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,170
You're so innocent.
What are we going to do with you?

266
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,440
I know. He's so different from you.

267
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,599
So-Hee. Just be patient with him.

268
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,410
I'm only listening to him
because he's Sin Da-On.

269
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,759
I told you to stop saying things
like that. I won't let it go now.

270
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,200
That's true. Da-On isn't the same person
he used to be.

271
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,599
Be quiet.

272
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,680
Why are you so mean to me?

273
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:33,890
Oh, right. Mr. Seo.
Let's all take a photo together.

274
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,759
When I graduate next year, I'm going
to miss our student council.

275
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,440
I want to take a lot of pictures.

276
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,000
I even brought a camera.

277
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,079
Then we should give him his present now.

278
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,039
A present?

279
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:54,599
This is a gift we all prepared for you.

What do you think, Mr. Seo?
Do you like it?

282
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:20,759
I love it. Thank you, guys.

283
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,650
Put it on for our photo.

284
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:24,920
Should I?

285
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,680
Namgung wrote this.

286
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,920
Really? Si-Un, it's really nice.

287
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,039
Designed by Namgung.
This is my second piece.

288
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,319
Every man has his trade.

289
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,650
You're right.
I think you did a good job this time.

290
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,240
"This time"?

291
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,359
Then was the one last one bad?

How nice.

My goodness.

00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,920
"Hello. Do you have fireworks here?"

312
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,440
I asked. He gave me these.

313
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,880
I paid. The end.

314
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,359
Gosh, these aren't working.

315
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,960
Darn it. Are you kidding me?

316
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:09,720
Why must we all suffer because of you?

317
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:12,559
Is it my fault?
I went with Tae-Gyeong to get them.

318
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,119
Is it all my fault again?

319
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:21,480
Namgung did what Namgung always does.

320
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,640
He always blames other people.

321
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,160
Gosh, I know.

322
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,559
Okay.

323
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,039

- Do you want to do that?
- Good luck.

Keep acting like that!

327
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,400
Does he think he can get them to work?

328
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,960
Can we just leave him like this?

329
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:51,440
Let him be.
He'll come in when he gets tired.

330
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,799
He's really stubborn sometimes.

331
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,759
We're going inside.

332
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,200

- Gosh.

333

- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

(We're still sharing in...)

340
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,079
(each other's moments.)

341
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,960
Excuse me, guys.

342
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,160
Don't you have something to say to me?

343
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,559
Aren't you cold?

344
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,480
You should've put on a cardigan.

345
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,319
It's still cold at night.

346
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,400
It's really cold.

347
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,519
I'm going to freeze to death.

348
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:17,039
I'm not cold anymore.

349
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,960
(Shin-Woo's ears still get really red.)

350
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,519
Your ears are red again.

351
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:05,279
They're red because I'm cold.

352
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,240
What are you talking about? It's summer.

353
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,799
You said you were cold too.

354
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:14,319
(I still...)

355
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,799
(have no intention of letting it go.)

356
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,000
Hey, you guys.

357
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,279
Gosh, my eyes!

358
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,480
But I'm jealous.

359
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,599
Me too. Give me a kiss too.

360
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,960
You guys look good together.

361
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,079
But everyone else here is single.

362
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,799
We're getting jealous, so stop.

363
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,680
I know. You're in front of other people,

364
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,440
but you're filming a drama together.

365
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,440
Let's let it go this one time.

366
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:48,960
Let's forgive them.

367
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,960
(But we are all...)

368
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,279
(definitely in love.)

369
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,279
I can't let it go anymore. I'm going in.

370
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,839
Me too. Wait for me.

371
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,160
- Want to go in and have some barbecue?
- Barbecue?

372
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,720
(With the moments we remember...)

373
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,079
(as they are.)

374
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:34,920
=Light on Me=

375
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,559
Hold on, guys.

376
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,079
Cut. Let's go again.

377
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,519
Let's go again.

378
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,440
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Let's go again.

379
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
Let's go again.

380
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,559
One more time.

381
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,960
You...

382
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,359
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

383
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,039
I will remember you until the day I die.

384
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,200
I'm sorry.

385
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,400
This is the last time. Let's go.

386
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,160
Are you up?

387
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,160
I have to say,
"When did I fall asleep?" first.

388
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,359
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

389
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,279
Cut. Let's go again.

390
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,440
Why are you being like this?

391
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,440
There's a fly in the back.

392
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,640
Hey, you!

393
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,880
Oh, wow.

394
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,359
Your characters are all so clear.

395
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,519
This is hilarious.

396
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,400
Everyone is saying the same thing.

397
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,680
What are you doing?

398
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,519
No!

399
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,640
I won't let you take it
from me three times.

400
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,160
Cut.

401
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,079
- What is this?
- I'm sorry.

402
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,279
(Lee Ki-Hyun as Seo Haet-Bit)

403
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,319
