1
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,679
Don't be...

2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,759
too mad at Da-On.

3
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:18,559
Don't get hurt either.

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,359
It's because it's the first time...

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,079
he's being honest.

6
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,280
When I...

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,479
was in middle school,

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,479
there was a kid I liked.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,039
I told my friends,

10
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,719
and they all thought it was weird.

11
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,039
It was a boy.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,240
That's when I realized...

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,079
"I see."

14
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,719
"This is something
I shouldn't tell people."

15
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,439
"I can't be honest about this."

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,120
The feelings that I felt back then...

17
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,560
are probably what Da-On is feeling now.

18
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,480
He's afraid of people
being disappointed in him,

19
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,599
so it'll be harder for him to be honest.

20
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,439
His heart probably closed off,

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,079
so it'll take a lot of courage
to open up again.

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,120
But this is from the perspective
of Sin Da-On's friend.

23
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,959
From the perspective of
Woo Tae-Gyeong's friend,

24
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,359
he's just a selfish jerk.

25
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,280
You can hate him all you want.

26
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,560
Until you're okay.

27
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,400
Do you...

28
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,319
want me to curse Sin Da-On out?

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,879
No.

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,000
But...

31
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,719
are you my friend?

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,240
Then what did you think I was?

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,530
No, it's not that...

34
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,680
It's just a bit weird hearing you
call yourself...

35
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,960
Woo Tae-Gyeong's friend.

36
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,080
Forget it.

37
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,319
There's no need to nitpick now.

38
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,080
You said that once
you close off your heart,

39
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,240
it takes a lot of courage
to open up again.

40
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,080
Then...

41
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,120
did you open up again?

42
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,560
He's a lot neater than I thought.

43
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,319
Wait.

44
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,680
This...

45
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,360
What are you doing? Come out and eat.

46
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,120
Did you buy this?

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,120
I bought it for myself.

48
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,800
I liked it.

49
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,199
Is that so?

50
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,120
Why?

51
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,560
Do you like it?

52
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,050
Yes. It's cute.

53
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,240
You can have it then.

54
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,480
What?

55
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,170
You...

56
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,610
can have it.

57
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,610
Hurry up. The noodles will get soggy.

58
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,879
Hey.

59
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,519
So...

60
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,120
About what you saw outside...

61
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:23,319
Oh, right. Okay. I won't tell anyone.

62
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,879
I'll keep the fact that you cried
a secret and take it to my grave...

63
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,519
Hey. It's not a secret. You said
you'd pretend you didn't see anything.

64
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,759
Did I ever cry?

65
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,000
Right.

66
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,079
That's right.

67
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,920
I didn't see anything.

68
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,720
Did something happen outside?

69
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,800
I don't remember anything.

70
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,639
Thank you, Shin-Woo.

71
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,600
What are you thankful for?

72
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,800
Stop talking and eat.

73
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,839
I'm serious.

74
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,839
If it wasn't for you, I would've
collapsed on the street from crying.

75
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,879
You're exaggerating.

76
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,439
I'm not.

77
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,399
Think about it.

78
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,680
What if...

79
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,639
I collapsed on the street after crying
and died at 18?

80
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,079
Okay. Hurry up and eat your ramyeon.

81
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,720
What about your parents?

82
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,839
Aren't they coming home?

83
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,680
No. They went to see my grandma.

84
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,399
Then can I sleep over?

85
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,680
What?

86
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,199
Why?

87
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,839
I mean, it's late,

88
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,399
and the buses aren't running anymore.

89
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,360
I've never slept over a friend's house.

90
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,839
It's the first time I ever visited
a friend's house.

91
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,600
I've always wanted to try it.

92
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,800
In dramas,

93
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,519
kids sleep over at their friend's house
and hang out.

94
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,439
Oh, I'm sorry.

95
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,800
Does that make you uncomfortable?

96
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,120
I'll just take a cab home then.

97
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
No.

98
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,240
You can sleep over.

99
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:32,959
Okay.

100
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,800
This is going to be fun.

101
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,079
It's been so long since
I watched a movie.

102
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,839
Why? Don't you like movies?

103
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,639
Yes, I do.

104
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,160
What kind of genre do you like?

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let's see. I like...

106
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,399
Let's say our favorite genre
at the count of three.

107
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,040
Okay.

108
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,680
Let me think about it.

109
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,399
The first thing that comes to mind
is the genre you really like.

110
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,839
Okay, ready?

111
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,360
One, two, three.

112
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,399
Romance.

113
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,439
What is this?
Why didn't you say anything?

114
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,879
I'm sorry. I wanted to tease you.

115
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,450
Gosh, Noh Shin-Woo.

116
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,519
You like romance movies?

117
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,960
I thought you'd like thrillers.

118
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,600
That's prejudice.

119
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:58,720
What about you? What genre do you like?

120
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,679
I like romance too.

121
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:06,960
I guess we have something in common.

122
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,639
What's wrong?

123
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,600
Something just popped into my mind.

124
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,639
Looking for things you have in common...

125
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,039
and getting to know each other...

126
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,799
all while having fun...

127
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,090
is a part of becoming friends.

128
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,039
Da-On was the one to tell me that.

129
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,210
Sitting here like this with you...

130
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,919
reminded me of that day.

131
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,919
Thank you...

132
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,360
for being my friend.

133
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,679
I want to thank you too,

134
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,919
Tae-Gyeong.

135
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,480
Let's watch the movie now.

136
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,159
I didn't get to watch any of it.

137
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,919
Let's play it from the beginning again.

138
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,440
Then there's nothing going on?

139
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,960
Right. He's just nice to Tae-Gyeong
because they're friends.

140
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,919
I took that photo because...

141
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,279
they looked close and it was cute.

142
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,120
But since Da-On is so popular, people
got jealous and spread strange rumors.

143
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,000
Why isn't Da-On defending himself?

144
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,120
He can just tell the truth
and get it over with.

145
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,919
Is there a reason to defend himself?

146
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,159
It's such a ridiculous rumor.

147
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,320
Makes sense. It would be funny to defend
yourself over something like this.

148
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,679
I still have my doubts.

149
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,039
Weren't they holding hands
in the student council room last time?

150
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,159
That's...

151
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,759
because they're really close.

152
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,919
Lee So-Hee.

153
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,480
What are you doing here?

154
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,639
I was explaining what happened
to everyone.

155
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,480
Since you're not saying anything,
everyone is curious about it.

156
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,039
Right. Can you tell us what happened?

157
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,799
That's enough.

158
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,639
I don't know
why you find it so interesting,

159
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,320
but stop talking about it now.

160
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,080
It's because
you're not saying anything, so...

161
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,240
Okay, Da-On.

162
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,120
I get what you're saying.
I'm really sorry.

163
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:55,200
Don't worry about kids like that.

164
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,279
They just enjoy talking about
baseless rumors.

165
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,519
- So-Hee.
- Yes?

166
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,480
Don't do this ever again.

167
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,559
It's just...

168
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,159
I was just being considerate...

169
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,279
I'm grateful that you were being
considerate of me,

170
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,919
but you're only making
the rumors spread faster.

171
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,240
Break time will be over soon.
You should go.

172
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,879
Woo Tae-Gyeong!

173
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,799
Can you...

174
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,919
play this game for me?

175
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,720
Please?

176
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,799
Why?

177
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,759
I don't want to.

178
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:00,159
Can you play just one round for me?

179
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,600
They're having an event today,
so I need to keep playing,

180
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,080
but if I don't memorize these words,
my teacher will get mad.

181
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,679
Here. Can you play for me?

182
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,200
I don't know how to play.

183
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,519
Oh, right. Exactly. Just like that.

184
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,159
That's good.
Go into this area and shoot.

185
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,320
Right. Start shooting.

186
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,799
- Right. Like that.
- How do you do this?

187
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,639
Hold on.

188
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,960
You can't shoot like that.

189
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,360
You should've told me soon.

190
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,600
Oh, no!

191
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,039
I told you I was bad at playing games.

(Noh Shin-Woo)

196
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,600
I did a good job, right?

197
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,279
Stop goofing off and study.

198
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,639
(Study Hall)

199
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,720
Excuse me, sir.

200
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,159
Sir?

201
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:52,440
Hey, Da-On. Are you done?

202
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,440
Yes.

203
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,600
Hey, Da-On!

204
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,720
Namgung. Be quiet.

205
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,120
Yes, sir.

206
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,119
Okay. Good job.

207
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,170
- You can go.
- Okay.

208
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,039
What is it?

209
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,410
Oh, right.

210
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,200
Well...

211
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:05,319
May I use the restroom?

212
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,279
Why are you asking for permission?

213
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,920
You can just go.

214
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,559
Are you in kindergarten?

215
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,480
I'm sorry.

216
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,960
Da-On.

217
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:41,599
Hey, Shin-Woo.

218
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,240
Why do you keep avoiding him?

219
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,119
Did I do that?

220
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,440
I'm sorry.

221
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,440
Exams are right around the corner,

222
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,319
and I have a lot going on these days.

223
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,440
Thank you for what you did earlier.

224
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,839
Take good care of Tae-Gyeong, Shin-Woo.

225
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,480
Isn't it only right for you to
get jealous and treat him better...

226
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,170
when you see us together?

227
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,079
We both like Tae-Gyeong.

228
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,119
You always get pushed around
with other things,

229
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,960
so you don't take care of yourself.

230
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,759
Isn't it hard to worry about
what people think,

231
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,890
hide your feelings, and avoid...

232
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,240
the person you like?

233
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:41,799
Tae-Gyeong spent the entire day
looking for you.

234
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,240
He hoped he might bump into you.

235
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,960
He was wondering whether or not you ate,

236
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,720
so he barely ate himself.

237
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,410
But what did you do?

238
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,599
All you did was avoid him.

239
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,039
Have you ever thought...

240
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,200
you were being selfish?

241
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,119
- Noh Shin-Woo.
- You're why he joined the council,

242
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,920
and he adjusted well because of you.

243
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,319
That's why he followed and liked you.

244
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,440
It's not like he had a one-sided crush.

245
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,890
You feel the same way about him.

246
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,319
Am I wrong?

247
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,799
Is it because...

248
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,079
of the rumors?

249
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,240
- It's not like that.
- If it's not like that,

250
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,799
I'd like you to meet with him.

251
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,319
Meet him and talk to him, so that...

252
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,720
Shin-Woo.

253
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,359
I'll take care of it myself.

254
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,279
Thank you for worrying about it.

255
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,079
I like you.

256
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,440
Namgung. You haven't left yet?

257
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,079
Yes. I was on my way home,
but I came back.

258
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,519
I wanted to see you.

259
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,759
I didn't get to see you all day.

260
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:46,890
Da-On.

261
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,599
Anyone who truly cares about you...

262
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,240
will like and respect you...

263
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,400
regardless of who you are.

264
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,519
If that's not the case,

265
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,960
just cut them out. You have me.

266
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,240
Thank you, Namgung.

267
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,279
I hate seeing the people I like suffer.

268
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,799
Everyone in the student council
is important to me.

269
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,759
But...

270
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,279
among all of them,

271
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,279
you're my favorite.

272
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,599
It's because you're the most handsome.

273
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,559
I'm always on your side.
Keep that in mind.

274
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,759
If you don't, I'll be upset.

275
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:43,839
Bye.

276
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,880
(Tae-Gyeong's Tutoring Notes)

277
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,440
- Lee So-Hee.
- Yes?

278
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,920
Hey, Lee So-Hee.

279
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,839
What is it?

280
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:45,200
I know that you did it. The photograph.

281
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,319
It wasn't me.

282
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,640
Really?

283
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,039
Are you sure it wasn't you?

284
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,880
Don't tell Da-On.

285
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:06,319
Why would I tell him?

286
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,079
You should tell him yourself.

287
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,039
Go and be honest with him.

288
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,960
Tell him you did it.

289
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,160
Da-On.

290
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,759
I have an urgent request.

291
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,960
I'm sorry.
I have something important to do.

292
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,839
- What?
- It's really important.

293
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,160
Something I can't push back.

294
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,960
Oh, okay.

295
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,640
Tae-Gyeong.

296
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,839
Here.

297
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,960
What is this?

298
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,279
You have midterms coming.

299
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,960
And?

300
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,319
Do you have anything else to say?

301
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,359
I haven't been able to tutor you lately.

302
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,599
I wrote down all the things that
you got confused and left some memos.

303
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,880
Look at them and study.

304
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,440
That's not what's important here.

305
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,519
You kept avoiding me all this time,

306
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,400
and is that all you have to say to me?

307
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,599
Is that all you have to say?

308
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,119
No. It's not that, Tae-Gyeong.

309
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,319
You can take this with you.

310
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,319
I don't need it.

311
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,440
Go after him.

312
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,839
Hurry up and go after him.

313
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,960
Or...

314
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:52,000
I will.

315
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,160
Fine.

316
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,759
Go stay by Tae-Gyeong's side.

317
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,880
Da-On.

318
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,480
Please do that for me, Shin-Woo.

319
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,640
If I go now,

320
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,680
I won't give up on him for you.

321
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,880
Should I still go?

322
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,079
Sin Da-On!

323
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,319
Let's talk.

324
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:21,000
This is serious.

325
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,480
Jung-Woo. What's wrong?

326
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,319
My girlfriend told me
not to say anything.

327
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,680
The photo of you holding hands
with Woo Tae-Gyeong.

328
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,359
Well...

329
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:55,000
- To be honest...
- I know. I heard.

330
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,440
Your girlfriend took the photo.

331
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,559
It's not that.

332
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:02,680
The person who sent that photo
to the group chat...

333
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,559
was Lee So-Hee.

335

(- Did you do it?
- I was just thinking of you...)

336
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:26,000
(I can't trust anything
you say anymore.)

337
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,680
(Tae-Gyeong, do you want to go karaoke?)

338
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,759
(I've never seen Shin-Woo
act like that before.)

339
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:32,599
Shin-Woo. Just be my friend.
Take my side.

340
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,039
(Regardless of what I do,
he'll be thinking about you.)
