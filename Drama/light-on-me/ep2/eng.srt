1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,586
Tae-Gyeong. Tae-Gyeong, hold on.

2
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:07,382
Are you upset?

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:08,967
Yes.

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,346
I'm sorry. I should've discussed this
with the kids first.

5
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,931
I was too eager.

6
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,892
Even though Shin-Woo talks like that,
he's not a bad kid.

7
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,769
He's a good kid
once you get to know him.

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,522
I don't care to be friends with him.

9
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,193
I've never even had a friend before,
so how can I join the student council?

10
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,530
I'll just pretend this never happened.

11
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,407
Thank you for worrying about me.

12
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,703
Tae-Gyeong. You told me...

13
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,164
that you wanted to change.

14
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,918
You've already changed.

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,215
The person you were would never
have come up to me.

16
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,179
I was really moved
because you came to me.

17
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,017
So since you've changed,

18
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,728
shouldn't you try at least once?

19
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,274
I still have no idea...

20
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:11,446
what I was thinking at the time.

21
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:17,494
Why did I decide to become...

22
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,830
a different person overnight?

23
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,795
If you don't want to,
there's nothing I can do.

24
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,130
I'm sorry for bringing it up.

25
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,965
- Let's just pretend this...
- I'll do it.

26
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,677
I'll make an effort.

27
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,972
Okay. Just once. Let's try one time.

28
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,850
I'll support the new Tae-Gyeong too.

29
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,899
Maybe it's because...

30
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,818
someone gave me a hand...

31
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,072
for the first time.

32
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,742
(Administration)

33
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,535
My gosh.

34
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,913
It's cleaner than my room.

35
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,886
We must have a snail bride
in the student council room.

36
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,099
Are you going to leave him be?

37
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,394
What are you talking about?

38
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:29,650
He's making an effort.
Are you really not going to accept him?

39
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,320
Who told him to make an effort?

40
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,239
Why did he do something
we didn't ask for?

41
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,202
Wouldn't it be nice to have a member who
is as honest and eloquent as Tae-Gyeong?

42
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:44,790
Based on this,
he's neat and diligent too.

43
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,001
What are you talking about? You could
tell he'll be tiresome and sensitive.

44
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,712
Gosh,
he can't be as bad as Noh Shin-Woo.

45
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,005
Gosh.

46
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,802
In any case, I have no intention
on changing my mind.

47
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,723
Why do you hate him so much?

48
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,268
- Did something happen between you?
- Is that it?

49
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,322
No. I just don't like him.

50
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,993
Your default is apathy. But...

51
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,662
the fact that you hate him
for no reason...

52
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,999
Do you need a reason for hating someone?

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,840
Be honest. You feel bad, right?

54
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,177
You shouldn't have said
you hated him so much.

55
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,055
You regret it, and it bothers you,
right?

56
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,850
- No.
- Gosh.

57
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,186
We can hear you rolling your eyes.

58
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,646
You feel bad, right?

59
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,316
Why should I feel bad?
He said he doesn't like me either.

60
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,442
Oh, I see.

61
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,154
So you don't like him
because he doesn't like you?

62
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,823
Goodness. Were your feelings hurt?

63
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,491
What are you talking about? Gosh.

64
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,995
Where are you going?

65
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,538
I'm going to the bathroom.

66
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:25,015
The appearance of a snail bride
in the peaceful student council room.

67
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,522
This will be fun.

68
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,865
I should at least do this.

69
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,117
Let's make an effort.

70
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,920
Gosh, I'm so tired.

71
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,173
Maybe it's because I don't exercise,

72
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,883
but my whole body hurts.

73
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,178
Oh, Da-On.

74
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,763
You're here early.

75
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,266
Yes, but why are you here?

76
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,978
Oh, I'm here to help you clean.

77
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,189
You don't need to.

78
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,400
It's hard to do it alone.

79
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,986
You looked really tired just now.

80
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,446
So you saw everything?

81
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,242
Sit and take a break for a bit.
Let's clean up together.

82
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,995
Where did you get that?

83
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:31,123
I got this from the bathroom.

84
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,499
Okay.

85
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,460
If you're not still resting
when I get back, you'll be in trouble.

86
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,588
Okay.

87
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,506
I'll be right back.

88
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,184
Staying like this is more uncomfortable.

89
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,277
I was taking a break.

90
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,969
Haven't you read the fairy tale
"Snail Bride"?

91
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,430
"Snail Bride"?

92
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,811
The snail bride runs away
when it gets caught.

93
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,358
So?

94
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,780
Leave because I caught you.

95
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,074
I'm not leaving.

96
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:52,120
This is the student council room.
You're not a member.

97
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,122
- You're unauthorized...
- Do you...

98
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,001
not have any feelings?

99
00:06:58,961 --> 00:06:59,962
What?

100
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,843
I came here early in the morning
to sweep, wipe, and mop.

101
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,262
Last night,
I fell asleep while looking up...

102
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,138
machines that squeeze mops.

103
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,476
I really felt like I became
a snail bride these past few days,

104
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,229
but don't you feel like...

105
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,398
you might like me...

106
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,900
or come to like me?

107
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,318
No.

108
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,988
So don't bother wasting your time.

109
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,031
There's no way...

110
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,284
I will end up liking you.

111
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,955
Do you have anything left to say?

112
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,419
Are you protesting?

113
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,755
No. It's not that.

114
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,677
The thing is... I can see...

115
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:51,930
a spider in your hair.

116
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,025
Gosh, it wasn't a spider.
It was a piece of dust.

117
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,575
What? Why are you laughing?

118
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,035
It's funny.

119
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,456
By the way,

120
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,712
do your ears get red easily?

121
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,757
You...

122
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,258
What?

123
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,345
I really hate you.

124
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,815
My gosh, that jerk.

125
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,985
I'm getting mad
because he keeps saying he hates me.

126
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:04,253
I was wondering who was making
Shin-Woo's ears so red. It was you.

127
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,504
What?

128
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,005
It's been a while since I saw that.

129
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,260
I can't believe you managed to awaken
that monster. This is a big deal.

130
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,347
- What do you mean?
- What?

131
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,725
Gosh, no. It's a good thing.

132
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,352
A good thing?

133
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,480
You know that good things
come at a cost, right?

134
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:27,192
Hey, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

135
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,862
You woke up the monster,

136
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,906
so you must put it back to sleep.

137
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,956
(Administration)

138
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:44,418
Then is he a new hired hand? No.

139
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,295
Our new member?

140
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,213
He's not an official member yet.

141
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,550
We reflected Shin-Woo's opinion, and
he'll be a temporary member for a month.

142
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:54,511
- Let's applaud Shin-Woo.
- Don't you dare.

143
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,732
How well you clean for a month will
decide on whether or not you'll join.

144
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,943
Don't meddle and help him clean.

145
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,613
Okay. Don't worry.

146
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,700
- You have to do it alone.
- I get it.

147
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,370
What changed your mind?

148
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,039
You seemed like you'd never allow it.

149
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,045
The student council room
is really dirty.

150
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,838
You should be cleaner.

151
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,883
Gosh. Okay. Fine.

152
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,553
- Are you going to keep joking around?
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Vice President.

153
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,096
Goodness.

154
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:41,141
Woo Tae-Gyeong. Let's get along.

155
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,851
We do a lot in student council,

156
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,187
so we'll get close quickly while
working on it together.

157
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,689
If this place is ever messy,
it'll be over.

158
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,441
We won't go easy on you.

159
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,276
I get it.

160
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,196
Shin-Woo. That's enough.
Stop picking on him on his first day.

161
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:56,740
Right. Didn't he clean this morning too?

162
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,118
Gosh.

163
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,829
You can eat off this table.

164
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,751
On my way in,
I saw that the recycling bin was full.

165
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,128
I'll go throw it out.

166
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,756
Why? Do you not want to do it?

167
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,358
My gosh. Thank you so much
for letting me be a temporary member.

168
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,618
Let's see.

169
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,371
It's okay.

170
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,248
I can do it alone.

171
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,209
This is really heavy.

172
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:50,669
Let's go.

173
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:01,096
(Saebit Boys High School)

174
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:06,685
It'll be hard to do everything alone.
Let's do it together.

175
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,230
Thank you.

176
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,317
There's no need to thank me.

177
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,111
You can be comfortable around me.
You're our member.

178
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:20,449
I'm not an official member.

179
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,703
You'll be a member soon,
and we'll spend more time together.

180
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:26,872
Okay.

181
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:33,086
Oh, right. Did you volunteer at
Saebit Center last year?

182
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,922
Yes.

183
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,258
I knew it. I went there too.

184
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,595
I thought you familiar,
and I was thinking about it...

185
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:42,930
when I remembered.

186
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:48,060
Didn't you read picture books
for Ant Class?

187
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,230
Yes, I did. How interesting.

188
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,358
You're the first person
who remembered me.

189
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,904
I have really good memory.

190
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,284
In any case,
if you ever need help, just call me.

191
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,582
Thank you.

192
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,709
Also,
you may be a temporary member for now,

193
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:16,296
but you'll be a real member soon,
so don't worry about it.

194
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:22,469
I'm not sure. Someone really hates me.

195
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:26,181
Shin-Woo is a good kid.
He's kind and considerate too.

196
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,977
Everyone looks nice to nice people,

197
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,563
and they understand
why they behave that way.

198
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,358
That's why I won't believe you.

199
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,695
Am I nice?

200
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:44,908
Yes. Based on what I've seen so far.

201
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,077
Gosh, I'm so touched.

202
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,664
But Shin-Woo is nicer than me.

203
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:53,083
I'm not sure about that.

204
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:58,881
Right. You won't know each other
until you get close.

205
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,632
You should use this chance to get close.

206
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,760
Okay. I'll try.

207
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:07,681
Oh, right.
You can't get closer to him than me.

208
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:15,647
I should get going.

209
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,566
I'll see you again.

210
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,196
Yes. I'm on my way.

211
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,615
I'll be there soon. Okay.

212
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,284
He keeps saying "we".

213
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,414
But he has really good memory.

214
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,750
How did he remember that?

215
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:36,793
What?

216
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,798
What? How long were you in there?

217
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,510
No. Why are you there?

218
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,554
My specialty is sleeping unseen.

219
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,473
During class,
I sleep behind the lockers,

220
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:52,100
During gym class, I pretend to get water
and sleep in the lounge.

221
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:55,604
- I see.
- Why do you look so depressed?

222
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,022
Is life hard?

223
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,732
A bit.

224
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,280
That's true.

225
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:08,283
Life is like that. Nothing comes easy.

226
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,078
But you don't need to worry.

227
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,539
Why? Because you have me.

228
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,958
Okay. Ask me anything.

229
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:23,674
What does Noh Shin-Woo like?

230
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,260
Oh, right.

231
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:30,264
Unfortunately, he doesn't like anything.

232
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,641
He's hopeless.

233
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,560
But...

234
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,437
one thing is for certain.

235
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:42,359
Noh Shin-Woo is bothered by you.

236
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,029
It's a good thing.

237
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,242
Just trust me. I know everything.

238
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:55,789
My gosh.

239
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:58,166
We were just talking about you.
Want to join?

240
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,003
What? What are you doing?

241
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,629
- Let's go?
- Where?

242
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:04,089
Just follow me.

243
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,049
Let's take our temporary member with us.

244
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,467
We could become close.

245
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,303
Why bother getting close?

246
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:13,432
He's not even a real member.
There's no point.

247
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,642
He's going to leave soon anyway.

248
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,519
You're such a heartless man.

249
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,398
Hey. Tae-Gyeong. I'll see you later.

250
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,108
You can ask me questions later.

251
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,860
You know that I know...

252
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,446
everything.

253
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:34,119
Gosh. He has such a bad personality,
and he's immature too.

254
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,668
Oh, my.

255
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,674
Have you seen Sin Da-On?

256
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,804
Why aren't you answering me?

257
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,723
Can't you hear me?

258
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:59,311
Right. I didn't see him.

259
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,855
He's not even answering my calls.
Where is he?

260
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:03,690
Hey.

261
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,028
This is an all-boys school.

262
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,032
So what?

263
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,910
What? Well...

264
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,038
Aren't girls not allowed to be at
an all-boys school?

265
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,251
Why not? Don't you know me?

266
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:26,004
I don't.

267
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,807
I come here every day.

268
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,185
You should be able to tell by looking
at the things in here, so why don't you?

269
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,312
Aren't you a member?

270
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,908
You said you didn't see him.

271
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,493
What?

272
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,790
Why do I smell Sin Da-On's cologne
on you?

273
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,268
(Light on Me)

274
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,354
Our president is good at everything,
but he can't refuse.

275
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,773
I asked why you hate me so much.

276
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,400
It bothers me and gets on my nerves.

277
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,777
My gosh, you're so annoying.

278
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,987
Noh Shin-Woo?

279
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,655
Where are you going?

280
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:36,450
Wake up, Woo Tae-Gyeong. Woo Tae-Gyeong!

281
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:52,174
(Light on Me)
