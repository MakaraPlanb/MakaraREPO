1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,629
- Da-On!
- Da-On! Let's go.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,589
- Da-On.
- Let's go to the store.

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,382
- Da-On.
- Da-On.

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,968
Da-On! Da-on!

5
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,388
Su-Jin likes someone else!

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,229
Su-Jin does?

7
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,440
I'm going to die. I'm serious.

8
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,527
- Darn it!
- Hey. Jae-Min!

9
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:31,406
Our president is good at everything,
but he can't refuse.

10
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:35,244
He does favors for everyone,
and he's okay when people act like that.

11
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,246
And as for Su-Jin...

12
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,456
She likes me.

13
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,793
I know everything.

14
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,259
(Administration)

15
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,681
Don't worry. I'll look into it.

16
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,891
Why am I like this?

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,270
Thank you, Da-On. You're the best.

18
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,897
Oh, right. Can you tell me your number?

19
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,148
Oh, right.

20
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,194
Here. Call me.

21
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,113
Okay. Thank you.

22
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:13,866
Hey.

23
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,578
Yes.
I'm here to watch you be a pushover.

24
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,079
Why would you call him a pushover?

25
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,707
You shouldn't talk to him like that.

26
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,166
What are you saying? Are you crazy?

27
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,462
Oh, my. You should watch your mouth in
front of our innocent temporary member.

28
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,755
"Temporary member"?

29
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,592
A temporary member joined
our student council.

30
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,552
He's Woo Tae-Gyeong,
and he's in Grade 11.

31
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,763
We've met before.

32
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,517
Hi. It's been three years
since I liked Sin Da-On.

33
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,768
My name is Lee So-Hee.

34
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,813
Tae-Gyeong.

35
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,108
She's the vice president of
Saebit Girls High School, Lee So-Hee.

36
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,278
She comes here often to run errands.
You'll keep seeing her around.

37
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,697
You mean she uses errands
as an excuse to come see you.

38
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,658
Of course. That's the only reason.

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,910
I know.

40
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,371
Everyone else knows,
but he pretends he doesn't.

41
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,416
How did you guys meet before?

42
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,793
- Yesterday...
- Right.

43
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,838
I met him in here
when I came looking for you.

44
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,467
I'm sorry. I was busy,
so I forgot to call you back.

45
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,885
I didn't say anything.

46
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,679
Reply to my messages.

47
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,348
What? Are you leaving so soon?

48
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,310
I came to see Sin Da-On,
and I saw that he was okay.

49
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,771
There's no reason for me to stay.

50
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,406
"There's no reason for me to stay."

51
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,700
She's trying to act so cool.

52
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,246
I heard she went all over the place
just looking for you.

53
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,541
So when will you accept her feelings?

54
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,209
It's not like that.

55
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,211
She's just like a cute little sister.

56
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,463
Gosh, you're such a bad guy.

57
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,966
Among them, you're a bad guy
who can't refuse.

58
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,467
It's fatal.

59
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:57,636
Tae-Gyeong.

60
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,555
What do you think about So-Hee?

61
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,014
Pardon?

62
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:05,143
She can be a but curt, but she has
a good personality and she's easygoing.

63
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,188
What do you think?
Don't you think you can become friends?

64
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,440
Oh, right. Yes.

65
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,198
Where are you going?

66
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,534
I can't focus
because it's noisy in here.

67
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,458
Go after him.

68
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,526
They need to become friends soon.

69
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,237
You don't need to worry about that.

70
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:00,866
Why?

71
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,036
Just because. I have a feeling.

72
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,552
Why are you following me?

73
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,514
Who said I was following you?

74
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,266
You are following me.

75
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,648
Aren't you hungry?

76
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,650
- Do you want to go to the store...
- No.

77
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,696
Then do you want to eat together--

78
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:40,822
Not really.

79
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:48,163
Fine. I'll stop beating around the bush.

80
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,873
Let me ask you directly.

81
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,750
Why do you hate me?

82
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,627
Why do I hate you?

83
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,505
Yes. I'm sure you have a reason.

84
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,300
I don't...

85
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,177
have a reason.

86
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:11,228
"I don't have a reason"?

87
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,525
That jerk. He always leaves
after saying what he wants to say.

88
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,871
I asked why you hate me so much.

89
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,125
Just leave. I feel like I might get
indigestion because of you.

90
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,837
Do you like beans?

91
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,922
What are you talking about?

92
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,383
So what I mean...

93
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:45,679
I heard an interesting story recently.

94
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,974
So you...

95
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,936
(What if you tried doing something
you'd never do?)

96
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,439
"What if you tried..."

97
00:05:55,898 --> 00:06:00,611
"doing something that you..."

98
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,613
"would never do?"

99
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,244
Our first impression of one another
was bad,

100
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,913
but you never know.

101
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,963
"Something fun..."

102
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,715
"might happen."

103
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,638
I think that was pretty good.

104
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,140
Don't you agree?

105
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,770
I'm leaving.

106
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,441
Hey. Where are you going?
You didn't even finish.

107
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,864
Is this how you're going to be?

108
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,503
You seriously...

109
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,133
What do you want from me?

110
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,094
I kept asking you.

111
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,805
Why do you hate me?

112
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:13,892
I don't know the reason, so I'm
following you because I'm frustrated.

113
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,355
Is it because of that day when I
poked your butt...

114
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,526
No, I mean,

115
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,029
when I did that to that part...

116
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,907
with that thing?

117
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,119
Is that why you hate me?

118
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,168
If you tell me exactly
what you hate about me,

119
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,045
I'll accept it,
and I won't bother you anymore.

120
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,424
So tell me what you hate about me.

121
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,677
This.

122
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,096
It bothers me and gets on my nerves.

123
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:54,224
It annoys me that you're acting
like we're friends,

124
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,602
and you're a total eyesore.

125
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,606
Move over.

126
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,307
- Hey.
- Hey. Noh Shin-Woo.

127
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,228
I'll get going then.

128
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:47,194
What? I was going to go in too.

129
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:53,408
Noh Shin-Woo. Did you hear something?

130
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,953
Are you joking around again?

131
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,331
Yes. I was going to say "the sound of
an innocent bystander getting hurt".

132
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,502
How strange. It's really hard
to read my thoughts.

133
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,174
In any case, I'm embarrassed,
so I'm going in now.

134
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,813
Tae-Gyeong.
What are you doing after school today?

135
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,607
I'm not doing anything.

136
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,610
Then do you want to eat
something delicious with me?

137
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,654
Just the two of us?

138
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,657
No. With 2 10th graders from
Saebit Girls High School.

139
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,117
A blind date?

140
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,411
My friend asked me to do it,

141
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,621
but two girls coming,
so I don't want to go alone.

142
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,250
Namgung looks like that because
he played games all night,

143
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,878
and Shin-Woo isn't the type
to do this kind of thing.

144
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,090
You're the only one that's left,
Tae-Gyeong. Let's go together.

145
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,510
I've never gone on one before.

146
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,180
I'm not that handsome either.

147
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,850
- You're handsome.
- What?

148
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,686
No. I think you're pretty.

149
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,443
I'm serious.
I don't usually say things like this.

150
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:10,861
Right, Shin-Woo?

151
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,489
You don't need to feel burdened.

152
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,491
We can just get good food and have fun.

153
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,663
If you don't want to, I can go alone.

154
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,420
Then let's go together.

155
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,256
Really?

156
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,550
Okay. Let's go together.

157
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:34,676
Me too.

158
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,138
I want to go too.

159
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,226
So that's why she came with us.

160
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,144
She wants to make friends.

161
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,193
Yes. I don't have friends.

162
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,904
Hi. Let's be friends.

163
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,659
I'm sorry. She can be awfully stubborn.

164
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,537
In return, order anything you want.
I'll buy.

165
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,165
Why are you buying?
We all get allowance.

166
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,126
Let's split.

167
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,473
- So-Hee.
- Yes?

168
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,808
You have something on your face.

169
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,102
Where? Here?

170
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,396
Here.

171
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,363
Tae-Gyeong.
Do you want some more of this?

172
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:37,865
No.

173
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,617
Thank you.

174
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:45,455
We're in Grade 10.
You can speak comfortably to us.

175
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:47,666
I'm not comfortable right now.

176
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,676
Tae-Gyeong is mysterious,
so he doesn't speak much.

177
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,179
Guys like him are popular
with girls, right?

178
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,014
He's quiet and chic.

179
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,348
Right.

180
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,519
Guys like you are popular too.

181
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,564
You're kind, funny,

182
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,482
and handsome too.

183
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,568
Gosh, I'm not.

184
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,945
Do you want something else?

185
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,655
It's not because
you said something nice.

186
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,498
Excuse me. I need to use the restroom.

187
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,271
- You're not having fun, are you?
- No. Not at all.

188
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:55,067
I knew it. I like that you're so honest.

189
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,196
Let's wrap things up and go home.
I'm tired too.

190
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,742
Have you done this often?

191
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,036
"This"?

192
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:10,207
Blind dates like this where you eat
and hang out with girls.

193
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,378
Oh. My friend kept asking me
to do him a favor.

194
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,589
I couldn't refuse,
so I had no choice but to come.

195
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,968
This is my first blind date too.

196
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,470
You can just refuse.

197
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,889
Gosh. What's good is good.

198
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,059
Do you feel uncomfortable?

199
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,646
No. I'm just a bit cold.

200
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,566
Is it because
you're by the air conditioner?

201
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,401
Let's go.

202
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:38,777
Okay.

203
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,790
Wait. That's my seat.

204
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,127
Sit here. It's not as cold here.

205
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,312
- Thank you.
- No need to thank me.

206
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,817
This place is a bit cold.

207
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,446
Jin-Young.

208
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,616
Here. Put this on.

209
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,007
Da-On.

210
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,177
Can you give me your number?

211
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:47,763
Please.

212
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,354
Where do you live?

213
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,939
I live in Saebit Apartment.

214
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,196
What's wrong?

215
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,074
Oh, right. This song is good.

216
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,836
Oh, no. I forgot something.

217
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,922
Wait here. I'll go get it.

218
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,428
Hold on.

219
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,727
Why did you give everyone your number?

220
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,065
What?

221
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,234
You not only gave your number
to that girl,

222
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,903
but you gave your number
to the other girl too.

223
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:50,492
Shouldn't you just give your number
to the girl you like the most?

224
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,162
Most people usually do that.

225
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,419
Both of them asked me,
so I couldn't refuse.

226
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,130
I'm sure they mustered up
their courage to ask.

227
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,426
Why can't you refuse?

228
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:09,595
Well...

229
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,390
I don't like hurting people,

230
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,559
and I don't like getting hurt either.

231
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,604
Regardless of what it is,
what's good is good.

232
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,153
Yes. I found it.

233
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,324
This is it, right?
The song you thought was good.

234
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,538
Is being kind to everyone...

235
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,459
really a good thing?

236
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,378
Da-On is really cool.

237
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,964
I know. He's so nice.

238
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,427
Erase Sin Da-On's number.

239
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,766
Thank you for today, Woo Tae-Gyeong.

240
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,519
You went through a lot today,
so I'll treat you to a meal next time.

241
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:02,189
It's okay. You paid for me today too.

242
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:04,274
Just accept it when I'm offering.

243
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,529
Because what's good is good?

244
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,157
Exactly.

245
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:16,328
President Sin Da-On smiled,

246
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,997
but I'm not sure if...

247
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:22,584
being nice to everyone
is really good thing,

248
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,462
so I didn't smile back.

249
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,133
"What's good is good?"

250
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:37,891
Noh Shin-Woo?

251
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,018
My gosh, you're so annoying.

252
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,229
Look at how he's keeping his mouth shut.

253
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,358
Answer me, Shin-Woo.
You should do everything I tell you to.

254
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,235
I know your secret.

255
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,444
Noh Shin-Woo.

256
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,697
What are you doing there?

257
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:54,032
Woo Tae-Gyeong?

258
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,666
Who is he? Is he your boyfriend?

259
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,626
You jerk.

260
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,132
I'm neither his boyfriend
nor am I his friend.

261
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,969
If there's nothing left to say,
we'll get going.

262
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:19,725
Where are you going?

263
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,441
Don't touch him.

264
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,695
What is this?
Is he really your boyfriend?

265
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,199
What are you doing there?

266
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,409
Run! It's a police officer.

267
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,581
Woo Tae-Gyeong.

268
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,250
Wake up, Woo Tae-Gyeong.

269
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,086
Woo Tae-Gyeong!

270
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,176
(Light on Me)

271
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:55,802
- I have a question.
- What is it?

272
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,347
Did something happen to him
in middle school?

273
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,890
Is your face okay?

274
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:02,684
Gosh, I got chills.
When did you become close?

275
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,354
Da-On? He won't answer even if you call.

276
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,440
How do you know whether or not
Sin Da-On...

277
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,234
will answer my calls?

278
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,834
(Light on Me)
