1
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:06,599
Gosh, that stings.

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,080
Hey. Don't you have anything to say?

3
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,120
You're a good actor.

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,000
I had to pretend to pass out
to scare them.

5
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,039
No. It's not that.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,160
I'm sure there's something else
that you should say right now.

7
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,079
Don't do pointless things from now on.

8
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:40,079
I'm not one to expect anything
from people,

9
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,159
but you're a piece of work.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,840
But who were those guys?

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,159
They were talking about some secret.

12
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,039
We were friends in middle school.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
I see.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,640
But isn't it exhausting to draw a line
against people?

15
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,920
It was for me.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,689
A line?

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,439
I was similar to you.

18
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,799
No, I was worse.

19
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:23,359
I said I didn't need friends,
and I drew a line...

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,120
and didn't let people talk to me.

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,680
But I suddenly thought it would be nice
to have friends.

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,799
That's why I joined the student council.

23
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,959
I'd really like it
if you didn't hate me.

24
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,599
I could be a better person
than you think I am,

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,640
and you could be a better person
than I think you are.

26
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,560
Da-On said you're a good person.

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,400
Da-On says everyone is a good person.

28
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,159
But you said I bother you
and get on your nerves.

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,919
Do I still get on your nerves?

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,039
In some ways,
you could say that I saved you.

31
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,719
Right?

32
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,810
Oh, and you told them
not to touch me too.

33
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,090
What was that about?

34
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,199
I really don't like you.

35
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,960
What was that? I helped him,
and he didn't even thank me.

36
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,120
Can you pay for this too?

37
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,080
How was it today? Was it a lot of fun?

38
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:07,319
No. It wasn't.

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,520
I thought so.

40
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,479
I heard rumors that
those 10th graders really like Da-On.

41
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,599
There's no reason for me to be there.

42
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,319
Hey.

43
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,960
I have a question.

44
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,319
What is it? Ask me anything.

45
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,520
You bought me this, so I'll answer it.

46
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,840
- About Noh Shin-Woo...
- He has always been that annoying.

47
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,560
Yes. I know that too.

48
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,759
Did something happen to him
in middle school?

49
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,240
His friend said that he would reveal
his secret or something.

50
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,360
I was wondering
if you knew anything about it.

51
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,039
Why don't I know anything?

52
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,240
I take back what I said about
knowing everything.

53
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,479
Ask him later when you become close.

54
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,080
Ask Shin-Woo yourself.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,800
Do you think we could become friends?

56
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,759
Of course.

57
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,719
Shin-Woo really seems to like you.

58
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,520
Not at all. He really hates me.

59
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,839
He says I bother him
and get on his nerves.

60
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,879
What?

61
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,560
That's a good thing.

62
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,610
Why?

63
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,319
Because when you hate something,

64
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,240
it requires as much energy
as when you like something.

65
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,519
But it's dangerous for you to get
involved like that.

66
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,120
Your face. You got involved and...

67
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,360
Bam.

68
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,560
- Did you see it?
- Yes.

69
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,800
Since when?

70
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,079
When they were being cheap
and ganging up on Shin-Woo 4 against 1.

71
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,319
But why didn't you help him?

72
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:59,639
Hey. They're really scary guys.

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,170
How painful would it be to get it?
It won't just hurt.

74
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,610
Look at your face. The scar.

75
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,800
What will you do about that?

76
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,120
Listen carefully.

77
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:12,240
Guys who are as handsome
as you and me...

78
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,120
shouldn't end up with scars.

79
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,399
Look at my skin.

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,199
It's clean, right?

81
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,839
If you call the cops,

82
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,879
you can save your friend
and save your skin too.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,839
It's like killing 2 birds with 1 stone.

84
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,360
Oh, I see.
You were the one who called the cops.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,360
In any case, I'll get going.

86
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
Next time, call 112.

87
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,319
Officers of the law.

88
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,600
I'm exhausted today.

89
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,519
I just got this phone.

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,240
Hello?

91
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,160
Hello?

92
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,360
It's me. Noh Shin-Woo.

93
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,600
Noh Shin-Woo?

94
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,759
Yes. Can we talk on the phone?

95
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
Yes.

96
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,279
My screen cracked, so I can't see
anything, but I can talk on the phone.

97
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,959
What is it?

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,199
No. Can we talk on the phone right now?

99
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,519
We're talking...

100
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,360
right now.

101
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,199
Well...

102
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll buy you...

103
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
another phone.

104
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,519
It's fine. It's not like you broke it.

105
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:07,480
Hello? Did you hang up?

106
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,519
What is this? Did he really hang up?

107
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,160
Hey, Woo Tae-Gyeong.

108
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,600
What?

109
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,639
Thank you...

110
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,959
for today.

111
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,439
(Tae-Gyeong)

112
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,160
Have we gotten closer?

113
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,759
My gosh.

114
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,480
At least it wasn't the worst day ever.

115
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,800
(Administration)

116
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,759
Why is this here?

117
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,960
- It wasn't once, right?
- It was.

118
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,879
No way.

119
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,600
Gosh, were you cleaning?

120
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,840
You're so diligent.

121
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,480
Did you get home safely yesterday?

122
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,879
Yes. What about you?

123
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,450
Yes. I got home safely.

124
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,399
Oh, right. I found this on the floor.

125
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,639
Oh, I threw that out.

126
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
What? You're ranked
in the first percentile again?

127
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,759
You always go out,
so when do you have time to study?

128
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,519
You should brag about it.
Your parents would be happy.

129
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,210
Should I do that?

130
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,240
(2021 CSAT Mock Exam)

131
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,039
By the way, what happened to your face?

132
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Oh, right.

133
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,120
I just got a bit of scratch.

134
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,120
It's not just a scratch.

135
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,480
You could say it's a scar
created by justice.

136
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,960
Gosh. We've never been all together
this early in the morning.

137
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,519
Shin-Woo, you're here early too.

138
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,360
Hi.

139
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,399
Right.

140
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,519
Hi.

141
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,519
What was that just now?

142
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:07,960
Did you guys just greet each other?

143
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,159
So what? What about it?

144
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,759
Gosh, I got chills.

145
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,399
When did you become close enough...

146
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,559
to greet each other like that?

147
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,799
When? When did you get close without me?

148
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,919
I'm about to get hurt.

149
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,639
You're so noisy. Be quiet.

150
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,159
You're so cold.

151
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,720
The atmosphere in here is different
now that you get along.

152
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,919
Let's all go out to get something
to eat next time.

153
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,000
Gosh. I love it. You're the best.

154
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,480
Oh, right.
The math teacher is looking for you.

155
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,450
Right. I'm going to go now.

156
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,480
Does the school not run without you?

157
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,399
I want to deny it,
but I think it's true.

158
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,279
Things are always so hectic.

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,159
I'll see you later.

160
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,679
Oh, right.

161
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,240
I had something to do before class too.

162
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,080
I'll see you later.

163
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,080
Hey. Hey!

164
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,399
Hey, Shin-Woo.

165
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,279
Yes?

166
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,320
I'm hungry.

167
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,840
Do you want to go to the store together
before classes start?

168
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:46,639
You surprised me. Why? What is it?

169
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,559
You wanted to go to the store.

170
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,639
Aren't you going?

171
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,840
Right. I'm going.

172
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,919
Do you want a bite?

173
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,360
You can eat up.

174
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,080
Why did you come
if you weren't going to eat?

175
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,039
Just because. I wanted to go on a walk.

176
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,879
You know that you're really weird,
right?

177
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,440
Hey.

178
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,679
Is your face okay?

179
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,480
Yes. I'm sure it'll get better soon.

180
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,360
I didn't get hurt badly.

181
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,759
I'll get going.

182
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,159
Have fun in class.

183
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,480
Okay.

184
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,200
Da-On?

185
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,600
He's not in
the student council room right now.

186
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:14,879
- What?
- Aren't you going there right now?

187
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,120
He won't be in there.

188
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:20,720
He probably won't answer your calls.

189
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,360
How would you know?

190
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,559
What?

191
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,840
How would you know whether or not...

192
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,919
Da-On will answer my calls?

193
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,519
Well, he told me earlier...

194
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,080
that he's busy all day today.

195
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,279
He's probably going to be with
a teacher all day,

196
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,080
so he won't be able
to look at his phone.

197
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,559
Oh, is that so?

198
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,360
If it's urgent,
you can go to the teachers' lounge.

199
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,360
Or you can wait for him
in the student council room.

200
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,879
Sin 2 over pi minus 2x.

201
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,360
Da-On.

202
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,960
What are you doing here?

203
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,639
I was on my way home
when I saw the lights were still on.

204
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,159
I see.

205
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,600
You need to add a minus there.

206
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,919
Oh, right.

207
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,440
That's right.

208
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,960
You're good at math too.

209
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,159
Oh, right.
You're ranked in the first percentile.

210
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,600
I like math the most.

211
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,960
The answer is clear.

212
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,399
I hate math the most...

213
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,320
because it's hard.

214
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,159
You don't like PE either, right?

215
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,320
Right.

216
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,759
I see. You look like you would.

217
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,759
Are you criticizing me?

218
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,039
No. Did it seem like I was?

219
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,279
Yes. A little.

220
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,200
You're really honest.

221
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,919
It's not really a good thing.

222
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,720
Why not? It's a really good thing.

223
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,240
There are a lot of people in this world
who can't be honest.

224
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,200
In any case, I wasn't criticizing you.

225
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm sorry. Did I surprise you?

226
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,840
What were you doing?

227
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,960
Let me join you.

228
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,039
Can I do that, Tae-Gyeong?

229
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,600
Yes, of course.

230
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,360
Because of you,

231
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,320
I went back and forth from the teachers'
lounge and student council room.

232
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,720
Are you trying to trick me or something?

233
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,279
I really had no idea.

234
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,600
So-Hee. We're studying math right now.

235
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,759
Our curriculum is different,
so it won't help you.

236
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,360
It doesn't matter.
I could study it in advance.

237
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,840
Move over. It's tight.

238
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:35,679
Right.

239
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,120
Da-On, I have something to do.

240
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,080
I'll get going.

241
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,320
Really? You should go.

242
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:50,240
Da-On. Let's go get tteokbokki.

243
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,879
Tae-Gyeong. Hold on.

244
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,120
So-Hee, Tae-Gyeong and I have
something important to take care of.

245
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,650
If you wait in the student council room,
I'll meet you there.

246
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,839
What is it?

247
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,960
What are you guys doing?

248
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,650
We'll be done really soon. Okay?
Go and wait for me there.

249
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,170
Hurry up, Da-On.
I'll be waiting for you.

250
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:38,960
What's the important thing
you have to do?

251
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,440
The reason why I came here...

252
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,799
is this.

253
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,720
Let me see.

254
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,720
You shouldn't have a scar on your face.

255
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,079
What are you doing next weekend?

256
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,559
I don't do anything on the weekends.

257
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,440
I see. Do you want to
go grab a meal together?

258
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:49,839
Let's go eat tteokbokki.

259
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,799
- Do you like tteokbokki?
- Yes.

260
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,170
We could get tteokbokki
and go to a cafe afterwards.

261
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,519
Sounds good.

262
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,920
Gosh, my charger.

263
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,960
My charger should be...

264
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:20,960
Where is my charger? Where is it?

265
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,960
Is it here? Is it there?

266
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,890
Is it here?

267
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,480
- Hey, Lee So-Hee!
- You surprised me.

268
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:30,759
What are you doing in here?

269
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,720
I'm waiting for Da-On.

270
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:33,799
Da-On?

271
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,170
I saw him leaving with Tae-Gyeong.

272
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,680
- What?
- I saw them on the first floor...

273
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,650
Gosh. That fool only cares about Da-On.

274
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,170
Love is exhausting.

275
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,890
- Are you really okay?
- Yes.

276
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,200
It'll be there for about a week.

277
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,000
You should change the bandage
when you get home.

278
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,359
It's fine.

279
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,119
What's with him?

280
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:13,200
(Light on Me)

281
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,599
How are things with Shin-Woo?
You seem closer.

282
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,039
Did something happen?

283
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,559
- What?
- Didn't we get closer?

284
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,650
Is something wrong?

285
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,279
I keep getting the wrong answer.

286
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:24,200
Bring it to the front
and transpose it with x.

287
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,559
If you have a problem with me,
say it to my face.

288
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,170
I can't hold back anymore.

289
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:44,119
(Light on Me)
