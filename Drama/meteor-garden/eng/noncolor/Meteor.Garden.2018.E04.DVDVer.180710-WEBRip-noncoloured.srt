EPISODE 4

4
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:34,078
No.

5
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:36,558
This isn't what I want.

6
00:01:46,798 --> 00:01:47,838
We're adults now.

7
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:50,998
As long as we're responsible,

8
00:01:51,798 --> 00:01:52,878
we can do whatever we want.

9
00:01:54,638 --> 00:01:55,638
If I didn't want to,

10
00:01:57,078 --> 00:01:58,238
I wouldn't give you a chance.

11
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:05,078
Hey, do you want some grilled squid?

12
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:06,278
Wake up, Meizuo.

13
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:08,518
Get up, Meizuo.

14
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:10,318
What are you doing? Have some squid.

15
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:11,678
You're a pervert!

16
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:15,358
-Grilled squid time!
-Hey!

17
00:02:15,438 --> 00:02:17,598
-What's your problem?
-Who wants some squid?

18
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:19,398
-It's so good.
-I...

19
00:02:19,718 --> 00:02:21,318
Ximen!

20
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:22,438
What are you doing?

21
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:23,358
Hey!

22
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:24,918
Ximen!

23
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,198
Ximen!

24
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:28,118
What is wrong with you?
I was about to sleep.

25
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:29,838
-Grilled squid at this hour?
-Hey!

26
00:02:29,918 --> 00:02:31,198
-Yes, grilled squid.
-I told you,

27
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:32,478
-I was about to sleep.
-Wake up!

28
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:33,518
-Get up!
-So annoying.

29
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:34,438
Get up!

30
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:35,598
Hey, get up!

31
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:38,958
Hey, Jing. Want some grilled squid?

32
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:41,358
Get up. Wake up!

33
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:55,918
I want this.

34
00:02:55,998 --> 00:02:56,838
This one?

35
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:57,878
Thanks.

36
00:02:58,358 --> 00:02:59,198
You're welcome.

37
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:01,798
Thank you.

38
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:03,038
You're so cute.

39
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,438
Shancai, do you want some grilled squid?

40
00:03:08,118 --> 00:03:10,038
No, thanks. I'll just have a drink.

41
00:03:10,518 --> 00:03:11,358
Okay.

42
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:13,238
Thanks.

43
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:20,598
Here you go.

44
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:22,078
Okay, thanks.

45
00:03:23,558 --> 00:03:24,398
Hurry up.

46
00:03:32,558 --> 00:03:33,398
All right.

47
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:34,318
-Thanks.
-Here.

48
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:35,358
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

49
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:36,958
Hey.

50
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:38,118
Look.

51
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:40,758
Do you know what this is?

52
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:43,198
-This...
-It's just a bucket.

53
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,398
I mean, what's inside it?

54
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:47,318
Is it squid?

55
00:03:47,398 --> 00:03:48,358
No.

56
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:50,678
It's the squid that I caught.

57
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,038
Si.

58
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:57,038
Have you been fishing for squid all night?

59
00:03:57,598 --> 00:03:59,478
Yes. It's so much fun.

60
00:04:00,678 --> 00:04:02,918
Let's never hang out with him again, okay?

61
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:23,998
Shancai.

62
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:30,438
What are you drinking?

63
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,398
This.

64
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:45,918
Did you see everything?

65
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:51,958
Yes.

66
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:55,238
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:57,318
I just wanted to return the dress.

68
00:04:58,478 --> 00:04:59,558
I didn't mean to.

69
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:06,638
You...

70
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:09,598
You must hate me.

71
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:14,278
I know

72
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:17,238
I'm a lot of trouble.

73
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:19,998
I'm hard to please

74
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:22,438
and I'm kind of selfish.

75
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:28,438
But to me,

76
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,278
you're a very,

77
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:36,878
very important friend.

78
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:44,158
If I hate you,
why would I save you so many times?

79
00:06:24,398 --> 00:06:25,478
Tell me.

80
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:27,158
When are you going to talk to him?

81
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:31,798
Well,

82
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,918
according to Si's logic,

83
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:36,038
they're not talking because

84
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:39,078
he forbade Lei from talking to him.

85
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:42,038
But Si can still talk to Lei.

86
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:43,478
Cut it out.

87
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:45,678
I'll talk to him when I want to.

88
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:41,278
<i>All of us pursue different kinds
of happiness in this world.</i>

89
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:43,158
<i>To me,</i>

90
00:07:43,678 --> 00:07:47,158
<i>a smile from Lei is enough.</i>

91
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:31,718
Si, you're early today.

92
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,478
I want to get there early.

93
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:37,718
I'm happy that you're so energetic.

94
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,398
I'm happy for you.

95
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:45,158
The color of that tie
doesn't really go with your outfit.

96
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,078
It's not something you would wear.

97
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:09,398
It's fine.

98
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:12,038
I want to try something new today.

99
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:14,718
Oh? All right.

100
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:16,638
Your breakfast is here.

101
00:09:17,118 --> 00:09:18,118
-Okay.
-I'll go now.

102
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:05,518
Hey, Shancai.

103
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:07,998
Shancai.

104
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:09,078
Shancai.

105
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,118
Good morning, Qinghe.

106
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:12,358
Thank you for the trip.

107
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:14,118
Don't mention it.

108
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:18,318
I still can't forget how exciting
the last night in Sanya was.

109
00:10:19,158 --> 00:10:20,398
That night in Sanya?

110
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:22,638
My aunts and uncles

111
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,638
heard that I won F4 over
with squid-fishing.

112
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:25,998
They're so proud.

113
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,798
Is that what you're talking about?

114
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:32,558
Yes.

115
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:35,198
Didn't you see the squid I grilled?

116
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,198
All of them started drooling.

117
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,078
They loved it.

118
00:10:39,158 --> 00:10:40,918
I've managed to make F4
like me with my food!

119
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:47,438
Good morning!

120
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:49,478
Shancai, see?

121
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:52,198
They think of me as their friend now.

122
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,718
They never looked at me before.

123
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:55,678
Now, they hit my head.

124
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:57,718
That's something friends do.

125
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:03,598
Please turn in
your assignment from last week.

126
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:07,398
Pass it to your right to the class leader.

127
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,758
<i>Shancai is getting out of hand.</i>

128
00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:19,118
First, she winked at Daoming Si
in front of you.

129
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:21,798
Next, she tackled him and kissed him.

130
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:24,838
This Shancai...

131
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,638
I can't tell her who to like or hit on.

132
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,318
But she's getting close to Huaze Lei
and seducing Daoming Si at the same time.

133
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:33,918
What is she doing?

134
00:11:34,678 --> 00:11:35,678
Yes.

135
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:39,198
She just wants to be popular.

136
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:43,318
If we knew they were going to Sanya,

137
00:11:43,798 --> 00:11:44,918
we should've gone too.

138
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:50,918
Zhen.

139
00:11:51,598 --> 00:11:53,478
Aren't you friends with Shancai?

140
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:56,078
Why didn't she bring you along?

141
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:04,198
Hello, sir.

142
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:05,318
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

143
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:08,438
That Shancai is so ridiculous.

144
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:10,718
This video has gone viral on Now Live.

145
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,558
She tackled and kissed Daoming Si
in public.

146
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,238
Yeah, what was she thinking?

147
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,198
Unbelievable.

148
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:17,558
Where are my sneakers?

149
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:25,758
Good morning, Shancai.

150
00:12:43,118 --> 00:12:45,598
Daoming Si, why are you wearing my shoes?

151
00:12:48,998 --> 00:12:49,838
Are these your shoes?

152
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:52,758
No wonder they're kind of tight.

153
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,238
Daoming Si, is there something wrong
with you?

154
00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:58,118
You're so immature for your age.

155
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:00,438
I feel sorry for you.

156
00:13:05,878 --> 00:13:06,718
Hey.

157
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:09,198
I...

158
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:10,118
Hey.

159
00:13:15,238 --> 00:13:16,078
Hey.

160
00:13:16,558 --> 00:13:18,198
Did you see her face?

161
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,758
She was so mad.

162
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:23,878
You woke us up so early today

163
00:13:24,718 --> 00:13:25,798
just to see that?

164
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:29,078
Yes.

165
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:31,958
I didn't sleep last night
so I can do this to pick on her.

166
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,278
We should really think about

167
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,678
why we're friends
with someone so immature.

168
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:40,598
Don't worry.
This is just the first part of my plan.

169
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:42,798
You have a plan?

170
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:44,358
Yes.

171
00:13:44,518 --> 00:13:48,078
My plan is to seduce her first,

172
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:49,278
mess around with her

173
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:51,838
and then dump her.

174
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:53,798
She'll be so sad.

175
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:56,758
Nobody up there or down there
will be able to help her.

176
00:13:57,518 --> 00:14:00,198
I feel like you'll fall for her first.

177
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:01,318
Are you kidding?

178
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:02,958
Would I like someone that lame?

179
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:08,798
Hey, where are you going?

180
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:10,198
Hey.

181
00:14:10,878 --> 00:14:11,838
Hey.

182
00:14:12,358 --> 00:14:13,798
Can you get me my shoes?

183
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,438
You're drawing Jing, aren't you?

184
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:48,558
You can tell? Does it look like her?

185
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,358
Yeah.

186
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:54,678
Are you sure?

187
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:56,998
I've never been good at art.

188
00:14:59,918 --> 00:15:03,678
Jing is probably
the only person you'd draw.

189
00:15:05,878 --> 00:15:06,718
I guess so.

190
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:15,238
You have chalk dust on your head.

191
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:18,558
Where?

192
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:20,238
There.

193
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:22,198
Where?

194
00:15:26,478 --> 00:15:27,718
Can I...

195
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:31,878
Sure.

196
00:16:09,638 --> 00:16:10,478
That's good.

197
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,478
Thanks.

198
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:17,278
<i>This is enough.</i>

199
00:16:17,638 --> 00:16:18,958
<i>For me,</i>

200
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,998
<i>the time I spent with Lei on the rooftop</i>

201
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:23,278
<i>was probably the only time</i>

202
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:26,278
<i>I felt calm and relaxed at this school.</i>

203
00:16:37,398 --> 00:16:38,558
Look at him.

204
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,398
How many times has he watched it?

205
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:41,718
I don't know.

206
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:43,118
But I do know that

207
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:45,718
when you like someone,
you have to follow her QQ space.

208
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:49,958
I think this time,
Si has really fallen for her.

209
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:57,398
Daoming Si.

210
00:16:58,158 --> 00:16:59,238
Do you remember me?

211
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,838
I'm Xinhui, a freshman
in the Nutrition Department.

212
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:02,918
I really like you.

213
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,238
And?

214
00:17:05,718 --> 00:17:08,638
My classmate,
Shancai, has been rude to you.

215
00:17:09,118 --> 00:17:10,558
I have a video of her to show you.

216
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:12,838
Hopefully, she'll stay out of trouble.

217
00:17:15,478 --> 00:17:16,478
Let me see.

218
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:19,158
No, it's for Daoming Si.

219
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,958
Give it to me.

220
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:52,758
What's the big deal?

221
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:53,758
Yeah.

222
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:57,318
Shancai only touched Huaze Lei head.

223
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,878
They've been meeting
on the rooftop for a few times now.

224
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:04,638
Even though Huaze Lei likes Jing,

225
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:08,158
Shancai seems to be interested in him.

226
00:18:08,238 --> 00:18:09,318
Shut up.

227
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,478
She kissed you once,
but now she's flirting with Huaze Lei.

228
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:17,998
I told you to shut up, didn't I?

229
00:18:19,758 --> 00:18:23,878
Si, Xinhui s just trying to remind you

230
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:27,038
that Shancai isn't
as innocent as she looks.

231
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:28,438
You should be careful.

232
00:18:29,638 --> 00:18:30,638
Get out of the way.

233
00:18:37,478 --> 00:18:38,678
-Shancai.
-Yes?

234
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:40,918
What are you wearing
to Jing's birthday party?

235
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:42,038
I don't know.

236
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:44,118
My mom said she would help me.

237
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:45,158
What about you?

238
00:18:45,238 --> 00:18:47,798
I've already prepared a cool outfit.

239
00:18:48,278 --> 00:18:49,838
I'll be the star of the show.

240
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,758
Zhen, Jing is having a party this weekend.

241
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:01,878
Do you want to come?

242
00:19:04,158 --> 00:19:05,838
But she didn't invite me.

243
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:09,118
It's okay.
She said I could bring my friends.

244
00:19:09,318 --> 00:19:10,678
Qinghe and Xiaoyou will be there.

245
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,318
We're all high-school classmates.
Let's go together.

246
00:19:13,678 --> 00:19:16,798
Yeah, maybe we'll see
someone famous there.

247
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:19,718
All right.

248
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:24,758
Where's my notebook?

249
00:19:27,118 --> 00:19:29,038
I left it on the rooftop.
I'm going to get it.

250
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,358
GIVE BACK TO YOUR PARENTS
FOR THEIR HARD WORK

251
00:19:36,598 --> 00:19:39,918
MY DAD ALWAYS TELLS ME TO FOCUS ON
MY STUDIES WHILE HE WORKS MULTIPLE JOBS

252
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:50,598
CREDIT CARD HOLDER, LI ZHEN

253
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:56,558
<i>This way, I can buy a dress
to wear to Jing's birthday party.</i>

254
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:13,078
Daoming Si, what are you doing here?

255
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,678
Why are you here?

256
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:26,038
They were telling the truth.

257
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:32,878
Don't go.

258
00:20:36,678 --> 00:20:37,638
What are you doing?

259
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:45,438
Shancai, you tricked me.

260
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:50,358
What are you talking about?
Who tricked you?

261
00:20:52,838 --> 00:20:53,678
Hey!

262
00:20:54,758 --> 00:20:55,758
You're a bad girl.

263
00:20:56,158 --> 00:20:57,318
Why are you so mean?

264
00:20:57,918 --> 00:20:59,758
What the hell are you talking about?

265
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:02,358
Let go!

266
00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:03,518
I'm going to get angry.

267
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:05,758
I'm the one who should get angry.

268
00:21:06,238 --> 00:21:07,478
How did I piss you off now?

269
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:09,038
Tell me.

270
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:25,518
Stop pretending.

271
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:27,438
You know what you're doing.

272
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:20,118
Don't come near me.

273
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,438
It's all your fault!

274
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:54,278
Daoming Si.

275
00:22:56,878 --> 00:22:58,678
I'm begging you.

276
00:23:00,398 --> 00:23:01,358
Please stop.

277
00:23:49,118 --> 00:23:50,198
Stop crying.

278
00:23:59,758 --> 00:24:01,158
I won't hurt you anymore.

279
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:05,158
Shancai's home.

280
00:25:06,358 --> 00:25:07,998
Go wash your hands and get ready to eat.

281
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:09,958
I'm not hungry.

282
00:25:11,478 --> 00:25:12,678
You're not hungry?

283
00:25:13,318 --> 00:25:14,398
Are you on a diet?

284
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:15,798
No.

285
00:25:16,318 --> 00:25:17,158
Let me see.

286
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,118
Why is there blood here?

287
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,318
What happened? Tell me.

288
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:24,198
Is someone bullying you?
I'll go beat him up.

289
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:25,998
I tripped and fell.

290
00:25:26,678 --> 00:25:28,158
It doesn't look like it.

291
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,838
Did someone hurt you?

292
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:31,678
No.

293
00:25:31,758 --> 00:25:33,318
Stop lying.

294
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,078
That's enough.

295
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:37,038
She's always had a grumpy face.

296
00:25:37,198 --> 00:25:38,278
You should know that.

297
00:25:38,358 --> 00:25:39,318
-I guess so.
-All right.

298
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:42,558
That's enough.
I'm really tired. I want to go rest now.

299
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:47,598
Come out and eat later.

300
00:27:56,358 --> 00:27:57,318
Lei.

301
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:00,118
I think Jing came back this time for you.

302
00:28:05,638 --> 00:28:06,478
Really?

303
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:08,278
When are you going
to tell her how you feel?

304
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:12,238
I'm thinking about it.

305
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,398
Si, what happened to your hand?

306
00:28:30,478 --> 00:28:32,238
Did you hit Shancai?

307
00:28:35,078 --> 00:28:36,198
Did you hit a wall?

308
00:28:49,678 --> 00:28:50,878
I'm going to class now.

309
00:28:54,718 --> 00:28:56,118
He probably hit both of them.

310
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,158
Lei.

311
00:29:03,598 --> 00:29:06,678
What's going on with you and Shancai?

312
00:29:07,238 --> 00:29:08,158
What?

313
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:18,278
What?

314
00:29:18,638 --> 00:29:20,438
Why would Daoming Si do that to you?

315
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:24,518
Didn't you say that
you had grilled squid together in Sanya?

316
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:27,358
I'm confused.

317
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:31,798
He stole my sneakers
and was being all stupid about it.

318
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:34,478
The next second, he turns into a pervert.

319
00:29:35,198 --> 00:29:36,438
Every time I close my eyes,

320
00:29:37,078 --> 00:29:39,038
I can see his crazy eyes.

321
00:29:39,198 --> 00:29:40,038
Then what happened?

322
00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:42,238
There's nothing else.

323
00:29:42,918 --> 00:29:46,038
I've been going to school really early
and coming straight home

324
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,478
so that I won't bump into him.

325
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:50,998
What about Jing's birthday party?

326
00:29:51,598 --> 00:29:53,198
Will you see him there?

327
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,638
I'm worried about that too.

328
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:01,398
It's fine. There'll be a lot of people.

329
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:03,598
Just pretend you don't see him.

330
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:05,238
That's all I can do.

331
00:30:07,478 --> 00:30:10,118
Shancai, you're wearing makeup now?

332
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:12,118
Wetcode Aqua Cushion CC Cream?

333
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,238
Last time in Sanya, Jing recommended it.

334
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:16,838
It's not bad.

335
00:30:20,358 --> 00:30:21,598
It's very popular lately.

336
00:30:21,998 --> 00:30:22,838
Let me see.

337
00:30:23,998 --> 00:30:25,598
Your skin looks flawless.

338
00:30:25,678 --> 00:30:26,518
So moisturized.

339
00:30:27,078 --> 00:30:27,998
Can I borrow it later?

340
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:29,238
Sure. No problem.

341
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:38,438
By the way, Shancai,

342
00:30:38,678 --> 00:30:41,278
will that handsome guy, Ximen, be there?

343
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:44,438
Xiaoyou.

344
00:30:51,158 --> 00:30:52,358
Wow.

345
00:30:54,678 --> 00:30:55,558
Qinghe.

346
00:30:56,318 --> 00:30:57,918
What an awesome car.

347
00:30:57,998 --> 00:31:00,158
-What do you think? Cool, right?
-Yes.

348
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:01,718
My dad said for an occasion like this,

349
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:03,958
I have to drive Qinghe number two.

350
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:06,238
-What about Qinghe number one?
-That's me.

351
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:07,718
Silly girl.

352
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,118
Shancai.

353
00:31:13,158 --> 00:31:14,598
-Wow.
-Hey.

354
00:31:14,678 --> 00:31:17,158
What do you think? Do I look weird?

355
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:19,998
No. You look great.

356
00:31:25,078 --> 00:31:27,198
Wow, so pretty.

357
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:33,038
WOMEN'S DRESS, 5,998 YUAN

358
00:31:34,238 --> 00:31:36,558
You can pay in installments
with a credit card.

359
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:39,078
With 12 installments,
it's only a few hundred yuan a month.

360
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:45,998
How are you paying?

361
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:48,958
Can I use my Bank of Communications app?

362
00:31:49,518 --> 00:31:50,358
Of course.

363
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,318
BANK OF COMMUNICATIONS APP

364
00:32:17,078 --> 00:32:18,318
Everyone looks wonderful.

365
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,398
They're dressed so formally.

366
00:32:21,078 --> 00:32:22,558
Do you think we're dressed up enough?

367
00:32:23,238 --> 00:32:24,118
Why not?

368
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,518
At least, I look good.

369
00:32:28,878 --> 00:32:30,278
Isn't that the actress, Zhou Dongyu?

370
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,118
So pretty.

371
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:34,718
Calm down, Xiaoyou.

372
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:37,118
My dad said at events like this,
if you see someone famous,

373
00:32:37,198 --> 00:32:38,918
you should pretend you didn't see them.

374
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:41,078
We should get something to eat first.

375
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:42,118
Come on.

376
00:32:45,318 --> 00:32:46,718
There's so much food.

377
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,998
-Which one do you want?
-This one.

378
00:32:56,758 --> 00:32:57,838
It's Ximen.

379
00:32:58,558 --> 00:32:59,438
He's so handsome.

380
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:04,278
Which one is Si?

381
00:33:05,198 --> 00:33:06,558
-Si.
-Si...

382
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:11,838
Do you see that pineapple head?

383
00:33:11,918 --> 00:33:12,918
That's Daoming Si.

384
00:33:13,238 --> 00:33:16,478
One time, we went squid-fishing
and I caught way more than him.

385
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:18,398
His squid was smaller than...

386
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:19,878
Than what?

387
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:22,278
My finger.

388
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:38,598
Shancai.

389
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:46,398
You look very elegant today.

390
00:33:47,678 --> 00:33:49,478
Yes, very cute.

391
00:34:21,598 --> 00:34:23,998
Daoming Si, you're still so handsome.

392
00:34:24,558 --> 00:34:26,198
I just came back from London last month.

393
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:28,878
I went to Fashion Week there.
I saw your sister.

394
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:30,798
She's still so beautiful.

395
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:33,158
I bought this dress I'm wearing
over there.

396
00:34:33,318 --> 00:34:34,238
What do you think?

397
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,638
Shancai.

398
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:39,918
What are you doing?

399
00:34:42,638 --> 00:34:43,758
Isn't it nice?

400
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:48,038
What are you up to lately?

401
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,278
You should come out with us.

402
00:34:50,598 --> 00:34:52,118
You never hang out with us anymore.

403
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:55,918
Next time when you're free,
don't forget to call me.

404
00:35:52,598 --> 00:35:53,758
Lei, don't be sad.

405
00:35:54,878 --> 00:35:56,078
I'll be back.

406
00:36:21,278 --> 00:36:23,078
Welcome. This way, please.

407
00:36:27,678 --> 00:36:28,878
Please show your invitation.

408
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,598
My friend has it. She's inside.

409
00:36:31,718 --> 00:36:33,518
-Can you let me in?
-I'm sorry.

410
00:36:33,678 --> 00:36:35,118
You need an invitation to get in.

411
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:37,558
Excuse me, please step aside.

412
00:36:38,438 --> 00:36:41,118
Ms. Li, you look wonderful.
Let me see that.

413
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:42,158
Welcome.

414
00:36:42,238 --> 00:36:43,078
Sir, hello.

415
00:36:48,718 --> 00:36:49,838
Invitation, please.

416
00:36:50,798 --> 00:36:51,838
Mr. Wang, hello.

417
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:57,958
Ms. Wang, you look beautiful tonight.
It has been a while.

418
00:36:58,038 --> 00:36:58,958
Please come in.

419
00:37:05,078 --> 00:37:06,038
This way, please.

420
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:14,318
I'm sorry.

421
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:15,718
I didn't do it on purpose.

422
00:37:15,878 --> 00:37:16,798
What have you done?

423
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:20,358
This is an expensive suit.

424
00:37:20,918 --> 00:37:22,358
What are you going to do now?

425
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:24,318
It was an accident.

426
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,118
Don't worry.

427
00:37:27,198 --> 00:37:28,038
It's fine.

428
00:37:28,758 --> 00:37:29,638
How about

429
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:32,478
you wipe it clean for me?

430
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:34,078
Is that okay?

431
00:37:40,798 --> 00:37:41,878
I'll wipe it for you.

432
00:37:44,798 --> 00:37:47,078
But your suit is flimsy.

433
00:37:48,038 --> 00:37:49,038
The texture is terrible.

434
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:52,758
You should just toss it.

435
00:37:57,678 --> 00:37:59,118
What a rude boy.

436
00:37:59,598 --> 00:38:00,718
It's none of your business.

437
00:38:14,238 --> 00:38:15,518
Has my phone died again?

438
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:20,598
Where's Xiaoyou?

439
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:25,638
<i>-The number you dialed is...</i>
-Okay, thanks.

440
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:27,438
<i>Please try again later.</i>

441
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:34,958
I go to Mingde University,
the same school Jing goes to.

442
00:38:35,118 --> 00:38:36,278
My friend is inside.

443
00:38:36,718 --> 00:38:38,198
Can you let me in?

444
00:38:38,878 --> 00:38:40,318
Miss, please don't cause any trouble.

445
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,958
Show your invitation
or ask your friend to come get you, okay?

446
00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:46,518
-But I--
-Don't get in the way.

447
00:38:47,278 --> 00:38:48,358
Sir, invitation, please.

448
00:38:48,798 --> 00:38:49,918
Welcome.

449
00:38:50,518 --> 00:38:51,998
Ms. Li, you look fabulous.

450
00:38:52,118 --> 00:38:52,998
This way, please.

451
00:38:53,478 --> 00:38:54,438
Ms. Zhao, hello.

452
00:38:54,638 --> 00:38:55,478
Invitation, please.

453
00:38:56,078 --> 00:38:56,958
Welcome.

454
00:38:57,318 --> 00:38:58,958
Ms. Li, it has been a while.

455
00:39:22,638 --> 00:39:23,958
Are you okay, Ms. Milk Tea?

456
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:27,278
Thank you.

457
00:39:27,918 --> 00:39:30,118
You remember me?

458
00:39:30,878 --> 00:39:33,358
You're cute. Of course I remember you.

459
00:39:33,678 --> 00:39:34,598
Are you free later?

460
00:39:35,278 --> 00:39:38,038
-What?
-I'm a tea expert.

461
00:39:38,758 --> 00:39:40,478
-Maybe later we can--
-What do you want?

462
00:39:43,318 --> 00:39:44,438
We're in public.

463
00:39:45,118 --> 00:39:45,958
What can I do?

464
00:39:47,198 --> 00:39:48,118
Don't talk to him.

465
00:39:48,398 --> 00:39:50,078
If you talk to him, you'll get pregnant.

466
00:39:50,158 --> 00:39:50,998
Hey.

467
00:39:51,718 --> 00:39:53,158
I'm very careful, okay?

468
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:54,798
Ignore him.

469
00:39:56,918 --> 00:39:58,718
But I think he's handsome.

470
00:39:59,078 --> 00:40:00,158
His voice is mesmerizing.

471
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:01,918
He seems more composed than Daoming Si.

472
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:04,038
Xiaoyou, get yourself together.

473
00:40:05,518 --> 00:40:06,358
Where's your phone?

474
00:40:06,598 --> 00:40:07,838
I need to call Zhen.

475
00:40:08,118 --> 00:40:09,118
My phone is dead again.

476
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,118
Here.

477
00:40:25,558 --> 00:40:28,438
-Hello?
-Zhen, where are you?

478
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:31,678
-I'm sorry, my phone died--
-I called you to say

479
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:33,718
that something came up. I can't go.

480
00:40:34,638 --> 00:40:36,358
What? You can't come?

481
00:40:36,718 --> 00:40:37,558
<i>Yes.</i>

482
00:40:38,038 --> 00:40:39,038
Have fun.

483
00:40:48,518 --> 00:40:49,878
Hey, I have something to tell you.

484
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:51,758
What is it?

485
00:40:54,478 --> 00:40:55,318
Nothing.

486
00:40:56,438 --> 00:40:57,678
-Shancai.
-What's up with him?

487
00:40:57,758 --> 00:40:58,838
Who knows?

488
00:40:59,158 --> 00:41:01,158
Daoming Si just taught me
how to make girls like me.

489
00:41:01,678 --> 00:41:02,558
How?

490
00:41:02,718 --> 00:41:03,718
I'll tell you later.

491
00:41:43,398 --> 00:41:44,318
She's so beautiful.
