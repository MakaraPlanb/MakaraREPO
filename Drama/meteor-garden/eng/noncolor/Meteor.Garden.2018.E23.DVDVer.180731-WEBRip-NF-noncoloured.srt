EPISODE 23

4
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:41,842
Shancai.

5
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,482
Wake up.

6
00:01:43,922 --> 00:01:45,442
We start cleaning at 7:00 a.m.

7
00:01:57,402 --> 00:02:00,002
Mrs. Yu, I've completed my tasks.

8
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:01,642
What else should I clean?

9
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:08,122
Just completing them
and completing them nicely

10
00:02:08,802 --> 00:02:09,882
are two different things.

11
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:13,162
If it doesn't pass my examination,

12
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:16,122
you have to do it again.

13
00:02:49,162 --> 00:02:50,082
Wait.

14
00:02:50,162 --> 00:02:53,282
Why aren't the pleats on the window
curtains the same size?

15
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:55,722
It doesn't look uniform.

16
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:09,762
Why aren't those bathroom slippers
placed facing the door?

17
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,722
What if someone slips

18
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:13,642
when trying to wear them?

19
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:16,282
And this trash can.

20
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:19,722
Why is the trash bag visible
in the trash can?

21
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:21,962
That's not allowed either?

22
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:23,762
That's how we do it at home.

23
00:03:24,322 --> 00:03:26,362
That's not how we do it here.

24
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:29,602
There would be no sign of life
if it's too clean.

25
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:32,922
How can we not leave a trace
while we're alive?

26
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:36,362
Don't talk back to me.

27
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:40,282
The sign of life you're referring to
is sloppiness.

28
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:47,202
It's time to wake Si up.

29
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:51,282
Why are you still standing there?

30
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:54,842
Aren't I just responsible for cleaning?

31
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:56,642
Go when I tell you to.

32
00:03:58,562 --> 00:03:59,402
Okay.

33
00:04:05,482 --> 00:04:06,482
Never mind.

34
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:07,922
This is work.

35
00:04:08,442 --> 00:04:09,482
Just act like normal.

36
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:33,722
Daoming Si.

37
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:40,362
Sir, wake up...

38
00:04:59,162 --> 00:05:00,642
Why isn't he budging at all?

39
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:03,602
He sleeps like a dead person.

40
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:15,322
It's so rare to see him so quiet.

41
00:05:18,642 --> 00:05:19,802
Looking at him closely...

42
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:22,042
His nose is quite sharp.

43
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:30,362
Hey.

44
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:32,842
Let go.

45
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:35,042
-Hey.
-Stop.

46
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:37,682
Why are you so violent?

47
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:39,242
Can't you be nicer?

48
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:40,602
You jerk.

49
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:42,842
Were you pretending to be asleep?

50
00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:44,322
No.

51
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:45,642
I was dreaming.

52
00:05:48,122 --> 00:05:49,042
You...

53
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:53,002
Can you wear something to bed from now on?

54
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,442
Why?

55
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,602
Are you feeling shy?

56
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,482
Of course not.

57
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,242
I heard my mom bothered you yesterday.

58
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:33,242
Sorry about that.

59
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:37,282
That's fine.

60
00:06:38,962 --> 00:06:40,402
Did you and Xiaozi meet afterward?

61
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:49,122
She came to my house.

62
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:53,562
Really?

63
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:55,762
How is she?

64
00:06:58,402 --> 00:07:00,242
She's all smiles on the outside.

65
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:02,282
However...

66
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:05,642
Even though I feel sorry for her,

67
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:07,722
but...

68
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:12,282
I can't control my feelings.

69
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:17,282
I thought

70
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:19,282
you'd be with Lei.

71
00:07:20,362 --> 00:07:21,322
Lei?

72
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:23,362
What are you talking about?

73
00:07:26,962 --> 00:07:27,842
You...

74
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:30,402
Are you stupid?

75
00:07:31,522 --> 00:07:32,762
-I--
-Never mind.

76
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,922
Anyway, it's not important.

77
00:07:36,482 --> 00:07:38,042
Why are you speaking calmly?

78
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:39,642
Listen.

79
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:43,882
Didn't you tell me
that you'll fight with my mom for us?

80
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:48,402
For us...

81
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:54,642
You should have told me earlier.

82
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:56,842
That way, I wouldn't date other girls.

83
00:07:57,322 --> 00:07:58,162
Daoming Si.

84
00:07:58,242 --> 00:07:59,842
-Let me explain.
-I'm not listening.

85
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:03,642
Every time you explain,
it only complicates things.

86
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:06,842
Because life itself is complicated.

87
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:09,282
Si.

88
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:13,482
You're being so intimate with our cleaner
so early in the morning.

89
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:15,002
What do you think you're doing?

90
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:21,762
Mrs. Yu.

91
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:25,202
You should knock before you come in.

92
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,242
You're dillydallying.

93
00:08:31,522 --> 00:08:33,402
I asked you to wake Si up.

94
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,762
I didn't ask you to provide
other services.

95
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:41,202
What are you saying, old lady?

96
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:42,922
That kid

97
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:47,442
who pees his bed until the third grade

98
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,962
is all grown up now.

99
00:08:52,162 --> 00:08:56,882
-So you think you can disrespect me now?
-Mrs. Yu, stop it.

100
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:01,282
Who changed your sheets

101
00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:04,402
every time you wet your bed?

102
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:08,082
And who always cried saying,

103
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,922
"Don't tell my sister"?

104
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:13,642
Si.

105
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:16,482
Have you forgotten already?

106
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:18,082
Mrs. Yu.

107
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:20,922
That's ancient history. Don't bring it up.

108
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:22,882
And you're even saying them
in front of a girl.

109
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:26,802
Shancai, I dare you to laugh.

110
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,642
Didn't you retire
due to a bad back a year ago?

111
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:36,682
Why did you come back
when my mom asked you to?

112
00:09:37,362 --> 00:09:40,842
Do I look like someone's puppet?

113
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:43,642
This time,

114
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:46,642
even though the president was the one
who asked me to come back,

115
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:50,242
I decide how to organize

116
00:09:50,762 --> 00:09:52,282
this household.

117
00:09:53,682 --> 00:09:55,122
No matter who he is,

118
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:57,482
if he's wrong,

119
00:09:58,242 --> 00:09:59,562
I won't be lenient with him.

120
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:03,082
Shancai.

121
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:06,522
Shouldn't you get back to work outside?

122
00:10:06,602 --> 00:10:07,642
Yes.

123
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:20,402
Mrs. Yu.

124
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:24,042
Did my mom send you to spy on me?

125
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:29,402
Si.

126
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:31,842
What did you do

127
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:36,762
to need such supervision and re-education?

128
00:10:45,642 --> 00:10:47,962
-What happened to Shancai?
-I'm not sure.

129
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:50,282
Didn't she write a post
in QZone saying she's fine?

130
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:52,602
Yes, but I don't know where she is now.

131
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:54,962
Stop worrying.
You'd see her later in class.

132
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:00,202
-Shancai.
-Shancai.

133
00:11:00,962 --> 00:11:02,482
Why are you with Daoming Si?

134
00:11:04,682 --> 00:11:06,122
Did you spend the night together?

135
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:09,322
Well...

136
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,202
Shancai, we'll be late. Let's go.

137
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:15,082
-We'll go to class first.
-All right.

138
00:11:15,162 --> 00:11:16,122
Come on. Hurry.

139
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:19,522
Daoming Si, just wait.

140
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:20,762
Just you wait.

141
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:22,362
Shancai.

142
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:32,962
So Shancai's been staying with you
after she was driven out by her landlady?

143
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:34,722
Yes.

144
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:36,482
She even woke me up this morning.

145
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,402
What? Did I hear you right?

146
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:40,522
She woke you up?

147
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:42,922
That means...

148
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,322
I mean

149
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:51,042
I can see the person I like
when I wake up every day.

150
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:00,762
What's going on?

151
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:03,122
Shancai is a cleaner at your house?

152
00:12:03,802 --> 00:12:05,202
That's ridiculous.

153
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,122
How can you develop

154
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:10,402
such a unique love story
when you're with Shancai?

155
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:13,082
Because they're both not normal.

156
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,642
By the way, I saw your application, Si.

157
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:19,962
You're going to graduate school?

158
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:21,882
Yes.

159
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:23,362
Shancai is a sophomore.

160
00:12:23,962 --> 00:12:26,522
We'll graduate together
if I stay two more years.

161
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:28,442
Does Shancai know?

162
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,722
Not yet.

163
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:34,482
However, I have to personally
hear her say those three words.

164
00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:35,762
Which three words?

165
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:38,442
You are annoying, stay far away,
you stupid fool.

166
00:12:38,522 --> 00:12:39,602
Or...

167
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:41,442
He he he?

168
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,842
It seems you already have a perfect plan.

169
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:46,602
Don't worry.

170
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:48,442
I've got it all planned out.

171
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:56,962
<i>I never thought I'd live
in the same house as Daoming Si,</i>

172
00:12:57,362 --> 00:12:58,842
<i>especially working at his house.</i>

173
00:13:00,602 --> 00:13:02,762
<i>I wonder how my parents
are doing in the fishing village.</i>

174
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:04,642
<i>I hope they can come back soon.</i>

175
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:07,242
<i>And we'll live happily as a family again.</i>

176
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:09,682
<i>No.</i>

177
00:13:09,842 --> 00:13:11,082
<i>I can't feel discouraged.</i>

178
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:15,202
<i>I have to live well for my parents
and not worry them.</i>

179
00:13:17,122 --> 00:13:18,602
The calories it contains...

180
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:28,002
Your meal is ready.

181
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:29,842
Please enjoy.

182
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:41,602
Eat with me.

183
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:43,042
I can't.

184
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,962
I can't eat with you when I'm working.

185
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:46,282
Why not?

186
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:48,482
It's against Mrs. Yu's rules.

187
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,642
You can if I say you can.

188
00:13:56,362 --> 00:13:57,242
All right.

189
00:14:10,522 --> 00:14:11,602
Can we eat now?

190
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:14,402
I'll meet you at midnight.

191
00:14:24,882 --> 00:14:25,722
<i>What should I do?</i>

192
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:27,842
<i>Why does he want to meet me?</i>

193
00:14:31,962 --> 00:14:35,002
<i>How about I just pretend to be asleep?</i>

194
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:38,162
<i>No.</i>

195
00:14:38,362 --> 00:14:40,202
<i>He must have the key to this room.</i>

196
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:46,282
<i>No.</i>

197
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:47,802
<i>With his bad temper,</i>

198
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:51,082
<i>he'll wake everyone up
if he can't come in.</i>

199
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:55,242
<i>When that happens,
it would cause a huge misunderstanding.</i>

200
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:59,402
<i>What should I do?</i>

201
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:11,402
<i>What should I do with Daoming Si?</i>

202
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:12,722
<i>He just does whatever he wants.</i>

203
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:14,522
<i>He never cares
about what other people feel.</i>

204
00:16:15,482 --> 00:16:19,202
<i>He might do something extreme.</i>

205
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:22,002
<i>What if...</i>

206
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:27,082
<i>No. It's too dangerous.</i>

207
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,122
<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>

208
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:32,282
<i>I'll just spend a night at Xiaoyou's.</i>

209
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:34,642
<i>I'll deal with him tomorrow.</i>

210
00:16:51,522 --> 00:16:52,802
<i>Why are you so slow?</i>

211
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:54,442
<i>Were you hatching eggs in the bedroom?</i>

212
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:58,122
It's very late now.

213
00:16:58,522 --> 00:17:00,522
-I think--
-There are many things

214
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:03,002
that we can only do at night.

215
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:04,562
No.

216
00:17:04,642 --> 00:17:06,842
We can't do it regardless
if it's daytime or night time.

217
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,562
I've already made a decision.

218
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,202
I won't be shy.

219
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:21,642
Why did you ask me to come here?

220
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:24,042
To watch you launch a rocket?

221
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:26,122
Are you stupid?

222
00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:28,322
You're the stupid one.

223
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,922
You don't know how to set it.

224
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:34,722
Who doesn't know that's a telescope?

225
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:41,402
That's strange.

226
00:17:41,722 --> 00:17:44,162
It's tonight for sure.

227
00:17:45,962 --> 00:17:49,162
You asked me to come here to look at this?

228
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:54,642
Why are you laughing?

229
00:17:54,882 --> 00:17:56,242
Don't distract me.

230
00:17:58,602 --> 00:17:59,842
I'm heading back to sleep.

231
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:03,002
Can't you just look
in the mirror to see a Martian?

232
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,082
I found it. Come and see it.

233
00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:06,562
-See what?
-Come and take a look.

234
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:08,802
Do you see it?

235
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,762
Yes. It's so beautiful.

236
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:12,682
-Let me see.
-Okay.

237
00:18:12,762 --> 00:18:13,642
Let me see it.

238
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:16,002
Let me see it again.

239
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,002
It's really beautiful.

240
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,562
Stupid girl.

241
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,282
Aside from that,
can't you say anything else?

242
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:26,602
It's so spectacular.

243
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:30,722
It's like thousands of diamonds
falling from the sky.

244
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:31,922
It's so nice.

245
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:37,122
Then...

246
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:39,442
Do you like it?

247
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:45,882
Yes, I do.

248
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:49,242
But it's too short.

249
00:18:51,402 --> 00:18:54,322
I wonder how many decades later
it will take to see it again?

250
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:56,802
It'd be nice if I can see it every day.

251
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:00,602
You want to see it every day?

252
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:03,402
Then close your eyes and make a wish.

253
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:05,002
Maybe it'll come true.

254
00:19:06,642 --> 00:19:08,962
I'm not a kindergarten student.

255
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,242
Do you think I'll believe that?

256
00:19:12,082 --> 00:19:13,802
How would you know if you don't try?

257
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,002
All right.

258
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:37,962
I'll put it on for you.

259
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:40,962
No. It's too expensive.
I can't accept this.

260
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:42,162
Don't move.

261
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,082
This gift has a special meaning.

262
00:20:05,642 --> 00:20:06,922
So you can't refuse it.

263
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:12,802
Why are you so overbearing?

264
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,682
Because you're the only one
I'm willing to trade all the meteors

265
00:20:23,362 --> 00:20:24,282
in the sky for.

266
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:33,082
Shancai.

267
00:20:34,122 --> 00:20:35,082
Be my girlfriend.

268
00:21:13,202 --> 00:21:14,202
Daoming Si.

269
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:17,562
I'm very moved that you like me so much.

270
00:21:18,162 --> 00:21:19,082
But...

271
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:26,722
But what?

272
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:33,402
If my feelings for you

273
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:37,482
are only ten percent
of your feelings for me,

274
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:39,762
would you still want to be my boyfriend?

275
00:21:44,122 --> 00:21:45,482
Only ten percent?

276
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:50,882
I really hate the way you speak.

277
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:52,562
Sorry. I...

278
00:21:53,482 --> 00:21:56,482
I just wanted to tell you how I feel.

279
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:01,802
What if I couldn't like you

280
00:22:03,562 --> 00:22:04,602
the way you like me?

281
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:09,522
Then be my girlfriend.

282
00:22:10,482 --> 00:22:13,522
If you become my girlfriend,
I'll make up for the 90 percent.

283
00:22:16,522 --> 00:22:18,682
What if you couldn't make up for it?

284
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:22,362
It's fine if you don't trust yourself.

285
00:22:22,802 --> 00:22:24,802
But you trust me, right?

286
00:22:28,842 --> 00:22:29,922
I won't force you.

287
00:22:30,562 --> 00:22:32,122
But you have to give me chance, okay?

288
00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:34,802
If...

289
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:39,962
If you still don't like me after a month,

290
00:22:40,162 --> 00:22:41,242
I won't bother you again.

291
00:22:46,322 --> 00:22:47,402
Think about it carefully.

292
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:49,402
Give me an answer by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

293
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,402
Seven in the morning?

294
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:54,802
Isn't that only three hours away?

295
00:22:59,242 --> 00:23:01,722
Do you only need three minutes then?

296
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:03,962
Fine. 7:00 a.m. then.

297
00:23:34,202 --> 00:23:35,362
Daoming Si.

298
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,122
You should wake up.

299
00:23:39,322 --> 00:23:40,882
Can I come in and do the cleaning?

300
00:23:59,722 --> 00:24:00,842
I'll start cleaning.

301
00:24:03,962 --> 00:24:05,082
Aside from cleaning

302
00:24:05,842 --> 00:24:07,282
don't you have anything else to say?

303
00:24:18,842 --> 00:24:20,162
I want to say...

304
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:26,802
What do you want to say?

305
00:24:30,922 --> 00:24:32,842
Regarding the one month trial period,

306
00:24:33,442 --> 00:24:35,642
I think we can try it.

307
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,562
But it's not a trial period for you,
but for me.

308
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:43,002
I want to officially
and seriously date you.

309
00:24:44,722 --> 00:24:46,922
If I can't like you with all my heart,

310
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:49,482
then I'm the one who's leaving.

311
00:24:52,122 --> 00:24:53,162
So the answer is yes?

312
00:24:53,442 --> 00:24:54,282
Right?

313
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,282
Answer me.

314
00:25:00,962 --> 00:25:02,122
Yes.

315
00:25:36,562 --> 00:25:37,642
I don't know.

316
00:25:39,762 --> 00:25:41,602
Ask her yourself if you want to know.

317
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:46,162
-How can I ask her?
-How can I?

318
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:50,882
How is it?

319
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:52,402
We're still testing it.

320
00:25:55,402 --> 00:25:56,482
Your girlfriend's here.

321
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:04,802
Shancai, someone's waiting for you.

322
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:06,042
Go over there.

323
00:26:06,242 --> 00:26:07,802
I'll just sit here with Qinghe.

324
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:08,962
Why?

325
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:10,482
We usually sit together.

326
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:15,322
Shancai, let me ask you.

327
00:26:16,362 --> 00:26:18,962
Are you officially dating Daoming Si?

328
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:26,922
Why are you just standing there?
Come here.

329
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:36,202
Let's go.

330
00:26:38,802 --> 00:26:39,722
What are you doing?

331
00:26:40,882 --> 00:26:41,882
My goodness.

332
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:42,802
They're together?

333
00:26:42,922 --> 00:26:44,042
They're officially together?

334
00:26:44,802 --> 00:26:46,082
They're officially together.

335
00:26:46,162 --> 00:26:47,322
That's so surprising.

336
00:26:47,402 --> 00:26:48,842
-I'm so envious.
-I'm so envious.

337
00:26:48,922 --> 00:26:50,042
That's so surprising.

338
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:52,002
-That's right.
-She's so lucky.

339
00:26:52,082 --> 00:26:53,682
-Why isn't it me?
-What a lucky girl.

340
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:55,202
-That's right.
-It's so annoying.

341
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:57,522
-Look at them.
-Yes.

342
00:26:57,602 --> 00:26:59,442
-Shancai's so lucky.
-That's right.

343
00:27:00,842 --> 00:27:03,042
-They're together now?
-Daoming Si's so handsome.

344
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:05,042
So what? He's taken already.

345
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:06,722
-He's so cute.
-That's right.

346
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:07,922
Impossible. Stop dreaming.

347
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:13,162
He's so handsome.

348
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:20,882
Look.

349
00:27:21,162 --> 00:27:22,962
Shancai's so awkward
in front of Daoming Si.

350
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:24,722
It's so unnatural.

351
00:27:25,962 --> 00:27:26,842
Really?

352
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:28,362
I think they look good together.

353
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,122
Shancai's not usually like that.

354
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:32,562
I don't care. I won't allow them
to be together.

355
00:27:32,642 --> 00:27:34,162
Shut it.

356
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:38,002
Sorry.

357
00:27:38,602 --> 00:27:39,842
Why are you apologizing?

358
00:27:44,722 --> 00:27:46,042
What's wrong?

359
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:52,322
I'm not used to this.

360
00:27:57,122 --> 00:27:58,082
That's understandable.

361
00:27:58,162 --> 00:28:01,202
All eyes would be on you
if you're with someone like me.

362
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,042
It's normal to not be used to it.

363
00:28:03,722 --> 00:28:04,842
However...

364
00:28:08,202 --> 00:28:11,202
You can't use this reason
to reject me after a month.

365
00:28:19,122 --> 00:28:20,082
Eat up.

366
00:28:26,002 --> 00:28:28,722
You're dating?
And you're living in his house?

367
00:28:30,362 --> 00:28:31,602
Congratulations.

368
00:28:31,682 --> 00:28:34,122
You're finally together
after such a long time.

369
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:38,082
Why do you look so worried?

370
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:41,202
Aren't you happy with Daoming Si's
love confession?

371
00:28:43,082 --> 00:28:44,322
You don't understand.

372
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:49,842
I just ate at the cafeteria
and all eyes were on me.

373
00:28:50,682 --> 00:28:53,602
I felt like a freak in a jar

374
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:55,602
at a medical laboratory.

375
00:28:56,922 --> 00:28:58,362
I couldn't eat.

376
00:28:58,602 --> 00:28:59,922
How would I be happy?

377
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:02,962
I don't think that would work.

378
00:29:04,562 --> 00:29:05,842
Me too.

379
00:29:06,842 --> 00:29:10,162
But how can we date like this?

380
00:29:12,162 --> 00:29:13,642
Don't think too much.

381
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:16,242
Tell me what's your ideal date.

382
00:29:19,522 --> 00:29:23,282
An ideal date should be

383
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:26,122
going to the library to study together.

384
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:29,482
Then shopping and walking together,

385
00:29:30,242 --> 00:29:31,602
watching movies together,

386
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:34,402
and eating in
popular restaurants together.

387
00:29:35,322 --> 00:29:36,482
Then do it.

388
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:37,722
What are you worried about?

389
00:29:38,762 --> 00:29:39,762
But...

390
00:29:40,602 --> 00:29:43,482
But these don't seem like the things
Daoming Si would like to do.

391
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:45,842
Shancai.

392
00:29:46,122 --> 00:29:48,642
When two people are together,
they have to understand

393
00:29:48,722 --> 00:29:49,882
and adjust to each other.

394
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:53,882
If he really likes you,
he'll adjust for you.

395
00:29:55,362 --> 00:30:00,042
This month, you can test him
and see if he really likes you.

396
00:30:03,962 --> 00:30:05,882
But how would I ask him out?

397
00:30:11,682 --> 00:30:12,522
I know.

398
00:30:12,802 --> 00:30:15,442
I'm going on a date
with my boyfriend this weekend.

399
00:30:15,642 --> 00:30:17,042
Bring Daoming Si along.

400
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:20,522
My boyfriend and I usually do
the things you've mentioned.

401
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:23,602
We'll see if Daoming Si can adjust to you.

402
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:29,122
Xiaoyou.

403
00:30:29,882 --> 00:30:31,402
When did you have a boyfriend?

404
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:32,482
You didn't tell me.

405
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:33,762
Who is it?

406
00:30:34,322 --> 00:30:36,122
I wanted to tell you a long time ago.

407
00:30:36,522 --> 00:30:38,202
But weren't you in a bad mood lately?

408
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:40,082
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

409
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:43,002
He's my classmate.

410
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:45,642
He took me home
when it was raining one time.

411
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:49,402
Then he kissed me at my door.

412
00:30:49,962 --> 00:30:52,242
He kissed you the first time
he took you home?

413
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:55,922
He's so romantic.

414
00:30:57,082 --> 00:30:58,442
I really like him.

415
00:31:00,122 --> 00:31:02,362
Xiaoyou, I'm really happy for you.

416
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:05,002
And I'm really curious
about what type of person he is

417
00:31:05,402 --> 00:31:06,922
to make you like him so much.

418
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:12,842
So bring Daoming Si
and let's have a double date.

419
00:31:14,722 --> 00:31:15,562
All right.

420
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,882
I think the topic of your thesis is great.

421
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,282
But it has to be more focused.

422
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:23,882
I don't think so.

423
00:31:23,962 --> 00:31:24,802
Look at this.

424
00:31:25,362 --> 00:31:26,842
-What's the matter?
-Have some fruit.

425
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:51,162
It's really delicious.

426
00:32:03,642 --> 00:32:04,642
Hey.

427
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:06,522
Know your places.

428
00:32:06,602 --> 00:32:08,522
She can only feed me.

429
00:32:18,962 --> 00:32:19,842
-Go on.
-Hey.

430
00:32:19,922 --> 00:32:21,442
-Why did you choose this?
-Look at this.

431
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,602
What do you want to say?

432
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:24,402
Come out for a while.

433
00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:25,922
I have something to tell you.

434
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:28,722
Just say it here.

435
00:32:29,122 --> 00:32:30,602
By the way, Ximen, scroll down.

436
00:32:30,722 --> 00:32:31,562
Okay.

437
00:32:32,722 --> 00:32:34,042
Do you see this? This one.

438
00:32:34,122 --> 00:32:35,842
-The topic won't work.
-Let's go on a date.

439
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:50,562
Shancai, you're incredible.

440
00:32:51,282 --> 00:32:53,562
Little Miss Shancai is making
the first move now.

441
00:32:58,722 --> 00:33:02,482
Well, do you still remember
my good friend Xiaoyou?

442
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:05,322
Yes, the one who works with you.

443
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,322
She's thin with round eyes. Very cute.

444
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:09,482
Don't get any ideas about her.

445
00:33:09,562 --> 00:33:11,002
I'm just complimenting your friend.

446
00:33:13,122 --> 00:33:14,722
What exactly are you trying to say?

447
00:33:19,282 --> 00:33:21,282
Let's have a double date
with Xiaoyou and her boyfriend.

448
00:33:21,362 --> 00:33:23,562
On Sunday at 11:00 a.m. at the theme park.

449
00:33:23,722 --> 00:33:25,682
Just treat it as a date with me.

450
00:33:31,282 --> 00:33:33,882
Never mind. If you didn't hear clearly.
I'll take it as a yes.

451
00:33:35,202 --> 00:33:36,762
This is the legendary double date.

452
00:33:37,322 --> 00:33:38,882
The famous double date 20 years ago.

453
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:43,882
You want me to go out
with someone I don't know?

454
00:33:43,962 --> 00:33:45,282
Who says you don't know her?

455
00:33:45,602 --> 00:33:48,322
Xiaoyou's my friend. Just adjust to it.

456
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,162
Adjust? Why?

457
00:33:54,602 --> 00:33:55,482
It's a bit outdated,

458
00:33:56,082 --> 00:33:58,242
but it's the first time Shancai
asked you out.

459
00:33:58,722 --> 00:34:01,442
Si, you can play
a supporting role for once.

460
00:34:01,762 --> 00:34:03,282
Won't you do it for Shancai?

461
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:05,962
How boring. I got excited over nothing.

462
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:08,362
Why are you making that face?

463
00:34:08,602 --> 00:34:11,082
It's just the first day
of the one month period.

464
00:34:11,402 --> 00:34:12,762
Can't you just try it once?

465
00:34:14,122 --> 00:34:15,802
I don't want to do it. No way.

466
00:34:21,242 --> 00:34:22,362
You know how he is.

467
00:34:22,882 --> 00:34:24,322
Don't worry about it.

468
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:25,642
Shancai. You know him.

469
00:34:26,282 --> 00:34:29,242
If Si really goes there,
that would truly be awkward.

470
00:34:30,722 --> 00:34:31,602
Never mind.

471
00:34:31,882 --> 00:34:33,522
I won't ever ask him out again.

472
00:34:34,082 --> 00:34:35,362
Can't he just adjust a bit?

473
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:41,842
Big stupid fool!

474
00:34:41,962 --> 00:34:42,962
Good night.

475
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:51,842
Sorry, Xiaoyou.

476
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:54,842
Daoming Si...

477
00:34:55,922 --> 00:34:57,442
attended a friend's wedding.

478
00:34:58,682 --> 00:34:59,682
Which friend?

479
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:03,082
That friend...

480
00:35:04,962 --> 00:35:05,922
Never mind.

481
00:35:07,682 --> 00:35:10,242
Daoming Si slipped and fell
when he walked out the door earlier.

482
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:14,362
I won't even believe that.

483
00:35:14,442 --> 00:35:15,482
Shancai.

484
00:35:19,002 --> 00:35:20,882
Sorry, we weren't able to catch the train.

485
00:35:20,962 --> 00:35:23,002
We had to wait.
This is my boyfriend, Xiaoqi.

486
00:35:23,082 --> 00:35:25,802
Hi, I'm Zhang Ziqi. Just call me Xiaoqi.
That makes us sound closer.

487
00:35:28,282 --> 00:35:29,482
Hi, I'm Dong Shancai.

488
00:35:31,082 --> 00:35:34,122
-Where is he?
-He might not make it.

489
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:35,682
He can't come?

490
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:39,122
Something came up at home.

491
00:35:39,562 --> 00:35:40,602
I'm really sorry.

492
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:41,682
It's fine.

493
00:35:41,802 --> 00:35:43,162
Let's have some burgers.

494
00:35:43,722 --> 00:35:44,762
No, you guys go ahead.

495
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,322
I don't want to intrude on your date.

496
00:35:55,242 --> 00:35:56,562
Traffic was bad.

497
00:35:58,482 --> 00:36:00,682
Daoming Si, is everything okay at home?

498
00:36:05,202 --> 00:36:06,362
Yes.

499
00:36:06,882 --> 00:36:08,002
Let me introduce you.

500
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,202
This is Daoming Si. Shancai's boyfriend.

501
00:36:20,522 --> 00:36:21,482
Hi.

502
00:36:26,682 --> 00:36:27,962
Why are you so shy?

503
00:36:28,362 --> 00:36:29,242
Let's take a picture.

504
00:36:33,002 --> 00:36:34,042
Say cheese.

505
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:35,722
All right.

506
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:36,922
Let's have some burgers.

507
00:36:37,002 --> 00:36:38,522
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

508
00:36:43,682 --> 00:36:44,962
Didn't you say you're not coming?

509
00:36:45,842 --> 00:36:47,722
Just this once.
There will be no second time.

510
00:36:51,282 --> 00:36:52,282
Why are you laughing?

511
00:36:53,522 --> 00:36:57,562
I'm laughing because you were like a robot

512
00:36:57,962 --> 00:37:00,562
learning his first movement
when you extended your hand earlier.

513
00:37:02,162 --> 00:37:03,162
You talk too much.

514
00:37:06,282 --> 00:37:08,242
What are you having?
Order whatever you want.

515
00:37:08,322 --> 00:37:09,242
My treat.

516
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:11,562
Don't be shy.

517
00:37:13,682 --> 00:37:14,522
This one.

518
00:37:18,482 --> 00:37:19,322
No.

519
00:37:19,962 --> 00:37:22,042
You're all grown up
and you're ordering a kid's meal?

520
00:37:22,802 --> 00:37:24,362
Your boyfriend is a child at heart.

521
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,322
Do you want a Minion toy with it?

522
00:37:26,762 --> 00:37:27,762
I want this one too.

523
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,042
Me too. It's so cute.

524
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:32,322
Let's order the same thing.

525
00:37:34,442 --> 00:37:35,482
All right.

526
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:40,282
What do you think?

527
00:37:40,362 --> 00:37:41,522
He's quite handsome, right?

528
00:37:42,482 --> 00:37:43,402
Yes.

529
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:45,882
But how do I say it?

530
00:37:46,882 --> 00:37:48,642
He's different than what I imagined.

531
00:37:58,842 --> 00:37:59,922
How tall are you?

532
00:38:00,402 --> 00:38:01,642
I'm 185cm.

533
00:38:02,202 --> 00:38:03,122
You're 185cm?

534
00:38:03,602 --> 00:38:04,602
No wonder.

535
00:38:05,002 --> 00:38:06,162
You can be a model.

536
00:38:06,962 --> 00:38:09,242
I was wondering
why your name is Shaolin Si.

537
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:11,202
Turns out your mom has foresight, right?

538
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:13,242
It's Daoming Si.

539
00:38:13,962 --> 00:38:14,882
Don't mind him.

540
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:16,202
He just likes to make jokes.

541
00:38:21,002 --> 00:38:21,842
Do you smoke?

542
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:26,602
I knew it. You look like such a good boy.
Surely you don't smoke.

543
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:29,402
Are you also a good boy at home?

544
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:37,362
Well...

545
00:38:38,402 --> 00:38:40,682
Where are we going later?
How about the theme park?

546
00:38:42,002 --> 00:38:43,922
All right. Let's go there after.

547
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,722
This pirate ship ride is so exciting.

548
00:38:54,802 --> 00:38:55,842
Let's go on it together.

549
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:01,482
Daoming Si.

550
00:39:02,162 --> 00:39:03,322
You're so tall.

551
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:05,362
You're not afraid, right?

552
00:39:06,002 --> 00:39:06,882
No problem.

553
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:09,242
I'll go with the girls, all right?

554
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:10,522
-Let's go.
-No.

555
00:39:11,242 --> 00:39:12,402
I'm the one who's afraid.

556
00:39:12,962 --> 00:39:14,002
You two go ahead.

557
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:16,362
Daoming Si and I will just walk around.

558
00:39:27,562 --> 00:39:28,882
Looks like

559
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,122
they have a good relationship, right?

560
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,122
Dong Shancai.

561
00:39:32,682 --> 00:39:34,522
This is the double date
you were talking about?

562
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:36,282
What kind of person is that?

563
00:39:36,482 --> 00:39:38,482
Why would your friend
be with such a freak?

564
00:39:38,722 --> 00:39:39,722
What are you thinking?

565
00:39:41,242 --> 00:39:43,882
All right. If you don't want to stay,
let's just go home.

566
00:39:43,962 --> 00:39:45,082
No.

567
00:39:48,482 --> 00:39:49,842
I mean

568
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:52,522
it'd be awkward for you if I leave.

569
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:02,642
I think you look really handsome...

570
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:04,842
today.

571
00:40:06,002 --> 00:40:06,962
Don't worry.

572
00:40:07,162 --> 00:40:10,042
I won't beat him up even though
that guy is really infuriating.

573
00:40:11,922 --> 00:40:12,882
Really?

574
00:40:13,242 --> 00:40:15,722
Even if I'm so mad, I won't beat him up.

575
00:40:15,802 --> 00:40:17,082
Let's go.

576
00:40:21,602 --> 00:40:23,642
THOMAS THE TRAIN

577
00:40:39,802 --> 00:40:42,562
-What is this?
-This is a very famous haunted house.

578
00:40:42,642 --> 00:40:44,202
It's only in Shanghai for a few days.

579
00:40:44,282 --> 00:40:45,402
I don't want to miss it.

580
00:40:45,482 --> 00:40:47,322
Haunted house? I'm not going.

581
00:40:47,882 --> 00:40:48,882
Why?

582
00:40:50,002 --> 00:40:51,882
It looks boring. What's so good about it?

583
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:53,962
But I really want to go.

584
00:40:54,562 --> 00:40:55,602
Come with me.

585
00:41:02,282 --> 00:41:03,362
I can't say no to you.

586
00:41:14,802 --> 00:41:16,802
ENTRANCE

587
00:41:29,162 --> 00:41:30,202
It's so dark.

588
00:41:30,642 --> 00:41:32,922
I feel like I can't see anything.

589
00:41:35,282 --> 00:41:36,242
I'm so nervous.

590
00:41:36,402 --> 00:41:37,362
It's so exciting.

591
00:41:38,082 --> 00:41:39,042
How is it exciting?

592
00:41:39,402 --> 00:41:41,362
I told you. These things are fake.

593
00:41:52,722 --> 00:41:53,722
Why are you laughing?

594
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,202
Haven't I told you already?
These things are not scary at all.

595
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:58,042
Stay behind me and follow me.

596
00:42:42,362 --> 00:42:43,642
I told you it would be fine.

597
00:42:43,722 --> 00:42:44,602
Let's go.

598
00:42:55,202 --> 00:42:56,082
Sorry.

599
