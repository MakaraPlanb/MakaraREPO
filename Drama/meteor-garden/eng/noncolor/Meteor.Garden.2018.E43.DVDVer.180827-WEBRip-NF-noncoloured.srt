EPISODE 43

4
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,079
<i>Something happened to Daoming Si.
Watch the live broadcast on Now.</i>

5
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,359
<i>At around 11 a.m. yesterday,</i>

6
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,439
<i>Daoming Si, the successor
of Daoming Group,</i>

7
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:11,839
<i>was stabbed by an unknown person.</i>

8
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:14,439
<i>It was reported that Daoming Si
fell into a coma.</i>

9
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:17,799
<i>He's still undergoing emergency treatment
and is in critical condition.</i>

10
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,879
Don't worry.

11
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,119
Shancai called to say she's fine.

12
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,639
<i>The perpetrator
who was arrested at the scene</i>

13
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,359
<i>was a former employee
of the Daoming Group.</i>

14
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,479
<i>His motive is yet unknown
and the investigation is still pending.</i>

15
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,519
Lei.

16
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,199
He was covered in blood.

17
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:03,439
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

18
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,519
Am I too greedy?

19
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,599
That's why the heavens are punishing us.

20
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:20,239
This is not a punishment. It's a test.

21
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,879
People who can surpass this test
can obtain happiness.

22
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,279
<i>The patient's stab wound is too deep.
He lost a lot of blood.</i>

23
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,279
<i>The brain suffered local contusion
due to severe impact.</i>

24
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,719
Why did this happen? Who exactly hurt Si?

25
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:34,399
We have already arrested two suspects.

26
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:35,759
And they already confessed

27
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,439
that they were former employees
of the Daoming Group's hotel chain.

28
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,119
The hotel closed down due to
poor management and they lost their jobs.

29
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,279
So they wanted revenge.

30
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:51,199
Also, Ms. He Yuanzi also confessed

31
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,439
that the kidnapping on the island
was a prank of hers.

32
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:55,599
Aren't you aware of that?

33
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,479
Ms. Xiaozi invited us for a party
on their island.

34
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,119
We just found out about the prank
after we arrived.

35
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,639
But our phones didn't have any signal,
so we couldn't contact the police.

36
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:09,479
Okay. Please come to the station
to record your statement.

37
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,159
The three of us will go with you first.

38
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:15,679
Please give Shancai more time...

39
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,359
-for her statement.
-All right.

40
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,519
You can come with us first.

41
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:42,879
Doctor.

42
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,959
-How is Daoming Si?
-The surgery was a success.

43
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:47,919
The patient is out of danger.

44
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,119
However, his skull
suffered a severe impact,

45
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,479
which may result to clogging
of blood vessels or compressed nerves.

46
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,239
We still have to determine
whether it would have any after-effect.

47
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,119
You can visit him in his room later.

48
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,719
-Thank you, Doctor.
-You're welcome.

49
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:18,559
Shancai.

50
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,159
I just finished recording my statement
at the police station.

51
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:26,679
I brought some food and clothes for you.

52
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:30,639
Sorry.

53
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,519
If it wasn't because of me,

54
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,839
Si wouldn't have been stabbed.

55
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,119
It's not your fault.

56
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,719
You don't need to feel guilty.

57
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,079
I caused so much trouble.

58
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,599
Actually,

59
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,879
I can't even look you two in the eye.

60
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:54,959
I know you did it so Daoming Si
and I can be together.

61
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,039
Stay and wait with me

62
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:01,919
until he wakes up.

63
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,639
With you around,
I'll feel brave and more confident.

64
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:08,639
Really?

65
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,199
Yes.

66
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:14,399
Shancai.

67
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:16,319
You're so kind.

68
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,319
Mrs. Daoming, Daoming Si is--

69
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,599
The doctor will tell me how he's doing.

70
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:33,639
Shancai.

71
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,719
It must have been hard for you.

72
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:55,639
It's a good thing he's safe.

73
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:01,039
Thank God Daoming Si is all right.

74
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,839
Xitian.

75
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:09,919
When's the next flight back to London?

76
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,439
There's a direct flight at 10 p.m.

77
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,039
Mrs. Daoming.

78
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,759
Aren't you staying at a time like this?

79
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:22,359
Si is already safe.

80
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,439
Stay and take care of him.

81
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:38,079
When will you stop dragging everyone
into this game you're playing?

82
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,839
-I--
-Mrs. Daoming.

83
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,799
If you handled the employee
matters properly,

84
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,399
Si wouldn't have been stabbed.

85
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,159
It's not Shancai's fault.

86
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,159
Xiaozi.

87
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,199
I think you seriously misunderstood me.

88
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,159
I'm working with your dad

89
00:08:57,439 --> 00:09:00,199
to push things in the right direction.

90
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,999
I'm quite fond of you. Don't abuse it.

91
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:07,199
And don't play childish games
with this girl anymore.

92
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,839
But Mrs. Daoming, I--

93
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:11,839
Shancai.

94
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,359
You once told me

95
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,919
that I'm not welcome in your world
and I should leave.

96
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:22,039
Now, I'm also telling you

97
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:25,519
that you're not welcome
in the Daoming family's world.

98
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:29,159
Please don't show yourself
in front of Si anymore.

99
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,159
You can shut me out of your world,

100
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,119
but Daoming Si has to be part of mine.

101
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,639
Whatever happens,

102
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,439
I'll stay here

103
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,679
until Daoming Si wakes up.

104
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,679
If he wants me out of his world,

105
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,599
I want to hear him say it himself.

106
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,119
You will soon enough.

107
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:20,959
How's Si?

108
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,639
He's not awake yet.

109
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,639
Come and wait inside.

110
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:29,359
Daoming Si.

111
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,959
You're finally awake.

112
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,119
Where am I?

113
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:15,879
Why am I here?

114
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:24,479
Si, you were seriously hurt
and you were in a coma for a few days.

115
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,639
I was hurt?

116
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,159
Yes.

117
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:55,799
Who is she?

118
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,759
Si, are you not fully awake yet

119
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,159
or did you lose your memory,
like what the doctor mentioned?

120
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:09,759
Hey, do you know who I am?

121
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,119
Ximen.

122
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,959
-How about me?
-Meizuo.

123
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:13,999
How about him?

124
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,399
Lei. Why are you even asking me that?

125
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,039
Then who am I?

126
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:29,919
Monkey. Ugly Monster.

127
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:32,199
Stop it.

128
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:37,879
You scared me.
I thought you've lost your memory.

129
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,239
Then who is she?

130
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:46,119
What is she doing here?

131
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,279
Si, cut it out.

132
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,799
How can you remember all of us
but not Shancai?

133
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,639
Shancai?

134
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,399
What a lousy name.

135
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,999
It'll be all right.

136
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,159
He just woke up.
His brain is still a mess.

137
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:13,599
That's right.

138
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,239
They love each other so much.
I don't believe he's forgotten her.

139
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,679
Shancai.

140
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,279
How about you tell him what happened
between you two?

141
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:37,679
-Maybe it'll help him remember.
-Yes.

142
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,039
Green shoes.

143
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,159
Do you still remember

144
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,519
that you stepped on my phone and broke it?

145
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,279
I went to the opening ceremony

146
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:04,799
and your fans pushed me around.

147
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,719
So I dropped my phone
and it broke when you stepped on it.

148
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,119
I even confronted you about it.

149
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,919
Do you still remember?

150
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,839
Hey, green shoe guy.

151
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,559
-What's this?
-A broken phone.

152
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:30,559
You broke it by stepping on it.

153
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,119
Hey.

154
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,799
And a lot of other things happened.

155
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,519
I watched the meteor shower with you
on your balcony.

156
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:53,279
You gave me a meteor necklace.

157
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,239
This gift has a special meaning.

158
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,319
So you can't refuse it.

159
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,559
Why are you so overbearing?

160
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:20,319
Because you're the only one
I'm willing to trade all the meteors

161
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:21,599
in the sky for.

162
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,719
And look at your phone.

163
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,599
In the Fantasy Westward Journey game,

164
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,479
-you gave me a Meteor Garden.
-All right. Stop.

165
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:37,519
I don't understand what you're saying.

166
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,319
Please don't forget me, okay?
You have to remember me.

167
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,239
Why do I have to remember you?

168
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,479
Because she's the one you love the most.

169
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:02,079
And because she also loves you the most.

170
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,719
The one who loves me the most...

171
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:15,199
Right?

172
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,679
Remove the word "right."

173
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,439
Yes.

174
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:24,039
I'm the one who loves you the most.

175
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:24,999
I'm telling you.

176
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:26,719
I am.

177
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:31,359
In London,

178
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:33,919
we promised each other

179
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:37,159
to also live happily in our next lives.

180
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:39,879
I've decided...

181
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:43,759
not to wait for our next life.

182
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,599
In this life,

183
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:48,799
I would always love you.

184
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:50,639
I will.

185
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,839
I definitely will.

186
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:55,519
It doesn't matter if you lost your memory.

187
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,399
I'll make you love me again.
I love you so much, do you know that?

188
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:19,439
Shancai.

189
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:22,199
Don't be that fierce.

190
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,639
Si's still recovering.

191
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,719
I don't care if you're still recovering.

192
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:33,079
I want to tell you that I, Dong Shancai,
will be with you no matter what.

193
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,319
You said that yourself.

194
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:48,279
If you lie, then you're a dog.

195
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,599
I knew you were lying.

196
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:01,599
How else can I listen
to her love confession?

197
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:04,439
I really admire my own intelligence.

198
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,959
You can even joke around
at a time like this.

199
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,279
You've gone too far.

200
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,239
This is great.

201
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,039
Everything's back to normal.

202
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,999
I don't mind if you hit him.

203
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,039
Shancai.

204
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,519
Go ahead.

205
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:31,319
Hey, Mrs. Yu. Whose side are you on?

206
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,839
By the way, Lei. Thanks.

207
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:39,199
Good thing you pushed the perpetrator
away at the right time.

208
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:41,479
I don't think a thank you is enough.

209
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,999
Who else would block that knife for you?

210
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,159
Why? Wouldn't you do it too?

211
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:53,159
-We'll think about it.
-We'll think about it.

212
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:54,079
You two.

213
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,319
Go home and reflect on yourselves.

214
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,759
Among my three friends,

215
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:01,919
at least one has a conscience.

216
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,599
It's true love between Lei and me.

217
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,879
Idiot.

218
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,919
You're holding your true love
in your hand.

219
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,199
Hey.

220
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,799
Let go of me.

221
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:28,679
Let go.

222
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,799
Let go now.

223
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,279
-I'll hit you.
-No.

224
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:35,719
Let go.

225
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:48,479
Mrs. Yu, Si seems to be fine.

226
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:51,159
You must be tired too. Go home and rest.

227
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,479
By the way, don't tell Mrs. Daoming
that Si has woken up.

228
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,159
I won't.

229
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,319
I'll only tell Zhuang.
So that she won't worry.

230
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:07,119
I'll go now.

231
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:21,759
Are you still mad?

232
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:25,559
Think of it this way.

233
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:29,239
Your love confession brought back
my memories.

234
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,839
You should be happy.

235
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,719
It really shocked you, right?

236
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:42,999
Yes.

237
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:46,599
I was really shocked

238
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,839
the moment I saw you get hurt.

239
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:54,239
When you were rushed
into the operating room,

240
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:58,799
I was so worried
and flustered the whole time.

241
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:08,039
Staring at the red light
of the operating room

242
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,439
was such torture.

243
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:14,279
Initially,

244
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:17,119
I just prayed that you'd wake up.

245
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:20,359
But I never thought

246
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,119
you'd forget me after you did.

247
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,599
When you looked at me like a stranger,

248
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:30,399
I was so flustered.

249
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,679
For a moment, I even thought

250
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:37,239
that maybe I tortured you too much

251
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:39,879
so the heavens

252
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,439
let you only forget about me.

253
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:47,799
I forgot the fact

254
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,119
that having you alive and well

255
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,719
is the most important thing.

256
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:10,679
You fool.

257
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:12,799
How can I forget about you?

258
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,879
We're like Velcro.

259
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,359
We can't be separated no matter what.

260
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,919
It's so great that Si's out of danger.

261
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,599
After going through grief and tests,

262
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:39,799
you'd know if what you have is true love.

263
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:43,759
It makes you quite envious, right?

264
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:46,639
I don't agree with your view on love.

265
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:48,519
If it were me,

266
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,839
I definitely wouldn't want
to go through such a test.

267
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,559
Maybe Meizuo's right.

268
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,239
Only true love can surpass the tests

269
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:01,399
and achieve real happiness.

270
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,959
Only people who've experienced it knows.

271
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:07,999
When did I experience it?

272
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,399
He's talking about you and Jing.

273
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,759
You two didn't pass your test.

274
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,439
So your love is like porcelain.

275
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:19,719
It broke with a touch.

276
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,239
What are you talking about?

277
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:27,239
The relationship between Jing and I

278
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,599
already turned into something
more intimate than love.

279
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,479
What is it then?

280
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:39,679
Loving each other forever
but not possessing each other.

281
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:43,279
Always remembering the best
about each other.

282
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,879
That is such a high level of love.

283
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,079
I salute you but I can't do it.

284
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,119
I'm also really envious.

285
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:05,999
Me too.

286
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:31,039
Mom, Dad. You're home.

287
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:32,719
We missed you.

288
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,279
Your mom saw the news
at the fishing village.

289
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,519
She was really worried.

290
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:38,959
Mom, I'm fine.

291
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,079
My poor daughter.

292
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,279
You stayed at the hospital
the past few days.

293
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:47,039
You didn't sleep well, right?

294
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,479
Yes. I'm so tired.

295
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:53,199
Of course you are.

296
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:56,519
Your dad and I are worried about you
so we came to visit.

297
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,439
How's Daoming Si?

298
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,239
He's fine now. Don't worry.

299
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,879
He's young. It's good that he's fine.

300
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,719
Should your mom and I
go visit him at the hospital?

301
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,759
There's no need.

302
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:15,479
You might meet his mom there.
Isn't that more uncomfortable?

303
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:20,719
All right. You get some sleep.

304
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,679
Okay.

305
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:23,919
Your dad and I will leave
in a couple of days.

306
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:26,279
It's winter vacation soon.

307
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,359
Do you want to spend
Chinese New Year with us there?

308
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:30,199
Of course.

309
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:32,399
We have to spend
Chinese New Year together.

310
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:37,759
Good. Go to bed.

311
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,679
Okay.

312
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,559
How is she?

313
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,399
She's already asleep.

314
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,959
She must be exhausted after what happened.

315
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,999
I just realized something.

316
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:08,479
Even though Daoming Si
is a very nice young man,

317
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:12,159
the gap between our families is too wide.

318
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:17,799
What happened this time is a warning.

319
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:20,839
They're still young anyway.

320
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,399
Later on, I'll try to convince Shancai...

321
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:28,839
and Daoming Si

322
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,079
to just be ordinary friends.

323
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:11,599
-She's here.
-Hurry.

324
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:12,919
-Dong Shancai.
-Hurry.

325
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,439
You're the girl who risked her life

326
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,719
and protected the successor
of the Daoming Group, right?

327
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,279
What's your relationship with Daoming Si?
Are you lovers?

328
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,239
Did you just risk your life
to do what's right?

329
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,759
-Tell us.
-Say something.

330
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,879
-Say something, okay?
-What's your relationship?

331
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:26,999
-Explain it.
-Can you respond?

332
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:30,079
-Say something.
-Please respond. What's your relationship?

333
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,119
-Are you lovers?
-Miss?

334
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,559
What exactly is your relationship?

335
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:34,159
Yes. What's your relationship?

336
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:35,759
-Please respond.
-Yes. Please respond.

337
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:36,719
Can you tell us?

338
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:38,399
Don't go.

339
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,919
-Tell us. Don't go.
-Don't run away.

340
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:43,119
Please respond.

341
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:45,279
Don't run away. Please respond.

342
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:47,119
-Tell us.
-Miss.

343
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:48,879
What exactly is your relationship?

344
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:50,759
Stay back. Back away.

345
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:51,799
Back away.

346
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:53,079
-Tell us. Don't go.
-Don't go.

347
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,199
-Please respond.
-Don't go.

348
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,199
-Don't run away. Let us interview you.
-Tell us.

349
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,399
Miss.

350
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,199
Shancai, you're so cool.

351
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:10,839
Weak and fragile girls are not in anymore.

352
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:13,159
What's in now is your type.

353
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:16,839
Why are you speaking that way?
Why are you making that expression?

354
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:18,399
Qinghe.

355
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:21,159
Are you Shancai's manager?

356
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,199
He's just a jealous little frog.

357
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,639
What?

358
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,239
Shancai.

359
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:36,679
You're my goddess from now on.
Love you. See you later. Bye.

360
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,279
They like Shancai now.

361
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,399
Shancai, are you all right?

362
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:48,719
Qinghe, Xiaoyou, and I
are so worried about you.

363
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,439
We originally wanted to visit
Daoming Si at the hospital.

364
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:55,399
But we called Ximen
and he asked us not to go.

365
00:31:56,639 --> 00:31:58,439
I'm fine. Thanks.

366
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,359
Shancai is my idol forever.

367
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:03,959
How could you be so brave?

368
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:06,759
Weren't you afraid of the other
perpetrators that could be hiding?

369
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,599
How could I care about that?

370
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:13,119
There was only one thing on my mind
when I saw him collapse.

371
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,039
I have to help him get up.
I have to save him.

372
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,799
If it were me,

373
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:20,559
-you would've done the same, right?
-Chen Qinghe.

374
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:23,399
-You're really the King of Jealousy.
-You...

375
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,679
Hey.

376
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:27,999
Qinghe's my best friend.
Of course I'd save him.

377
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,439
It's enough to hear that.

378
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:32,639
I'm willing to be
your best friend forever.

379
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:36,639
I, Chen Qinghe, hereby wish Shancai
and Daoming Si happiness forever.

380
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,479
I officially withdraw from pursuing you.

381
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:43,439
Unless...

382
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:45,959
you abandon Daoming Si.

383
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,479
Or unless Daoming Si abandons you.

384
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,159
And unless

385
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:52,559
-their birth details are not compatible--
-That's enough.

386
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:56,679
No.

387
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:58,959
I haven't said everything yet.

388
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:13,199
Don't worry. I'm fine.
You don't need to come.

389
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,399
All right. Tell me.

390
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:16,319
What's your sister's name?

391
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:17,439
Are you an idiot?

392
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,879
You're calling me an idiot?

393
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:22,519
I mean only an idiot wouldn't know
your name is Daoming Zhuang.

394
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:26,279
The world's most beautiful
and talented sister.

395
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:28,439
All right. You seem fine.

396
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,759
That's right.

397
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,199
<i>But you really scared me.</i>

398
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,919
I was already so mad when you got hurt
all over from fighting before

399
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:40,119
because you didn't take
good care of yourself.

400
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,279
I know.

401
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:42,959
It won't happen again.

402
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,439
But it's not your fault this time.

403
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:47,039
I'm mad at Mom.

404
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:52,159
Actually, it's not all her fault.

405
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:55,159
<i>She's to blame for everything
related to the Daoming Group.</i>

406
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:56,559
All right.

407
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:58,679
I'm fine now.

408
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,079
I'm telling you.

409
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,999
Somebody said that my ability to recover
is like that of a dog.

410
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:05,599
A dog?

411
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,439
I know. Shancai must have said that.

412
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,479
All right. I'll go ahead. Bye.

413
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,799
<i>I'll go and see you some time.</i>

414
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,479
Mrs. Yu.

415
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,239
Where are you going?

416
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,479
Mrs. Yu.

417
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:44,559
My wound...

418
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:46,759
is recovering.

419
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,439
I want to get discharged.

420
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,279
Discharged?

421
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:52,119
Yes.

422
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:55,639
I've been here for two weeks.

423
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,759
If I stay here longer,

424
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,719
I'm worried that my wound
might get infected.

425
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,359
Also,

426
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,199
I'll stay at Lei's house
for the time being.

427
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:09,999
I don't want to face my mom.

428
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:14,519
Your mom won't be back anytime soon.

429
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:18,999
She's busy with the London headquarters.

430
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:40,199
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

431
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:41,799
Can you be discharged?

432
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:46,439
I have the ability to recover
as fast as a dog anyway.

433
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:00,759
You look like you have something to say.
What is it?

434
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,559
I want to marry Shancai.

435
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:08,519
I'm fine with it.

436
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,559
Shancai's not fine with it.

437
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,959
Shancai's worried about your mom, right?

438
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:20,759
Actually, I've already thought about it.

439
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,559
I can make it on my own.
Why do I need to rely on my mom?

440
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:26,199
Don't forget.

441
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:29,919
When I was 18,
I made my first million in stock trading.

442
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:39,119
The point is that Shancai doesn't want you
and your mom to fight because of her.

443
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:42,399
You really know Shancai well.

444
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,159
Don't tell me you're jealous?

445
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:48,279
Not this time.

446
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,039
Actually, I already have a plan.

447
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:54,759
I'll marry Shancai first,

448
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:58,879
then I'll tell my mom the secret plan
I've long prepared.

449
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:03,559
And turn the Daoming Group
into a hotel group with a new concept.

450
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:07,079
What's your secret plan?

451
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:25,439
The secret plan is a secret, of course.

452
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,039
How can I tell you about it?

453
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,559
Good night.

454
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,839
-Your two Peach Red Royales.
-Thank you.

455
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,999
-Please come again.
-Bye.

456
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:51,759
Shancai, you're alone today?
Thanks for your hard work.

457
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,559
I'm fine, ma'am.

458
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,559
Why is Xiaoyou on leave today?

459
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:57,279
Did something happen?

460
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:59,319
-Xiaoyou?
-Yes.

461
00:37:59,399 --> 00:38:02,079
Oh, she said she's going
to a Way of Tea club.

462
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:05,599
And she'll help us come up
with new products.

463
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:08,639
How nice. She's so concerned
about the shop.

464
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:09,839
Of course.

465
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:13,639
Her dream is to open a franchise
of Talent's Tea Shop.

466
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:17,959
That's great.
She never mentioned that to me.

467
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:20,239
I have to ask her about it later on.

468
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:32,359
You two started working so hard here

469
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,319
since you graduated senior high school.

470
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:37,719
I'm so lucky to have you two.

471
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:42,959
We're also lucky to have
such a good employer who takes care of us.

472
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:55,439
Hi, everyone. My name is Jiang Xiaoyou.

473
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:57,279
I'm glad to join this Way of Tea club.

474
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:59,959
I hope I'll learn a lot from you.

475
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:01,839
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

476
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,359
You're so cute.

477
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:07,479
Yifen, the girls in our group
all have long hair, except you.

478
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,759
Now, Xiaoyou's here.

479
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:15,639
That's great or else they'll say
I look like a guy.

480
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:19,199
How come?

481
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,839
Your eyes are so big.
You look like a short-haired doll.

482
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:26,239
Speaking of dolls,
Yifen knows how to make them.

483
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:27,839
They're really cute.

484
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,039
Sometimes, our club has activities.

485
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,639
She sells her dolls with our tea leaves.

486
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,239
-They're really popular.
-Yes.

487
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:36,799
Really?

488
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:39,319
I really want to see how it looks.

489
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:41,479
Just ask her to make you one.

490
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:42,439
That's right.

491
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:43,799
Can you make me one?

492
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:47,039
Sure, but...

493
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,839
find me a boyfriend.

494
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,399
Stop pretending.

495
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:54,679
Every time someone pursues you,
you just ignore them.

496
00:39:54,799 --> 00:39:56,039
-That's right.
-That's right.

497
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:58,799
I have to feel a spark.

498
00:39:59,879 --> 00:40:01,919
What's your type then?

499
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,879
She likes men who know the Way of Tea.

500
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:07,839
But the guys who do are usually ugly.

501
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:08,759
That's right.

502
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,079
Why are you calling us ugly?
We're very unique, okay?

503
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:17,799
Xiaoyou, what's your type?

504
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,199
Like you, I also like men
who know the Way of Tea.

505
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:26,919
We have hope.

506
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:30,879
Xiaoyou, don't mind them.

507
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:32,719
Do they know the Way of Tea?

508
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:35,279
-They just know nonsense.
-You...

509
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:37,319
Yifen.

510
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:38,479
You're really...

511
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:41,199
You're so cute. I want
to take a picture with you.

512
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:42,759
All right.

513
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:46,399
Look. Short-haired girls are so cute.

514
00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:47,599
Yes. That's right.

515
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,359
What? Isn't long hair nice too?

516
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:51,079
Long-haired girls are very elegant, okay?

517
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,199
-That's right.
-Fine.

518
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:54,119
-All right.
-Elegant.

519
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:10,999
Good thing Daoming Si's fine now.
He recovered so fast.

520
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,519
-How lucky.
-Yes.

521
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:15,279
I was so worried then.

522
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:17,039
I thought he'd die.

523
00:41:17,799 --> 00:41:19,159
Or lose his memory or something.

524
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,359
I was so worried at the hospital.

525
00:41:22,879 --> 00:41:26,599
When I saw you on the news broadcast,
I was so shocked.

526
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:29,879
I still remember your expression then.

527
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:32,319
I really idolize you.

528
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:34,719
I'm such a coward compared to you.

529
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,119
What?

530
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:39,079
That was all adrenaline.

531
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,879
I didn't know what I was doing.

532
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:46,319
Should I buy something
to celebrate Daoming Si being discharged?

533
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,119
Flowers or something nutritious?

534
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,679
There's no need. Just be there.

535
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:54,439
What's important is that
we're all together.

536
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:02,759
But I'm not sure what to say

537
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:04,639
if I see Ximen.

538
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:14,119
Just treat him as Daoming Si's friend.

539
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:17,199
You haven't seen him for a while, right?

540
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:22,679
When you were in London,
I met him to ask about you.

541
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:25,879
He was quite cold to me.

542
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:31,439
Xiaoyou.

543
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:36,239
Stop obsessing over these things.

544
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:39,199
Maybe Ximen's not suitable for you.

545
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,239
Stop worrying about him.

546
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,199
Okay.
