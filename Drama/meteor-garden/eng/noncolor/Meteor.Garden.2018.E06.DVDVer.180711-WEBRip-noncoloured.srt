00:00:00,214 --> 00:00:02,054
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,956
METEOR GARDEN

3
00:01:27,214 --> 00:01:30,134
EPISODE 6

4
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:31,894
Fine.

5
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:33,694
If you don't know how to play Bridge,

6
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:35,334
you can set the rules.

7
00:01:35,774 --> 00:01:36,854
I'll decide what you wager.

8
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:37,974
Is that fair?

9
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:39,614
They're setting the rules?

10
00:01:40,654 --> 00:01:42,654
I'm never unfair to people.

11
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:47,734
You mean, we're not playing Bridge?

12
00:01:48,334 --> 00:01:49,734
We could play Five-card stud.

13
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:51,214
What stud?

14
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:53,574
What can you play?

15
00:01:54,374 --> 00:01:56,174
We'll compare hands.

16
00:01:57,014 --> 00:01:57,854
What?

17
00:01:58,214 --> 00:01:59,374
Compare hands?

18
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:01,574
We'll each pick a card
and compare them to see who wins.

19
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:03,574
Do you think this is kindergarten?

20
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,814
You said we could set the rules.

21
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:08,614
All right.

22
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:09,854
We'll compare hands.

23
00:02:10,454 --> 00:02:11,894
-Why aren't they out yet?
-Who won?

24
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:13,014
I think so too.

25
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:15,214
Shancai could never win, right?

26
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:16,734
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

27
00:02:16,814 --> 00:02:18,254
There's something wrong with her.

28
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:35,894
Regardless of which game,
F4 has never lost before.

29
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,374
One round. Go.

30
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:44,894
Pick a card.

31
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:56,014
<i>I only get one chance.</i>

32
00:02:56,774 --> 00:02:58,174
<i>Which one should I pick?</i>

33
00:02:58,974 --> 00:03:00,694
<i>We'll lose if I choose the wrong card.</i>

34
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:04,294
<i>I'm so nervous.</i>

35
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:10,054
<i>This one?</i>

36
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:11,814
<i>Or this one?</i>

37
00:03:12,294 --> 00:03:13,774
<i>I can't decide.</i>

38
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:15,574
Hey.

39
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:17,294
Are you done yet?

40
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:23,014
Ace of hearts.

41
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:24,414
You got the ace of hearts.

42
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:26,054
We won!

43
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:29,214
How about that?

44
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:30,974
We win, unless you get the ace of spades.

45
00:03:31,054 --> 00:03:32,134
Which is impossible.

46
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:34,734
Your turn.

47
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:57,614
How is that possible?

48
00:03:58,614 --> 00:03:59,494
Wait.

49
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:02,734
You shuffled the cards.
What if you're cheating?

50
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,894
Five of clubs.

51
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:31,254
Six of diamonds.

52
00:04:32,094 --> 00:04:33,174
Eight of hearts.

53
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:35,454
Jack of spades.

54
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:37,414
Two of spades.

55
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:39,454
Ten of diamonds.

56
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:43,454
Three of clubs, nine of diamonds,
five of hearts, king of hearts.

57
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:50,294
Wait.

58
00:04:52,614 --> 00:04:54,694
You don't have
the ace of spades. You lose.

59
00:04:57,734 --> 00:05:00,814
That's because it's in your pocket.

60
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,014
Why is it in my pocket?

61
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:10,774
Who put it in there?

62
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:16,414
Do you think the champion team
of the World Bridge Competition

63
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:17,854
would lose to you?

64
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:20,214
Meizuo has impeccable eyes.

65
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:23,134
He's second to none.

66
00:05:23,494 --> 00:05:26,054
No matter what we play,
you'll lose for sure.

67
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:28,774
So? Another round?

68
00:05:36,574 --> 00:05:37,694
We lost.

69
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:38,814
What do you want?

70
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:44,574
This is between you and Si.

71
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:45,734
We'll back out of this.

72
00:05:46,294 --> 00:05:47,774
What do you mean it's between them?

73
00:05:47,854 --> 00:05:48,734
What about me?

74
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:49,894
Hey. What are you doing?

75
00:05:50,374 --> 00:05:52,374
What will you do to Shancai? Hey!

76
00:05:52,494 --> 00:05:53,494
Let go!

77
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:54,854
Let go of me!

78
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:56,614
Daoming Si, come at me if you want!

79
00:05:56,694 --> 00:05:58,174
Don't touch Shancai!

80
00:05:58,254 --> 00:05:59,254
Let go!

81
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:00,774
What are you doing?

82
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:02,654
Let go!

83
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:05,174
So, what do you want from me?

84
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:07,094
Do I have to eat some slippers?

85
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:27,614
What do you want?

86
00:06:28,414 --> 00:06:29,254
Treat me to dinner.

87
00:06:31,054 --> 00:06:31,894
What did you say?

88
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:36,374
Stop pretending you can't hear me.

89
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,334
You did that last time at the airport.
Now you're doing it again.

90
00:06:39,894 --> 00:06:40,854
It's infuriating.

91
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:47,374
Treat.

92
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:48,494
Me.

93
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:49,574
To.

94
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:50,494
Dinner!

95
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:51,854
Did you hear me?

96
00:07:01,974 --> 00:07:02,974
QQ MESSAGE FROM DAOMING SI

97
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:06,254
<i>See you at 12:00 p.m.
at the Jiangwan Stadium Plaza.</i>

98
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:08,574
What does he want?

99
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:10,334
So weird.

100
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:16,974
Oh, it's Qinghe.

101
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:18,654
<i>Shancai, are you okay?</i>

102
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:21,534
Ximen and Meizuo just let me go.

103
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:22,974
I've been worried sick.

104
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:25,894
<i>Did they make you eat something weird?</i>

105
00:07:25,974 --> 00:07:27,134
Should we go to the hospital?

106
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:30,454
I would rather eat slippers.

107
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:31,574
<i>What?</i>

108
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:33,214
You ate slippers?

109
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:34,574
No, I mean--

110
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:36,494
Hello?

111
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:38,094
Hello?

112
00:07:39,854 --> 00:07:41,214
Hello?

113
00:07:44,694 --> 00:07:46,214
Stupid Si.

114
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,774
He's going to find
a way to bully me again.

115
00:07:49,174 --> 00:07:51,374
My phone is broken because of him.

116
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:53,734
I'm not going.

117
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,214
Let's see what he'll do.

118
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:06,574
SHANGHAI INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL HUB

119
00:08:17,974 --> 00:08:19,974
Shancai, what do you think of this one?

120
00:08:20,974 --> 00:08:22,894
It's nice. You can buy it if you like it.

121
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:24,374
We've been shopping for hours now.

122
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:25,654
You can't rush shopping.

123
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:27,134
It'll affect your decisions.

124
00:08:37,574 --> 00:08:38,654
Shancai, look.

125
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:40,334
Isn't this one nice?

126
00:08:40,414 --> 00:08:41,494
Here. Try it on.

127
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:43,974
This...

128
00:08:45,654 --> 00:08:46,694
It's so expensive.

129
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:47,894
Don't worry about that.

130
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:48,974
Hurry up and try it.

131
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:50,374
-Hurry.
-Okay.

132
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:52,894
It's getting colder. You need new clothes.

133
00:08:52,974 --> 00:08:54,494
You can't always wear your old ones.

134
00:08:55,814 --> 00:08:56,894
I know it would look nice.

135
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,654
Even though you aren't
as pretty as your mom,

136
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:02,094
your figure is acceptable.

137
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:05,814
It's raining.

138
00:09:07,774 --> 00:09:10,974
<i>Is he waiting for me?</i>

139
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:15,254
Mom, I need to be somewhere.

140
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:16,574
I'll meet up with you later.

141
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:19,894
Hey, I haven't paid for that yet.

142
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:22,934
Silly girl. We only have one umbrella.
How will I get home?

143
00:10:00,494 --> 00:10:02,054
He's still there.

144
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:14,214
Why are you standing here?

145
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:32,574
What are you doing? Let go.

146
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:33,694
It's cold.

147
00:10:33,814 --> 00:10:36,934
Do you know what time it is?
I've been waiting for three hours.

148
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:39,014
I never said I would come.

149
00:10:39,094 --> 00:10:41,134
You lost. You don't get to decide.

150
00:10:50,094 --> 00:10:51,894
You bought new clothes for our date?

151
00:10:53,974 --> 00:10:55,454
It's only 799 yuan? That's cheap.

152
00:10:57,454 --> 00:10:58,694
You should go home.

153
00:10:58,774 --> 00:10:59,974
Why did you keep waiting?

154
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:01,934
I couldn't reach you on your phone.

155
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:03,894
I was worried you came
and couldn't find me

156
00:11:03,974 --> 00:11:05,254
or that you had an accident.

157
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:07,174
I couldn't leave even
when it started to rain.

158
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:09,134
Fine.

159
00:11:09,214 --> 00:11:10,934
-Let's go indoors.
-Okay.

160
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:14,134
Over here.

161
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,294
Let me hold that. Silly girl.

162
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:23,094
Where are we going?

163
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,374
-To get food.
-What?

164
00:11:25,494 --> 00:11:27,574
Where are you taking me?

165
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:29,254
I know this place.

166
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:30,454
They have delicious food.

167
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,254
It's only 50 yuan per person.

168
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:33,174
Fifty yuan?

169
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:35,414
Are we having grass or something?

170
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,054
They have lots of options. It's great.

171
00:11:38,454 --> 00:11:39,774
Let's go.

172
00:11:40,814 --> 00:11:42,454
Can't you walk faster?

173
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:44,454
-Fine.
-You're so slow.

174
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:49,094
That's weird...

175
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:50,454
The shops aren't open here.

176
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:52,214
Thank god. Let's go.

177
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:54,414
-No.
-Why?

178
00:11:56,814 --> 00:11:57,814
I know another place.

179
00:11:58,294 --> 00:12:00,014
They have good noodles.

180
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:03,694
Let's go. Come on.

181
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:05,214
It's delicious.

182
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:08,134
-Hurry up.
-Fine.

183
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:23,254
What's going on?

184
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:25,054
Over there. This way.

185
00:12:26,774 --> 00:12:28,734
UNDER RENOVATION

186
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:32,774
I know another place up there that's good.

187
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:34,254
-Come on.
-We're going up again?

188
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:35,934
We can take the elevator.

189
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:37,094
Hurry up.

190
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:59,054
ELEVATOR UNDER MAINTENANCE
DO NOT USE

191
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,574
Nobody dares to let me go hungry.

192
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,814
Food's more delicious when you're hungry.

193
00:13:10,094 --> 00:13:12,454
What? Is this stupid elevator broken?

194
00:13:13,094 --> 00:13:14,454
That's ridiculous.

195
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:18,174
Is anyone there?

196
00:13:18,574 --> 00:13:19,454
Help!

197
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:20,974
<i>-Hey.
-Hey.</i>

198
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:22,494
<i>Help! Is anyone there?</i>

199
00:13:22,574 --> 00:13:24,054
Hey. Help!

200
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:28,974
Help!

201
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:32,574
I think it's broken.

202
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:35,934
Are you kidding me?

203
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:37,094
What a stupid elevator.

204
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:39,934
<i>Stop that, okay?</i>

205
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:41,974
If the elevator falls, we'll die.

206
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:45,094
Then what are we supposed to do now?

207
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:53,894
My stupid phone is dead again.

208
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:55,014
Where's your phone?

209
00:13:56,654 --> 00:13:58,134
I called you for four hours straight.

210
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:00,214
What do you think?

211
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:04,054
Then...

212
00:14:04,294 --> 00:14:05,454
We'll have to wait here.

213
00:14:08,134 --> 00:14:09,854
Hello, Li Zhen?

214
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,414
I'm Shancai's mom.

215
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:13,694
Yes. I'm her mom.

216
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,134
Did Shancai call you?

217
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:20,054
She's not picking up?

218
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:23,174
I know. I've been calling her too.

219
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:25,974
She hasn't picked up.
She hasn't called back either.

220
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:27,134
Okay.

221
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:29,614
If she calls you, let me know.

222
00:14:30,054 --> 00:14:31,694
Okay. Thanks.

223
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:38,414
Hey. Help!

224
00:14:39,054 --> 00:14:40,374
<i>Can't you see we're stuck?</i>

225
00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:41,614
<i>Hey.</i>

226
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:46,614
Dear,

227
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,374
something's wrong.

228
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:53,654
Shancai hasn't called me yet.

229
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:55,334
She isn't picking up.

230
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:58,774
I called Li Zhen,
she hasn't heard from Shancai either.

231
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:02,894
She's really lost.

232
00:15:04,054 --> 00:15:07,614
Where are you? Why aren't you home yet?

233
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:11,374
You're at the BBQ stand?

234
00:15:11,574 --> 00:15:12,654
BBQ...

235
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:16,614
Can you bring some home?

236
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:18,694
With no pepper.

237
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:21,934
Okay.

238
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:24,774
Why am I crying?

239
00:15:26,174 --> 00:15:28,174
Do you think I want to cry?

240
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:33,294
These onions are really something.

241
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:56,734
Hey.

242
00:15:58,014 --> 00:15:59,014
What are you doing?

243
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:09,494
Hey.

244
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:10,654
What's wrong with you?

245
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:14,054
Your clothes are drenched.

246
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:17,534
You have a fever.

247
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,814
Try standing in the rain for four hours.

248
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:41,574
Lie down.

249
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:54,134
You should get some rest.

250
00:16:54,494 --> 00:16:55,774
Try to stay conscious.

251
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:59,174
Someone will come for us soon.

252
00:17:53,094 --> 00:17:53,974
I'm sorry.

253
00:17:54,614 --> 00:17:55,654
This is all my fault.

254
00:18:00,494 --> 00:18:01,494
But you're the one

255
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:03,534
who insisted on coming here.

256
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:06,494
If you didn't insist on coming here,

257
00:18:07,134 --> 00:18:08,374
we wouldn't be stuck here.

258
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:12,534
What's so funny?

259
00:18:12,974 --> 00:18:14,334
I'm hungry and tired

260
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:16,414
and I was in the rain for so long.

261
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:18,494
It's normal that my stomach is growling.

262
00:18:21,014 --> 00:18:22,014
Okay.

263
00:18:23,054 --> 00:18:25,614
Right now, I'm the only one
that can take care of you.

264
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:28,894
When you get home,
your mom will take care of you.

265
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:39,814
I haven't seen my mom for two years.

266
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,494
Two years?

267
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:43,654
My dad...

268
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:46,814
He died when I was in middle school.

269
00:18:48,414 --> 00:18:50,054
My mom had to work in London.

270
00:18:50,614 --> 00:18:53,094
When we called her,
we always got her assistant instead.

271
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:55,374
So we stopped calling.

272
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:02,934
It must be lonely living
in such a big house by yourself.

273
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:06,534
Don't say that.

274
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:08,294
I'm never lonely.

275
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:11,814
If I were you,

276
00:19:12,374 --> 00:19:14,174
I would feel very lonely.

277
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:16,174
I would probably become rebellious.

278
00:19:27,174 --> 00:19:28,134
Okay.

279
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:29,534
I admit it was my fault this time.

280
00:19:29,974 --> 00:19:31,774
How can I make it up to you?

281
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:11,934
Hey.

282
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:14,374
That's not what I meant...

283
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:44,934
Hey. What are you doing?

284
00:20:53,214 --> 00:20:54,694
It's nice to be young.

285
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:17,134
Is this the police?

286
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:18,614
My daughter is around 160cm.

287
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:19,614
She has a round face.

288
00:21:20,214 --> 00:21:21,854
She had a big coat on.

289
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,534
What? Her main features?

290
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:25,854
She has a big butt.

291
00:21:26,254 --> 00:21:28,054
How can you say that about her?

292
00:21:29,094 --> 00:21:30,054
Hello, sir.

293
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:31,734
Yes, I'm her dad.

294
00:21:31,814 --> 00:21:32,654
Yes.

295
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:34,534
My daughter is very pretty.

296
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:35,814
She's around 160cm.

297
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,854
She has big, round eyes.

298
00:21:37,934 --> 00:21:39,054
Everyone loves her.

299
00:21:39,134 --> 00:21:40,734
She has pale skin, and--

300
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:42,654
They won't find her like that.

301
00:21:42,974 --> 00:21:44,094
-But--
-Mom, Dad.

302
00:21:44,414 --> 00:21:45,694
See? She's home.

303
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:47,694
I was right about her having a big butt.

304
00:21:50,414 --> 00:21:51,854
Shancai, you're home?

305
00:21:52,774 --> 00:21:54,694
-How dare you?
-Mom, stop it.

306
00:21:54,774 --> 00:21:56,934
-Stop it.
-How could you do this?

307
00:21:57,014 --> 00:21:59,454
-You couldn't call us?
-Stop it.

308
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:00,974
You always hit me in the end.

309
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:02,134
-Get out of the way.
-Mom.

310
00:22:02,214 --> 00:22:03,254
I was stuck in an elevator

311
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:05,654
-the whole night.
-You couldn't call us?

312
00:22:05,734 --> 00:22:07,054
My phone is broken.

313
00:22:08,054 --> 00:22:09,854
The elevator broke
and your phone broke too?

314
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:11,894
You're lying. You're a bad girl.

315
00:22:12,454 --> 00:22:13,574
No, I'm not.

316
00:22:13,654 --> 00:22:15,894
See? My phone is broken.

317
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:18,374
It is...

318
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:21,334
So you were trapped
in the elevator the whole night?

319
00:22:21,894 --> 00:22:22,734
Yes.

320
00:22:25,854 --> 00:22:26,774
All right, come out.

321
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:31,814
You didn't come home all night.
Do you know how worried we were?

322
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:33,374
-Sweetheart.
-We were worried sick.

323
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:34,694
-It's fine.
-Here.

324
00:22:44,254 --> 00:22:46,574
Fine. You can use my phone for now.

325
00:22:47,894 --> 00:22:48,854
Thanks, Mom.

326
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:52,334
Shancai, are you hungry?

327
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:54,934
The porridge is cold. I'll heat it up.

328
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:56,214
I'll get you a bowl.

329
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:03,294
Aren't you heating the porridge?
What's the bowl for?

330
00:23:03,374 --> 00:23:04,574
I'm pouring water, okay?

331
00:23:04,654 --> 00:23:06,414
-Silly woman.
-You're the silly one.

332
00:23:06,494 --> 00:23:07,974
Who needs water to heat up porridge?

333
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,174
<i>My house is small.</i>

334
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,654
<i>My parents are always bickering.</i>

335
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:15,134
<i>But they really care about me.</i>

336
00:23:16,174 --> 00:23:18,174
<i>I don't know if anyone</i>

337
00:23:18,494 --> 00:23:20,374
<i>will take care of him at home.</i>

338
00:23:21,614 --> 00:23:23,654
<i>Or if his fever has gone down.</i>

339
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:34,214
Hey, Li Zhen.

340
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:39,334
-Did Shancai's mom call you last night?
-Yes.

341
00:23:39,414 --> 00:23:42,094
She said she didn't come home all night

342
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:43,734
and asked me where she was.

343
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:45,134
I couldn't reach her either.

344
00:23:45,214 --> 00:23:46,694
-What about you?
-I couldn't either.

345
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:48,454
I called her all night.
She never picked up.

346
00:23:48,854 --> 00:23:50,054
What happened?

347
00:23:50,534 --> 00:23:52,174
Shancai has never been like this.

348
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:56,774
I know.

349
00:23:57,934 --> 00:23:59,814
It must be Daoming Si.

350
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:02,214
He said if we lost,
he could decide what to do to us.

351
00:24:02,294 --> 00:24:03,814
I waited all day but nothing happened.

352
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:07,174
He must have gone after Shancai.

353
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,534
Jerk!

354
00:24:09,934 --> 00:24:11,134
Qinghe, wait.

355
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:27,814
Hey.

356
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:30,854
Shancai.

357
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:32,654
-Shancai.
-Quiet now, everyone.

358
00:24:32,734 --> 00:24:33,974
-Shancai.
-Class is starting.

359
00:24:34,054 --> 00:24:35,174
The professor is here.

360
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:40,334
All right.

361
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:43,974
In the last class,
we talked about nutrition in food.

362
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:45,294
Today...

363
00:24:49,214 --> 00:24:50,654
I heard Mr. Liu say you're sick.

364
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:53,174
How did you get sick on a date?

365
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:55,734
You get sick when you're weak.

366
00:24:56,414 --> 00:24:58,374
Especially when you're exhausted.

367
00:24:58,454 --> 00:24:59,534
What are you talking about?

368
00:25:00,854 --> 00:25:02,334
Where did you go with Shancai?

369
00:25:02,894 --> 00:25:04,654
Did you follow the plan we made for you?

370
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:07,734
We were trapped
in an elevator the whole night.

371
00:25:08,294 --> 00:25:09,734
-An elevator?
-An elevator?

372
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:13,454
Wow, so exciting.

373
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,174
How was it?

374
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:17,814
It was cold.

375
00:25:18,654 --> 00:25:20,414
And Shancai gave me her clothes.

376
00:25:20,694 --> 00:25:22,614
And I started feeling very hot.

377
00:25:23,494 --> 00:25:26,014
I was sweating all over, so...

378
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:27,374
What happened in the end?

379
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:31,654
I thought something
would happen in the end.

380
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:33,654
But then...

381
00:25:34,414 --> 00:25:36,174
The workers came and found us.

382
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:39,614
You're such a weird couple.

383
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:41,254
Weird?

384
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:43,574
I'm still mad at that elevator worker.

385
00:25:50,454 --> 00:25:51,374
Class,

386
00:25:51,814 --> 00:25:54,254
these are the six essentials
for the human body.

387
00:25:55,014 --> 00:25:57,734
Now, I'll give you ten minutes
to read your book

388
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:00,574
and go over what we just talked about.

389
00:26:09,254 --> 00:26:10,134
Xinhui.

390
00:26:10,894 --> 00:26:12,174
Look at her.

391
00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:15,534
I wonder how Daoming Si
punished her last night.

392
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:20,974
She shouldn't have challenged F4.

393
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,854
She dug her own grave.

394
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:27,134
I'm so mad.

395
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:29,854
Look how tired she looks.

396
00:26:30,374 --> 00:26:32,614
Daoming Si must have
bullied her last night.

397
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:41,894
All right, that's all for today.

398
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:42,894
Class dismissed.

399
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:50,334
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

400
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:51,934
Your mom said you didn't come home.

401
00:26:52,014 --> 00:26:53,094
Where did you go?

402
00:26:54,054 --> 00:26:56,134
-I...
-Daoming Si kidnapped you, didn't he?

403
00:26:57,094 --> 00:26:58,774
Did he make you do something weird?

404
00:26:59,214 --> 00:27:00,574
Or eat something weird?

405
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:02,774
Shancai, don't worry.

406
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,814
I'm your humble servant.

407
00:27:04,894 --> 00:27:06,294
I'll get them back for this.

408
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,494
That's enough.

409
00:27:07,774 --> 00:27:08,734
I'm fine.

410
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:09,734
Don't worry.

411
00:27:09,814 --> 00:27:11,574
It's not what you think.

412
00:27:11,854 --> 00:27:13,854
Daoming Si didn't bully me.

413
00:27:14,014 --> 00:27:15,694
All right, Shancai.

414
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:17,774
Stop pretending.

415
00:27:17,894 --> 00:27:20,974
It's okay that you lost the challenge.

416
00:27:21,294 --> 00:27:22,254
Yeah, Shancai.

417
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,574
If you told us earlier,

418
00:27:24,654 --> 00:27:28,814
maybe we could've talked
Daoming Si out of it.

419
00:27:31,894 --> 00:27:33,814
Shancai, Daoming Si is looking for you.

420
00:27:35,174 --> 00:27:36,614
Come on, let's go.

421
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:49,414
Excuse me.

422
00:28:04,254 --> 00:28:05,174
What do you want?

423
00:28:05,774 --> 00:28:06,814
Here.

424
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:12,894
What is it?

425
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:14,854
I won't accept a gift from you.

426
00:28:15,534 --> 00:28:16,374
Idiot.

427
00:28:16,454 --> 00:28:17,694
Who said it's a gift?

428
00:28:18,254 --> 00:28:19,254
It's your coat.

429
00:28:27,094 --> 00:28:29,374
You forgot to take it
when you left this morning.

430
00:28:36,654 --> 00:28:38,294
Hey. Snap out of it.

431
00:29:18,094 --> 00:29:19,054
Last night,

432
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,934
did Shancai sleep with Daoming Si?

433
00:29:22,214 --> 00:29:24,734
It says here in QQ Space
that they're dating.

434
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:27,374
To be honest,

435
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:30,574
I don't like this girl.

436
00:29:30,974 --> 00:29:33,454
Can we stop talking to her?

437
00:29:34,654 --> 00:29:35,654
Why?

438
00:29:36,614 --> 00:29:38,534
If she's close to F4,

439
00:29:39,174 --> 00:29:40,774
I want to be friends with her.

440
00:29:42,774 --> 00:29:44,654
I can't take it anymore!

441
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:47,774
Shancai, you said
that Daoming Si didn't bully you.

442
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,094
But he did.

443
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:52,414
Did he?

444
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:53,974
Did he not?

445
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:56,014
Why did he have your coat?

446
00:29:56,414 --> 00:29:57,814
He's a big guy.

447
00:29:58,414 --> 00:29:59,574
Your coat is too small.

448
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:01,494
He probably wanted to ruin your coat.

449
00:30:02,374 --> 00:30:04,134
Such a pervert.

450
00:30:05,654 --> 00:30:08,054
"Shancai, I'm so cold.

451
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:10,054
Give me your coat.

452
00:30:10,534 --> 00:30:12,854
Shancai, I'm so cold.

453
00:30:13,214 --> 00:30:14,614
Give me your dress too."

454
00:30:17,094 --> 00:30:18,654
His intentions aren't pure.

455
00:30:18,894 --> 00:30:20,294
Li Zhen, isn't he disgusting?

456
00:30:20,614 --> 00:30:22,254
You're exaggerating.

457
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:24,014
He's ridiculous.

458
00:30:25,254 --> 00:30:26,254
Shancai, tell us.

459
00:30:26,494 --> 00:30:28,054
Why did he have your coat?

460
00:30:35,254 --> 00:30:37,134
I gave him the coat because--

461
00:30:37,214 --> 00:30:38,254
Shancai.

462
00:30:39,814 --> 00:30:41,254
Ever since school started,

463
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:43,414
we haven't really hung out together.

464
00:30:43,494 --> 00:30:46,174
How about we go have some fun tonight?

465
00:30:48,174 --> 00:30:50,654
Xinhui only hangs out
with a selective group.

466
00:30:50,774 --> 00:30:52,174
You'll be there, won't you?

467
00:30:52,254 --> 00:30:56,814
Are you too ashamed of us because
you're friends with Daoming Si now?

468
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:58,774
That's not true.

469
00:30:59,094 --> 00:31:00,814
So, where are we going?

470
00:31:01,374 --> 00:31:04,374
Tonight, let's have a ladies' night.

471
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:10,374
What?

472
00:31:11,574 --> 00:31:13,094
So I can't go?

473
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:20,894
What are you looking at?

474
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:23,294
No wonder you came to school sick.

475
00:31:23,854 --> 00:31:26,374
You couldn't wait
to declare your territory.

476
00:31:26,454 --> 00:31:27,814
Declare my territory?

477
00:31:27,894 --> 00:31:29,534
You went on a date
with Shancai last night.

478
00:31:29,614 --> 00:31:31,774
And today, everyone says you're dating.

479
00:31:33,254 --> 00:31:35,614
If I don't tell the world who I like,

480
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,054
I'd be waiting for someone to steal her.

481
00:31:40,254 --> 00:31:42,174
-What are you doing tonight?
-I don't know.

482
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:44,014
-Where are you going?
-What are you up to?

483
00:31:44,094 --> 00:31:45,054
-Chill at my place?
-Hey.

484
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:46,014
Good idea.

485
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:47,174
-You're leaving me?
-Okay.

486
00:31:47,254 --> 00:31:48,094
Hey.

487
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:10,694
Shancai.

488
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:14,414
You can go dance.
I'll just stay here. It's fine.

489
00:32:14,494 --> 00:32:15,454
It's okay.

490
00:32:15,654 --> 00:32:16,654
I can't dance.

491
00:32:16,814 --> 00:32:18,574
We'll just have our drinks here.

492
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:19,574
Okay.

493
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:21,454
Cheers.

494
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:22,534
Cheers.

495
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:34,574
-Let's go.
-Sure.

496
00:32:36,494 --> 00:32:39,054
Why aren't you guys dancing?

497
00:32:40,814 --> 00:32:43,254
We can't dance.

498
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:45,454
You're pretty and have nice bodies.

499
00:32:46,254 --> 00:32:48,334
You're cool too, Shancai.

500
00:32:48,414 --> 00:32:51,054
Tell me, how did you get
Daoming Si to like you?

501
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:54,374
Xinhui.

502
00:32:54,694 --> 00:32:56,574
It's not like that with Daoming Si and me.

503
00:32:57,334 --> 00:32:59,054
Daoming Si isn't my boyfriend.

504
00:33:00,054 --> 00:33:02,254
Shancai, do you think we're stupid?

505
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,694
We saw Daoming Si give your coat back.

506
00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:09,494
QQ Space says that you're dating.

507
00:33:09,574 --> 00:33:10,734
He hasn't denied it.

508
00:33:10,974 --> 00:33:12,494
Why are you denying it?

509
00:33:13,134 --> 00:33:14,854
It's not true.

510
00:33:14,934 --> 00:33:16,734
It's a misunderstanding.

511
00:33:16,814 --> 00:33:17,854
Fine.

512
00:33:17,934 --> 00:33:20,214
If Daoming Si isn't your boyfriend,

513
00:33:20,654 --> 00:33:22,614
you should introduce him to us.

514
00:33:27,774 --> 00:33:28,934
Do we have a deal?

515
00:33:29,214 --> 00:33:30,614
Everyone heard it here.

516
00:33:31,254 --> 00:33:33,254
Let's drink to it.

517
00:33:33,454 --> 00:33:34,854
Let's thank Shancai.

518
00:33:39,254 --> 00:33:40,094
Cheers.

519
00:33:51,934 --> 00:33:53,534
This drink is pretty good.

520
00:34:10,854 --> 00:34:12,054
I feel so hot.

521
00:34:12,174 --> 00:34:13,814
I'm going to the restroom.

522
00:34:16,094 --> 00:34:16,934
Shancai.

523
00:36:28,174 --> 00:36:29,414
I like you.

524
00:37:02,974 --> 00:37:05,174
Isn't that Shancai?

525
00:37:06,654 --> 00:37:07,734
Yeah.

526
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:12,574
She's leaning on
the long-haired foreign pianist.

527
00:37:13,134 --> 00:37:15,494
Isn't she your good friend?

528
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:17,654
She's crazy.

529
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:19,734
She's not good at anything,

530
00:37:20,694 --> 00:37:24,094
but she's good
at throwing herself at boys.

531
00:38:03,854 --> 00:38:04,894
Where am I?

532
00:38:07,934 --> 00:38:09,854
<i>You were drunk. Call me when you wake up.</i>

533
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:10,814
<i>Thomas.</i>

534
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:15,614
Thomas?

535
00:38:19,254 --> 00:38:20,854
Who the hell is Thomas?

536
00:38:37,174 --> 00:38:38,014
-Hi.
-Hi.

537
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:39,894
We're friends with Shancai.

538
00:38:39,974 --> 00:38:42,094
I'm Baihe. This is Xinhui.

539
00:38:42,174 --> 00:38:43,014
What's your name?

540
00:38:43,094 --> 00:38:44,334
Call me Thomas.

541
00:38:44,414 --> 00:38:45,814
Nice to meet you.

542
00:38:45,894 --> 00:38:46,814
Shancai, too.

543
00:38:48,054 --> 00:38:49,814
-Let's take a photo.
-Okay.

544
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:50,814
Okay.

545
00:38:59,494 --> 00:39:00,614
What?

546
00:39:01,934 --> 00:39:03,454
That foreigner and I...

547
00:39:16,694 --> 00:39:18,094
Hello? Thomas?

548
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:20,534
<i>You're awake? I'll go see you.</i>

549
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:22,574
Don't, I'm at school now.

550
00:39:22,974 --> 00:39:23,894
<i>Okay.</i>

551
00:39:24,374 --> 00:39:25,494
Last night,

552
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:27,854
how did I get to the hotel?

553
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:29,774
Where did my friends go?

554
00:39:30,054 --> 00:39:33,534
<i>They were drunk.
They asked me to take care of you.</i>

555
00:39:33,614 --> 00:39:35,494
<i>I didn't know where you lived.</i>

556
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,334
<i>So I brought you to a hotel.</i>

557
00:39:37,814 --> 00:39:38,654
Hey.

558
00:39:39,614 --> 00:39:40,814
Why are you so late?

559
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:43,454
None of your business.

560
00:39:45,094 --> 00:39:46,974
You have your first class at eight.

561
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:48,254
You were almost late.

562
00:39:49,174 --> 00:39:50,254
None of your business.

563
00:39:53,494 --> 00:39:54,334
Wait.

564
00:39:55,174 --> 00:39:56,494
You know my schedule?

565
00:39:57,734 --> 00:39:59,934
I didn't. Ximen told me.

566
00:40:00,814 --> 00:40:01,974
Go away.

567
00:40:08,374 --> 00:40:09,854
Why are you following me?

568
00:40:11,694 --> 00:40:13,974
Were you waiting for me there?

569
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:15,694
You wish.

570
00:40:15,894 --> 00:40:18,414
I'm going to the administration building.
I just passed by.

571
00:40:18,494 --> 00:40:20,014
The administration building?

572
00:40:20,734 --> 00:40:22,254
That's in the opposite direction.

573
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:24,494
I like taking the long way there.

574
00:40:25,294 --> 00:40:26,254
Whatever.

575
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:27,414
I'm going to class.

576
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,214
Wait.

577
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:35,174
Here.

578
00:40:41,614 --> 00:40:42,774
What's this?

579
00:40:43,694 --> 00:40:46,734
Next time you give me your clothes,
at least make it an expensive one.

580
00:40:51,334 --> 00:40:53,334
It's getting cold. Put it on.

581
00:41:06,974 --> 00:41:07,854
Do you need help?

582
00:41:09,294 --> 00:41:11,494
No. I'm going to be late.

583
00:41:17,134 --> 00:41:18,454
All right, class.

584
00:41:18,534 --> 00:41:20,454
That's all for today.

585
00:41:20,534 --> 00:41:22,334
Please send me your assignments.

586
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:23,734
Class dismissed.

587
00:41:31,174 --> 00:41:32,134
Li Zhen.

588
00:41:32,214 --> 00:41:33,854
When did you go home last night?

589
00:41:33,934 --> 00:41:35,214
Why didn't you tell me?

590
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,814
I don't remember.

591
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:38,254
I had a bit too much to drink.

592
00:41:38,334 --> 00:41:40,094
It seemed like
you were having a good time.

593
00:41:40,174 --> 00:41:41,614
So I went home.

594
00:41:43,454 --> 00:41:44,454
Okay.

595
00:41:44,774 --> 00:41:45,814
Shancai.

596
00:41:46,494 --> 00:41:48,454
Was it fun last night? Where did you go?

597
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,614
THOMAS

598
00:42:08,014 --> 00:42:09,054
Hello?

599
00:42:09,134 --> 00:42:10,574
<i>Shancai, where are you?</i>

600
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,134
Your school is so big.

601
00:42:12,294 --> 00:42:13,974
I think I'm lost.

602
00:42:14,054 --> 00:42:15,014
You're...

603
00:42:16,174 --> 00:42:17,614
You're at my school?

604
00:42:17,694 --> 00:42:19,814
Yeah. Where can I meet you?

605
00:42:22,094 --> 00:42:23,094
The cafeteria.

606
00:42:29,974 --> 00:42:31,694
Shancai, where are you going?
