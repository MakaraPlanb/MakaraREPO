EPISODE 24

4
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:38,291
All right. I'll stop laughing.

5
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:43,611
You're still laughing. Stop already.

6
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,611
Daoming Si.

7
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,691
Did you hear what one tourist said?

8
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:50,411
They said someone got scared
by the female ghost

9
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,811
and almost knocked her out.

10
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,251
Daoming Si.

11
00:01:56,971 --> 00:02:00,411
You might've just topped
the Weibo's search hotlist.

12
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:17,251
What are you doing?

13
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,211
Shancai.

14
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,611
I'm a bit thirsty.
Should we buy some drinks?

15
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:35,611
Sure.

16
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:36,811
How about some cold beer?

17
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:38,891
Wait.

18
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,371
A goody-two-shoes like you
wouldn't drink beer, right?

19
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:45,131
Are you even old enough to drink beer?

20
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:48,851
I don't drink beer.

21
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,291
I'll have juice.

22
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:52,091
I'll buy it.

23
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:54,291
Let me do it.

24
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,651
A boy that eats a kid's meal

25
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:58,251
and can't drink beer

26
00:02:58,451 --> 00:02:59,531
might just get lost.

27
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:05,451
I'll be back.

28
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:10,451
I'm going to the bathroom.

29
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:20,931
Sorry, Shancai.

30
00:03:21,531 --> 00:03:22,531
It got kind of awkward.

31
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:24,651
It's okay.

32
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:27,011
He gets riled up easily.

33
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:29,731
But

34
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:31,451
you two were...

35
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:43,451
Well, ladies. It's on.

36
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:45,811
-See you at the bar tonight.
-Sure, I'll be there.

37
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:47,211
-Okay?
-See you there.

38
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:49,291
I'll make sure to dress up.

39
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,611
Do you see that guy?

40
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:52,851
-That's my lackey.
-So handsome.

41
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,331
-He came with me.
-So handsome.

42
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:58,251
All right, I'll talk to you again.
See you.

43
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,291
-Okay.
-Okay.

44
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:02,051
Do you think he'll come tonight?

45
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:03,571
-So handsome.
-Hey.

46
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:07,451
I got to meet those two ladies
in the queue.

47
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:09,371
They're pretty hot, right?

48
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:11,411
What are you saying?

49
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:14,291
I asked them out to the bar tonight.

50
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:15,531
Do you want to come?

51
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:16,851
You look pretty good.

52
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:18,771
How about I show you a good time?

53
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:22,251
I know what you're thinking.

54
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:23,811
The other two are so boring.

55
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:25,331
We can just leave them.

56
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:27,931
What do you mean?

57
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:28,931
Wait.

58
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:31,411
Does your brain work?

59
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:33,331
Or does it not?

60
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:35,211
Don't you understand what I mean?

61
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,131
Do you know who you're talking to?

62
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:41,531
Dong Shancai's boyfriend.

63
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:45,891
Don't tell me you're going
to stick with one tree.

64
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:47,771
There's a whole forest out there.

65
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:48,691
You know what?

66
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:50,411
Your girlfriend is pretty pathetic.

67
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:53,451
When I first met her, I held her hand.

68
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:54,851
She was pretty excited about it.

69
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:01,891
Are you okay?

70
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:05,211
What's wrong with you?
Why did you hit him?

71
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,731
He got on my nerves.

72
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:09,011
If this is the date you wanted,

73
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:10,571
I'm never coming back.

74
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:14,291
And you.

75
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:16,731
Why did you pick a boyfriend
from the trash?

76
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:24,371
What is his deal?

77
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:27,251
Sorry.

78
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:28,571
That's the way he is.

79
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:30,331
His temper gets the better of him.

80
00:05:30,891 --> 00:05:32,091
Easy for you to say.

81
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,451
He just hit me.

82
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:37,011
Keep your crazy boyfriend in check
instead of standing there.

83
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:38,411
That's enough.

84
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,611
Bullshit.

85
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:40,811
Where are you going?

86
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:51,371
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:59,091
Daoming Si.

88
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,531
Where is Daoming Si?

89
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:04,731
In the shower.

90
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,731
Hey, he's...

91
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:09,571
Are you dumb?

92
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:11,891
She heard you and left.

93
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,171
Hey!

94
00:06:19,931 --> 00:06:20,891
Hey.

95
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,451
You're the peeping Tom.

96
00:06:23,531 --> 00:06:24,731
Stop playing the victim.

97
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,491
You better apologize.

98
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,371
To who?

99
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,211
Xiaoyou's boyfriend.

100
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:31,291
Why should I?

101
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,011
Why did you hit him then?

102
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,491
I hit him

103
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:37,331
because I was doing service
for his mother.

104
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,011
I went easy on him.

105
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:42,091
Why do I feel like something is off?

106
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:44,531
I thought they just had a date.

107
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:45,851
That was quick.

108
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:48,651
What did you say?

109
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,451
Only four days.

110
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:52,771
They haven't split yet.

111
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,291
What exactly happened?

112
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:01,931
I'm not going to tell you.

113
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:04,571
Can you be more reasonable?

114
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:08,371
I was furious.

115
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:10,251
So I hit him. Satisfied?

116
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:11,651
I'm angry.

117
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:12,971
Can I hit you?

118
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:18,251
That Xiaoqi is annoying.

119
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:20,011
I don't like him either.

120
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:23,571
But you're not any better.

121
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:25,731
No matter what it is,

122
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,291
it's wrong to hit another person.

123
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:31,171
You need to apologize
for what you've done.

124
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,131
What have I done?

125
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:33,811
Did they break up?

126
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:36,011
That'd be great.

127
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:40,971
You really are a jerk.

128
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,251
I'm sick of you.

129
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:50,651
-You're unreasonable.
-You don't love me anymore.

130
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:52,291
Explain to me why you did it.

131
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,411
Listen to me.

132
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:54,971
I won't. You're just a liar.

133
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:57,531
-Fine then.
-I'm leaving.

134
00:07:58,131 --> 00:07:59,851
-I'll kill you if you leave.
-Go ahead!

135
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:02,211
What are you guys doing?

136
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:03,651
Experiencing life.

137
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:05,771
Whatever.

138
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:07,531
Let me make it clear.

139
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:10,051
I've broken up with that jerk, Daoming Si.

140
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:38,931
Shancai.

141
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:41,011
Shancai.

142
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:43,011
What's wrong? Are you sick?

143
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:44,371
I'm fine.

144
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:47,251
Okay.

145
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:50,171
Let's go back to the passage.

146
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:54,851
Xiaoqi didn't come to school today.

147
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:57,171
Shouldn't you call him?

148
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:59,051
I did.

149
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:00,691
Nobody answered.

150
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:03,011
It's my fault.

151
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,331
I caused the rift between you two.

152
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:07,411
I don't blame you.

153
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:10,691
If things got bad between us
only because of this,

154
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:12,571
our relationship won't last long.

155
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:16,531
Actually,

156
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:19,131
you also think that Xiaoqi
isn't a good guy, right?

157
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:26,051
I like him
so I make the effort to compromise.

158
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:28,531
I kind of let things pass.

159
00:09:30,051 --> 00:09:31,771
Am I too blinded by love?

160
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:38,851
But I think
you should work hard with Daoming Si.

161
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,211
Actually,

162
00:09:43,371 --> 00:09:44,771
Daoming Si and I

163
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:47,291
are pretty much over.

164
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:49,931
Why?

165
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,411
He did hit Xiaoqi

166
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:54,691
and still seems hard to get along with.

167
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,771
But I can tell he really likes you.

168
00:09:58,971 --> 00:10:01,011
I mean, he still came

169
00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:02,491
even though he didn't want to.

170
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:04,291
He tried hard to be a part of us.

171
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:08,611
You've been in a bind over him,
haven't you?

172
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,451
Daoming Si is driving me crazy.

173
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:16,611
Because of him,

174
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:18,891
I got pissed at the teacher
and students in class.

175
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:21,331
I don't feel like myself.

176
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:24,651
You're not yourself because of love.

177
00:10:27,171 --> 00:10:28,051
Xiaoqi.

178
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:29,411
Stop it, Xiaoqi.

179
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:30,891
There are people here.

180
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,411
I don't see anyone.

181
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:35,891
There's nobody. You can come to my house.

182
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,411
-Come.
-Can I?

183
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:39,091
Won't your girlfriend be unhappy?

184
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:40,771
I don't care about her.

185
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:41,731
Listen.

186
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:43,971
Do you know how boring it is
to date a goody-two-shoes?

187
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:46,891
Every day, it's going to the library,

188
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:48,651
or visiting the park.

189
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,891
It's like watching paint dry.
Boring as hell.

190
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,331
Really?

191
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:53,451
Xiaoyou!

192
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:00,091
Zhang Ziqi.

193
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:01,611
Stop right there.

194
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:03,411
Wait for me at the store.

195
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:05,251
-Okay.
-I'll find you when I'm done.

196
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,131
-Zhang Ziqi.
-What?

197
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:09,411
What did you mean by that?

198
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:11,611
Who is Xiaoyou to you?

199
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:14,171
I was just being honest.

200
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:16,011
Any normal guy

201
00:11:16,251 --> 00:11:17,971
would be tired of that pathetic girl.

202
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:19,491
It's been a week.

203
00:11:19,691 --> 00:11:21,091
She wouldn't even let me kiss her.

204
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:23,651
Your boyfriend, Daoming Si,
is a weirdo too.

205
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,451
I introduced some pretty women to him
and he shot me down.

206
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,691
What I'm saying is,

207
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:30,651
it gets really tiring to be
with such rigid people.

208
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:33,331
If you're bored, come and find me.

209
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:41,531
Trash.

210
00:11:42,371 --> 00:11:43,891
You'd better stay away from Xiaoyou.

211
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:47,291
Otherwise, you'll be given
more than a mere beating.

212
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:53,691
Crazy woman.

213
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:55,771
You and your boyfriend are both crazy.

214
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:08,011
Xiaoyou.

215
00:13:21,211 --> 00:13:22,731
This is Lavender Dingxiang Tea.

216
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:24,211
It will calm you.

217
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:29,171
How embarrassing.

218
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:31,931
I cried my eyes out
at the side of the road

219
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,491
and you saw me.

220
00:13:34,131 --> 00:13:35,131
It's okay.

221
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,811
This is my house.

222
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,851
You can cry whenever you want.

223
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,291
No one's going to laugh.

224
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:43,811
Or maybe

225
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:47,131
you rather tell me what happened?

226
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,291
I'm sorry.

227
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:07,851
My luck has been terrible lately.

228
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:10,051
So terrible.

229
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,931
Is it because of your boyfriend?

230
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,451
I heard

231
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:19,491
that he had some beef with Si.

232
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:25,851
Today, I saw him with another girl.

233
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:27,891
He said

234
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:30,331
it was so boring to be with me.

235
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:32,571
It was like watching paint dry.

236
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:40,731
How could he say that about a cute girl?

237
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:43,011
He's awful.

238
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,331
No.

239
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:48,051
I think he's right.

240
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:50,331
The girl I saw today

241
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:52,091
is much prettier than me.

242
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:56,171
She's got a nicer voice.

243
00:14:58,171 --> 00:14:59,571
She was all dressed up.

244
00:15:00,971 --> 00:15:02,131
She has a nice body.

245
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:07,611
Chin up. Look at me.

246
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:13,251
Don't make such a terrible comparison.

247
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:16,931
You need to know that
you've got your own lovable traits.

248
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:19,331
You'll find someone better.

249
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:24,651
I have my own lovable traits.

250
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:26,971
I will find someone better.

251
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:30,011
See? How lovable.

252
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:36,851
Freshen up. Let's go.

253
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:41,011
It's okay. I can go back on my own.

254
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:42,731
I'm not taking you home.

255
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,891
I'm taking you to the piece of shit.

256
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:48,931
What are you going to do?

257
00:15:50,251 --> 00:15:53,251
Since he was so generous
to give you such a horrible experience,

258
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:55,411
we should teach him a lesson.

259
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:58,731
A guy like him has no respect for women.

260
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:02,331
Are you going to hit him?

261
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:03,251
If you want me to,

262
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:05,011
I can.

263
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:06,611
No. It's okay.

264
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:12,531
He must be taught a lesson
for what he's done.

265
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:15,171
Do we have to?

266
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:17,171
Even if you're breaking up,

267
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:19,691
you'll be the one smiling at the end.

268
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,851
Where does he usually go at this time?

269
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,851
He likes to go to a bar
called Guinness 288.

270
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:52,851
We're here.

271
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:57,051
Are you going to be okay?

272
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:02,091
Ximen, maybe we should forget about it.

273
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,491
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
when I see him.

274
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,691
I should leave.

275
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:09,331
He dumped you like it was nothing.

276
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:10,971
Are you okay with that?

277
00:17:14,171 --> 00:17:15,371
Of course I'm not.

278
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:17,331
It makes me so angry.

279
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:21,691
It's not healthy to keep
such pent-up frustration.

280
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,451
Let's go and take it all out.

281
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,211
Hello, Si.

282
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:33,731
There's someone here
who has no respect for women.

283
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:35,131
Do you want to meet him?

284
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:47,331
Hey, Qinghe.

285
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:49,371
Have you seen Xiaoyou?

286
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:53,011
No?

287
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,171
Okay.

288
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:57,571
It's nothing.

289
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,291
<i>Xiaoyou was never confrontational
even since in high school.</i>

290
00:18:04,731 --> 00:18:06,531
<i>She always held it in
and let things passed.</i>

291
00:18:06,971 --> 00:18:08,771
<i>I've never seen her angry.</i>

292
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:11,811
<i>I'm such a terrible friend.</i>

293
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:14,131
<i>I didn't like that guy very much.</i>

294
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:15,811
<i>I should've told her sooner.</i>

295
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:22,371
<i>Shancai.</i>

296
00:18:22,571 --> 00:18:24,051
<i>I just saw your missed call.</i>

297
00:18:24,411 --> 00:18:25,291
<i>I'm fine.</i>

298
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:27,291
<i>I'm at the bar on Julu Road.</i>

299
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:48,251
Do you see him?

300
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:51,811
He's there.

301
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:03,211
Hi.

302
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:05,411
Hi, hello.

303
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:08,131
-Who are you?
-You don't know him?

304
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:09,451
It's Ximen.

305
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:11,611
-Who?
-One of the F4 members of Mingde.

306
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:13,171
F4?

307
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:16,411
You don't know?

308
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:19,851
F4 is made up of four tall, handsome

309
00:19:19,931 --> 00:19:22,131
and smart sons of business elites.

310
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:23,051
It has been a while.

311
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:26,251
It's crowded here,
but you caught my eye immediately.

312
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,091
It has been a while, Ximen.

313
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:30,211
Why didn't you call me again

314
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,051
after we met the last time?

315
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:33,611
I've been busy.

316
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:38,451
This plain-looking, squinty-eyed guy

317
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:40,051
isn't your boyfriend, is he?

318
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:42,531
-Of course not.
-No?

319
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:45,411
Why are we out on a date then?

320
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:47,731
You were pestering me to go out with you.

321
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:49,851
Oh, well.

322
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:52,171
My girlfriend is so much cuter and nicer.

323
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,651
You have a girlfriend?

324
00:19:57,891 --> 00:19:59,771
Why? Do you have a problem with that?

325
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:01,811
Are you going to hit me?

326
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:03,211
You better not be rash.

327
00:20:03,611 --> 00:20:04,931
Just try and hit me.

328
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,491
Ximen.

329
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:09,891
Should we go somewhere else?

330
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:13,531
Pretty girl, if you don't mind,

331
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:15,171
I'm going to take my girlfriend

332
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:18,131
and we can all go to a nice,
more high-end place.

333
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:20,211
No way.

334
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,691
Ximen has a girlfriend?

335
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:35,011
Xiaoyou?

336
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,931
What are you doing here?

337
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:47,371
She's my girlfriend.

338
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:48,611
Cute, isn't she?

339
00:20:51,411 --> 00:20:52,411
Why?

340
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:53,811
Do you know him?

341
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:56,491
No, I don't.

342
00:20:57,451 --> 00:20:59,851
I think he's from our school.
I've seen him around.

343
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:08,051
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

344
00:21:08,451 --> 00:21:09,531
I came to find Xiaoyou.

345
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:10,851
I came to find Ximen.

346
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:12,411
Why are they together?

347
00:21:12,531 --> 00:21:13,491
How should I know?

348
00:21:13,891 --> 00:21:15,091
He's your friend, right?

349
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:16,491
She's your friend, no?

350
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:19,811
I get it.

351
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:23,091
This old-fashioned, stupid girl got dumped

352
00:21:23,331 --> 00:21:24,211
and felt bad.

353
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:26,011
So you got someone to prank me?

354
00:21:26,091 --> 00:21:28,291
You better take back what you said

355
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:29,731
and apologize to my girlfriend.

356
00:21:30,651 --> 00:21:33,051
Apologize?
She should be the one apologizing.

357
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,451
Who's the one who organized

358
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:37,371
a double date.

359
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:41,091
She invited a good-for-nothing
lackey called Daoming Si.

360
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:42,651
He hit me.

361
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,171
Now she's got this mama's boy to show off.

362
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:49,571
You so-called F4

363
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:52,491
are just pathetic losers.

364
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:54,731
Who did you call a pathetic loser?

365
00:21:57,731 --> 00:21:58,691
That's right, you.

366
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,451
And you.

367
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:23,291
Thanks.

368
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:31,451
This is a special Ballantine's Blast
for you.

369
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:33,211
I'm sorry about today.

370
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:43,131
Well? Feel better now?

371
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:45,011
Yes, much better.

372
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,571
I have no idea what I saw in him.

373
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:50,171
Thanks, guys.

374
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:54,531
You're welcome.

375
00:22:57,371 --> 00:22:58,611
He didn't know his place.

376
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:00,091
How dare he provoke you guys?

377
00:23:00,651 --> 00:23:02,451
Daoming Si gave him a good beating.

378
00:23:03,931 --> 00:23:04,811
I didn't hit him.

379
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,011
I only gave him a massage.

380
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:12,851
When I saw him fooling around
with another girl,

381
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:15,891
I go so pissed that I hit him too.

382
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:22,971
Who was the dumb girl yesterday that said,

383
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:25,211
"No matter what,
it's wrong to hit another person."

384
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:27,771
-That's because...
-Now you're going to justify it?

385
00:23:28,171 --> 00:23:30,171
That's because you wouldn't say anything.

386
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:32,971
So you're putting all the blame on me?

387
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:34,851
How dare you.

388
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:38,291
I don't understand those two.

389
00:23:38,691 --> 00:23:40,291
They don't seem to be getting anywhere.

390
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:44,051
But I think
that Daoming Si likes Shancai a lot.

391
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:47,131
Let's go. We shouldn't bother them.

392
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:48,811
Hey.

393
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:50,931
Where are you two going?

394
00:23:51,251 --> 00:23:52,131
Take care.

395
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:55,771
Ximen is probably taking Xiaoyou home.

396
00:23:58,251 --> 00:23:59,171
Will it be okay?

397
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,531
Don't worry.

398
00:24:00,811 --> 00:24:03,291
Ximen is not interested
in naive, cute girls.

399
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:08,451
-Really?
-He likes to go for hot girls.

400
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:11,211
Straight-forward girls
without much intelligence.

401
00:24:12,691 --> 00:24:14,011
But Xiaoyou is very gullible.

402
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:15,171
I'm worried.

403
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,771
You're only concerned about others.

404
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:23,171
When are you going
to be concerned about us?

405
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:26,811
We're...

406
00:24:28,411 --> 00:24:29,731
What about the dating time limit?

407
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:31,651
One month will be over soon.

408
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:36,331
It's not a month yet.

409
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,251
You know what?

410
00:24:40,571 --> 00:24:43,091
There's an umbrella rental company.

411
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:45,771
The company invested
in an umbrella-sharing model.

412
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,531
It rented out 300,000 umbrellas.

413
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:49,011
And after one month,

414
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:51,931
none of them came back.

415
00:24:52,411 --> 00:24:53,491
You're still joking around.

416
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:04,531
To be honest,

417
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:06,931
I'm very anxious.

418
00:25:08,531 --> 00:25:09,611
Since I got to know you,

419
00:25:10,691 --> 00:25:12,251
despite countless confessions,

420
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,091
you never once gave me a definite answer.

421
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:18,171
Sometimes, even I wonder

422
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,531
if it's over between us.

423
00:25:37,891 --> 00:25:38,731
Daoming Si.

424
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:42,131
I'm sorry.

425
00:25:43,651 --> 00:25:44,851
I wrongly accused you.

426
00:25:47,491 --> 00:25:48,571
I want to tell you

427
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:51,851
that I'm really thankful.

428
00:25:57,371 --> 00:25:58,251
Daoming Si.

429
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:01,691
Let's make our relationship official.

430
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:15,131
I'm going to test you now.

431
00:26:21,611 --> 00:26:23,611
What's the most important nutrient
needed by humans?

432
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:24,811
-Water.
-Reason?

433
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:27,251
Water helps maintain temperature.
It's the best solvent.

434
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:28,411
It has strong adhesion,

435
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:29,651
it maintains water...

436
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:31,251
Electrolyte balance.

437
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:34,531
Not bad.

438
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,211
My turn.

439
00:26:39,091 --> 00:26:40,171
You're testing me?

440
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:41,651
Miss.

441
00:26:41,731 --> 00:26:43,411
Don't forget I'm a top student.

442
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:45,771
Wow.

443
00:26:47,651 --> 00:26:49,371
This topic seems really hard.

444
00:26:51,371 --> 00:26:52,571
I'll pick this question.

445
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:58,491
What is the principle of Schumpeter theory
of creative destruction?

446
00:26:58,571 --> 00:27:01,851
In an entrepreneurial life cycle,
one doesn't always remain an entrepreneur.

447
00:27:02,211 --> 00:27:04,571
Unless he continues to evolve

448
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:06,611
and create new formations,

449
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,091
which means to destroy the old,
creating the new.

450
00:27:09,571 --> 00:27:11,291
Because with every depression,

451
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:13,491
there's a possibility to gain new skills.

452
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,731
It becomes a new product, skill,

453
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:18,331
or business model

454
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:19,851
to bring the most benefit.

455
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:20,891
Wow.

456
00:27:21,331 --> 00:27:22,731
You're incredible.

457
00:27:24,371 --> 00:27:25,211
Not bad, right?

458
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:26,971
Since I did so well,

459
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:29,891
do I get any reward?

460
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:35,771
What do you mean?

461
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:37,331
What kind of reward?

462
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:41,251
What reward can you give me?

463
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:46,211
Are you asking for a free meal?

464
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:49,531
Okay. I'll take you to Rabbit Hole.

465
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,091
Rabbit Hole?

466
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:52,491
With rabbit meat?

467
00:27:52,691 --> 00:27:53,651
Of course not.

468
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:55,531
It's my favorite snack shop.

469
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,971
What a lousy reward. No thanks.

470
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:00,851
Come on.

471
00:28:03,491 --> 00:28:04,331
How about...

472
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:07,171
this kind of reward?

473
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:09,651
No.

474
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:14,051
Go read your book.

475
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:15,131
All right.

476
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:36,651
What a coincidence.

477
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,611
What a surprise to see you here.

478
00:29:05,931 --> 00:29:08,171
I'm surprised you like Li Quan's recital.

479
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:11,131
I should be asking you.

480
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:15,251
How did you end up in the seat
right beside mine?

481
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:18,531
I don't think it was a coincidence.

482
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,771
It wasn't?

483
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:22,651
Let me ask you.

484
00:29:23,131 --> 00:29:24,851
Where did you get your ticket?

485
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:26,331
My ticket?

486
00:29:26,651 --> 00:29:30,011
I asked a friend who helped
get me the good seat.

487
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:31,091
You?

488
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:32,171
Not me.

489
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,851
I got my ticket from the pianist.

490
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:40,091
You know Li Quan?

491
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,491
Of course.

492
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,891
My family organized this recital.

493
00:29:44,571 --> 00:29:45,691
We have connections.

494
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,651
I'm going to look for my old friend.

495
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:50,051
See you.

496
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:52,891
Hey! Wait.

497
00:29:55,971 --> 00:29:57,051
What is it?

498
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,251
Can you take me with you?

499
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:04,491
Miss.

500
00:30:05,331 --> 00:30:06,571
You're asking me to take someone

501
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:09,051
who is suspicious of me
to see an old friend.

502
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:10,851
Isn't that unreasonable?

503
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:13,811
Well...

504
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:14,851
Sorry.

505
00:30:15,891 --> 00:30:16,811
What did you say?

506
00:30:17,011 --> 00:30:18,091
I didn't hear you.

507
00:30:21,891 --> 00:30:23,451
I'm sorry.

508
00:30:28,251 --> 00:30:29,451
Meizuo.

509
00:30:29,571 --> 00:30:30,771
Why isn't Huaze Lei here?

510
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:31,771
Hi, sir.

511
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,331
Huaze Lei is busy preparing
for the Juilliard exam.

512
00:30:35,971 --> 00:30:36,811
Sir.

513
00:30:36,891 --> 00:30:38,291
Can I introduce you to a friend?

514
00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:40,371
This girl here really loves your music.

515
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:42,331
Hi, Mr. Li Quan.

516
00:30:42,651 --> 00:30:43,731
I'm honored to meet you.

517
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:45,451
I've been a great fan of your music.

518
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:46,851
Thanks.

519
00:30:47,851 --> 00:30:48,851
Is she...

520
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:50,491
your girlfriend?

521
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:51,851
Well...

522
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:55,731
Yes. She's my girlfriend, Zhou Caina.

523
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:57,371
Thank the teacher.

524
00:31:00,211 --> 00:31:01,331
Thank you, sir.

525
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,211
Sir,

526
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:05,251
my girlfriend has been a long-time fan.

527
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,651
It's so rare for you to have
a performance here,

528
00:31:07,731 --> 00:31:10,931
so she's been bugging me
to let her meet you.

529
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:13,411
Yes.

530
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:16,211
Mr. Li Quan, can I take a photo with you?

531
00:31:16,571 --> 00:31:17,491
Sure.

532
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:23,011
I'll take it.

533
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:29,091
Hey, girlfriend, come closer.
You're blocking the teacher.

534
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:35,371
You did that on purpose, right?

535
00:31:36,051 --> 00:31:39,731
If I brought some random girl
to see Mr. Li,

536
00:31:40,051 --> 00:31:42,371
he'd probably think
I'm being disrespectful.

537
00:31:45,331 --> 00:31:47,091
Anyway, thank you.

538
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:49,531
-Remember to send me the photos.
-Okay.

539
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:52,251
Does that mean you're going
to add me on WeChat?

540
00:31:53,851 --> 00:31:55,611
Adding you on WeChat
is not a big deal, right?

541
00:31:57,211 --> 00:31:58,851
So you're telling me not to overthink.

542
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:03,051
What could a little boy think about?

543
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:06,411
This little boy is different from others.

544
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:09,291
First, he's a joker
and he'll make you laugh.

545
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:12,851
No matter where, he'll protect you.

546
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:13,931
In addition,

547
00:32:14,011 --> 00:32:16,691
he's can talk to you about anything,
including music,

548
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:17,931
food or other interests.

549
00:32:18,091 --> 00:32:19,051
Most importantly,

550
00:32:19,611 --> 00:32:20,931
this little boy is very handsome.

551
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:23,691
So why don't you consider

552
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:26,571
being this little boy's girlfriend?

553
00:32:32,491 --> 00:32:33,891
Don't turn me down so quickly.

554
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:35,931
I'm giving you time to think.

555
00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:37,451
In the Bible, it's stated that

556
00:32:37,611 --> 00:32:39,571
people who are destined to be together

557
00:32:39,851 --> 00:32:41,011
will not be kept apart.

558
00:32:41,731 --> 00:32:42,691
Which scripture is that?

559
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:44,051
Additional scripture.

560
00:32:46,171 --> 00:32:47,051
All right.

561
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:49,331
It's a coincidence that we met today.

562
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:50,891
If we meet again,

563
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:52,331
I'll believe in destiny.

564
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:02,211
UNNUMBERED SEAT NAME LIST

565
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:05,611
"Zhou Caina."

566
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:09,331
Switch this Zhou Caina

567
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:11,651
to the best seat in the VIP zone.

568
00:33:12,131 --> 00:33:12,971
Okay.

569
00:33:16,571 --> 00:33:17,971
Why wait for next time?

570
00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:20,411
Leaving straight away after taking a photo

571
00:33:20,491 --> 00:33:21,971
is a little rude, right?

572
00:33:22,491 --> 00:33:25,251
You should at least treat me to a drink.

573
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:29,931
If you can return this favor
with a glass of wine,

574
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:31,291
then sure.

575
00:33:31,891 --> 00:33:33,491
I never ask for much.

576
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:39,211
Why aren't you drinking?

577
00:33:40,891 --> 00:33:41,771
No need to be shy.

578
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:44,611
I'm not.

579
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:46,651
-I'm just...
-Just what?

580
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:49,771
Okay.

581
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:51,331
I'll tell you a little secret.

582
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,811
I kind of lose my mind whenever I drink.

583
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,491
The next day,
I wake up not remembering anything.

584
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,291
Is that why you're worried?

585
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,611
Just drink.

586
00:34:01,771 --> 00:34:02,851
If you get drunk,

587
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:06,011
I'll be a gentleman
and take you back safely.

588
00:34:06,731 --> 00:34:08,211
-You promise?
-I promise.

589
00:34:08,611 --> 00:34:09,571
I'll drink then.

590
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:14,531
One more glass.

591
00:34:15,331 --> 00:34:16,371
Me too.

592
00:34:17,131 --> 00:34:18,011
All right.

593
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:24,131
Do you know which letters
of the 26 English alphabet

594
00:34:24,371 --> 00:34:25,611
is my favorite?

595
00:34:28,531 --> 00:34:29,771
You better not tell me

596
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:31,731
that you like "u" and "i" the most.

597
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:33,971
That's such an old Internet gag.

598
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:35,691
I just wanted to hear it

599
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:37,651
from your own mouth,

600
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:39,051
"I like you and I."

601
00:34:39,131 --> 00:34:40,091
That's all.

602
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,691
You really are adorable.

603
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:45,771
Cheers.

604
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,291
There won't be any "better you and I."

605
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:54,291
Because I'm going back to the States.

606
00:34:54,851 --> 00:34:55,851
But you just got back.

607
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:59,531
I don't really have a reason to stay.

608
00:35:01,411 --> 00:35:03,611
Can I be the reason for you to stay?

609
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:07,371
A young man is giving his commitment?

610
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:09,211
No matter what,

611
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:12,091
meeting me is the start of your happiness.

612
00:35:12,691 --> 00:35:13,771
To your future.

613
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:15,651
Cheers.

614
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:16,771
I like it.

615
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:19,331
Meeting you is the start of my happiness.

616
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,171
Let's toast to our future.

617
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:30,171
Do you dance a lot back in the States?

618
00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:32,091
Sure. I'm a good dancer.

619
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,491
-Come, let's dance.
-No, you go ahead.

620
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:50,611
Are you drunk?

621
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:52,091
-I'll take you home.
-I'm not drunk.

622
00:35:54,131 --> 00:35:56,291
Show me five fingers.

623
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:58,571
-Your five fingers.
-Five.

624
00:35:58,891 --> 00:35:59,771
Am I right?

625
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:00,811
Five fingers.

626
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:03,491
That's the most magical number right now.

627
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,851
Why is five the most magical number?

628
00:36:11,651 --> 00:36:13,811
Do this and the magic will come.

629
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:21,931
It has been a while, Caina.

630
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:32,891
Hi.

631
00:36:33,051 --> 00:36:34,291
It has been a while.

632
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:36,451
-Is he someone you know?
-Yes.

633
00:36:38,171 --> 00:36:39,331
Your friend?

634
00:36:42,771 --> 00:36:43,931
My friend.

635
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:46,411
I'm Meizuo.

636
00:36:46,491 --> 00:36:47,411
And you are?

637
00:36:47,611 --> 00:36:48,491
Terence.

638
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:50,051
Terence.

639
00:36:51,051 --> 00:36:53,851
Caina, is this old man your friend?

640
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:55,651
Him?

641
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:59,731
He was a summer-break boyfriend.

642
00:36:59,811 --> 00:37:01,091
Summer-break boyfriend?

643
00:37:06,011 --> 00:37:06,891
Weixun.

644
00:37:06,971 --> 00:37:08,451
Give me more wine.

645
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:10,611
-More wine.
-Okay.

646
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,491
Listen, man.

647
00:37:23,571 --> 00:37:25,411
I promised Caina to take her home.

648
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:26,571
Allow me.

649
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,931
-Do you know where she lives?
-I...

650
00:37:29,531 --> 00:37:30,491
She'll tell me.

651
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,891
How will she do that when she's so drunk?

652
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:35,131
I brought her here.

653
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,811
So? Are you two close?

654
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:41,171
It's none of your business.

655
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:46,971
It hurts.

656
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:53,331
It hurts.

657
00:38:21,371 --> 00:38:22,211
Sir!

658
00:38:22,971 --> 00:38:24,571
Your coconuts!

659
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:29,891
Sir, you dropped your coconuts!

660
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:35,291
Sir, your coconuts fell off.

661
00:38:57,331 --> 00:38:58,571
It's you again.

662
00:39:08,091 --> 00:39:08,971
A sad face.

663
00:42:43,571 --> 00:42:44,491
Hey.

664
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:46,051
Weixun.

665
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:47,651
Give me more wine.
