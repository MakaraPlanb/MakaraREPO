TALENT'S TEA SHOP

5
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:33,331
Daoming Si is going
to introduce you to his mom.

6
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:35,611
It feels like you're going to be
married soon.

7
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:37,771
What are you talking about?

8
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:39,411
I'm not even his girlfriend.

9
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:40,811
Why not?

10
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:44,211
Daoming Si even risked his life for you.

11
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:46,571
You also got hurt trying to protect him.

12
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:48,731
You have a very close relationship.

13
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:50,371
It makes sense to talk about marriage.

14
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:54,811
Shancai.

15
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:57,811
You're finally going to become
part of an elite family.

16
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:06,331
Come on.

17
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:08,611
My problem is what gift
I'm giving to Daoming Si, okay?

18
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:10,971
Speaking of gifts.

19
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:13,771
I really want to lend you some money.

20
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:17,651
But I'm also a bit tight
with money right now.

21
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:20,331
Earlier this month,
I bought some clothes on sale.

22
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:22,891
I'm really broke right now.

23
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:25,971
Then what should I do?

24
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:28,411
It would be embarrassing
to show up empty-handed.

25
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:33,771
Wait a minute.

26
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:35,171
Didn't you win the special prize

27
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:36,931
at the Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition?

28
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:39,291
Any dish you cook must be valuable.

29
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:47,931
They have famous chefs working for them.

30
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:49,491
How can they eat the dishes I make?

31
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:52,411
It's the thought that counts.

32
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,091
You can also make some dessert.

33
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,531
As long as you're the one who made it,
I'm sure he'll like it.

34
00:03:06,531 --> 00:03:08,371
Dessert...

35
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:54,971
Sorry to keep you waiting.

36
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:57,051
It's fine. We also just arrived.

37
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:00,971
Why are you so formally dressed?

38
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:03,251
We're not too formally dressed.

39
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:04,731
You're the one that is...

40
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:10,011
too underdressed.

41
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:15,011
This is my nicest dress.

42
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:20,651
It doesn't matter.

43
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:22,651
Lei already expected this. Let's go.

44
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:24,571
Wait.

45
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:26,971
Tell me.

46
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:29,731
Why should I wear something nice?

47
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:33,971
Is there any special meaning
to this birthday party?

48
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:39,051
Si's birthday party is a very important
occasion in the Daoming family.

49
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,731
How important is it?

50
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:47,131
Politicians and people of stature
will try to get along

51
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:48,811
and benefit from the Daoming Group.

52
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:52,491
Actually, the focus of Si's birthday party
is not about Si himself, but his mom...

53
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:55,211
Who's the real power
behind the Daoming Group.

54
00:05:58,051 --> 00:05:59,651
Daoming Si's mom?

55
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:04,011
But what does that have to do
with whether I dress formally or not?

56
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:06,771
Si's mom is a very scary woman.

57
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:09,331
She's hard to deal with,

58
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:11,491
especially in scrutinizing young girls.

59
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,011
As Si's the only successor
of the Daoming Group

60
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,091
and he has brought a girl home...

61
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:18,531
Your future together...

62
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:20,091
Future?

63
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:24,211
We're referring to your married life.

64
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:27,131
Shancai, you're the first girl
Si ever brought home.

65
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:30,091
His mom would scrutinize you
as his fiancée.

66
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:33,171
Fiancée?

67
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:41,171
All right. Stop struggling. Let's go.

68
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:42,691
No. I'm not going anymore.

69
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:44,851
I'm not going anymore. Let go of me.

70
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,771
Shancai, just wear this one.

71
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:53,771
It suits you.

72
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:56,611
It doesn't suit Shancai's age.

73
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:57,931
It's too extravagant.

74
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:00,931
How about this one?

75
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:04,451
It doesn't go with Shancai's dress.

76
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:05,691
No.

77
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:06,971
Wait.

78
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,171
I...

79
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:11,051
Can I not wear any of them?

80
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,171
I don't think I can pull it off
with my background.

81
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,811
Have more confidence.

82
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:19,251
You're the special prize winner of the
Chinese Cuisine Culinary Competition.

83
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:24,811
But we're just attending
Daoming Si's birthday party.

84
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,531
Do we need to be so formal?

85
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:28,051
Shancai.

86
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:31,171
Having similar social and economic status
still matters to some people.

87
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:34,171
Regardless if it's their family background
or ethics,

88
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:35,851
there isn't a very big difference.

89
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,771
Si's mom

90
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,291
is especially strict in this area.

91
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:44,411
Similar social and economic status?

92
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:49,091
Even though it sounds very traditional,
Si's family still holds this concept.

93
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:53,051
So just pretend to be
from a well-known family today

94
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:55,771
for Si's sake.

95
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,131
Please.

96
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:09,251
This one suits you.

97
00:09:59,651 --> 00:10:01,691
<i>This is Daoming Si's birthday party?</i>

98
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:04,611
<i>It's just like what I see in the movies.</i>

99
00:10:05,211 --> 00:10:07,931
<i>It's a completely different world
from how I live.</i>

100
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:12,851
<i>Looking at the other guests,
I really don't belong here.</i>

101
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:24,651
Excuse me.

102
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:31,171
Why are you so late?

103
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:33,611
Because...

104
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:38,451
You look so elegant today.

105
00:10:41,411 --> 00:10:44,611
Ximen, Meizuo, and Lei
helped me dress up this way.

106
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,291
It's quite nice.

107
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:52,891
You look like you're from
a well-known family today.

108
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:56,371
I'm a fake.

109
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:57,931
A fake?

110
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:00,371
Never mind.

111
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:02,091
It's nothing.

112
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:03,771
Sorry. Excuse me.

113
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,331
Mr. Daoming Si, on behalf of our company,

114
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:16,051
I'd like to give you
this 1907 Heidsieck champagne

115
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:17,371
as your birthday gift.

116
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:19,571
Happy Birthday, Mr. Daoming Si.

117
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:21,411
Thank you to you and your family.

118
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:22,411
You're so thoughtful.

119
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:26,211
The Shipwrecked 1907 Heidsieck?

120
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:28,131
That's incredible.

121
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:33,371
What's so special about that champagne?

122
00:11:34,731 --> 00:11:38,051
That champagne was taken
from a shipwreck in 1907.

123
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:39,891
Because of its long history,

124
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,451
it's one of the world's
most difficult wines to find.

125
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:44,811
Isn't it a shame

126
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:47,091
if you drink such a special wine?

127
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,611
This wine is not for drinking.

128
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,651
Isn't this a gift
for Daoming Si's birthday?

129
00:11:55,891 --> 00:11:56,891
Yes, it is.

130
00:11:56,971 --> 00:11:59,371
But these gifts would be sold
to charity auctions.

131
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:00,971
All the proceeds will also be donated.

132
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:04,251
That means that this rare champagne

133
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:08,371
and other kinds of rare gifts
would all not go to Si.

134
00:12:08,571 --> 00:12:10,451
He's just putting on an act
for receiving them.

135
00:12:13,731 --> 00:12:16,731
I never thought Daoming Si
would have such a big heart.

136
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:18,171
This way, please.

137
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:22,491
<i>No.</i>

138
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:27,211
<i>The gifts from normal people
won't be auctioned.</i>

139
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:37,571
Mr. Daoming Si.

140
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:38,651
Hi.

141
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:40,851
This is the nine heavenly eyes necklace

142
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:42,691
that my mother used
to pray for you in Bhutan.

143
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:45,091
It symbolizes nobleness and good fortune.

144
00:12:45,171 --> 00:12:47,851
This is our gift
for your birthday this year.

145
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:49,851
Thank you very much.
That's very kind of you.

146
00:12:56,811 --> 00:12:57,811
-This way, please.
-Okay.

147
00:12:57,891 --> 00:12:58,771
Bye.

148
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:02,051
This heavenly necklace is not only rare,
it's very precious too.

149
00:13:02,371 --> 00:13:04,211
It would surely get a good price
in the auction.

150
00:13:04,411 --> 00:13:06,331
He put a lot of thought
into that precious gift.

151
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:09,851
He must have a close relationship
with the Daoming family.

152
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:13,651
They've been working closely
with the Daoming Group for the past year.

153
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:21,331
What are you thinking about?

154
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:24,811
Where's my gift?

155
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:33,971
-I forgot to bring it.
-You forgot?

156
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:37,731
How could anyone attend a birthday party
and forget the gift?

157
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:42,531
Just continue playing dumb.

158
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:45,491
Come on. Follow me.

159
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:47,611
-Where are we going?
-To introduce you to my mom.

160
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:50,251
There's no need for that.

161
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:53,211
I'll just blend in with the crowd. I'll...

162
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,731
She won't be able to see me.

163
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:55,731
It's fine.

164
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:57,051
Why are you so nervous?

165
00:13:57,411 --> 00:13:59,131
I'm not introducing you as my girlfriend.

166
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:01,811
There's no need for that either.

167
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:03,851
Just follow me.

168
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:06,171
No. I'm not going.

169
00:14:06,331 --> 00:14:07,411
I'm not going!

170
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:33,771
<i>My goodness.</i>

171
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:35,571
<i>Her eyes are so scary.</i>

172
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:37,291
<i>Why can't I move?</i>

173
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:40,331
Miss, who are you?

174
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:54,731
Sorry. I...

175
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:01,251
Stand up.

176
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:07,771
Si.

177
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:10,051
Is she your friend?

178
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:13,651
Yes.

179
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,771
Then please escort her out.

180
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:34,571
Did you hear what I said?

181
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:38,811
I heard you.

182
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,371
But sorry, I can't do that.

183
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:46,611
What did you say?

184
00:16:48,011 --> 00:16:51,251
I want to take this opportunity
to formally introduce you

185
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:54,251
to someone who's very important to me.

186
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:04,851
Her name is Dong Shancai.

187
00:17:06,131 --> 00:17:07,371
She's the girl that I like.

188
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:10,651
I hope you can also accept her.

189
00:17:16,691 --> 00:17:18,131
<i>Daoming Si, are you crazy?</i>

190
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:20,571
<i>Have you ever considered my position?</i>

191
00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:27,371
Do you realize what you just said?

192
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:28,891
I do.

193
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:31,051
You do?

194
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:34,411
Mrs. Daoming.

195
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,291
This girl is a student
from Mingde University.

196
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:39,491
She's close with us.

197
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,011
That's right.
It's not what you think at all.

198
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:43,211
I didn't ask you.

199
00:17:43,691 --> 00:17:44,731
Shut up.

200
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,411
Dong Shancai.

201
00:17:53,091 --> 00:17:54,291
Yes.

202
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:55,571
Based on what I know,

203
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:59,051
there's not a lot of people with
the surname Dong in the business world.

204
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:00,291
I want to ask you

205
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:03,251
what business is your father in?

206
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:09,811
My father is...

207
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:12,411
The President of Huangpu Chamber
of Commerce's Overseas Division.

208
00:18:17,211 --> 00:18:19,731
He's mainly responsible for the business
in North Africa and UAE.

209
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:23,051
It's understandable
that you don't know him.

210
00:18:27,651 --> 00:18:30,451
That's right. The companies he's handling
would be publicly listed soon.

211
00:18:31,691 --> 00:18:34,011
<i>Why are they telling a lie?</i>

212
00:18:34,091 --> 00:18:36,011
<i>That lie could immediately fall apart.</i>

213
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:39,091
A girl who comes from this kind of family
must have a lot of skills,

214
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:40,571
such as playing musical instruments.

215
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:44,811
Of course.

216
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:48,851
Shancai can play the piano or violin.

217
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:56,131
Then please play a song
for our charity auction tonight.

218
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:02,811
We can also treat it as an auction item.
What do you all think?

219
00:19:04,691 --> 00:19:05,571
Mrs. Daoming.

220
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:08,411
Shancai is very busy with school lately.

221
00:19:08,651 --> 00:19:10,051
She didn't have time to practice.

222
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:12,131
How about letting her play next time?

223
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:15,571
That's right. If you want to hear a song,
Lei can play it for you.

224
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:20,211
Social etiquette and skills

225
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,371
are basic requirements
for someone from such a family.

226
00:19:24,651 --> 00:19:25,651
Shancai.

227
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:26,971
Please go ahead.

228
00:20:09,171 --> 00:20:10,051
Si.

229
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:12,491
Take her away. She must be terrified.

230
00:20:39,731 --> 00:20:40,891
Humans.

231
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:45,211
When you put more importance
in the clothes they wear

232
00:20:45,771 --> 00:20:47,531
than the wisdom they possess,

233
00:20:49,171 --> 00:20:51,851
when you put more importance
to the expensive jewelry they wear

234
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:56,091
than their righteousness, kindness,

235
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:58,571
and bravery...

236
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:07,171
When you're easily fooled

237
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:09,571
by illusory comparisons

238
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:15,211
and couldn't see the pure heart

239
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:17,451
that's burning and beating
right in front of you,

240
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:25,451
you lost the right to have
real human emotions.

241
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:34,811
Excuse me.

242
00:21:36,651 --> 00:21:38,571
What were you saying earlier?

243
00:21:46,651 --> 00:21:48,131
Tagore once said,

244
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:52,251
"Set the bird’s wings with gold

245
00:21:53,171 --> 00:21:55,291
and birds won’t fly over."

246
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:58,091
A person's value

247
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:01,091
is not decided by
his social class and status."

248
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:05,171
I don't come from a well-known family.

249
00:22:06,811 --> 00:22:09,171
I can only play this song.

250
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:11,731
But so what?

251
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:15,211
My heart is open and honest.

252
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:20,211
Si.

253
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:24,491
Your friend's upbringing
is very interesting.

254
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:29,371
I'd surely find time to visit
that President father of hers.

255
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:37,651
I really don't care whose daughter she is.

256
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:40,171
But you're our family's only son.

257
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:44,931
Do you think you're a match
for such an ill-mannered girl?

258
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:46,291
I like her.

259
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,051
Aside from her,
I wouldn't accept any other girl.

260
00:22:49,171 --> 00:22:51,211
I like her. What can you do?

261
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:54,971
It's not up to you.

262
00:22:58,851 --> 00:22:59,971
Mrs. Daoming.

263
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:02,011
Please stop.

264
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:04,851
-Daoming Si and I--
-Since that's the case,

265
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:07,331
I'll leave with her.

266
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,491
If you dare to walk out this door,
be prepared for the consequences.

267
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:15,331
Si.

268
00:23:18,771 --> 00:23:19,771
Thanks.

269
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:57,331
<i>Am I dreaming?</i>

270
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:00,291
<i>Because of me,
Daoming Si disobeyed his mom</i>

271
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:02,771
<i>and messed up such an important party.</i>

272
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:06,051
Put on your seatbelt.
I had a hard time taking you out of there.

273
00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:07,811
I don't want anything to happen to you.

274
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:21,811
Where are we?

275
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:26,651
This is one of the clubhouses
our family owns.

276
00:25:26,851 --> 00:25:29,291
The last time my mom came here
she wanted to renovate it.

277
00:25:29,731 --> 00:25:31,411
I guess the renovation hasn't started yet.

278
00:25:32,891 --> 00:25:34,731
Do you know M Hotel?

279
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:37,291
Yes.

280
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:41,611
That international chain hotel
with the shape of maple leaf as its logo.

281
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:45,411
Even though I haven't stayed there before,
I always see it on TV.

282
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:47,731
That's also my family's business.

283
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:49,731
My mom has always been
the one handling that.

284
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:57,531
<i>I couldn't imagine
how a family can be so incredible.</i>

285
00:26:01,971 --> 00:26:02,931
Daoming Si.

286
00:26:03,691 --> 00:26:04,571
Sorry.

287
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:07,811
I messed up such an important party.

288
00:26:08,051 --> 00:26:09,771
And started a fight
between you and your mom.

289
00:26:10,331 --> 00:26:11,251
It's fine.

290
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:17,571
I'm not close with my mom anyway.

291
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:21,971
To her, maybe work
is more important than me.

292
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:26,091
That's why I don't have
any memory of being with her.

293
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:28,411
Don't mind what happened.

294
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:31,611
I'll make the decisions for my life.

295
00:26:38,051 --> 00:26:40,891
Why are you talking about your life to me?

296
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:42,211
Nonsense.

297
00:27:09,891 --> 00:27:11,291
My life is you.

298
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:32,211
The night is so beautiful.

299
00:27:39,971 --> 00:27:42,051
I remember when I was young,

300
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:47,491
I thought I could get a star
if I can get close to the sky.

301
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:51,771
My dad would always carry me
on his shoulders

302
00:27:52,251 --> 00:27:54,051
to get me closer to the sky.

303
00:28:21,771 --> 00:28:22,731
My heart is not at ease.

304
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:29,371
I'll probably have nightmares
from what happened tonight.

305
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,091
Can you even fall asleep?

306
00:28:33,531 --> 00:28:35,211
I wouldn't even dare
to turn off the lights.

307
00:28:35,411 --> 00:28:38,811
I'm afraid that I'll hear a gunshot
outside the window to punish me

308
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:40,371
for helping Si and Shancai.

309
00:28:44,011 --> 00:28:44,851
Lei.

310
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,811
When did Shancai learn
how to play the piano?

311
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,011
Why didn't we know about it?

312
00:28:48,771 --> 00:28:49,931
We were so nervous earlier.

313
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:51,691
I only taught her once.

314
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:53,691
I'm not sure when she practiced
by herself.

315
00:28:54,611 --> 00:28:56,371
But so what if she was able
to play the piano?

316
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:58,411
It still turned out that way today.

317
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,731
Do you still remember meeting Si's mom

318
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:02,931
in his house when we were
high school seniors?

319
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:06,891
You played so badly today.

320
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:09,211
-I'm so much better than you, okay?
-I'm way better, okay?

321
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:29,131
Whose idea was it
to cut class and go ice skating?

322
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:33,211
If you dare to cut classes,
then don't let me find out.

323
00:29:34,571 --> 00:29:35,451
Sorry, Mrs. Daoming.

324
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:38,131
We won't do it again.

325
00:29:40,731 --> 00:29:41,971
Si.

326
00:29:42,051 --> 00:29:46,411
If you hang around with such people,
then your life would be hopeless!

327
00:29:56,731 --> 00:29:58,171
I also don't feel good now.

328
00:29:59,691 --> 00:30:02,811
At that time, we only cut class
and went ice skating

329
00:30:03,811 --> 00:30:04,931
and we were scolded that way.

330
00:30:05,491 --> 00:30:06,691
With what happened today,

331
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:09,611
I'm not sure if Si's mom
will make Shancai...

332
00:30:13,131 --> 00:30:15,411
Shancai even dared

333
00:30:16,011 --> 00:30:18,211
to have a direct confrontation with her.

334
00:30:20,931 --> 00:30:22,611
I hope she can take it.

335
00:30:23,731 --> 00:30:25,291
I wonder how they're doing now.

336
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:39,011
Have you touched the star yet?

337
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:41,531
Go a little higher and get me closer.

338
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:43,331
You're so heavy.

339
00:31:08,371 --> 00:31:09,291
Honestly,

340
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:11,611
did you think about it carefully or not?

341
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:14,611
Think about what?

342
00:31:15,451 --> 00:31:16,491
Your feelings for me.

343
00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:22,091
I...

344
00:31:24,171 --> 00:31:25,611
Actually, I'm not sure.

345
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:30,531
When will you learn
to be honest with yourself?

346
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:38,331
Daoming Si.

347
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:40,731
Let me ask you a question first.

348
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:43,051
I'm the one who was asking you a question.

349
00:31:43,491 --> 00:31:45,571
And what kind of lousy answer was that?

350
00:31:45,651 --> 00:31:47,291
How was that a lousy answer?

351
00:31:47,371 --> 00:31:48,731
I told you how I really feel.

352
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:51,571
All right. Ask your question.

353
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:55,491
Look at me.

354
00:31:55,851 --> 00:31:57,291
My looks are mediocre.

355
00:31:57,771 --> 00:31:58,811
My skills are mediocre.

356
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,011
My family background is mediocre.

357
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:02,811
There are so many girls
in Mingde University.

358
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,731
Why me?

359
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:11,771
Maybe I'm really blind.

360
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:22,971
I suddenly realized

361
00:32:24,571 --> 00:32:26,131
I brought something we can eat.

362
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:33,011
What's that?

363
00:32:34,851 --> 00:32:35,891
Nothing.

364
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:38,011
It's nothing important.

365
00:32:40,211 --> 00:32:41,171
Don't snatch it away.

366
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:43,251
Give it back to me.

367
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:45,211
Give it back!

368
00:32:47,611 --> 00:32:48,771
Give it back.

369
00:32:48,851 --> 00:32:50,051
What exactly is this?

370
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:54,171
It's your birthday gift.

371
00:32:55,611 --> 00:32:57,851
My birthday gift?
Didn't you say you forgot to bring it?

372
00:32:57,931 --> 00:33:00,011
After seeing what others gave you,

373
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:02,251
I looked at my lousy gift.

374
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,491
How can I give it to you?

375
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:21,371
These are the cookies I baked
based on the way you look.

376
00:33:22,651 --> 00:33:24,051
This is you when you're smiling.

377
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:25,571
This is you when you're mad.

378
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:27,571
This is you when you're sleeping.

379
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,531
This is you when you're being dumb.

380
00:33:34,891 --> 00:33:36,331
I was in such a hurry.

381
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:38,331
So I wasn't able to do it well.

382
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:40,211
Never mind.

383
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:43,251
Give it back to me if you don't want it.

384
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:50,611
You're so bad.

385
00:33:51,931 --> 00:33:53,171
I'm sorry.

386
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:56,131
I'll prepare a better gift for you
next time, okay?

387
00:33:57,491 --> 00:33:58,931
Why didn't you give it to me earlier?

388
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:02,491
If you did, I would have been
so happy the whole night.

389
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:09,251
This is the best gift
I've ever received in my entire life.

390
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:04,171
It's 6:00 a.m. Why is she not home yet?

391
00:35:05,411 --> 00:35:06,611
Haven't I told you already?

392
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:09,811
If you're worried, just give her a call.

393
00:35:10,771 --> 00:35:12,171
Why would I call her?

394
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,371
She's celebrating Daoming Si's
birthday with him.

395
00:35:14,451 --> 00:35:15,931
It would ruin the mood if I call her.

396
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:17,331
So what should we do?

397
00:35:21,691 --> 00:35:22,571
My darling daughter.

398
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:23,771
You're finally home.

399
00:35:23,851 --> 00:35:25,331
-Come on. Give that to me.
-How was it?

400
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:27,891
We left the party early.

401
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:30,971
Daoming Si and I ran out.

402
00:35:31,531 --> 00:35:32,531
You ran out?

403
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:36,931
We went to see the night view
and ate biscuits.

404
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:38,731
That's so romantic.

405
00:35:38,811 --> 00:35:40,691
-What else?
-Yes. What happened next?

406
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:43,291
Tell us.

407
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,091
Hurry.

408
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:50,851
That's it.

409
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:54,531
What does "that's it" mean?

410
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:58,771
She said that's it, then that's it.

411
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:00,811
Look how happy she looks.

412
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:02,011
"That's it"?

413
00:36:02,331 --> 00:36:03,411
What is it?

414
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:04,771
"That's it."

415
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:15,931
Lei, wake up! Lei!

416
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:17,331
Come on. Wake up. Hurry.

417
00:36:17,411 --> 00:36:18,571
I want to show you something.

418
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:22,531
Do you know what this is?

419
00:36:24,571 --> 00:36:26,451
This is the birthday gift Shancai gave me.

420
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:34,131
This is me.
The utterly handsome Daoming Si.

421
00:36:35,971 --> 00:36:37,651
Look. Doesn't it look so similar to me?

422
00:36:39,051 --> 00:36:40,011
Doesn't it?

423
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:42,451
Huaze Lei. What are you doing?

424
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:44,131
Spit it out. Hurry!

425
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:46,051
Spit it out!

426
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:47,091
Huaze Lei.

427
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,491
She gave them to me.
I haven't even tasted them yet!

428
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:02,811
Mrs. Daoming, I've already
investigated everything.

429
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:07,291
Dong Shancai is not the daughter
of some company president.

430
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:11,251
Her father used to be a logistics director
for a small business.

431
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:14,931
He now works at Great Earnings
Investment Consulting Corporation

432
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:16,491
as a telemarketer.

433
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:20,411
Her mom manages
Dong's Private Kitchen online.

434
00:37:20,811 --> 00:37:22,331
It's a home chef delivery business.

435
00:37:22,971 --> 00:37:26,691
And Dong Shancai is a freshman
at Mingde University taking up Nutrition.

436
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:29,451
She once attacked Mr. Bobbit,

437
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:32,451
a guest speaker at the school's
opening ceremony, for no apparent reason.

438
00:37:33,371 --> 00:37:35,531
And her grades are mediocre.

439
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:37,211
She doesn't have any special talents.

440
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:38,971
Furthermore, I've confirmed with Mr. Liu

441
00:37:40,531 --> 00:37:43,531
that Si's previous mishaps
and even the time he was hospitalized

442
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:45,371
were all related to her.

443
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:48,331
And Si recommended her

444
00:37:48,491 --> 00:37:49,891
on behalf of the Daoming family

445
00:37:50,171 --> 00:37:52,331
to join the Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition.

446
00:37:52,891 --> 00:37:54,051
She got the special prize.

447
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:01,931
She knows how to use
the Daoming family name

448
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:03,851
to show her status.

449
00:38:08,211 --> 00:38:10,131
She's smart. She has her ways.

450
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:12,091
DONG SHANCAI

451
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:15,211
But if she thinks that she can totally
transform herself

452
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:17,171
into an exceptional girl using her tricks,

453
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:19,971
then she's got to be kidding me.

454
00:38:48,331 --> 00:38:49,451
Dumplings again?

455
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:52,291
Fine.

456
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:58,331
Who is it? It's just nine in the morning.

457
00:38:58,411 --> 00:38:59,971
Are they here to check the water meters?

458
00:39:00,051 --> 00:39:02,571
Why would they check the meters?
They just did that.

459
00:39:09,531 --> 00:39:11,811
Is this where Dong Shancai lives?

460
00:39:12,411 --> 00:39:14,211
Yes.

461
00:39:17,971 --> 00:39:20,171
Shancai, wake up.

462
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:21,491
What are you doing?

463
00:39:22,051 --> 00:39:23,291
Daoming Si's mom is here.

464
00:39:26,051 --> 00:39:27,211
Daoming Si's mom?

465
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:29,691
Yes. She's in the living room.

466
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:31,971
Mrs. Daoming.

467
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:34,571
Shancai is so exceptional.
She hasn't even graduated from college,

468
00:39:34,651 --> 00:39:37,131
yet she joined a Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition

469
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:38,651
and won the special prize.

470
00:39:38,731 --> 00:39:41,851
They said that this prize
is the first of its kind.

471
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:45,091
Mrs. Daoming, let me tell you.

472
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:48,171
I discovered an especially good financial
investment project just recently.

473
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:50,051
The interests are high
and the risk is low.

474
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:51,531
You're also a businesswoman.

475
00:39:52,011 --> 00:39:53,091
Let's do it together.

476
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:54,771
I'll just take five percent commission.

477
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:55,731
What do you think?

478
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:59,171
May I ask why you came to our house?

479
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,131
I'll get straight to the point then.

480
00:40:05,491 --> 00:40:08,491
-Your daughter is very motivated.
-Yes.

481
00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:10,651
She put a lot of effort into my son.

482
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:13,611
However,

483
00:40:14,571 --> 00:40:16,651
I won't let her just give up for nothing.

484
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:24,491
This is a check for five million yuan
as a token of appreciation.

485
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:29,211
What token of appreciation?

486
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,611
I know this is a bit rude,

487
00:40:32,251 --> 00:40:35,771
but your family
is just managing a small business.

488
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:37,171
You need subsidy.

489
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:40,851
Si has a big burden on his shoulders.

490
00:40:40,931 --> 00:40:44,051
He'll manage the whole
Daoming Group in the future.

491
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:45,651
So Shancai,

492
00:40:46,131 --> 00:40:48,851
I hope you could understand
how a mother feels.

493
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:53,531
If a stumbling block appears in your life,

494
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:57,251
you'd remove it too, right?

495
00:40:58,051 --> 00:40:59,411
Stumbling block?

496
00:41:00,931 --> 00:41:03,651
-What do you mean?
-I've already made myself very clear.

497
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:07,291
If you continue with what you're doing,

498
00:41:07,691 --> 00:41:09,811
you'll be the one
who'll end up getting hurt.

499
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:17,051
Mrs. Daoming.

500
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:19,291
I think you're being too nice.

501
00:41:21,051 --> 00:41:22,611
Mom, what are you saying?

502
00:41:23,491 --> 00:41:25,091
You're being sensible.

503
00:41:33,211 --> 00:41:34,851
-What...
-What are you doing?

504
00:41:36,331 --> 00:41:37,451
Mom, what are you doing?

505
00:41:37,531 --> 00:41:40,531
As a mother, I would never allow
anyone to insult my daughter.

506
00:41:41,171 --> 00:41:42,931
Sorry. My mom's too emotional.

507
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:44,291
I apologize on her behalf.

508
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:46,211
But it's also not right for you
to insult me.

509
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,971
I never wanted to get anything
by marrying into the Daoming family.

510
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:52,971
I'm really sorry. My wife was really rude.

511
00:41:53,051 --> 00:41:56,731
-What are you doing?
-I...

512
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:00,091
-Are you all right, ma'am?
-Here.

513
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:01,371
Wash it off.

514
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:05,291
You...

515
00:42:07,371 --> 00:42:08,531
You've gone too far.

516
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:10,611
-Let's go.
-Wait.

517
00:42:10,691 --> 00:42:12,851
Take your lousy money away.
You're not welcome here.

518
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:18,691
Come here.

519
00:42:19,811 --> 00:42:20,651
Mom.

520
00:42:21,091 --> 00:42:22,411
You're so great.

521
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:25,251
You refused five million yuan
for my dignity.

522
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:28,131
Having a firm tough mom
like you as an example,

523
00:42:28,251 --> 00:42:29,731
I think I can handle anything.

524
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:31,171
Silly girl.

525
00:42:31,411 --> 00:42:33,731
Do you think five million yuan
would make me surrender?

526
00:42:34,571 --> 00:42:36,971
If it's five hundred million,
I might consider it.

527
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:38,811
What?

528
00:42:38,971 --> 00:42:39,811
No.

529
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:43,091
Look at Daoming Si.
He's so handsome and he loves you so much.

530
00:42:43,171 --> 00:42:46,291
I can't get such a son-in-law
with five hundred million yuan. Right?

531
00:42:50,691 --> 00:42:55,331
It's so hilarious thinking
about what you two did to his mom.

532
00:42:55,411 --> 00:42:56,531
I think you were incredible.

533
00:42:56,611 --> 00:42:57,691
-Aren't I great?
-You are.

534
00:42:57,771 --> 00:42:58,971
-Are you satisfied?
-I am.

535
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,131
When you pretended to splash her earlier,
I was really scared.

536
00:43:03,211 --> 00:43:04,171
