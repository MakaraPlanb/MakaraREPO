EPISODE 11

4
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:38,526
Tian Ye.

5
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:41,166
This is Yang Rong.

6
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:43,606
She graduated from cooking school
with the best grades.

7
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:45,846
She'll help you in the kitchen.

8
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,886
I remember you told me
that she would be here before noon.

9
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:51,566
It's already one o'clock.

10
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:55,166
Sorry, I'm late. I was stuck in traffic.

11
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:56,846
If you can't be here on time,

12
00:01:57,286 --> 00:01:58,246
I won't work with you.

13
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:00,766
But, Tian Ye,

14
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:02,646
I spent a lot of effort poaching her.

15
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:05,046
If you kick her out,
who's going to take the job?

16
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,326
I'm sorry. I'll never be late again.

17
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:08,726
Please give me another chance.

18
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:11,966
What's your name?

19
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:14,846
I'm Dong Shancai.

20
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,566
You're here to try out for the job, right?

21
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:18,166
Can you start today?

22
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:20,406
-No problem.
-No.

23
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:23,126
I just read her resume.
She has no experience.

24
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:25,566
Attitude is more important.

25
00:03:04,246 --> 00:03:05,086
Si.

26
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,246
Mom called me.

27
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:09,726
She wants me to bring you
back to London this time.

28
00:03:09,886 --> 00:03:11,086
I have already refused for you.

29
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:16,286
Zhuang, I've decided.

30
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:17,926
Decided what?

31
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:19,686
I'm going to the UK.

32
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,086
Didn't you say you'd never go?

33
00:03:23,646 --> 00:03:24,606
Well, I changed my mind.

34
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:31,326
I made up my mind
before the Bridge competition.

35
00:03:32,006 --> 00:03:33,286
When the competition is over,

36
00:03:33,886 --> 00:03:36,126
regardless of the outcome,
I'm leaving for the UK.

37
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,686
I'll take a look at the schools there.

38
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:40,566
If I like it there,

39
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:44,086
I'm going to study there.

40
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:47,446
Is this because of Shancai?

41
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:49,566
Zhuang, I don't have to explain.

42
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:52,206
I can go wherever I want, whenever I want.

43
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:53,846
The faster, the better.

44
00:03:54,606 --> 00:03:55,446
By the way,

45
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,166
can you help me with the application
and my passport?

46
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:02,446
You're this easily defeated?

47
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:05,286
That's not the Daoming family spirit.

48
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:46,566
I can finally rest.

49
00:04:47,606 --> 00:04:48,846
I'm getting old now,

50
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:50,806
I can't deal with this.

51
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:52,766
-Thank you, Mr. Gao.
-Thanks.

52
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:55,086
I'm going to retire soon.

53
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:57,126
You young people should work hard.

54
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:58,846
Tian Ye.

55
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:01,846
You're going to take over
as the head chef soon.

56
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:05,126
I don't know if I'll pass the exam.

57
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:09,366
Hey, try the pork ribs I just made.

58
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:11,646
That smells amazing.

59
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:13,246
You can cook?

60
00:05:13,686 --> 00:05:15,406
My mom has a takeout restaurant.

61
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:16,886
So, I learned a bit from her.

62
00:05:20,926 --> 00:05:22,006
It's pretty delicious.

63
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:23,846
It looks good too.

64
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:25,566
Which school did you go to?

65
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:26,486
I go to Mingde.

66
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:28,126
-Mingde?
-Mingde?

67
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:30,286
Only elite students go there.

68
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:32,646
Why did you come to help in the kitchen?

69
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:36,526
I major in nutrition
and my mom cooks for a living,

70
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:38,686
so I'm happy when I'm in the kitchen.

71
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:39,806
I can learn so much here.

72
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:43,326
We sure have a lot of elite students here.

73
00:05:45,406 --> 00:05:47,166
This is our sous chef,

74
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,166
Tian Ye.

75
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:51,606
He's also an elite student
in business school.

76
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:55,726
You guys should go ahead and eat,
I'm still cutting onions.

77
00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:56,846
I'll come over later.

78
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:02,526
<i>Daoming Si is gone.</i>

79
00:06:02,606 --> 00:06:04,926
<i>Will F4 break up?</i>

80
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,166
<i>-My heart has left with Daoming Si.
-What?</i>

81
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:09,086
Hey, Shancai.

82
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:12,686
Shancai!

83
00:06:15,886 --> 00:06:17,126
-What?
-Have you heard?

84
00:06:17,726 --> 00:06:19,846
-Heard what?
-Daoming Si is going to London.

85
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:25,286
London? You're going to London?

86
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:27,566
It's not a big deal.

87
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,526
My mom's business is there.

88
00:06:29,926 --> 00:06:31,966
It's totally normal for me to go there.

89
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:33,366
Liar.

90
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:34,926
You hate it in London.

91
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:37,246
Are you trying to avoid Lei and Shancai?

92
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:38,606
Why would I avoid them?

93
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:39,646
Si.

94
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:43,246
Just so you know,

95
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:46,846
I'm not going to London
because of you. It's my plan.

96
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:51,326
I'm going to come back a better man.

97
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,086
Yeah right. You won't last two months.

98
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:02,766
You're going to London?

99
00:07:03,846 --> 00:07:05,326
Yes. Got a problem with that?

100
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:07,126
Shancai, he's not sure yet.

101
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:08,286
Talk some sense into him.

102
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:11,086
I've made up my mind.
No one can persuade me.

103
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:12,406
I'm leaving tomorrow.

104
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:14,886
Tomorrow?

105
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:17,206
Why didn't you tell me?

106
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:20,046
Why would I tell you?

107
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:24,326
Without me in the way,
you can finally date him.

108
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:26,366
Isn't that right, Lei?

109
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:33,766
You should get right to it.

110
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:37,126
When I get to London,
I'll find a blond girl

111
00:07:38,446 --> 00:07:40,646
and we'll go on dates
by the River Thames every day.

112
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:42,486
It will be so romantic.

113
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:50,606
Fine.

114
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:52,246
Go then.

115
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,606
I'm happy you're leaving.
I'll live happier without you.

116
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:58,566
Goodbye forever!

117
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:20,086
Shancai, bring over the soup.

118
00:08:20,686 --> 00:08:21,646
Okay.

119
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:27,926
Be careful!

120
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:32,326
Are you okay?

121
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:33,886
I'm fine.

122
00:08:39,446 --> 00:08:40,526
Hello, sir.

123
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:45,846
-Daoming Si?
-Where's Shancai?

124
00:08:46,446 --> 00:08:47,966
She has the night shift today.

125
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:49,606
She's probably at Frankie's Restaurant.

126
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,126
Frankie's Restaurant?

127
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:01,246
Thank you.

128
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:07,966
You've been distracted all day.
What's wrong?

129
00:09:09,846 --> 00:09:10,686
I...

130
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,766
Shancai, there's a boy here for you.

131
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:16,366
-For me?
-Yeah, he ordered a lot and won't eat.

132
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:17,566
He said the food isn't fresh.

133
00:09:17,646 --> 00:09:19,366
He demands to see someone in the kitchen.

134
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,166
He's just here to cause trouble.

135
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:32,926
I'm here for Dong Shancai.

136
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:33,886
Have her come out.

137
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:36,286
Sir, excuse me.

138
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:39,206
Dong Shancai works in the kitchen,
she can't come out here.

139
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,646
If she doesn't come out, I won't leave.

140
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,606
What are you doing here?

141
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,926
Sir, you said that our food isn't fresh.

142
00:09:56,686 --> 00:09:57,526
Which dish was it?

143
00:09:57,686 --> 00:09:59,246
That's not the point.

144
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:00,406
I'm here for her.

145
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:06,366
Restaurants are for eating.

146
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:07,926
If you're here to see her,

147
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,126
please wait until she's off work.

148
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:12,966
You're getting in the way of our work.

149
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,486
By the way,

150
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:17,246
our restaurant has always
been known for our fresh food.

151
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,326
-Please don't hurt our--
-That's enough.

152
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:21,726
I didn't come here to listen to you.

153
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:23,246
I'm here for Shancai.

154
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:29,966
Aren't you going to London?

155
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:36,846
What happened to your arm?

156
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:40,806
It's just a small burn.

157
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:42,086
It's none of your business.

158
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:45,606
Can't you learn how
to take care of yourself?

159
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:48,126
You're taking on too much work.

160
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:49,166
Why didn't you tell me?

161
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:51,486
Why should I tell you?

162
00:10:51,726 --> 00:10:53,046
Is it any of your business?

163
00:10:57,206 --> 00:10:58,046
Let's go.

164
00:10:58,126 --> 00:10:58,966
Hey!

165
00:10:59,046 --> 00:11:00,526
You can't just do whatever you want.

166
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:02,006
You're so immature.

167
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,126
Sir, please have some respect.

168
00:11:04,606 --> 00:11:05,606
She's my employee.

169
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:07,726
Giving her problems
is causing us problems.

170
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:09,086
Who the hell are you?

171
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:10,566
You have no right to talk to me.

172
00:11:11,206 --> 00:11:12,326
Daoming Si.

173
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:15,006
I work here.

174
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:17,846
Please respect my job and my colleagues.

175
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:19,366
What do you mean?

176
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:21,326
I mean...

177
00:11:22,446 --> 00:11:23,686
Please leave.

178
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,286
I was going to say goodbye before I left.

179
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:37,686
Looks like there's no need.

180
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:47,206
Daoming Si.

181
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:55,726
Dong Shancai.

182
00:11:58,486 --> 00:11:59,966
I'm never coming back.

183
00:12:04,846 --> 00:12:05,806
Goodbye.

184
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:32,566
Are you okay?

185
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:35,326
I'm fine.

186
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:38,126
I'm sorry for causing so much trouble.

187
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,086
I thought he was just a picky customer.

188
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:43,486
That Daoming Si...

189
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,286
Is he your boyfriend?

190
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:48,606
No.

191
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:51,806
He's none of my concern.

192
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:56,126
<i>I didn't say goodbye properly
to Daoming Si.</i>

193
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:59,886
<i>Maybe in the future, I'll regret it.</i>

194
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:04,606
<i>But perhaps it's better for us this way.</i>

195
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:07,566
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

196
00:13:07,646 --> 00:13:10,126
Didn't you break up with Daoming Si?

197
00:13:10,446 --> 00:13:11,766
Why are you still mad?

198
00:13:14,286 --> 00:13:15,726
I don't know.

199
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:18,966
I don't have the right to be mad at him.

200
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:22,046
But when I heard he was going to London,

201
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:23,246
it was just too sudden.

202
00:13:23,606 --> 00:13:25,886
I can't accept that
he's leaving so quickly.

203
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:28,846
You care about Daoming Si.

204
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:30,286
That's impossible!

205
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:32,606
His actions are unbearable.

206
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:35,046
I know.

207
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,766
He went to see you

208
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:40,446
because he wanted to get back together.

209
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:41,886
But, you guys argued again.

210
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:49,326
Shancai, you're home.

211
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:51,726
You're home, sweetheart.

212
00:13:53,926 --> 00:13:55,166
Why do you look so sad?

213
00:13:55,246 --> 00:13:57,646
What are you up to lately?
You've been coming home late.

214
00:13:59,886 --> 00:14:01,606
I found a new part-time job.

215
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:03,726
Part-time job?

216
00:14:03,806 --> 00:14:04,766
What is it?

217
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:05,926
Is it hard work?

218
00:14:06,006 --> 00:14:07,966
-Will it affect your studies?
-No.

219
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:10,446
It won't affect my studies.
It will help me learn some skills.

220
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:12,686
Really?

221
00:14:14,326 --> 00:14:16,326
Yes, I'm helping in a restaurant kitchen.

222
00:14:16,406 --> 00:14:17,566
I've arranged my schedule.

223
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:19,406
Don't worry.

224
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:20,926
Working in a kitchen?

225
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,606
There's fire in the kitchen.

226
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:23,966
Should we be worried about you?

227
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:26,046
Our daughter has perfect skin,

228
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,086
what if she gets burnt?

229
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:30,806
Don't worry.

230
00:14:33,526 --> 00:14:36,286
Mom, don't I cook with you all the time?

231
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:40,686
Fine.

232
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:44,246
I guess with better cooking skills,
you'll be able to cook for us.

233
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:46,766
Sounds good.

234
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:50,646
Shancai will be able to take
our restaurant to the next level, right?

235
00:14:51,926 --> 00:14:53,646
Take these clothes inside.

236
00:14:55,046 --> 00:14:57,406
She's working now,
don't make her do chores.

237
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,006
She still has to do her chores.

238
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:00,926
You shouldn't spoil her.

239
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,806
A, C, W,

240
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:29,686
X,

241
00:15:30,206 --> 00:15:31,166
D,

242
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:32,166
D,

243
00:15:33,206 --> 00:15:34,766
B, D...

244
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:35,926
You got three out of ten.

245
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:38,326
What?

246
00:15:41,086 --> 00:15:42,086
If that's true,

247
00:15:42,246 --> 00:15:44,006
how am I supposed
to get your super memory?

248
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,246
You wanted me to train you.

249
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:47,606
Have you lost hope now?

250
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:50,326
Why do you want a super memory?

251
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:53,486
I'm a part of F4.

252
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:55,526
I have to work hard to improve myself.

253
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,286
I can't ruin our reputation.

254
00:15:58,526 --> 00:15:59,726
Didn't you quit?

255
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:02,166
Now you've joined F4 again?

256
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:04,286
I...

257
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:06,926
Hey.

258
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:09,966
Daoming Si, tell them, am I a part of F4?

259
00:16:12,326 --> 00:16:14,166
Si, what's wrong?

260
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,166
You look mad.

261
00:16:17,286 --> 00:16:19,686
I guess it's because someone isn't here.

262
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:21,006
We should have invited Shancai.

263
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:22,566
She can't come.

264
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:24,286
She's working right now. It's tough work.

265
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:26,006
I really admire Shancai's energy.

266
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:29,486
I would work with her,
but I have too many classes this semester.

267
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:32,046
Why would you bother Shancai
when she's working?

268
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:33,206
None of your business.

269
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:35,126
None of my business?

270
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:37,086
Everything about Shancai is my business.

271
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,886
Why is it your business then?
Aren't you going to London?

272
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:43,726
Qinghe, you have the F4 spirit.

273
00:16:46,726 --> 00:16:48,526
Since Si is going to London,

274
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,766
I guess you can join F4 now.

275
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:54,126
-I have already joined.
-Shut up!

276
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:02,566
Hey, Xinhui,

277
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,686
did you know that Daoming Si
is leaving tomorrow?

278
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:09,086
Isn't his flight today?

279
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,406
I wonder if the plane has taken off?

280
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:14,046
Shancai.

281
00:17:20,926 --> 00:17:21,966
You're not sending him off?

282
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:24,326
Of course not.

283
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:27,966
I thought you like him.

284
00:17:28,326 --> 00:17:29,886
Who likes him?

285
00:17:31,126 --> 00:17:34,086
You keep saying that you like Huaze Lei,

286
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:36,966
but the truth is, you like Daoming Si.

287
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:38,526
Why can't you admit it?

288
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,766
That's nonsense.

289
00:17:41,446 --> 00:17:44,126
Who knows when he'll be back?

290
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:46,086
Are you really giving up on him?

291
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:52,086
Did you know?

292
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:53,686
When we were fighting,

293
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:56,086
Si got drunk one time.

294
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:57,766
I took him to my place.

295
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:01,326
I thought he would like me.

296
00:18:02,726 --> 00:18:04,646
But he told me,

297
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:06,406
I was different from you.

298
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:10,046
He said that Shancai
wouldn't betray her own heart.

299
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:14,126
So do you want him to leave?

300
00:18:27,846 --> 00:18:28,886
Si.

301
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:30,966
Don't miss us too much in London.

302
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,566
I emailed you our pictures.

303
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,206
You can look at them when you miss me.

304
00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:39,126
Who wants to see your face?
I'm not a woman.

305
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:42,206
You guys are like little girls.

306
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:43,726
He won't be gone forever.

307
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:46,726
Zhuang, we don't care about Si,

308
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,406
-but we'll miss you.
-Hey.

309
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:51,566
With you gone,
nobody will yell at us or kick us.

310
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:53,246
-We'll feel so lonely.
-Really?

311
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:55,926
I'll miss you too.

312
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,806
Give me a hug.

313
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,846
Okay.

314
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:00,366
I want one too.

315
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:03,126
You're such a good boy.

316
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:07,366
So? You don't want a hug?

317
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,606
Silly kid.

318
00:19:12,406 --> 00:19:14,766
Have you said goodbye to Shancai?

319
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,206
Whatever.

320
00:19:19,566 --> 00:19:21,246
Why should I say goodbye
to that ugly thing?

321
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:28,046
I'm an elegant, beautiful,
graceful and gentle woman.

322
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,526
How can you be so rude to me?

323
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:33,366
You're elegant?

324
00:19:34,726 --> 00:19:35,966
That hurts!

325
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:37,046
Little brat.

326
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:39,486
Have I not hurt you enough?

327
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:41,966
Huaze Lei will take care of Shancai.

328
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:43,486
Isn't that great?

329
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,446
Okay, Si and I need to board now.

330
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:49,886
Goodbye now.

331
00:19:50,686 --> 00:19:51,526
Take care, Zhuang.

332
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:52,446
-Don't miss me.
-Bye.

333
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,606
-Bye.
-Safe flight.

334
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:54,886
Si, wait.

335
00:19:57,286 --> 00:19:58,406
I have something to tell you.

336
00:19:58,726 --> 00:19:59,606
What?

337
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,006
-What are they talking about?
-I don't know.

338
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:29,726
<i>Welcome, passengers.</i>

339
00:20:29,806 --> 00:20:32,846
-<i>Thank you for flying with us.</i>
-Please fasten your seat belt.

340
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:34,806
<i>-We're about to take off.</i>
-Seat belt.

341
00:20:34,886 --> 00:20:36,406
<i>Please fasten your seat belts</i>

342
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:39,166
<i>and switch your phones to airplane mode.</i>

343
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:40,606
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

344
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:42,126
<i>Have a delightful flight.</i>

345
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:46,606
Lei...

346
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:48,526
That son of a bitch.

347
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:51,726
What did you say?

348
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:55,166
Hey! I need to get off.

349
00:20:56,406 --> 00:20:57,366
Stop it.

350
00:20:57,926 --> 00:20:59,646
I'm warning you. Sit down.

351
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:01,366
Don't embarrass me.

352
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:04,806
-I don't care. I need to get off.
-Sit down!

353
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:07,606
-I don't care.
-Sit!

354
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:08,846
-I'm getting off!
-Sit!

355
00:21:23,206 --> 00:21:24,606
Brat.

356
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:03,046
You're an arrogant,
green shoe-wearing, pineapple head.

357
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:05,526
You think you're popular at school

358
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:07,446
so you can do whatever you want.

359
00:22:07,646 --> 00:22:09,526
You're just a jerk.

360
00:22:24,206 --> 00:22:25,366
Give it back.

361
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:30,326
Hey. Give it to me!

362
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:31,326
Hey!

363
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:33,126
Give it to me!

364
00:22:52,686 --> 00:22:53,766
<i>What do you want?</i>

365
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:55,846
<i>Here, it's your coat.</i>

366
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:13,926
Sorry.

367
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:15,526
I'm late.

368
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:20,366
If you say you didn't do it,

369
00:23:20,926 --> 00:23:21,886
I believe you.

370
00:23:26,286 --> 00:23:30,006
<i>Why do I suddenly feel disappointed?</i>

371
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:32,646
<i>I thought you like Daoming Si.</i>

372
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:35,286
<i>No. I don't like him.</i>

373
00:23:35,926 --> 00:23:38,806
<i>I don't like arrogant and pushy people.</i>

374
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:39,846
<i>I just...</i>

375
00:23:42,646 --> 00:23:43,966
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

376
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:12,566
Zhuang and Si are here.

377
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:16,126
Where's Mom?

378
00:24:17,446 --> 00:24:19,406
She's working in New York.

379
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:20,846
Where's Yuanzi?

380
00:24:21,286 --> 00:24:24,006
She went to New York with Mrs. Daoming.

381
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:24,926
Oh.

382
00:24:28,646 --> 00:24:31,126
Zhuang, since Mom's not here.

383
00:24:31,206 --> 00:24:32,606
I have no reason to be in London.

384
00:24:32,726 --> 00:24:34,046
We should go back to Shanghai now.

385
00:24:36,046 --> 00:24:36,886
What?

386
00:24:37,486 --> 00:24:39,166
You said you wanted to study here.

387
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:41,326
Then, you made a scene on the plane.

388
00:24:41,406 --> 00:24:43,406
Now, you want to go back?

389
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:46,086
What the hell is wrong with you?

390
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:47,966
Do you want to get beaten up?

391
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:49,166
Hey.

392
00:24:49,526 --> 00:24:51,366
You were the mean one.

393
00:24:51,686 --> 00:24:54,486
You made me pass out on the plane.
Are you even my real sister?

394
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:57,926
I told you, I was a gift
from the phone company.

395
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:00,806
But for real,

396
00:25:01,526 --> 00:25:03,806
I've enrolled you in a lot of...

397
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:06,406
a lot of international finance classes.

398
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:10,206
You better stay in London.

399
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:12,366
Or what will I tell Mom?

400
00:25:15,286 --> 00:25:16,526
What will you tell Mom?

401
00:25:17,326 --> 00:25:19,166
Did mom send you to control me?

402
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:21,886
Stupid boy.

403
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:23,486
You don't understand anything.

404
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:25,766
If it weren't for me,

405
00:25:25,846 --> 00:25:27,886
Mom would've flown to Shanghai
and kicked your butt.

406
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:30,526
Mom is too busy.

407
00:25:30,606 --> 00:25:31,886
She doesn't have time for me.

408
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:35,686
That's true.

409
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,166
But, remember,

410
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:40,526
Mom wants you to take over Daoming Group.

411
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,486
She can't be here with you,

412
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:45,206
but whatever you say or do

413
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:47,286
is totally under her control.

414
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:49,286
You know that, don't you?

415
00:25:50,126 --> 00:25:51,206
Of course I do.

416
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:53,206
But...

417
00:25:54,006 --> 00:25:55,286
so what if she disagrees?

418
00:25:58,486 --> 00:26:00,126
I won't let her control my life.

419
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,806
He's all grown up now.

420
00:26:50,446 --> 00:26:53,526
<i>Nothing happened between Shancai and I...</i>

421
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:56,686
that night.

422
00:26:58,286 --> 00:27:02,686
I think the person
Shancai really likes is you.

423
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:30,406
LOG IN

424
00:27:36,006 --> 00:27:36,926
FRIENDS

425
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:40,126
FRIEND: I WON'T TELL YOU

426
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:46,326
<i>What's your name?</i>

427
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,406
<i>I won't tell you.</i>

428
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:49,846
<i>Why can't you tell me?</i>

429
00:27:50,006 --> 00:27:51,126
<i>What's your name?</i>

430
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:52,486
<i>I told you.</i>

431
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:53,926
<i>I won't tell you.</i>

432
00:28:21,726 --> 00:28:22,646
<i>Hello?</i>

433
00:28:22,886 --> 00:28:23,806
Hello?

434
00:28:23,966 --> 00:28:25,566
Is this Frankie's Restaurant in Shanghai?

435
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:27,966
I'm looking for Dong Shancai.
She works in your kitchen.

436
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,006
<i>Okay.</i>

437
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,606
<i>-You are?
</i>-I...

438
00:28:31,406 --> 00:28:32,406
I'm her dad.

439
00:28:32,486 --> 00:28:34,126
There's an urgent family matter.

440
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:35,046
Hurry up.

441
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:41,246
Hello, Dad?

442
00:28:43,566 --> 00:28:44,686
Why aren't you talking?

443
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:49,406
<i>Is his phone reception bad?</i>

444
00:28:50,246 --> 00:28:52,006
Dad, if you don't talk, I'm hanging up.

445
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:52,926
Hello?

446
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:54,766
<i>It's me.</i>

447
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:56,646
<i>How's work? Is it tough?</i>

448
00:28:56,806 --> 00:28:59,046
Do you have enough money?
I hope they're not bullying you.

449
00:28:59,886 --> 00:29:01,566
Sorry, you have the wrong number.

450
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:08,966
That dumb woman.

451
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:09,966
She hung up on me!

452
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:13,806
But...

453
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:15,246
It's not her fault.

454
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:17,046
She didn't know it was me.

455
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:29,286
FENG SHUI INN

456
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:47,446
Si!

457
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:50,326
You're back in London!

458
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:51,326
Yes.

459
00:29:51,646 --> 00:29:52,846
I'm here to have some food.

460
00:29:54,446 --> 00:29:57,166
We're not open now. No food for you.

461
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:00,446
Yue, you can cook for me.

462
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:03,006
Pretty please?

463
00:30:03,086 --> 00:30:04,806
-Please, Yue?
-Okay.

464
00:30:05,126 --> 00:30:07,446
-I'll set it up for you.
-Okay.

465
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,206
Si.

466
00:30:12,846 --> 00:30:13,726
Si,

467
00:30:13,806 --> 00:30:16,846
I haven't seen you
since you started college.

468
00:30:16,926 --> 00:30:18,406
It's been four years, right?

469
00:30:18,646 --> 00:30:19,486
Yes.

470
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:21,406
I've been longing for your cooking.

471
00:30:21,606 --> 00:30:22,886
It's my favorite since childhood.

472
00:30:22,966 --> 00:30:23,886
Please enjoy.

473
00:30:24,886 --> 00:30:27,166
These are all your favorite dishes.

474
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:30,446
Kung Pao chicken, braised eggplant,

475
00:30:30,966 --> 00:30:33,326
and sweet and sour pork ribs.

476
00:30:34,806 --> 00:30:36,326
Dandan noodles, too.

477
00:30:36,406 --> 00:30:37,606
I'm starting to drool now.

478
00:30:39,966 --> 00:30:41,766
You've grown up so much.

479
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:45,126
When your mom first brought you to London,

480
00:30:45,686 --> 00:30:46,806
you were only six.

481
00:30:47,126 --> 00:30:51,006
You didn't have money
and you were in front of our restaurant

482
00:30:52,046 --> 00:30:53,606
trembling with hunger.

483
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,326
What a poor sight.

484
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:56,926
But, you were so cute.

485
00:30:58,046 --> 00:30:59,886
Good thing I met you, Yue.

486
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:04,086
After you had my cooking,

487
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,646
you refused to go home.

488
00:31:06,246 --> 00:31:08,246
Your parents were so worried.

489
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:10,406
They looked all over London.

490
00:31:10,486 --> 00:31:12,886
The police almost brought me in.

491
00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:14,526
I couldn't help myself.

492
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:17,526
My parents were always busy
and took me all around the world.

493
00:31:17,606 --> 00:31:18,526
It was so irritating.

494
00:31:19,766 --> 00:31:20,646
By the way,

495
00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:23,286
my mom never cooked for me.

496
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:27,606
I'm glad you like my food.

497
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:29,966
You're always welcome here.

498
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:33,246
Thank you, Yue. You're the best.

499
00:31:34,286 --> 00:31:35,366
Honestly,

500
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:39,406
you're a lot like my son-in-law.

501
00:31:40,046 --> 00:31:42,286
You look mean and immature,

502
00:31:42,846 --> 00:31:45,086
but actually,

503
00:31:46,086 --> 00:31:49,086
you're very nice, kind and adorable.

504
00:31:50,286 --> 00:31:51,286
He must be handsome.

505
00:31:52,006 --> 00:31:53,286
Of course.

506
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,166
Then...

507
00:31:57,846 --> 00:31:59,246
who's more handsome?

508
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:00,806
Me or him?

509
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:03,046
You are

510
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:04,646
pretty much the same.

511
00:32:07,006 --> 00:32:09,526
-I'll prepare dessert.
-Okay.

512
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,006
<i>You don't know how hard
other people have to work.</i>

513
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:31,646
-You're a parasite of society.
-Shut up!

514
00:32:43,726 --> 00:32:44,926
Look familiar?

515
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:48,006
This sweet and sour pork rib
doesn't look good at all.

516
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:51,366
If you don't want it, throw it away.

517
00:32:57,006 --> 00:32:59,686
Why do I always think of her
when I have sweet and sour pork ribs?

518
00:33:17,526 --> 00:33:19,246
TIAN YE IS TAKING OVER THE FAMILY BUSINESS

519
00:33:33,406 --> 00:33:35,646
Shancai, can you taste this for me?

520
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:37,286
Of course.

521
00:33:38,806 --> 00:33:39,806
It's lobster.

522
00:33:40,446 --> 00:33:42,086
It looks amazing.

523
00:33:50,126 --> 00:33:51,006
What do you think?

524
00:33:53,646 --> 00:33:55,286
It's very good.

525
00:33:55,846 --> 00:33:56,686
Hey,

526
00:33:57,086 --> 00:33:58,406
what's this called?

527
00:33:58,966 --> 00:34:01,686
You've been working on it for five hours.
It must be very complicated.

528
00:34:02,046 --> 00:34:02,966
Yes.

529
00:34:03,086 --> 00:34:05,766
It's a famous French dish
called Lobster Thermidor.

530
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:08,246
Only a few chefs know how to make it.

531
00:34:08,406 --> 00:34:10,126
Qian is one of them.

532
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:11,526
Who's Qian?

533
00:34:12,086 --> 00:34:13,486
Qian is the best chef in China.

534
00:34:13,806 --> 00:34:16,406
Every year, he inspects
the restaurants in Shanghai.

535
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:20,006
I've worked here the past year
to receive his approval

536
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,326
and become the head chef.

537
00:34:21,846 --> 00:34:22,966
That's wonderful.

538
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:26,646
The sauce must be hard to make.

539
00:34:26,846 --> 00:34:27,686
Exactly.

540
00:34:31,766 --> 00:34:33,006
This fish soup

541
00:34:33,566 --> 00:34:36,726
has abalone, sea cucumber,
shark tail skin, yak-skin gelatin,

542
00:34:36,846 --> 00:34:39,446
king oyster mushrooms, pork tendon,
and many other ingredients.

543
00:34:39,526 --> 00:34:40,646
It takes three hours to make.

544
00:34:40,726 --> 00:34:43,246
I found this formula
after trying for three months.

545
00:34:43,366 --> 00:34:45,006
Just the sauce takes that long?

546
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:47,566
To be honest,

547
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:49,326
there is a shortcut.

548
00:34:50,726 --> 00:34:53,046
There's a special ingredient
called Kamio leaf.

549
00:34:53,126 --> 00:34:54,126
It can replace the sauce.

550
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,766
Then you can just use that.

551
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,046
Why trouble yourself?

552
00:34:59,086 --> 00:35:00,526
It still tastes different.

553
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:03,166
Chefs like us shouldn't be lazy.

554
00:35:03,646 --> 00:35:05,966
Kamio leaves are incredibly rare, too.

555
00:35:06,886 --> 00:35:08,046
Is that so?

556
00:35:08,846 --> 00:35:11,006
When are you taking the exam?

557
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:13,486
-Tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

558
00:35:15,006 --> 00:35:16,606
I was kind of nervous,

559
00:35:16,846 --> 00:35:18,566
but you said it's good, which helped me.

560
00:35:19,246 --> 00:35:22,206
Tian Ye, you work very hard.

561
00:35:22,566 --> 00:35:24,966
I'm sure you'll be the best chef ever.

562
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:26,846
All the best tomorrow.

563
00:35:51,606 --> 00:35:53,126
No way.

564
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:55,006
-What should he do?
-I don't know.

565
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,126
What should he do?

566
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:00,286
He's doomed.

567
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:05,606
What's wrong?

568
00:36:06,086 --> 00:36:07,046
What happened?

569
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,366
Tian Ye is doomed.

570
00:36:09,846 --> 00:36:12,846
He fell asleep this morning
and the fish soup cooked for too long.

571
00:36:13,126 --> 00:36:15,206
The flavor is all wrong.

572
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:17,686
There's only two hours left
until his exam.

573
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:21,286
He's trying to make the soup again,
but there's not enough time.

574
00:36:22,926 --> 00:36:24,286
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

575
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:36,166
Tian Ye.

576
00:36:36,686 --> 00:36:37,966
I'm so stupid.

577
00:36:39,126 --> 00:36:41,446
I spent the whole year here
just for this day.

578
00:36:43,726 --> 00:36:44,966
Don't freak out.

579
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:46,966
We'll find a way.

580
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:53,086
I need three hours to make the soup.

581
00:36:53,686 --> 00:36:54,886
It's impossible.

582
00:36:57,806 --> 00:36:59,966
Can you postpone it to tomorrow?

583
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:01,886
There's no tomorrow!

584
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:07,166
There's a special ingredient
called Kamio leaf.

585
00:37:08,486 --> 00:37:09,566
It can replace the sauce.

586
00:37:10,486 --> 00:37:13,566
Tian Ye, make the Lobster Thermidor.

587
00:37:13,646 --> 00:37:15,846
I'll go get Kamio leaves for you.

588
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:22,806
This...

589
00:37:25,686 --> 00:37:26,526
Shen Nong Village?

590
00:37:26,606 --> 00:37:27,686
PLACES TO BUY KAMIO LEAVES

591
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:29,286
ONLY AT SHEN NONG VILLAGE

592
00:38:11,126 --> 00:38:13,366
SHEN NONG VILLAGE HERBS

593
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:23,526
Hello, I need Kamio leaves.
How many do you have?

594
00:38:23,686 --> 00:38:25,166
How do you know we have them?

595
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:27,526
I looked it up online.
This is the only place in Shanghai.

596
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,646
You're lucky. We have one left.

597
00:38:32,286 --> 00:38:33,566
-How much is it?
-1,500 yuan.

598
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:35,286
That expensive?

599
00:38:41,606 --> 00:38:43,446
<i>Tian Ye, I got the Kamio leaves.</i>

600
00:38:47,646 --> 00:38:48,566
SHEN NONG VILLAGE HERBS

601
00:39:08,406 --> 00:39:10,846
<i>Dong Shancai, where are you?
There's only 30 minutes left.</i>

602
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:13,966
Wait for me. I'm almost there.

603
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:08,646
The Kamio leaves...

604
00:40:17,366 --> 00:40:18,646
The Kamio leaves...

605
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,126
What should I do?

606
00:40:26,646 --> 00:40:27,606
Young lady,

607
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:30,126
are you okay?

608
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:36,086
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

609
00:40:39,046 --> 00:40:40,046
-Out of the way!
-Hey!

610
00:40:40,126 --> 00:40:41,006
Watch out!

611
00:41:03,846 --> 00:41:05,486
Tian Ye, is there still time?

612
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:07,966
What happened, Dong Shancai?

613
00:41:08,606 --> 00:41:10,886
I'm fine. Go cook.

614
00:41:11,006 --> 00:41:12,006
There's no time left.

615
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,486
Tian Ye, very good job.

616
00:41:36,486 --> 00:41:40,486
You're still young,
but this lobster is marvelous.

617
00:41:40,566 --> 00:41:42,326
You have great potential.

618
00:41:42,406 --> 00:41:43,526
Qian, you're too kind.

619
00:41:44,446 --> 00:41:45,406
But,

620
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:47,326
if this sauce

621
00:41:48,046 --> 00:41:50,006
wasn't made from Kamio leaves,

622
00:41:50,726 --> 00:41:52,846
it would taste even better.

623
00:41:53,806 --> 00:41:56,246
Tian Ye, where did you learn how to cook?

624
00:41:57,286 --> 00:41:59,126
I haven't received professional training.

625
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:01,326
I've loved to cook since middle school.

626
00:42:01,726 --> 00:42:03,846
So, I did part-time jobs in restaurants.

627
00:42:03,926 --> 00:42:05,566
That's how I gained experience.

628
00:42:06,366 --> 00:42:08,726
<i>Tian Ye did a lot of part-time jobs,
just like me.</i>

629
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:09,646
Tian Ye.

630
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:11,046
<i>-I guess his life
</i>-Good job.

631
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:13,526
<i>-is just as difficult as mine.
</i>-Your future is very bright.

632
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,166
Take care.

633
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,526
Congratulations, Tian Ye.

634
00:42:21,726 --> 00:42:24,806
From now on, you're the head chef
of Frankie's Restaurant.

635
00:42:25,886 --> 00:42:28,246
-Head chef!
-Head chef!

636
00:42:30,046 --> 00:42:32,166
If it weren't for your Kamio leaves,

637
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:34,766
I wouldn't be able to pass the exam.

638
00:42:34,966 --> 00:42:36,926
This is all because of you.

639
00:42:38,446 --> 00:42:39,286
Shancai,

640
00:42:40,126 --> 00:42:40,966
thank you.

641
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:42,606
You're welcome.

642
00:42:43,046 --> 00:42:45,766
I'm happy that they saw
how talented you are.

643
00:42:47,486 --> 00:42:51,486
"I'm happy that they saw
how talented you are."

644
00:42:53,246 --> 00:42:54,566
Congratulations, Tian Ye.

645
00:42:54,646 --> 00:42:55,726
Congratulations.

646
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:56,766
Head chef.

647
00:42:56,846 --> 00:42:58,286
-Head chef!
-Head chef!

648
00:42:58,366 --> 00:43:00,086
-Head chef.
-Congratulations.

649
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:03,246
-Head chef!
-Head chef!

650
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:05,406
-Head chef!
-Head chef!

651
00:43:05,486 --> 00:43:07,086
-Head chef!
