METEOR GARDEN

00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,110
EPISODE 8

4
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,670
It's just shocking.

5
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,950
I never thought she was like that.

6
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,750
I thought we were friends.

7
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,750
You know?

8
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,110
Is that what you call friendship?

9
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,390
She betrayed you without any guilt.

10
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,590
Yeah. We almost took the blame.

11
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,790
Who does she think she is?

12
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,550
All right. Settle down now.

13
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,950
This is a reminder.

14
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,750
Turn in your group report

15
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,230
by the end of the month.

16
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,150
Please work together in groups

17
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,070
since you'll be getting the same grade.

18
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,190
Professor.

19
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,470
Can we switch groups?

20
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,390
What? Why?

21
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,550
We don't want to work with a liar

22
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,470
and get the same grade as her.

23
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,030
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

24
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,190
Who wants to work with her?

25
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,030
Is this about the Weibo rumor?

26
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,390
Yes, professor.

27
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,310
Li Zhen fabricated that rumor.

28
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,950
You can ask Shancai.

29
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,070
Shancai,

30
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,510
tell everyone what happened.

31
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,310
Professor,

32
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,070
Li Zhen did spread the false rumor,

33
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,430
which caused me a lot of trouble.

34
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,510
I went out with a few female classmates.

35
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,950
We had fun and got drunk.

36
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,350
Before Li Zhen went home,

37
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,790
she asked a foreigner
to take me to a hotel.

38
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,710
To assure her that I was okay,
that foreigner friend

39
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,030
took a picture of me in the hotel room
and sent it to her.

40
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,950
Li Zhen accidentally
posted the photo online.

41
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,830
Those Internet trolls
left terrible comments on it.

42
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,390
Li Zhen knew that she made a mistake.
She didn't know what to say.

43
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,110
That's what caused the misunderstanding.

44
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,750
Li Zhen, is that true?

45
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,990
It's true.

46
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,310
It had spread all over the school.

47
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,590
Why didn't she say anything?

48
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,990
-Li Zhen.
-Yeah.

49
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,550
-Because I...
-Because she's mad at me.

50
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,230
When I was at Jing's birthday party,

51
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,830
I didn't answer my phone.

52
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,030
She was outside in the rain all night
and couldn't get in.

53
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,230
I was the one who invited her.

54
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,110
I should have waited for her.

55
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,550
The next day, she caught a cold.

56
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,430
She looked pale and ignored me.

57
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,750
I have to go now.

58
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,510
<i>I was stupid and didn't notice.</i>

59
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,790
I even told her how fun the party was.

60
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,030
It was all my fault.

61
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,830
But now I know that

62
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,030
I need to treat the important people
in my life better than others.

63
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,750
Professor,

64
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,150
we won't fight anymore.

65
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,590
Everyone, please don't be mad at Li Zhen.

66
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,870
We'll study hard from now on.

67
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,470
Okay. Please sit down.

68
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,030
Classmates should get along
and be nice to each other.

69
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,190
I hope nothing like this happens again.

70
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,990
Let's start the class.

71
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,950
Shancai would never do that.

72
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,670
Shancai,

73
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,950
why did you stand up for me
even though I did something so mean?

74
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,750
Because I know you.

75
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,470
We don't want to become despicable people.

76
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,230
Do you remember?

77
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,670
When school had just started,

78
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,310
you said to me...

79
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,230
Shancai, it's good that I know you,

80
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,230
I'd be so lonely by myself.

81
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,630
We'll be best friends from now on
for the next four years.

82
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,750
I feel the same way too.

83
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,750
I'm glad that I know you.

84
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,030
Shancai, I'm sorry.

85
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,430
Please forgive me.

86
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,550
It's all right.

87
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,630
It's fine.

88
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,590
Shancai.

89
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,910
Someone's here for you.

90
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,670
See you later. Bye.

91
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,190
Give me your phone.

92
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,270
For what?

93
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,750
Just give it to me.

94
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,390
Here.

95
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,550
-This isn't my phone.
-Idiot.

96
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,950
I'm giving you this phone.

97
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,870
I broke your phone, didn't I?

98
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,710
You're the idiot.

99
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,230
I don't want this phone.

100
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,230
Give me my phone.

101
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,750
Hey!

102
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,790
Give it back.

103
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,710
Give it to me.

104
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,670
What are you looking at?

105
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,790
-Give me my phone.
-Shut up.

106
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,230
If you don't take it,

107
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,070
-I'll smash your mom's phone.
-You--

108
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,030
Try to explain that.

109
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,390
How do you know I have my mom's phone.

110
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,230
I went to your house yesterday
to ask your mom for your number.

111
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,270
She told me.

112
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,070
You asked my mom for my number?

113
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,270
Your mom asked me for my number
and added me on WeChat.

114
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,790
She told me to take good care of you.

115
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,590
I can't believe her.

116
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,670
Anyways,

117
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,470
I need to be able to find you
at all times.

118
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,630
Understand?

119
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,590
What's your problem?

120
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,110
I'm not a dog. Why should I listen to you?

121
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,350
Of course, you're not a dog.

122
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,270
Dogs are much more obedient.

123
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,110
Daoming Si!

124
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,190
The couple's bickering again?

125
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,430
Who's bickering with...

126
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,990
Lei!

127
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,550
Hi, I'm back.

128
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,390
He just arrived this morning.
He called us when he landed.

129
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,310
Si, we should get together tonight.

130
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,630
Sure.

131
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,790
Shancai, long time no see.

132
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,430
Welcome back.

133
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,630
Hey.

134
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,830
Shancai's my girlfriend now.

135
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,430
No, I'm not.

136
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,790
-Stop saying that.
-Really?

137
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,190
What a pity.

138
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,230
A handsome bachelor like me
just got taken.

139
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,910
It is a pity indeed.

140
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,430
It's a pity because we'll never
have peace and quiet again.

141
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,670
Yeah.

142
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,270
They bicker more in a day
than we do in a year.

143
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,550
Cut it out.

144
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,590
Let's go to class.

145
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,990
Hey.

146
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,830
It looks like a fan, it feels like a fan.

147
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,550
It is a fan, so why isn't it working?

148
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,470
Because it isn't plugged in.

149
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,790
You're so smart!

150
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,710
Even an idiot could answer that.

151
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,910
Lame.

152
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,950
-Hey, Shancai.
-What's going on?

153
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,510
What are these appliances...

154
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,910
-How can you afford them?
-Of course, we can't.

155
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,750
They're all from Daoming Si.

156
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,110
Daoming Si is really a nice person.

157
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,990
-Yeah.
-Daoming Si...

158
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,390
Who said he could give us these?

159
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,390
I never agreed.

160
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,510
Shancai, come back.

161
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,830
We have a lot of boxes to open.

162
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,030
<i>Do you like them?</i>

163
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,390
<i>I picked them out myself.</i>

164
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,590
I hate them!

165
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,070
Why are you yelling at me?

166
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,550
Your roof might blow off.

167
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,950
Our house is unlivable anyways.

168
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,350
You gave us so many appliances,
we can't even walk in here.

169
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,350
Are they that big?

170
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,030
I thought they would fit.

171
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,830
Maybe you could sleep on them.

172
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,190
You're ridiculous. I can't talk to you.

173
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,310
If you can't talk, let's meet up.

174
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,270
My driver will pick you up in ten minutes.

175
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,870
What?

176
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,430
"If you can't talk, let's meet up."

177
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,790
What kind of logic is that?

178
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,350
All girls like sweet talk.

179
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,950
Before Si learns how to do that,
he should just shut up.

180
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,030
Yeah.

181
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,070
Where's Lei?

182
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,030
I haven't seen him for a while.

183
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,590
He said he needed some air.
He'll be back soon.

184
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,070
I feel like Lei came back
as a different person this time.

185
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,070
How is he different?

186
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,910
-You don't know?
-Yeah.

187
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,950
Hey, over here.

188
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,870
-Hi.
-Hi.

189
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:20,910
Who is it?

190
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,190
Are you a turtle? What took you so long?

191
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,830
How dare you say that?

192
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,990
Let me get this straight,
why should I show up

193
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,350
-whenever you want me to?
-Because I want to see you.

194
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,950
Who do you think you are?

195
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,510
Hey, Shancai.

196
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,310
This is Kiki.

197
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,470
I finally get to meet the F4.

198
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,270
When can I play Bridge with you?

199
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,310
If you want to play,

200
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,390
Lei can bring you here anytime.

201
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,990
-We're okay whenever.
-Really?

202
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,430
That's great.

203
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,270
Come on.

204
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,110
Why are you spacing out?

205
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,670
Sit down.

206
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,750
This is yours.

207
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,550
What are you doing?

208
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,950
Here.

209
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,390
Wipe your mouth.

210
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,830
What did Lei do in Paris?

211
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,350
He's changed so much.

212
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,990
I think he grew up.

213
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,390
But we don't know
how long he'll be like this.

214
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,470
Something's wrong between him and Jing.

215
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,510
I'm going home.

216
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,190
Now?

217
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,190
You just got here.

218
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,070
I just came to tell you

219
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,390
to get all those appliances
out of my house.

220
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,310
Or I'm throwing them out. Bye.

221
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,550
-I'll walk you out.
-No, I can go by myself.

222
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,430
Hey.

223
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,950
Hey.

224
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,630
<i>Huaze Lei has totally changed.</i>

225
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,590
<i>What happened between him and Jing?</i>

226
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,430
What the hell?

227
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,750
<i>He's sitting there</i>

228
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,710
<i>just like he used to.</i>

229
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,470
<i>It's like nothing has changed.</i>

230
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,790
What are you looking at?

231
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,190
A plane just flew by.

232
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,430
-You and Jing--
-You're dating Si?

233
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,270
I'm not.

234
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,070
I never agreed to it.

235
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,910
It's all his idea.

236
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,270
Good.

237
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,070
Shancai, be my girlfriend.

238
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,230
Am I not better than Si?

239
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,590
Are you...

240
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,230
Are you really Huaze Lei?

241
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,470
I'm just kidding.

242
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,670
Did you believe me?

243
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,190
You're so cute.

244
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,110
Kidding?

245
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,350
I can't steal Si's girlfriend.

246
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,630
He's my brother.

247
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,790
Are you disappointed?

248
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,950
How about

249
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,470
we secretly date behind Si's back?

250
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,150
Doesn't that sound exciting?

251
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,430
Did you believe it again?

252
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,390
Class is starting.

253
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,470
I need to go.

254
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,230
Shancai,

255
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,310
you're even prettier now.

256
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,990
Thanks.

257
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,950
-Hey. What are you doing?
-Come with me.

258
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,230
I'm busy.

259
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,070
I need to work.

260
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,310
-I'm not rich like you.
-Shut up.

261
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,910
-I've already told them you're not going.
-What?

262
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,270
INTERNATIONAL DEPARTURE

263
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,350
Hey. Wait.

264
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,990
Where are you taking me?

265
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,750
-On a trip.
-A trip?

266
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,550
I didn't agree to that.

267
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,470
-I didn't tell my parents--
-They already gave me permission.

268
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,430
I told the tea shop too.

269
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,670
It's the weekend, so you don't have class.

270
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,830
I brought everything you need.
Your clothes and your passport.

271
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,150
Any other questions?

272
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,950
If not, let's go. Everyone's waiting.

273
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,070
Everyone?

274
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,990
Hey.

275
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,470
I'm warning you.

276
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,470
When we get to the island,
don't run off on your own.

277
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,150
-Is it dangerous there?
-Yes.

278
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,470
You're a ticking time-bomb.

279
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,710
-You might hurt someone.
-Daoming Si.

280
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,750
<i>Passengers, we have come across
some turbulence.</i>

281
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,870
<i>For your safety, please stay in your seat
and fasten your seatbelt.</i>

282
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,990
<i>Thank you.</i>

283
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,190
Strike a pose.

284
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,350
Where do you want to go first?

285
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,550
You decide.

286
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,670
-Really?
-Of course.

287
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,110
You scared me.

288
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,430
Who said you could look at another man?

289
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,950
That's none of your business.

290
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,510
-Are you jealous again?
-Of course, I am.

291
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,830
It's so beautiful!

292
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,150
It's like a postcard.

293
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,150
Do you like it?

294
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,870
It's the best room in the hotel.

295
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,270
The sky and sea are so blue.

296
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,110
It's wonderful!

297
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,590
Shancai,

298
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,230
this is our room.

299
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,990
What? I...

300
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,190
We're staying in the same room?

301
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,110
Don't worry.

302
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,350
It's the same room,

303
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,550
but we'll sleep in separate beds.

304
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,790
That's not what I mean.

305
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,150
What do you mean then?

306
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,230
I...

307
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,510
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

308
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,070
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

309
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,870
Here.

310
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,830
Meizuo.

311
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,270
-Yeah?
-Perform for us.

312
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,230
All right, listen up.

313
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,590
3.14159

314
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,910
265358

315
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,030
97932

316
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,670
384626.

317
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,150
Lei.

318
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,110
Lei...

319
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,070
Your friend is so amusing.

320
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,990
What about me?

321
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,910
Am I not amusing?

322
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,390
Don't you play the violin?

323
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,070
When will you play it for me?

324
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,390
Only special people
can hear me play the violin.

325
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,230
How do I become a special person?

326
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,870
You need to like me more.

327
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,870
Do I not like you enough?

328
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,390
That's not fair. I like you a lot.

329
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,070
You're so naughty.

330
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,630
He came back from Paris as a real man.

331
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,590
Looks like now we only need
to wait for Si to grow up.

332
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,870
Shancai,

333
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,350
will you wait for him?

334
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,230
Stop it.

335
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,630
Shut up.

336
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,790
Try it.

337
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,470
-The chicken is really good.
-I agree.

338
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,630
One, two, three, cheese.

339
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,550
I know I'm attractive,

340
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,830
but do you have to keep staring at me?

341
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,670
Who was staring at you?

342
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,310
You're so full of yourself.

343
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,270
Aren't you sleeping
on that bed over there?

344
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,550
Why? Can't I sit here for a while?

345
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,950
Don't worry.

346
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,990
I do like you,

347
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,510
but before you like me back,
I won't do anything to you.

348
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,390
I'd never touch a woman
without her consent.

349
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,510
I think...

350
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,190
Your legs are sticking out.

351
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,030
Do you want to sleep over there?

352
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,510
It's fine.

353
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,070
How about you just say you like me?

354
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,910
I don't know how much longer I can wait.

355
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,550
Or do you want to sleep
on this tiny bed with me?

356
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,030
No!

357
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,270
Lei,

358
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,430
what's up with you?

359
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,230
Ever since you came back from Paris,

360
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,470
you've totally changed.

361
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,470
Are you worried about me?

362
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,950
It's normal to be worried
about friends, isn't it?

363
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,070
It's because of Jing, isn't it?

364
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,350
What are you doing?

365
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,950
Ten minutes.

366
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,510
No, five minutes is enough.

367
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,750
I'm fine during the day,

368
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,590
but I can't deal with it at night.

369
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,670
Can you give me a hug?

370
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,150
Why don't you ask that girl to hug you?

371
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,270
I don't want to be touched
by a woman I don't know.

372
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,630
<i>This is the first time
I've seen Huaze Lei so vulnerable.</i>

373
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,990
<i>And I realized that</i>

374
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,590
<i>I never gave up on him.</i>

375
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,550
Shancai...

376
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,710
I found out that Jing

377
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,830
doesn't need me.

378
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,350
Jing and I lived together
in Paris for a while.

379
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,510
<i>I still remember</i>

380
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,190
<i>the look on her face</i>

381
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,870
<i>when she saw me that day.</i>

382
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,470
<i>We stayed at home when we were free.</i>

383
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,470
<i>We never got tired of it.</i>

384
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,430
<i>It was our own little world.</i>

385
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,070
<i>It was the best time of my life.</i>

386
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,430
<i>But</i>

387
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,390
<i>it didn't last very long.</i>

388
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,670
<i>She went to school during the day
and interned at a law firm at night.</i>

389
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,470
<i>I was alone all day without her.</i>

390
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,950
<i>She smiled less and less.</i>

391
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,830
<i>She became more tired.</i>

392
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,310
<i>She built a wall around her.</i>

393
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,950
<i>Even if I had turned into air,</i>

394
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,070
<i>I couldn't find a way in.</i>

395
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,110
You know how
I was slightly autistic before.

396
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,630
Jing led me out of the shadows of autism.

397
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,910
<i>But I never changed.</i>

398
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,430
<i>I was still the child
who hid in the corner.</i>

399
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,190
<i>I couldn't do anything
for the girl I loved.</i>

400
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,110
I'm sorry.

401
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,950
I don't know why I'm telling you all this.

402
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,550
Thank you for listening to me.

403
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,230
Did you find her?

404
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,630
No.

405
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,990
Where did she go at this hour?
She's not picking up her phone.

406
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,910
How about we split up and look for her?

407
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,470
Sure. Okay.

408
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,710
Where did you go?

409
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,750
Why weren't you picking up?

410
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,030
I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a walk on the beach.

411
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,550
I forgot to bring my phone.

412
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,950
Idiot. Couldn't you leave a note?

413
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,670
All right. Don't worry.

414
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,910
It's fine now.

415
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,430
If you do that again, I...

416
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,350
-You'll what?
-Shancai, do you know what Si did?

417
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,310
He came to my room and yelled,

418
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,470
"Shancai drowned in the sea!"

419
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,150
I had to come out and look for you.

420
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,150
That's enough.

421
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,230
Go to bed.

422
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,950
Fine.

423
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,830
We all know whom Si loves more.

424
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,430
-We'll give you some privacy.
-Let's go.

425
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,070
What are you still doing here? Go to bed.

426
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,510
Did you know that Huaze Lei
didn't come back to the room last night?

427
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,590
I asked him and he said
he was at the beach all night.

428
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,750
You would think that he had a mistress.

429
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,790
He's probably just shy.

430
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:34,950
Really?

431
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,950
<i>Where did you go?</i>

432
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,830
<i>I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a walk on the beach.</i>

433
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,230
Huaze Lei doesn't seem happy lately.

434
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,550
-Why?
-I...

435
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,550
Lei.

436
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,350
Did you see Shancai
at the beach last night?

437
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,790
Yeah.

438
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,150
I was there thinking,
and she came out for a walk.

439
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,790
She saw me and we chatted for a bit.

440
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,710
Oh.

441
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,430
TENG TANGJING, EXCHANGE STUDENT IN FRANCE
EXPECTED TO WED THIS YEAR

442
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,870
"Teng Tangjing, an exchange student,

443
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,350
fell in love with the son
of the mayor of Paris.

444
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,190
They are expected to get married...

445
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,470
by year-end."

446
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,070
Did you know about that?

447
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,310
Yes.

448
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,670
It's big news in Paris.

449
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,830
Is that why you came back?

450
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,390
Lei, do you not care?

451
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,950
Jing's about to marry someone else.

452
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,430
Why should I care?

453
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,430
Everything's over now.

454
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,030
<i>That's why he's changed so much.</i>

455
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,630
<i>He must be shocked by Jing's engagement.</i>

456
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,790
Are you all right?

457
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,510
Yes.

458
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,590
Really?

459
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:48,750
You don't look okay at all.

460
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,390
I want to know too.

461
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,190
Will I get better?

462
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,270
You will.

463
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,550
You'll get better.

464
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,110
Because

465
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,990
you're a wonderful

466
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,350
and very talented person.

467
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,390
How could you not get better?

468
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,830
Why are you crying?

469
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,750
I told you I'm okay.

470
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,910
Go back to your room.
Don't worry about me.

471
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,270
I don't know...

472
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:58,230
I just can't stop thinking about you.

473
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,230
I'm always wondering

474
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,870
why you're so unhappy

475
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,270
and what will happen between you and Jing.

476
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,150
I'm also wondering...

477
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,630
why you can't be happier.

478
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,070
Why aren't you the one I love?

479
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,750
Si.

480
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,230
Daoming Si!

481
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,630
Wait.

482
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,190
Listen to me.

483
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,750
Everything's clear now.

484
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,590
What is there to say?

485
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,790
No, it's not what it seems like.

486
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,510
Don't touch me!

487
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,190
Dong Shancai, ever since the beginning,

488
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,470
I've liked you and only you.

489
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,470
But what about you?

490
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,350
I'm sorry.

491
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,470
Let's pretend we don't know each other.

492
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,510
Si.

493
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,910
You have no right to talk to me.

494
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,750
I can't believe Si just left without us.

495
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,790
Wasn't everything fine yesterday?

496
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,310
Something must've happened.

497
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,710
Lei, did you see Si?

498
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,070
No.

499
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,230
We'll ask him when we get back.

500
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,150
Let's go.

501
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,030
Come on.

502
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,550
It's not ready yet.

503
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,990
-Shancai, welcome home.
-Welcome home.

504
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,910
Are you tired from your trip?

505
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,870
You look exhausted.

506
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,830
Of course, she is.

507
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,670
The pictures she sent were beautiful.

508
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,790
She must have had a lot of fun
and stayed up late, right?

509
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:07,830
Right?

510
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,430
It was very beautiful.

511
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,630
Shancai, tell me.

512
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,190
What happened between you and Daoming Si?

513
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:18,230
Did you guys create
some beautiful memories there?

514
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,430
This is your daughter
you're talking about.

515
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:24,350
Girls need to protect themselves.

516
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,470
Right?

517
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,190
What were you thinking?

518
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,310
I meant candle-lit dinners,
holding hands, and embraces.

519
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:34,430
Daoming Si is such a handsome young man.

520
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,030
-It must've been so dreamy. Wasn't it?
-That's exaggerating.

521
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,710
Our daughter is the best.

522
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:45,950
Even that Daoming Si guy doesn't
deserve her, you know?

523
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,590
Dad, Mom,

524
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,470
stop talking about Daoming Si.

525
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,910
It's over.

526
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,190
What do you mean, over?

527
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,190
Isn't he trying to win you over? Shancai?

528
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,470
That's enough.

529
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,270
Stop pestering her.

530
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,390
She's clearly not happy.

531
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:09,110
But didn't Daoming Si come
to our house just a few days ago?

532
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,870
How is it over already?

533
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,670
I have to know the reason.

534
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:16,470
What if our daughter
got dumped or abandoned?

535
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,350
What can you do?

536
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,710
Then I hope that
he grows shorter every day.

537
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:22,670
Which part?

538
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,990
His hair.

539
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,070
If he's bald,
he won't get a new girlfriend.

540
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,510
Good thing I have a lot of hair.

541
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,430
Idiot.

542
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,470
AUDIO MESSAGE FROM DAOMING SI

543
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,950
<i>I need to be able to find you
at all times.</i>

544
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,110
AUDIO MESSAGE FROM DAOMING SI

545
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,750
<i>Do you like them?
I picked them out myself.</i>

546
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,590
AUDIO MESSAGE FROM DAOMING SI

547
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,430
<i>Why are you yelling at me?</i>

AUDIO MESSAGE FROM DAOMING SI

550
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,910
<i>Are they that big?</i>

551
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,470
<i>I thought they would fit.</i>

552
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,190

00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,870
<i>he hates me now.</i>

560
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,950

561
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,350

Hello?

564
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,030
Yes.

565
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:26,630
I need to tell you something about Si.
