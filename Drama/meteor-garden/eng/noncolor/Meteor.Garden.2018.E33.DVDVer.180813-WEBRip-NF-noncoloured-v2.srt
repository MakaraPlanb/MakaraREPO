EPISODE 33

3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:07,199
Give up on Shancai, understand?

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,199
-Oh, all right.
-What do you mean, "Oh, all right"?

5
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,119
What exactly...

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,319
-What did you say again?
-I said all right.

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,719
I'll give up on Shancai.

8
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:21,719
Why?

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,199
-So I can pursue Shancai?
-No.

10
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,079
Do you want to die?

11
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:37,599
You jerk.

12
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:41,399
I was already feeling down
but you provoked me.

13
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:43,919
You planned all this to make me
admit my feelings.

14
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,159
You think I don't know that?

15
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,039
I wasn't trying to fool you.

16
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,999
You even dare say that.
That's what infuriates me the most.

17
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:54,639
But that's the most interesting part.

18
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,079
Think about it.

19
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:59,599
You knew I did it on purpose
but you still got mad.

20
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,279
-That proves...
-Shut up.

21
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,079
...that your temper is really bad.

22
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:05,559
Isn't that obvious?

23
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,719
You're so annoying.

24
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,159
You're still laughing?

25
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,439
But Si.

26
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,119
When have you started not doing
what you're thinking?

27
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:28,279
Even though we grew up together
and knew each other well,

28
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:29,999
this time,

29
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:32,399
I was really worried that you were scared.

30
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,079
You don't need to worry about me.

31
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:39,399
Shancai's the one you should worry about.

32
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,079
It's impossible for you not to know
what I'm thinking.

33
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,839
So what?

34
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:47,159
You're not saying it
so Shancai won't know either.

35
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,279
I won't pass along the message anymore.

36
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,999
Change your favorite slogan.

37
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,319
You're no longer the Lei who's not
interested in other people's business.

38
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,599
Shancai is not a stranger.

39
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,959
And neither are you.

40
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,999
You're both important to me.

41
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,999
I appreciate your gesture.

42
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,559
But I have to remind you again.

43
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,639
This is all just part of your plan.

44
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:28,359
I know, you green-eyed monster.

45
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,519
Do you have a problem with that?

46
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:34,319
What you're worried about won't happen.

47
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,519
I'll leave Shancai to you.

48
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,079
Take good care of her.

49
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,519
Of course.

50
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,319
But I'm telling you.

51
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,919
You're still my friend.

52
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,359
But don't play me anymore.

53
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,799
The weather's so nice today.

54
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,159
It's time for me to go.

55
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:39,319
Lei, your parting gift is too much.

56
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,359
Yes. You fooled me so badly.

57
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,519
I never knew that pursuing Shancai
would have such an impact on you.

58
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,399
Why would it?

59
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,479
But it's strange.

60
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,999
You and Si had such a big fight.

61
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,119
I thought we couldn't be friends anymore.

62
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,399
In the end, Ximen and I
were the ones who were fooled.

63
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:03,439
It's over now.
Why are you still talking about it?

64
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,719
I think it was quite fun.

65
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,599
You're such a weirdo.

66
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:15,239
Is your family situation really bad?

67
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:18,479
It's all right.

68
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,959
I should go see my family anyway.

69
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,119
-When are you leaving?
-My flight is in the afternoon.

70
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,679
Be in touch.

71
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,479
I'm already starting to miss you.

72
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:32,679
If all goes well, I'll be back soon.
You don't have to come to the airport.

73
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:37,759
Does Shancai know?

74
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,639
<i>Shancai, there are some things
that I couldn't tell you in person.</i>

75
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,399
<i>So I sent you this voice message.</i>

76
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:59,399
<i>You already know right?</i>

77
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:03,079
<i>I only wanted to make Si
face his own feelings.</i>

78
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:04,799
<i>That's why I decided to pursue you again.</i>

79
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,439
<i>Because I can't think of any other way
to help you and Si.</i>

80
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,239
<i>Sorry if it caused you any trouble.</i>

81
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:19,479
<i>Even though it was just part of my plan,
but my concern for you is real.</i>

82
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,639
<i>You know that, right?</i>

83
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,639
<i>I'm going back to Taiwan today.</i>

84
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,639
<i>I won't be back here anytime soon.</i>

85
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,799
Huaze Lei!

86
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,439
Goodbye!

87
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:57,159
<i>When you feel like crying, do a handstand.</i>

88
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,559
<i>That way, your tears won't fall down.</i>

89
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,399
<i>I'm really grateful...</i>

90
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,559
<i>to you.</i>

91
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:25,639
<i>You really are a nice guy.</i>

92
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:29,039
<i>I did those things because I wanted to.</i>

93
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:42,079
<i>Do you regret it?</i>

94
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:46,879
<i>I do.</i>

95
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,999
<i>I regret giving up on her so easily.</i>

96
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:54,079
<i>I regret not holding on
a little longer that time.</i>

97
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:00,079
<i>Shancai, do you get it?</i>

98
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:01,719
<i>Hold on a little longer.</i>

99
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,399
<i>If you do, a lot of things
might end up differently.</i>

100
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,279
<i>But if you miss that opportunity,</i>

101
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:12,359
<i>you'll regret it your whole life.</i>

102
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:42,679
QQ VOICE MESSAGE FROM HUAZE LEI

103
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,359
<i>Shancai.</i>

104
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:52,839
<i>Knowing you was the most interesting thing
that has ever happened to me so far.</i>

105
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,199
<i>All this time,</i>

106
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:58,559
<i>everything we've experienced
was so beautiful.</i>

107
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,399
<i>I won't ever forget it.</i>

108
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,599
<i>See you again.</i>

109
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,319
<i>Shancai, goodbye.</i>

110
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,239
<i>Lei.</i>

111
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,079
<i>Thank you for everything you did for me.</i>

112
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:16,359
<i>Thank you.</i>

113
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:48,839
It's so hard to face my own feelings.

114
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,639
<i>I see.</i>

115
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,119
Then I'll go ahead.

116
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:20,279
I told him I'm not leaving anymore.

117
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,759
He knows what I meant, right?

118
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,119
Then why did you get off the bus?

119
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:32,239
Did I misunderstand that?

120
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,159
Why did you get off the bus?

121
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,199
No.

122
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,399
He doesn't get it.

123
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,519
He's not the type who'd care
about people's feelings.

124
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:59,679
I really need to clearly tell him.

125
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,279
Women are so annoying.

126
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,799
What are you babbling about?

127
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:32,479
So how are things?

128
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:35,199
Did you get to see Shancai yesterday?

129
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,999
Yesterday...

130
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,359
Yesterday...

131
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:56,799
What is he trying to say?

132
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:00,839
I think he's saying,
"Something good happened.

133
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,719
He's unhappy."

134
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,119
And,

135
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:06,519
"He doesn't understand."

136
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,639
It seems Si has acquired
more depth of expression

137
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,359
after going to graduate school.

138
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:15,999
What do you care?

139
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:20,119
And are you and Shancai

140
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,519
together or not?

141
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:25,359
Why do you care?

142
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:27,559
Hey, Si.

143
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:31,239
Didn't you ask me to come here
to think of a plan?

144
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,239
Haven't you settled it with Shancai yet?

145
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,279
There are some things
that you don't understand.

146
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:45,799
Then ask me.

147
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,399
Leave your girl problems
to the love expert.

148
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,799
Mr. Love Expert,

149
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:53,879
let's hear what you have to say.

150
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,959
Women.

151
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:00,959
If you think of them
as a musical instrument,

152
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,839
she's a violin.

153
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,759
You have to accurately control
your strength, position, and tone

154
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,079
in order to play the best music.

155
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,999
So what do you think?

156
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:17,839
Master Ximen.

157
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:20,839
Even I didn't quite understand it,
let alone Si.

158
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,799
Right?

159
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,399
Where's Si?

160
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,519
What are you doing?

161
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,079
Why are you here?

162
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:45,399
Well...

163
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,359
I have something to tell you.

164
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,079
What is it?

165
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,839
It's not convenient here.
Let's go to the rooftop.

166
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,639
<i>I can easily do other things.</i>

167
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,999
<i>But why is love so hard?</i>

168
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,839
What do you want to say to me?

169
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:19,959
Tell me.

170
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:22,119
I'm starving.

171
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:26,359
<i>I should tell him openly.
I have to tell him how I really feel.</i>

172
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,799
<i>I want to officially
be together with Daoming Si.</i>

173
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,279
Well...

174
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,199
It's...

175
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,679
I...

176
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:52,759
<i>Goodness. I must tell him
that I really like him.</i>

177
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,679
<i>Or else we can't officially be together.</i>

178
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,399
What is it? Say what you want to say.

179
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:02,039
You're so fierce.

180
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,359
Never mind.

181
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,039
What do you mean? Are you playing with me?

182
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,199
I'm not.

183
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:10,159
Your voice is too loud.

184
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:11,399
Your attitude is so bad.

185
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,119
So I couldn't tell you any more.

186
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:19,679
I really don't get you.

187
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,519
I thought you're with me
but then you'll suddenly run away.

188
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,079
I really don't get what you're thinking.

189
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,319
I'm not thinking of anything.

190
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:30,679
My thoughts are simple.

191
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:34,479
But I never thought
that your thoughts are even simpler.

192
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,079
They are more straightforward.

193
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:37,799
What are you trying to say?

194
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:40,039
I'm warning you.

195
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,759
I don't want to hear harsh words.

196
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,119
Do you want to try this bento box?

197
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,599
You made it for me?

198
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,079
It's not some Michelin dish.

199
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,919
I'm not sure if it will suit your taste.

200
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,119
I'll try it.

201
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,359
What's this jellyfish-like thing?

202
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,399
Enoki mushroom bacon wrap.

203
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,159
I see.

204
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:43,759
Never mind. Don't force yourself.

205
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:47,639
I know you're used to food
made by high-class chefs.

206
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,719
You're not used to these common dishes.

207
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,719
Hey.

208
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,519
I thought you'd start dating Xiaozi.

209
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,399
Xiaozi?

210
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:18,879
Yes.

211
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,999
Last time,

212
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:24,999
I saw you two having a good time
at the coffee shop.

213
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,679
Are you crazy?

214
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,839
I told you I won't date a girl
that I don't like.

215
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:36,639
Then will you date me?

216
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,399
Are you all right?

217
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,079
Are you all right?

218
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,799
How can you say such things so easily?

219
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,079
I didn't just say it easily.

220
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:57,879
I'm serious.

221
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,279
And...

222
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,399
I hope you can keep it a secret.

223
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,439
Keep what a secret?

224
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:22,599
About us dating.

225
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,279
Don't tell anyone first.

226
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:26,919
-Because--
-You want us to date secretly?

227
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,399
That's not what I meant.

228
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,519
We won't keep it a secret forever.
Just don't tell anyone for now.

229
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,519
Are you freaking kidding me?

230
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:37,359
You want me to watch movies,
go out, and eat secretly?

231
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:38,799
What are you thinking?

232
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:40,679
I want to be together with you.

233
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:48,839
However,

234
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,719
if your mom finds out,

235
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:54,239
she'll surely take action again.

236
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,399
I don't want to be separated
from you like the last time.

237
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,519
I've had enough.

238
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,839
I've decided not to contact you.

239
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,559
I can't accept it.

240
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,319
You're leaving me
because of such a lousy reason.

241
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:13,879
That's nonsense!

242
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:19,439
I don't want to go through that again.

243
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,479
I've already made up my mind.

244
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,759
For you, even if I have
to leave my family,

245
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:33,399
even if I'm not Daoming Si anymore,

246
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,719
I'd give up everything for you.

247
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,759
You don't need to do anything.

248
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:46,279
What choice do I have?

249
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,519
Let's see when they find out.

250
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,399
You can't tell Ximen and Meizuo too.

251
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,319
We're keeping it from them too?

252
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,319
Is that okay?

253
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,119
Then...

254
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,639
I think Si doesn't have the courage yet.

255
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:10,799
Me too.

256
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,399
I'm not sure what Shancai is thinking.

257
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,079
She thinks too much.

258
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,519
That's right.

259
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:21,559
They're dating
like primary school students.

260
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,919
What is it? Do you have any ideas?

261
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,719
Let's do what Lei couldn't do.

262
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,559
Let's lend Si a helping hand.

263
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,319
Of course.

264
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:43,919
Wait.

265
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,959
Someone will see us.

266
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,399
There's no one here.

267
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,359
There is.

268
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,879
Near the back. Somebody's there.

269
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,679
Are you part of the Terracotta Army?
Where were you unearthed?

270
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,359
You're the Terracotta Army.

271
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,319
Aren't we already dating?

272
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,839
Can't I kiss you?

273
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,919
No.

274
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,399
Why?

275
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,679
If you don't tell me,

276
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:09,319
I'm not letting you go.

277
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,039
Because...

278
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:18,679
Because my heart's beating so fast.
Because I'm too excited.

279
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,319
Because you're all I think about.

280
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:22,039
Because you're here in front of me.

281
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:24,239
I can't breathe. So, no.

282
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,679
Why are you talking like that?

283
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:30,399
That's how I speak. So what?

284
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,839
Hearing you say those things
make me want to...

285
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:37,239
To...

286
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,479
<i>So this is how it feels to be in love.</i>

287
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,359
<i>It's so unbelievable.</i>

288
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,999
<i>My feelings are overflowing
like a dam on the verge of bursting.</i>

289
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:53,599
Xiaoyou.

290
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:57,839
-Move these inside.
-Sure. Right away.

291
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:02,479
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

292
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,079
Ximen?

293
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:26,319
You should ask Shancai to do these things.

294
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,559
She's stronger than you.

295
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,119
Why are you here?

296
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,079
Are you here to buy milk tea or...

297
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,759
I came for you.

298
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:38,239
Me?

299
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,479
Why?

300
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:43,079
But I'm a bit busy now.

301
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:44,719
It's fine.

302
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,199
I can wait for you.

303
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,519
Xiaoyou, are the ten orders
of White Jasmine Dew

304
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,199
and 15 orders of Peach Red Royale done?

305
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,679
The customer will be here soon.

306
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,159
Right away.

307
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:59,039
Aren't you the guy who helped
with our sales the last time?

308
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:02,439
-Sorry for disturbing you.
-How could that be? Thank you.

309
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,839
-Are you here for Xiaoyou?
-Yes.

310
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,479
She still needs to work for another hour.

311
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,079
It's fine. I can wait for her.

312
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:10,719
It's okay.

313
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,999
Xiaoyou, leave earlier today.

314
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,399
I'll take care of this.

315
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:15,919
Can I do that?

316
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:17,959
Don't let him wait. You can go.

317
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:22,199
-Thank you, ma'am.
-You're welcome.

318
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:51,479
<i>Am I mistaken?</i>

319
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:21,199
<i>Who are they? Why are they following me?</i>

320
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,799
Shancai.

321
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,239
Are you all right?

322
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,159
Who were you hiding from?

323
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,279
I've been followed by strange guys.

324
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,479
Come, this way.

325
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:57,999
Come here.

326
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:10,279
Come here.

327
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,439
They're obviously Si's bodyguards.

328
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:29,239
What do you plan to do?
Do you want to tell Si?

329
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,519
I should.

330
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:37,519
However,

331
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:40,439
-I'm worried--
-You're worried that Si

332
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,559
would fight with his mom.

333
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,359
Right?

334
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:45,559
Yes.

335
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,039
Then let's not tell Si for now.

336
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:58,559
Si loses all reason when it comes to you.

337
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,599
Ximen and I are also afraid
he'll be too rash.

338
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:05,439
It might worsen the situation.

339
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:14,079
I'm not sure what to do anymore.

340
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,159
Well,

341
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,279
I think you'd be fine for now.

342
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,039
However,

343
00:25:21,879 --> 00:25:23,239
try not to go home first.

344
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,559
They'll surely be back.

345
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,279
Okay.

346
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:32,399
I'll stay with Xiaoyou for a while.

347
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,719
By the way, why are you in this area?

348
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,799
Xiaoyou's not home.

349
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:45,599
How do you know?

350
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,719
She's at Ximen's house.

351
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:50,439
Who told you that?

352
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:51,879
Is it true?

353
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:57,839
Ximen told me earlier
that Xiaoyou's at his house.

354
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,959
And they're tasting some tea together.

355
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:01,999
Actually...

356
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:06,039
It should be all right.

357
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:08,919
But I think I should tell you.

358
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,679
So that you won't blame me later.

359
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,079
Tasting tea?

360
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:17,919
They can't do that.

361
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:26,639
Hello? Xiaoyou. Where are you now?

362
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:29,319
-<i>Shancai</i>.
-Are you at Ximen's house?

363
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,959
<i>Yes. I just arrived at their gate.</i>

364
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,279
Listen to me. Don't go in--

365
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,399
<i>Xiaoyou, what's the matter?</i>

366
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,919
<i>-Come in first.
-Okay.</i>

367
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:41,759
<i>Shancai, I'll talk to you later.</i>

368
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,479
Hey, I...

369
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,759
Take me to Ximen's house.

370
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:01,959
Success!

371
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,679
Why did you trick Shancai
into going to your house?

372
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,519
It's a surprise.

373
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:20,519
It's not something weird, right?

374
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:23,159
Xiaoyou, trust me.

375
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:29,079
You won't harm Shancai. I trust you.

376
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,439
You seem to be in a good mood.

377
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,319
Yes.

378
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,839
I have to keep moving forward.

379
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,119
All right. I'll tell you the truth.

380
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,559
We're trying to help Shancai
and Si take their relationship

381
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:53,519
one step further.

382
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,439
One step further?

383
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,079
I see.

384
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:02,399
However, if their relationship goes well,

385
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:04,319
it's not good for your family, right?

386
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,039
You should be worried.

387
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,759
No, it's not like that.

388
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,239
Shancai...

389
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,239
She doesn't tell me
what she thinks lately.

390
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:24,719
Maybe she's just shy.

391
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:26,279
No.

392
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,039
She'd tell me everything before.

393
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:31,999
But now,

394
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:34,559
she just handles everything alone.

395
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,279
I can't help her.

396
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,359
And I even need her to protect me.

397
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,919
I'm such a lousy friend.

398
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,359
But I did a lot of thinking lately.

399
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,679
I hope Shancai can be happy.

400
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:55,919
Since she likes Daoming Si
and Daoming Si likes her too,

401
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,799
then I'll raise both hands in support.

402
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:06,359
However, your family might get affected.

403
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:08,359
Doesn't that matter to you?

404
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:13,639
I'm already an adult.
I can help with our family's expenses.

405
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:15,599
And didn't you see it too?

406
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:19,079
Shancai was not at the milk tea shop.
But I could handle it by myself.

407
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,839
I believe our family can work together
and overcome any challenge.

408
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:26,919
Didn't Shancai do the same?

409
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,799
If she can do it, so can I.

410
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:30,759
There's nothing I can't do.

411
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:37,359
You're not the Xiaoyou
who used to cry on the street anymore.

412
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,559
You've grown up and become stronger.

413
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:48,239
The one who made me strong

414
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,399
was you.

415
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,359
After what happened,

416
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,959
I told myself I should change.

417
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,639
You told me I should never
look down on myself.

418
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,999
Is that so? What an honor.

419
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:11,359
You have to find a nice guy
to be your boyfriend in the future.

420
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:12,959
Keep it up.

421
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,359
Ximen.

422
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,399
Why are you here?

423
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,399
I walked past and thought
it was just someone who looked like you.

424
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:29,759
Turns out it's really you.

425
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:35,279
Are you on a date?

426
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:37,159
Am I interrupting?

427
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,559
No.

428
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:41,199
You're not.

429
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:45,359
By the way,
thanks for agreeing about Shancai.

430
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:48,759
Also, we'll do our best
to help your family.

431
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:50,359
You don't have to worry.

432
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:54,399
Does she want to have a drink with us?

433
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,559
No. She's not coming.

434
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:00,119
-Let's go.
-Bye.

435
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:17,079
Where's Xiaoyou?

436
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,879
Wait! Why are you so impatient?

437
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,679
I might be too late!

438
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,679
You're going to break my hand.

439
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:24,399
Tell me where Ximen and Xiaoyou are.

440
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:26,999
Master bedroom. Second door on the left.

441
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,959
Does she think she's Xiaoyou's guardian?

442
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,959
She's so easily tricked.

443
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:38,479
Xiaoyou.

444
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:42,839
Xiaoyou.

445
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,639
Are you inside?

446
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:52,639
Xiaoyou.

447
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:30,759
Hey.

448
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,639
<i>Are they trying to destroy my house?</i>

449
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:36,639
You're at a bar?

450
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,559
<i>Didn't we agree to meet at your house
with Xiaoyou afterward?</i>

451
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,719
Si and Shancai will be
locked in all night.

452
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,919
What's the point of being there?

453
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:51,639
<i>We'll suffer if we wait
by their door all night.</i>

454
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:52,999
Makes sense.

455
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,799
Then I'll join you.

456
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,839
Come over.
You're the only one missing here.

457
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:00,399
Okay. I'll head there now.

458
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:10,999
Daoming Si?

459
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:28,479
What's going on?

460
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:30,719
Ximen and Meizuo kidnapped me.

461
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:31,959
Did you see Xiaoyou?

462
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:33,519
No.

463
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,799
Did I go into the wrong room?

464
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,239
Those guys.

465
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,399
Hey!

466
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:47,599
Open up! Ximen, Meizuo.

467
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:50,439
Where did you take Xiaoyou?

468
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:51,599
Hey!

469
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,279
-Stop screaming.
-Open the door!

470
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,359
You've been tricked.

471
00:33:58,679 --> 00:33:59,519
What do you mean?

472
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,359
I received a call from Xiaoyou.

473
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,919
-She said she's here--
-So you've been tricked.

474
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,479
You mean...

475
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,199
Xiaoyou worked with Ximen
and Meizuo to trick me?

476
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:18,079
They planned this?

477
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:27,039
No. I have to find a way out.

478
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,839
That door's the only way out.

479
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:32,679
-But it's locked.
-So we can't go out.

480
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:33,799
So what do we do?

481
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:37,479
I don't care. I'm with you anyway.

482
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,879
Be serious. Think of something, okay?

483
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:42,839
Even if I can think of something,
I'm not going out.

484
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:48,679
Those guys. They should've just told me.

485
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:50,439
No need to tie me up like that.

486
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:53,759
In that case,

487
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:58,119
sorry, I'll tie you back up.

488
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,119
Are you crazy?

489
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,279
I'm not ready yet.

490
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:13,479
If I give you time to get ready,
you'll surely run away again.

491
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,839
<i>He saw through me.</i>

492
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,999
You might not know yet,

493
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:36,079
but this expression of yours

494
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,999
fascinates me the most.

495
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:31,199
Shancai.

496
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,239
You're so short.

497
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,199
My neck's about to break.

498
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,839
Who told you to be tall like a giraffe?

499
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:44,399
Make yourself taller for me, okay?

500
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,719
I'm so nervous already.

501
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,599
How can I do that?

502
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:52,039
What's there to be nervous about?

503
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:53,919
Your face is so red.

504
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:56,239
It might be contagious.

505
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:10,519
<i>It looks like things might not go smoothly</i>

506
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:13,279
<i>even if we're together already.</i>

507
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:18,639
<i>Especially since our situation
is not ordinary at all.</i>

508
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:36,039
Do you think this room
is like that wooden mansion in Canada?

509
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:44,959
Yes. Canada.

510
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:47,599
At the time,

511
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:52,439
I thought Xiaoyou went out
to see the night view in the snowstorm.

512
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:00,279
So I went out to find her.
Then I got lost.

513
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:02,719
I almost got eaten by wolves.

514
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,839
It was so scary.

515
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:28,159
-Then you...
-Then what did I do?

516
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:34,839
I became your savior.

517
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:36,519
Right?

518
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:45,479
You always got yourself involved
and saved me.

519
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:48,439
What do you mean I got myself involved?

520
00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:54,359
What I'm trying to say is

521
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,519
I've always been grateful.

522
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:04,799
No matter how many times it is,
I'd go and save you.

523
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:13,599
Because I really love you.

524
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:15,479
I can't live without you.

525
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:26,999
Why do you have that expression again?

526
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,239
I might...

527
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:33,919
<i>Happiness like this is like standing</i>

528
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:36,199
<i>on a piece of floating ice in the sea.</i>

529
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:39,919
<i>It might melt anytime.</i>

530
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,599
Ma'am, the investigative report
from Shanghai is here.

531
00:39:58,519 --> 00:39:59,799
Let me see it.
