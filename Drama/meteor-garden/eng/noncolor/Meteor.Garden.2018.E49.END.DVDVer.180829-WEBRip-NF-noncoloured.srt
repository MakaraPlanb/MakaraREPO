00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:30,023
EPISODE 49

3
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,303
I ask of the world, what is love?

4
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:34,663
People live and die for it.

5
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:37,063
I ask of the world, what is love?

6
00:01:37,143 --> 00:01:39,863
People live and die for it.

7
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:53,423
Why isn't the spell working?

8
00:01:56,023 --> 00:01:58,703
Shancai, you're not devoted enough.

9
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:01,743
All right.

10
00:02:02,183 --> 00:02:04,543
If we can only conjure F3,

11
00:02:05,503 --> 00:02:07,623
just pick one of them
to be your husband then.

12
00:02:15,103 --> 00:02:15,943
Shancai.

13
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:19,143
I, Meizuo, am one of F4 members
with the longest legs, smallest face,

14
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,463
best humor, and funniest jokes.

15
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:23,903
I'll never call you stupid or short.

16
00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:25,783
I won't call you an idiot
or make fun of you.

17
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:34,583
Meizuo, even though
you're the nicest to me in F4,

18
00:02:35,063 --> 00:02:36,983
don't you like older women?

19
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:38,743
I'm younger than you.

20
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:07,543
I guess so.

21
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:11,023
Older women are more sophisticated.
They aren't too clingy.

22
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:14,063
I guess I'll keep going after older women.

23
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:26,823
Shancai.

24
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:30,943
I, Ximen, am one of F4 members
who knows the most about women.

25
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:33,063
Whenever girls are with me,

26
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:37,303
I can tell what they're thinking
from their movements and expressions.

27
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:38,823
I know what girls want.

28
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:44,183
You'll be very happy with me.

29
00:03:44,903 --> 00:03:46,583
I'll cherish your every tear.

30
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:48,143
You should choose me.

31
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:57,503
XIMEN, MY BELOVED

32
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:09,223
Hey. Don't you have Xiaoyou already?

33
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:10,583
I'm warning you,

34
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:13,903
if you make Xiaoyou sad in any way,
I'll never forgive you.

35
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:17,543
You're being very annoying.

36
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:20,703
-I'm just kidding.
-You're not allowed to.

37
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,943
I love Xiaoyou.

38
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:26,783
You know that.

39
00:04:31,743 --> 00:04:32,703
Shancai.

40
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:36,063
I don't need to say anything
to make you understand.

41
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:41,423
<i>Huaze Lei, I understand.</i>

42
00:04:41,943 --> 00:04:45,903
<i>You look cold on the surface,
but you're very passionate inside.</i>

43
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:47,663
<i>You're very sincere to your friends.</i>

44
00:04:48,463 --> 00:04:51,743
<i>Whenever I'm frustrated, sad, or angry,</i>

45
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:54,103
<i>you're always by my side,
giving me courage.</i>

46
00:04:55,223 --> 00:04:58,343
<i>To me, you're like an angel.</i>

47
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:02,783
<i>The fact that you're going abroad
to study music makes me sad.</i>

48
00:05:03,143 --> 00:05:04,823
<i>I'm scared that I won't see you again.</i>

49
00:05:13,143 --> 00:05:15,583
So do you still choose Daoming Si?

50
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:26,543
Yes.

51
00:05:27,783 --> 00:05:32,783
We've loved, hated and hurt each other.

52
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,143
After all that,

53
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:39,103
regardless of the outcome
and the challenges,

54
00:05:39,903 --> 00:05:43,143
in every minute of my life,
I love him with all my heart.

55
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:51,623
All right.

56
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:55,543
Then we'll gather together
and summon Daoming Si for you.

57
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:36,623
Shancai.

58
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:40,983
Will you marry me?

59
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:02,943
Hey, Shancai.

60
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,943
You're the prettiest bride in the world.

61
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:09,423
You and Daoming Si
will live happily ever after.

62
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,183
Shancai, you're so pretty today.
We wish you a happy life.

63
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:15,503
I...

64
00:09:15,783 --> 00:09:17,863
This is my 120th time giving up on you.

65
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:20,543
Shancai, I will always
be your best friend.

66
00:09:20,783 --> 00:09:21,943
I wish you happiness.

67
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:23,863
Shancai,

68
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:25,543
<i>À la vôtre.</i>

69
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:29,823
It's so touching. All the best.

70
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,303
If Si takes good care of you,
I promise I won't beat him up.

71
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:39,983
Shancai, if you have babies,
I can be your nanny.

72
00:09:49,543 --> 00:09:50,383
Is...

73
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:54,023
Is this a dream? Or is this real?

74
00:10:03,863 --> 00:10:08,063
Shancai, you really are an idiot.
You're so easy to fool.

75
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:09,943
She's so silly.

76
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,423
Si, you can still call it off now.

77
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:14,063
Shancai.

78
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:17,223
You and Si were made for each other.

79
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:29,823
You guys lied to me?

80
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:49,383
-Daoming Zhuang!
-That's enough!

81
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:56,383
Are you getting married or not?

82
00:10:57,503 --> 00:10:58,423
Yes.

83
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:03,023
Daoming Si.

84
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:05,903
Do you take Shancai
to be your wedded wife?

85
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:07,983
Do you promise to love her,

86
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:11,063
comfort her, honor and keep her
for better or for worse,

87
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:14,463
for richer or for poorer,
in sickness and in health,

88
00:11:14,863 --> 00:11:17,023
and forsaking all others,

89
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,183
to be faithful to her,
so long as you both shall live?

90
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:26,263
I do.

91
00:11:27,783 --> 00:11:28,743
Dong Shancai.

92
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:30,863
Do you take Si to be your wedded husband?

93
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:33,463
Do you promise to love him, protect him,

94
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:36,183
comfort him, and support him

95
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,143
so long as you both shall live?

96
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:39,783
I do.

97
00:11:41,143 --> 00:11:42,383
We are here to celebrate

98
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:44,303
this couple who has gone through

99
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,543
challenges and hardships together.

100
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:50,183
And they still remain true to each other.

101
00:11:58,463 --> 00:11:59,383
I...

102
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:04,023
now officially pronounce you
husband and wife.

103
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:17,503
<i>Someone who's very important to me</i>

104
00:13:18,943 --> 00:13:20,303
<i>is called Dong Shancai.</i>

105
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,943
<i>She's the girl that I like.</i>

106
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:25,583
<i>I hope you can also accept her.</i>

107
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,263
<i>I'll make the decisions for my life.</i>

108
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,303
<i>Why are you talking about your life to me?</i>

109
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:34,423
<i>Nonsense.</i>

110
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:38,623
<i>My life is you.</i>

111
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,303
You're going to graduate school here
so you can graduate with me?

112
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:48,823
I'm so happy!

113
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:51,143
I'm so happy too!

114
00:13:59,223 --> 00:14:00,383
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

115
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:02,943
<i>It has nothing to do with you
being a superwoman or not.</i>

116
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:07,543
<i>I know this doesn't make me cute at all.</i>

117
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:09,623
<i>I'm stubborn and unreasonable.</i>

118
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:14,063
<i>But I hope you can accept the way I am.</i>

119
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:21,383
<i>Didn't I tell you before?</i>

120
00:14:21,463 --> 00:14:24,143
<i>No matter what happens,
I need to know where you are.</i>

121
00:14:26,183 --> 00:14:28,543
From now on,
I will do my best to protect you.

122
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:30,823
You're finally in my arms.
I'll never let go.

123
00:14:34,063 --> 00:14:34,943
Daoming Si.

124
00:14:35,783 --> 00:14:37,303
Let's make our relationship official.

125
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:10,023
<i>This is the happiest
I've been in this lifetime.</i>

126
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:17,823
<i>It would be nice</i>

127
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,903
<i>if we can spend our lives like this.</i>

128
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:24,223
<i>Then let's make a deal.</i>

129
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:26,863
<i>We'll spend each day like this
in our next lifetime.</i>

130
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:28,183
<i>Okay?</i>

131
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:45,903
Daoming Si, do you smell
something burning?

132
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:46,943
I think I do.

133
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,143
Mom, what are you doing?

134
00:17:12,223 --> 00:17:13,263
I'm making breakfast.

135
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:17,823
Why didn't you ask me to do it?

136
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:19,383
-I can do it.
-Why?

137
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:23,103
Do you think I can't even make breakfast?

138
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,183
But I guess,

139
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:39,063
in the past years,

140
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,263
I've been a successful businesswoman.

141
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:44,943
I am lacking some daily life skills.

142
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:49,303
Mother, don't say that.

143
00:17:49,463 --> 00:17:50,943
You're doing very well.

144
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:52,503
Look at you,

145
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,343
you're smart, intelligent, and capable.

146
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:59,303
Even your face and body
can't be compared to anyone.

147
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:01,823
You're doing better than everyone else.

148
00:18:02,463 --> 00:18:09,063
All you did was burn the toast and fish.

149
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:15,063
You don't need to say that.

150
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,023
I actually wanted to tell you something.

151
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:24,103
This was going to be the last breakfast
I made for you before I leave.

152
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:28,143
Wait.

153
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:30,663
Leave? Where are you going?

154
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:36,383
I think I need to learn
how to be independent now.

155
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:39,703
Mom, do you think you're not independent?

156
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:41,183
I'm not independent enough.

157
00:18:41,263 --> 00:18:42,463
In the past years,

158
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,783
I've been too dependent
on my company and my job.

159
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:49,063
Sometimes I think,

160
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:52,903
if I don't have my job,

161
00:18:52,983 --> 00:18:55,103
what will I have left?

162
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,783
That's why I decided

163
00:18:58,183 --> 00:18:59,903
that I want to take a break.

164
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:04,783
I want to get outside

165
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:06,823
and see what the world is like.

166
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:08,863
Are you saying...

167
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,423
Yes.

168
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:14,103
I want to travel alone.

169
00:19:15,223 --> 00:19:17,943
I want to learn how to make breakfast
and take care of myself.

170
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,063
I want to learn how to take the subway.

171
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:22,543
I want to learn how to take selfies.

172
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:26,543
I want to let go of everything.

173
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:30,023
I want to go see some friends
who have nothing to do with my business.

174
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:33,343
I want to chat with them about everything.

175
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:35,743
After I leave,

176
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:37,783
you guys can take over.

177
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,703
I wanted to make breakfast for you.

178
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,303
But I guess this breakfast...

179
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:49,783
is inedible.

180
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:52,943
I'm sorry about that.

181
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:01,863
Mom.

182
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:08,983
Are you still the Daoming Feng I know?

183
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:17,103
An old woman like me can still learn
and grow to be a better person.

184
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:35,623
Mother looks really cool.

185
00:20:41,503 --> 00:20:47,143
<i>I believe that a lot of people
want to be like Mrs. Daoming.</i>

186
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:51,103
<i>Being in her shoes is not easy.</i>

187
00:20:51,943 --> 00:20:55,983
<i>She has sacrificed a lot
to be where she is today.</i>

188
00:21:07,143 --> 00:21:09,583
<i>And I, this ordinary girl,</i>

189
00:21:10,663 --> 00:21:12,303
<i>am now able to start</i>

190
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,223
<i>this life that I've dreamed about.</i>

191
00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:36,743
Hey.

192
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:38,343
Hey.

193
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,743
-Don't move.
-Don't do it.

194
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:43,703
Stop moving.

195
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:50,383
WIFE

196
00:22:50,463 --> 00:22:51,583
What the hell is this?

197
00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:54,583
I'm marking my property.
You should go out like this tomorrow.

198
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,543
Do you think I'm stupid?

199
00:22:58,503 --> 00:22:59,583
Of course you are.

200
00:22:59,703 --> 00:23:01,223
Why would you marry me if you weren't?

201
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,103
That's enough.

202
00:23:04,223 --> 00:23:05,783
Now, I'll make Shancai beautiful again.

203
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,583
-I don't think you can do it.
-Does it work like this?

204
00:23:12,263 --> 00:23:15,583
-Like this? Is this right?
-No!

205
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,063
Is this right?

206
00:23:17,823 --> 00:23:20,623
I'm going to make you beautiful too.

207
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:22,663
Here.

208
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,583
All right, that's enough.
I'm already beautiful.

209
00:23:26,663 --> 00:23:28,143
Not enough. Let's put some more on.

210
00:23:28,663 --> 00:23:30,463
Are you really going to wash my hair?

211
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:33,543
I'm warning you. I won't put up with it.

212
00:23:33,623 --> 00:23:34,743
Don't mess around with me.

213
00:23:36,823 --> 00:23:40,103
I'm the dandruff eliminator.
I'm not afraid of you.

214
00:23:41,223 --> 00:23:44,383
-Get in.
-No!

215
00:23:58,383 --> 00:23:59,223
Hey.

216
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:01,863
It's all right. You don't need to do this.

217
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:03,303
Hey.

218
00:24:03,503 --> 00:24:06,183
Today, we're married for three months.

219
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:10,663
There's no greater gift that can beat
a home-cooked meal made by your husband.

220
00:24:11,223 --> 00:24:12,383
I understand.

221
00:24:12,863 --> 00:24:15,023
But it's just three months.

222
00:24:15,503 --> 00:24:17,823
Can't we go to a restaurant like we did

223
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:20,383
for our first and second
month anniversaries?

224
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:24,303
Rejecting your husband's love is a crime.

225
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:26,543
Get out of the way now.

226
00:24:27,263 --> 00:24:29,863
Just wait and see.
I'll give you a huge surprise.

227
00:24:37,223 --> 00:24:38,743
My hand!

228
00:24:38,823 --> 00:24:40,103
-What's wrong?
-It hurts!

229
00:24:40,183 --> 00:24:41,863
-Don't touch it.
-What happened?

230
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,463
How did it grow out again?

231
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:52,983
Don't play a prank like that again.

232
00:24:54,263 --> 00:24:55,143
Fine.

233
00:24:56,623 --> 00:24:59,183
I apologize. I'm sorry.

234
00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:01,703
If apologies worked,
why would we need the police?

235
00:25:52,903 --> 00:25:53,863
What are you reading?

236
00:25:54,223 --> 00:25:56,143
-A comic book.
-What comic book?

237
00:25:56,663 --> 00:25:58,543
<i>My Quarter of a Boyfriend.</i>

238
00:26:02,783 --> 00:26:05,463
They look kind of like F4.

239
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,023
But...

240
00:26:08,663 --> 00:26:09,663
I'm more handsome.

241
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,983
Yes. You're more handsome.

242
00:27:54,343 --> 00:27:56,943
-Look, it's a meteor shower.
-Put your jacket on.

243
00:27:58,743 --> 00:27:59,583
Here.

244
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:12,023
His latest work
has an ink wash painting theme.

245
00:28:12,703 --> 00:28:13,903
I think it'll work great.

246
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:14,943
BY CHEN FENG

247
00:28:15,023 --> 00:28:17,343
Using Chen Feng's work
as the packaging for our new tea.

248
00:28:19,183 --> 00:28:20,303
What a great idea.

249
00:28:22,663 --> 00:28:23,783
Are you kidding me?

250
00:28:23,983 --> 00:28:27,063
It's New Year's Eve,
but we're still here working.

251
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,743
Not us. Only you.

252
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,103
I made plans with Xiaoyou.

253
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,343
Bye.

254
00:28:41,663 --> 00:28:43,023
Do you think I don't have plans?

255
00:28:45,703 --> 00:28:47,343
I just have to wait longer.

256
00:29:14,343 --> 00:29:16,583
-Look, a meteor shower.
-Wow.

257
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:18,943
Meteors!

258
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,503
Please help us sell bananas
all around the world

259
00:29:22,023 --> 00:29:24,223
to every market that exists!

260
00:29:24,783 --> 00:29:27,023
And, please turn me into a handsome guy,

261
00:29:27,103 --> 00:29:29,983
so that I can get a beautiful girlfriend!

262
00:29:30,063 --> 00:29:32,663
Don't be silly.
You can't make that many wishes.

263
00:29:32,943 --> 00:29:35,543
There are so many of them.
I could make a dozen wishes.

264
00:29:36,703 --> 00:29:39,903
I want to be prettier.
I want to lose weight.

265
00:29:39,983 --> 00:29:42,263
World peace!

266
00:29:42,343 --> 00:29:44,743
No air pollution!

267
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:30,663
Put this on.

268
00:30:31,383 --> 00:30:33,183
-It's cold outside.
-Okay.

269
00:30:45,863 --> 00:30:47,583
Look, meteors.

270
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:55,023
There are so many of them.

271
00:30:55,303 --> 00:30:56,263
Make a wish.

272
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,463
Do you want to know what I wished for?

273
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:01,463
What?

274
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:04,543
It's a secret. I won't tell you.

275
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:22,623
That was good.

276
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:25,463
-Are you new here?
-New?

277
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:27,383
I've been singing here for over a decade.

278
00:35:27,463 --> 00:35:28,663
I've never seen you before.

279
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:31,103
-Yeah.
-I've never seen you either.

280
00:35:31,183 --> 00:35:32,583
-What's your name?
-I'm Daoming Si.

281
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,343
-Daoming Si. What about you?
-Dong Shancai.

282
00:35:36,983 --> 00:35:39,103
That's different from what I thought.

283
00:35:39,183 --> 00:35:41,063
I remember those names.

284
00:35:41,143 --> 00:35:42,263
They're really familiar.

285
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,343
-What's your name?
-That's weird.

286
00:35:44,663 --> 00:35:45,743
I'm Xiaoha.

287
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:47,463
-Xiaoha?
-Have you ever heard this song?

288
00:35:47,543 --> 00:35:48,703
<i>Can't Help Falling in Love?</i>

289
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:50,703
-<i>Can't Help Falling in Love?</i>
-Have you heard it?

290
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,823
-No.
-That's okay. Is it good?

291
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:55,103
-Yes.
-Yes.

292
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:56,903
-Want to hear it?
-Yes.

293
00:35:56,983 --> 00:35:57,863
Pay up.

294
00:35:57,983 --> 00:35:58,863
-Pay?
-Yeah.

295
00:35:58,943 --> 00:36:00,623
-Just a little.
-I don't have any. Do you?

296
00:36:00,703 --> 00:36:01,903
-Is ten yuan enough?
-Yes.

297
00:36:01,983 --> 00:36:02,943
Really?

298
00:36:03,023 --> 00:36:04,263
I'm just here for fun.

299
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,823
-Clap your hands.
-Okay.

300
00:36:07,263 --> 00:36:08,823
Here we go.

301
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:14,423
Keep singing. I'll help you.

302
00:37:23,823 --> 00:37:25,183
-You know it too?
-Yes.

303
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:26,623
-Cool.
-My friends do too.

304
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:27,623
Get them up here.

305
00:37:27,783 --> 00:37:28,663
Hey!

306
00:37:28,823 --> 00:37:30,183
Hey, come over here!

307
00:37:30,783 --> 00:37:31,703
Come on.

308
00:37:32,263 --> 00:37:33,903
-Get over here.
-Let's sing.

309
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:53,543
Let's wave our hands.

310
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:54,863
Come on.

311
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:34,583
-Bye.
-Bye.

312
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:37,023
Bye!

313
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:38,903
Bye!
