EPISODE 47

4
00:01:34,223 --> 00:01:38,223
I can't believe what I saw last night.
What era are we in now?

5
00:01:38,303 --> 00:01:39,503
How could this happen?

6
00:01:39,623 --> 00:01:40,623
Si's mom...

7
00:01:41,543 --> 00:01:42,823
Is she crazy?

8
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:46,383
Maybe his mom has gone crazy.

9
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:48,703
Crazy with what? Money?

10
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:50,743
The Daoming family has loads of it.

11
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:53,103
Do they really need
to merge the companies now?

12
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:55,823
What if it is very urgent?

13
00:01:57,463 --> 00:01:58,303
Why?

14
00:01:58,823 --> 00:01:59,943
Why is it so urgent?

15
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,543
Maybe Daoming Group is doomed.

16
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:11,263
Lei, why do you say that?

17
00:02:11,863 --> 00:02:13,983
The employee who stabbed Si

18
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:16,423
said that he was treated poorly
by the Daoming Group hotel.

19
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,823
That's why he took revenge on Si.

20
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:20,503
Maybe all the hotels are doing poorly.

21
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:25,623
If that's the case,

22
00:02:26,223 --> 00:02:27,583
then they have a huge problem.

23
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:30,023
Can we do anything to help?

24
00:02:31,503 --> 00:02:32,983
The most urgent thing now

25
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:36,343
is to keep Si from doing anything
he'll regret because of this.

26
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:39,103
How do we do that?

27
00:02:45,303 --> 00:02:46,143
Find Shancai.

28
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:44,143
Shancai, have you eaten?

29
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,663
You don't have to comfort me.

30
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:00,343
Just tell me.

31
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:05,703
How is Si doing right now?

32
00:04:10,503 --> 00:04:11,343
Tell me.

33
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,863
I'm prepared.

34
00:04:16,103 --> 00:04:19,063
Didn't you come to tell me the bad news?

35
00:04:21,703 --> 00:04:23,583
I can tell from your eyes.

36
00:04:25,703 --> 00:04:26,543
Shancai.

37
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:28,703
According to Mrs. Daoming's plans,

38
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:30,903
Xiaozi and Si are going
to get married soon.

39
00:04:32,823 --> 00:04:33,663
Shancai.

40
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:36,943
You know that this isn't what I want.

41
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:45,143
Then...

42
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,743
What do you want me to say?

43
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:54,183
Congratulations?

44
00:04:58,023 --> 00:04:58,983
Xiaozi.

45
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:02,103
I can't say that.

46
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,583
I know.

47
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:08,703
I know you won't believe anything I say.

48
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:13,423
But Shancai,

49
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:16,663
can I ask you a favor?

50
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:21,423
Please, let go of Si.

51
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,103
Xiaozi...

52
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:34,543
We all know that this wedding
is going to happen.

53
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:41,103
When Si found out,

54
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:45,183
he didn't eat or drink.

55
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:48,903
I see what's happening to him.

56
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:51,623
He's getting worse and worse.

57
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:57,503
We all tried to talk sense into him.
We all did.

58
00:05:57,903 --> 00:05:59,343
But he wouldn't listen to us.

59
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:03,143
If this continues,

60
00:06:03,783 --> 00:06:04,943
he will die.

61
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,303
Please.

62
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,583
I beg you. Just...

63
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:16,783
Just talk to him

64
00:06:17,863 --> 00:06:21,543
and tell him to stop hurting himself.

65
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,183
He'll listen to you.

66
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:33,263
But his mom would never let me see him.

67
00:06:34,823 --> 00:06:35,943
If you're willing to give up,

68
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:38,303
his mom will let you see him.

69
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:50,663
Lei.

70
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:55,743
Even you're trying
to make me give up on him?

71
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:59,263
No. We know Si too well.

72
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:03,143
Once he makes a decision,
he'll do anything to make it happen.

73
00:07:04,463 --> 00:07:07,943
If you don't go,
he'll fight with his mother to the end.

74
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,943
Maybe his willpower can beat his mom,

75
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:15,983
but his body can't.

76
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:20,743
Shancai, please forgive us
for being selfish.

77
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,143
We want you to see him

78
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:26,143
not to get your boyfriend back,

79
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:28,823
but to save him from dying.

80
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:46,143
Shancai,

81
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:48,743
do you know

82
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:51,783
that you're the only person
who can save Si?

83
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,023
Because...

84
00:07:57,223 --> 00:08:00,343
he doesn't listen to any of us.
He only listens to you.

85
00:08:02,663 --> 00:08:05,023
I know this is unfair to you, but...

86
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:08,863
I'm begging you.

87
00:08:47,023 --> 00:08:47,903
Xiaozi.

88
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,623
Promise me one thing.

89
00:08:55,183 --> 00:08:58,023
When you and Si get married,

90
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:02,503
don't invite me to the wedding.

91
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:05,903
Because...

92
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:10,023
I've already given him to you.

93
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,303
Let's go, Xiaozi.

94
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:33,783
If you're there,

95
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:36,983
his mom will let me see him.

96
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:51,463
<i>I'm not alone.</i>

97
00:09:52,463 --> 00:09:54,863
<i>I have everyone's support
and encouragement.</i>

98
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:57,823
<i>I'm not fighting alone.</i>

99
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:15,063
Xiaozi.

100
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:18,063
You're about to become
a part of our family.

101
00:10:18,823 --> 00:10:21,623
So you have to follow our family rules.

102
00:10:22,983 --> 00:10:27,063
In the future,
don't make friends with lowly people.

103
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:30,703
It'll affect your image.

104
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:32,703
Do you understand?

105
00:10:38,943 --> 00:10:41,263
<i>Straighten your back. Stand firmly.</i>

106
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:44,343
<i>I won't be defeated by those cold eyes.</i>

107
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:47,543
I'm here to see Si.

108
00:10:48,103 --> 00:10:50,903
Where is he? Please let me see him.

109
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:54,543
Mrs. Daoming,

110
00:10:54,623 --> 00:10:57,463
I brought Shancai here
so that she can talk some sense into Si.

111
00:10:58,743 --> 00:10:59,663
No need.

112
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:03,223
Mrs. Daoming, please consider it.

113
00:11:03,503 --> 00:11:06,663
Maybe Shancai could talk to him
and he would start eating.

114
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:11,423
This might be our last resort.
Why can't we try it?

115
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:14,263
I can't let her seduce my son again.

116
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:16,183
Shancai has given up on him.

117
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,663
She said so herself.
She'll make it clear to Si.

118
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:23,743
Mrs. Daoming, please let them meet.

119
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:25,743
I won't let them meet.

120
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:30,783
Fine. That's okay.
Let them talk through the door.

121
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:42,743
Mrs. Daoming, think about it.

122
00:11:42,823 --> 00:11:44,903
I'm marrying Si next week.

123
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:49,663
Unless I'm sure that they've cut it off,

124
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:52,103
I'll worry about marrying him.

125
00:11:56,783 --> 00:12:00,103
Please let me talk to him.
I'll leave after that.

126
00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:05,663
You go with her.

127
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:08,023
They can only talk through the door.

128
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:09,983
After she's done, send her out.

129
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,063
Thank you, ma'am.

130
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:13,623
Let's go.

131
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:23,743
What is it?

132
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:26,663
I want to see him on my own.

133
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:28,263
Can I?

134
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:32,263
I'll only talk through the door.

135
00:12:32,863 --> 00:12:33,903
Don't worry.

136
00:12:37,463 --> 00:12:38,503
Sure.

137
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:12,223
Daoming Si.

138
00:13:14,823 --> 00:13:15,863
Daoming Si.

139
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,063
It's Shancai.

140
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:23,823
Shancai?

141
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:07,623
Can you hear me?

142
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:11,583
Shancai.

143
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:15,143
You idiot.

144
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,063
Why aren't you eating?

145
00:14:21,463 --> 00:14:23,663
Why are you doing something so stupid?

146
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:27,703
Is it because of me?

147
00:14:30,823 --> 00:14:32,703
You always say I'm an idiot,

148
00:14:35,103 --> 00:14:36,303
but you're the idiot.

149
00:14:55,703 --> 00:14:56,703
Maybe...

150
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:02,863
You should just listen to your mom

151
00:15:06,463 --> 00:15:07,503
and marry Xiaozi.

152
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:14,223
That would be nice

153
00:15:16,143 --> 00:15:18,463
because Xiaozi really likes you.

154
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:26,063
But...

155
00:15:28,463 --> 00:15:30,343
I never really liked you.

156
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:40,263
I'm an ordinary girl.

157
00:15:41,863 --> 00:15:42,983
I wanted to marry you

158
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:48,103
just for the fame and money.

159
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:50,943
For the glamour.

160
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,543
Did you hear that?

161
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:00,303
I did.

162
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:02,583
Go on.

163
00:16:05,623 --> 00:16:07,663
When we first started dating,

164
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:10,223
it was pretty fun.

165
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:13,023
But towards the end,

166
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:17,343
it started getting complicated.

167
00:16:20,183 --> 00:16:22,303
I couldn't take it anymore.

168
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:29,463
If only we had never started dating.

169
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,263
That would make things easier, right?

170
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,263
I thought about it for a long time.

171
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:44,503
And I want to tell you that

172
00:16:47,063 --> 00:16:48,423
ever since the beginning,

173
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:51,823
I never really liked you.

174
00:16:59,823 --> 00:17:00,783
Daoming Si,

175
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:04,743
do you know how ridiculous you were?

176
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:09,423
Dong Shancai.

177
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:13,143
You're...

178
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:14,863
so cute.

179
00:17:24,863 --> 00:17:25,943
How can you

180
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:28,503
be so stupid and cute?

181
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:31,743
I'm really...

182
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:33,863
happy.

183
00:17:38,463 --> 00:17:40,423
What's this nonsense?

184
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:43,943
Do you even know

185
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,103
what's going on right now?

186
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,183
Shut up.

187
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,983
Use your stupid little head

188
00:17:52,623 --> 00:17:55,863
and try to think about

189
00:17:56,703 --> 00:17:59,063
everything I've ever said to you.

190
00:18:00,823 --> 00:18:01,783
Si...

191
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:02,823
Calm down

192
00:18:04,943 --> 00:18:06,343
and think about it.

193
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:17,463
Think about those
bad times we went through.

194
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,583
And how my love never wavered.

195
00:18:25,263 --> 00:18:26,663
I haven't forgotten.

196
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:30,063
I believe

197
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,583
that you haven't forgotten
about it either.

198
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:44,343
Dong Shancai!

199
00:18:55,623 --> 00:18:56,743
I like you.

200
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:12,863
I don't know why.

201
00:19:13,463 --> 00:19:16,703
Even I'm surprised by how much I like you.

202
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:21,703
No matter where I go,
you're the only person that I see.

203
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:26,223
Shancai.

204
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:28,543
I know I'm annoying.

205
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:32,343
If you want to run away,
I'll chase after you.

206
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:34,743
If you run to Mars,

207
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:36,663
I'll go there too.

208
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,303
You stupid boy!

209
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:45,023
Why didn't you fight back?

210
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:52,983
If I fought back,

211
00:19:54,103 --> 00:19:55,423
then I would really lose.

212
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:02,543
Can you stop crying?

213
00:20:04,543 --> 00:20:05,823
Just the few of them...

214
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:07,263
They...

215
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:09,423
They could never beat me.

216
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,583
But seeing you cry

217
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:15,503
makes me worried.

218
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,463
<i>My life has no meaning without you.</i>

219
00:20:44,463 --> 00:20:47,343
<i>When I'm awake, you're all I think of.</i>

220
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:50,343
<i>When I close my eyes, you're in my dreams.</i>

221
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,703
<i>I can only think of one thing.</i>

222
00:20:55,223 --> 00:20:56,383
<i>I can't live without you.</i>

223
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:04,943
<i>Shancai.</i>

224
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:10,943
<i>I've always done
what I wanted to do before.</i>

225
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:14,303
<i>But I don't know what to do anymore.</i>

226
00:21:15,863 --> 00:21:17,023
<i>Please tell me.</i>

227
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:19,743
<i>What should I do
for me to continue loving you?</i>

228
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:55,103
<i>Shancai's mine.</i>

229
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,103
I can't let her be with another guy.

230
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,183
I want to win her heart.

231
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:03,223
Regardless if it's my mom...

232
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:05,943
<i>Even if the whole world wants me
to give up on her,</i>

233
00:22:06,703 --> 00:22:08,223
<i>I'd never leave Shancai.</i>

234
00:22:17,943 --> 00:22:19,783
I never thought about giving up.

235
00:22:24,703 --> 00:22:27,263
Not in the past, not now,

236
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:29,783
not in the future.

237
00:22:32,543 --> 00:22:33,663
Your visit today

238
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,863
has proven that it's worth it.

239
00:22:45,343 --> 00:22:46,303
Because...

240
00:22:47,103 --> 00:22:49,703
only the Shancai who loves me
more than anything else,

241
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:54,343
who worries about me
suddenly disappearing,

242
00:22:56,463 --> 00:22:58,783
would say those hurtful words to me.

243
00:23:05,063 --> 00:23:07,303
I was so weak that I couldn't move,

244
00:23:09,623 --> 00:23:12,903
but now I feel so much energy inside me.

245
00:23:13,943 --> 00:23:16,263
You're giving me strength.

246
00:23:18,783 --> 00:23:20,063
In this whole wide world,

247
00:23:20,543 --> 00:23:21,583
only you...

248
00:23:22,343 --> 00:23:24,023
I need Shancai by my side.

249
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:26,503
Only then can I keep going.

250
00:23:56,223 --> 00:23:57,223
Daoming Si.

251
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,543
I understand.

252
00:24:06,943 --> 00:24:10,503
From now on, I won't lie
to my heart anymore.

253
00:24:19,623 --> 00:24:21,983
There's a wall between us,

254
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:26,143
but I'll always be on your side.

255
00:24:28,263 --> 00:24:29,503
No matter what you do,

256
00:24:31,143 --> 00:24:32,623
I won't let you be alone.

257
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:35,983
I'll always be by your side.

258
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:51,303
Didn't you say that

259
00:24:53,703 --> 00:24:55,183
if I run away,

260
00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:57,663
you'll chase after me?

261
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:02,103
Even if I run to Mars,

262
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,783
you'll still chase me down.

263
00:26:35,543 --> 00:26:36,423
Hey.

264
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:39,223
Is he willing to stop acting like that?
Is he willing to eat now?

265
00:26:44,263 --> 00:26:45,743
He's not listening to you either?

266
00:26:46,983 --> 00:26:48,063
If that's the case,

267
00:26:49,063 --> 00:26:50,063
you can go now.

268
00:26:58,263 --> 00:26:59,503
Hey, Shancai.

269
00:27:01,943 --> 00:27:02,863
Shancai.

270
00:27:03,463 --> 00:27:04,783
I'm sorry about that.

271
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:10,303
Xiaozi.

272
00:27:11,383 --> 00:27:12,863
I don't feel bad.

273
00:27:14,503 --> 00:27:15,783
I'm actually glad

274
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:20,703
because I've never been so sure
about what I want.

275
00:27:22,463 --> 00:27:25,743
I'm sorry. I couldn't convince him

276
00:27:27,423 --> 00:27:29,423
because I understand what he's doing.

277
00:27:31,343 --> 00:27:32,943
Maybe you don't understand,

278
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:35,023
but I do.

279
00:27:37,463 --> 00:27:38,943
So I'll stand by him.

280
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:41,343
If he doesn't eat,

281
00:27:41,903 --> 00:27:43,023
I won't eat too.

282
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,903
If he doesn't come out,

283
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:47,023
I'll keep waiting for him.

284
00:27:47,103 --> 00:27:48,303
Shancai!

285
00:27:48,783 --> 00:27:51,143
Don't be silly like Si.

286
00:27:52,623 --> 00:27:54,863
Xiaozi, you know how I am.

287
00:27:55,463 --> 00:27:59,183
Don't think that I'll pity you
if you do that.

288
00:28:04,303 --> 00:28:05,143
Mrs. Daoming.

289
00:28:06,263 --> 00:28:08,543
I'm not the one who needs sympathy.

290
00:28:11,743 --> 00:28:12,743
It's you.

291
00:30:04,743 --> 00:30:05,623
Shancai.

292
00:30:06,143 --> 00:30:07,303
You should eat something.

293
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,343
You've been here for so long.

294
00:30:10,263 --> 00:30:11,223
Eat something.

295
00:30:14,703 --> 00:30:17,703
At least drink some water.
You can't go on like this.

296
00:30:22,543 --> 00:30:23,703
Whatever Si does,

297
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:26,023
I'll do the same.

298
00:30:28,503 --> 00:30:31,903
If he stops eating and drinking,
I will too.

299
00:30:35,423 --> 00:30:36,503
To the end of the world,

300
00:30:37,663 --> 00:30:38,903
to hell or heaven,

301
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:41,983
I'll be with him.

302
00:30:55,543 --> 00:30:57,383
Is this what we really want?

303
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,983
This is Si and Shancai's mutual decision.

304
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,823
You're in a rush to see me. What is it?

305
00:33:12,143 --> 00:33:13,903
How can you be so cruel?

306
00:33:14,503 --> 00:33:16,343
Your son is starving himself in the room.

307
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:17,783
The girl your son loves

308
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:20,543
is standing outside starving herself too.

309
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:23,383
Do you have a heart of stone?

310
00:33:29,103 --> 00:33:30,623
Is this what you wanted to talk about?

311
00:33:32,983 --> 00:33:35,943
If Mrs. Yu didn't tell me,
you would've never told me, right?

312
00:33:36,423 --> 00:33:37,783
Why would I tell you?

313
00:33:38,663 --> 00:33:40,943
So that you can help your brother escape?

314
00:33:42,423 --> 00:33:45,343
Did you forget that you wanted
to elope with someone too?

315
00:33:46,223 --> 00:33:47,343
What happened then?

316
00:33:47,863 --> 00:33:49,903
The man who promised
to be with you forever

317
00:33:49,983 --> 00:33:51,343
ran away like a coward.

318
00:33:51,903 --> 00:33:55,703
If I didn't show you
what a wimp that man was,

319
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,543
I wouldn't know how your life
would've turned out.

320
00:33:58,623 --> 00:34:00,583
My situation was different from Si.

321
00:34:01,063 --> 00:34:02,943
I can't see what's different.

322
00:34:04,063 --> 00:34:07,143
No matter what threats
or tortures you use,

323
00:34:08,023 --> 00:34:09,663
you can't defeat Shancai.

324
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:13,103
She's braver than me.

325
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:18,983
Are you standing on her side
just to get revenge on me?

326
00:34:20,023 --> 00:34:20,863
No.

327
00:34:21,463 --> 00:34:23,463
I just don't want to see
you make the same mistake.

328
00:34:23,823 --> 00:34:25,023
Don't forget.

329
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:28,623
Your brother is the only son
of Daoming Group.

330
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:31,303
Daoming Group's future is his future.

331
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:34,423
I arranged the best path for him.

332
00:34:35,063 --> 00:34:38,623
Would you want me to give your brother
a company that has failed?

333
00:34:38,983 --> 00:34:42,303
The path you arranged isn't his.
It's your company's path.

334
00:34:43,463 --> 00:34:46,223
Mom, why didn't you have more babies?

335
00:34:46,863 --> 00:34:49,303
Whenever the company is in trouble,
you could sell another one.

336
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:54,783
Are you done?

337
00:34:59,503 --> 00:35:01,663
You're a great businesswoman.

338
00:35:02,783 --> 00:35:04,703
But, you don't know how to be a mother.

339
00:35:06,183 --> 00:35:07,503
You don't understand.

340
00:35:08,783 --> 00:35:10,383
Let me tell you one more time.

341
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:13,503
I'm not just playing the role of a mother.

342
00:35:37,783 --> 00:35:38,863
Si,

343
00:35:39,623 --> 00:35:41,223
if you don't eat something,

344
00:35:42,063 --> 00:35:44,623
your face which you think is handsome
will turn into a skull.

345
00:35:47,783 --> 00:35:49,103
I think I'll look good

346
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,583
even with a skull for my head.

347
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:55,703
That's not true.

348
00:35:57,583 --> 00:36:00,183
Get up now. I'm taking you to dinner.

349
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:02,223
I don't want to see you like this.

350
00:36:04,543 --> 00:36:05,503
And?

351
00:36:05,943 --> 00:36:06,783
And?

352
00:36:07,943 --> 00:36:09,143
What do you mean?

353
00:36:10,143 --> 00:36:11,783
Should I accept Mom's arrangments

354
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:14,623
just like you?

355
00:36:17,103 --> 00:36:18,463
Will I marry Xiaozi

356
00:36:20,903 --> 00:36:22,543
and forget about the girl I love?

357
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,143
Should I?

358
00:36:33,343 --> 00:36:34,943
We'll find a way.

359
00:36:35,663 --> 00:36:36,663
I know.

360
00:36:38,103 --> 00:36:39,103
But, Zhuang,

361
00:36:42,103 --> 00:36:46,503
I'm doing this to let Mom understand.

362
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:49,903
I'm not giving in.

363
00:36:52,463 --> 00:36:53,823
I want her to know

364
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,343
how serious I take this relationship.

365
00:36:57,743 --> 00:36:58,743
Do you understand?

366
00:37:00,503 --> 00:37:01,343
Yes.

367
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:04,143
Zhuang,

368
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:06,863
stop persuading me.

369
00:37:09,503 --> 00:37:10,703
I'm happy.

370
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:12,703
Because...

371
00:37:14,423 --> 00:37:16,383
Shancai is on my side.

372
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:25,503
I'm really glad that you have someone

373
00:37:27,783 --> 00:37:29,143
who makes you happy.

374
00:37:35,423 --> 00:37:37,663
<i>So? What did you find out?</i>

375
00:37:38,263 --> 00:37:40,463
I heard someone in
the finance sector said that

376
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:43,983
Daoming Group was expanding too fast.

377
00:37:44,063 --> 00:37:45,983
It can't keep up with new trends now.

378
00:37:46,103 --> 00:37:47,583
That's why they lost so much money.

379
00:37:49,023 --> 00:37:52,703
This is probably the reason
those employees were unhappy.

380
00:37:55,263 --> 00:37:57,023
She wants Xiaozi in the family

381
00:37:57,903 --> 00:38:00,943
because Xiaozi's dad is trying
to take advantage of their company

382
00:38:01,023 --> 00:38:02,903
while they're in rough waters.

383
00:38:03,463 --> 00:38:05,903
But he's worried that
Daoming Feng will retaliate.

384
00:38:08,063 --> 00:38:10,583
That's a strategy in the business world.

385
00:38:14,903 --> 00:38:16,063
Who would've thought

386
00:38:16,623 --> 00:38:20,743
that Si's family was in so much trouble?

387
00:38:24,223 --> 00:38:27,623
No wonder Mrs. Daoming was forced
to use such extreme measures.

388
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:29,583
But I don't understand.

389
00:38:30,063 --> 00:38:33,103
Is that the only way to help
Daoming Group get back on track?

390
00:38:33,903 --> 00:38:34,863
Of course not.

391
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:38,903
I think Si's mom doesn't know what to do.

392
00:38:39,423 --> 00:38:40,943
Because she's lost her direction.

393
00:38:41,423 --> 00:38:43,463
A successful businesswoman like her?

394
00:38:44,463 --> 00:38:45,863
She doesn't trust anyone.

395
00:38:46,863 --> 00:38:48,743
Her company was going
in the wrong direction,

396
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:51,303
and it couldn't find
new goals for this era.

397
00:38:52,343 --> 00:38:54,703
But, we can't find those goals for her.

398
00:38:58,303 --> 00:38:59,463
Who said so?

399
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:00,423
Don't forget.

400
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:04,223
When I was 18,
I made my first million in stock trading.

401
00:39:04,783 --> 00:39:06,463
Actually, I already have a plan.

402
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:09,303
I'll marry Shancai first,

403
00:39:10,263 --> 00:39:13,423
then I'll tell my mom the secret plan
I've long prepared.

404
00:39:14,023 --> 00:39:18,543
And turn the Daoming Group
into a hotel group with a new concept.

405
00:39:19,183 --> 00:39:20,503
What's your secret plan?

406
00:39:25,143 --> 00:39:27,143
Who has Si's email address?

407
00:39:27,263 --> 00:39:28,263
I think...

408
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:30,703
Si may have a good idea.

409
00:39:30,783 --> 00:39:31,663
I do.

410
00:40:19,863 --> 00:40:20,903
Stop delivering meals.

411
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:23,543
Si won't eat anything.

412
00:40:25,903 --> 00:40:27,143
Stop preparing food for him.
