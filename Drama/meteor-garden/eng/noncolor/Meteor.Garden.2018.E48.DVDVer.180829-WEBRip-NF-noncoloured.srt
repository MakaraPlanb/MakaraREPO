00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:30,023
EPISODE 48

4
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:53,223
I know you did it so Daoming Si
and I can be together.

5
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,543
Stay and wait with me

6
00:02:57,423 --> 00:02:58,303
until he wakes up.

7
00:02:58,863 --> 00:03:00,023
We'll wait for him to wake up.

8
00:03:02,063 --> 00:03:05,223
With you around,
I'll feel brave and more confident.

9
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:29,703
It's been raining for days.

10
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:33,703
Is God trying to help Si and Shancai,
or keep them from being together?

11
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:40,223
Xiaozi?

12
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:42,863
Meizuo, I've made my decision.

13
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:44,983
No matter what,

14
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:47,423
I'm on Shancai's side.

15
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:50,263
Okay.

16
00:03:50,383 --> 00:03:52,103
Let's meet at Si's house in a bit.

17
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:53,623
Okay.

18
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:06,823
<i>Shancai, stay strong.</i>

19
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:09,023
<i>You have to make it to the end.</i>

20
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:11,103
<i>You're the luckiest girl</i>

21
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:14,463
<i>because you have Daoming Si</i>

22
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:16,623
<i>who loves you with all his life.</i>

23
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:21,303
Shancai's been standing there for days.

24
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:23,183
Your son is about to starve to death.

25
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:25,223
When are you going to give in?

26
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:29,223
They're being very naive.

27
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:31,423
They think that by doing this,

28
00:04:32,263 --> 00:04:33,703
they can force me to give in.

29
00:04:34,223 --> 00:04:35,183
I'm telling you,

30
00:04:36,263 --> 00:04:37,463
that's not going to happen.

31
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:41,423
Mom, can you wake up?

32
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,023
Don't tell me to wake up.

33
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:46,023
I know precisely what I'm doing.

34
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:50,343
I'm begging you.

35
00:04:51,143 --> 00:04:52,503
Someone is going to die.

36
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,223
Have you ever thought
about what caused this situation?

37
00:04:55,703 --> 00:04:57,343
It's because they were disobedient.

38
00:04:58,063 --> 00:04:59,983
This is the price they have to pay.

39
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:01,383
This is the result.

40
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:03,463
Do you think

41
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:06,063
they're the only ones who are dying?

42
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:08,383
Let me tell you something.

43
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:10,943
I'm dying too.

44
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:15,103
I'm dying of anger
because my children are disobedient.

45
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:33,623
Xiaozi?

46
00:05:39,663 --> 00:05:40,863
I've talked to my parents.

47
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:44,943
I'll never, ever marry Daoming Si.

48
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:48,223
Because

49
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:51,103
I really want Shancai to be with Si.

50
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:53,223
Mrs. Daoming,

51
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:54,983
give up already.

52
00:06:04,103 --> 00:06:05,463
Is this your decision?

53
00:06:06,063 --> 00:06:07,223
It's my decision.

54
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:09,343
And it's my dad's decision too.

55
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:12,903
My dad will talk to you soon.

56
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:16,823
Mrs. Daoming,
apart from being here with Xiaozi,

57
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:18,903
we have something very important

58
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:21,303
you and Zhuang should look at.

59
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:53,143
Shancai, it's over now.

60
00:06:53,503 --> 00:06:55,863
Shancai, Mrs. Daoming gave in.

61
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:58,303
She won't try to separate
you and Si anymore.

62
00:07:28,943 --> 00:07:30,063
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

63
00:07:31,303 --> 00:07:32,383
<i>I'm here.</i>

64
00:07:34,223 --> 00:07:35,343
<i>Wait for me.</i>

65
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:41,863
<i>Why are my feet so heavy?</i>

66
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:46,343
<i>You're so close to me now.</i>

67
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:50,903
<i>Why can't I walk over to you?</i>

68
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:53,703
<i>I'm fine.</i>

69
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:55,703
<i>I can do this.</i>

70
00:07:56,863 --> 00:07:58,463
<i>If I can't walk to you,</i>

71
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:01,303
<i>where else would I go?</i>

72
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:22,423
<i>What is the principle of Schumpeter theory
of creative destruction?</i>

73
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:26,463
In an entrepreneurial life cycle,
one doesn't always remain an entrepreneur.

74
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,503
Unless he continues to evolve

75
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:31,143
and create new formations,

76
00:13:31,623 --> 00:13:34,303
which means to destroy the old,
creating the new.

77
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:36,223
Because with every depression,

78
00:13:36,343 --> 00:13:38,783
there's a possibility to gain new skills.

79
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,063
It becomes a new product, skill,

80
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:42,703
or business model

81
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:44,703
to bring the most benefit.

82
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:02,263
That day, I was studying with Shancai.

83
00:14:02,903 --> 00:14:05,423
She asked me about
a theory I had memorized.

84
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:09,623
I gave her the answer fluently,

85
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,543
but I suddenly felt that

86
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:13,943
remembering the theory
and understanding it

87
00:14:14,023 --> 00:14:15,583
were two totally different things.

88
00:14:16,343 --> 00:14:18,343
And Shancai's expression at that moment...

89
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:24,263
You're incredible.

90
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:48,783
She was so cute that day.

91
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:52,023
I had never seen
that expression on her face before.

92
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:53,863
It was true admiration.

93
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:58,063
I hope that
I will always be the person she admires.

94
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:01,423
So, when I do my job in the future,

95
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:04,103
I'll have more than memorized theories

96
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,943
or an affluent family background.

97
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:08,983
I want to become a talented person.

98
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:10,743
I want to find out

99
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,583
how we can truly realize
the creative destruction theory.

100
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,143
<i>I started looking for ways</i>

101
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,823
<i>to think out of the box
and create something new.</i>

102
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:30,983
<i>So I decided to launch
a startup incubator platform project.</i>

103
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,583
<i>In this project,</i>

104
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:45,823
<i>I've collected ideas and creative thoughts</i>

105
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:49,583
<i>from different fields,
places, and products.</i>

106
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,423
<i>This might allow us
to break free of our old ways.</i>

107
00:15:54,023 --> 00:15:57,223
<i>Also, this project is able
to bring about market miracles.</i>

108
00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:03,463
It includes artificial intelligence
technology development

109
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:07,223
and business strategies
that are applicable to every field.

110
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:14,103
<i>Practical products that everyone uses
in their daily life will also be included.</i>

111
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:19,023
<i>Something as small as a sauce packet
can become an international product.</i>

112
00:16:19,703 --> 00:16:21,943
<i>I've done preliminary research
on all these aspects.</i>

113
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:28,823
<i>Currently, nobody knows about my research.</i>

114
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,783
<i>But I'll announce it soon</i>

115
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:33,663
<i>because we need the help of many people.</i>

116
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:55,983
Hey, what is Si's email password?

117
00:16:56,903 --> 00:16:57,983
F4's friendship anniversary.

118
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:01,543
LOG IN

119
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:04,263
It's not it.

120
00:17:05,063 --> 00:17:06,383
It must be Shancai's birthday.

121
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:09,623
That would be too easy.

122
00:17:14,543 --> 00:17:15,863
LOG IN

123
00:17:22,343 --> 00:17:23,983
I guess Si is a simple person.

124
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:33,943
EMBRACE YOUR DREAMS

125
00:17:37,743 --> 00:17:39,503
<i>Of course, I didn't have enough time,</i>

126
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:41,303
<i>so I haven't contacted anyone yet.</i>

127
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:44,983
<i>But I truly believe that
this project is feasible.</i>

128
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:46,543
<i>I'm very confident.</i>

129
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:47,783
<i>Also,</i>

130
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:50,343
<i>I have some very talented friends.</i>

131
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:54,023
<i>I'm sure when they find out
about this project,</i>

132
00:17:54,863 --> 00:17:56,663
<i>they'll do their best to help me out.</i>

133
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,223
Don't you think this tea is special?

134
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:08,303
Yes, it's very fragrant.

135
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:10,343
It's a new kind
that has never been on the market.

136
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:11,783
Are you willing to incorporate it

137
00:18:11,863 --> 00:18:12,863
-into your pastries?
-Yes.

138
00:18:12,943 --> 00:18:13,823
DONG'S KING OF SQUID

139
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:17,423
<i>From the first day I met them,</i>

140
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,943
<i>they've always been kind
and sincere to me.</i>

141
00:18:21,863 --> 00:18:24,063
<i>My worries, my immaturity,</i>

142
00:18:24,783 --> 00:18:25,703
<i>my emotions...</i>

143
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,383
<i>They accepted me for who I am.</i>

144
00:18:30,663 --> 00:18:33,183
<i>I'm very happy because my project</i>

145
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:35,343
<i>can bring hope to people.</i>

146
00:18:37,943 --> 00:18:39,063
Do you really think that

147
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:42,263
Shancai's Eight Treasure Spicy Sauce
can be sold across China?

148
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:47,663
Here, nothing is impossible.

149
00:18:52,503 --> 00:18:53,463
<i>My name is Daoming Si.</i>

150
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:57,423
<i>My family owns an international
enterprise, Daoming Group.</i>

151
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:02,223
<i>Even though I don't know
whether our group can always be on top,</i>

152
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:08,383
<i>I hope that when I join the group,</i>

153
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,383
<i>I can instill new energy
into the business empire my dad built.</i>

154
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:14,023
<i>So that my mom</i>

155
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,863
<i>and my sister can be proud of me.</i>

156
00:19:18,463 --> 00:19:19,783
<i>We're not throwing away our past.</i>

157
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:21,743
<i>We're using new methods</i>

158
00:19:23,223 --> 00:19:24,303
<i>to bring glory to our past.</i>

159
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:27,903
<i>The boy that has always got
on their nerves</i>

160
00:19:28,263 --> 00:19:29,343
<i>is all grown up now.</i>

161
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:32,943
<i>Because he met a girl, Dong Shancai.</i>

162
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:35,503
<i>This girl taught him a lot.</i>

163
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:39,343
<i>He realized that the world
doesn't revolve around him.</i>

164
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,663
<i>He learned how to let go of his pride
and accomplish things.</i>

165
00:19:45,863 --> 00:19:48,383
<i>Because her love gave him strength.</i>

166
00:19:51,943 --> 00:19:53,383
<i>I want to remember that moment.</i>

167
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:56,543
<i>And I want to remind myself
to remember that moment.</i>

168
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:02,543
<i>Therefore, I'm going to name
this project Embrace Your Dreams.</i>

169
00:21:03,743 --> 00:21:04,743
<i>We all have dreams</i>

170
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:08,023
<i>and we should all bravely
embrace our dreams.</i>

171
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:10,823
Mom.

172
00:21:27,223 --> 00:21:29,783
<i>Lei, I can see your face.</i>

173
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:31,983
<i>You probably think this is so sentimental.</i>

174
00:21:32,263 --> 00:21:34,383
<i>That's exactly what I want.</i>

175
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:29,623
Why are you here?

176
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:33,503
After watching Si's project,
you passed out.

177
00:22:35,383 --> 00:22:36,943
The doctor said you were too tired.

178
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,863
We thought you passed out
because you were so mad at him.

179
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:42,543
But I think you saw

180
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:45,543
how grown-up and mature he is now.

181
00:22:46,543 --> 00:22:48,423
So you're finally able to let go and rest.

182
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:54,743
How long did I sleep for?

183
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:56,103
Seven days.

184
00:23:00,423 --> 00:23:02,303
I tried to wake you up.

185
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:04,503
You would open your eyes and say,

186
00:23:06,383 --> 00:23:07,743
"The sun isn't out yet."

187
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:09,583
Just like a child.

188
00:23:15,023 --> 00:23:16,143
I was too exhausted.

189
00:23:16,903 --> 00:23:18,063
I know.

190
00:23:18,303 --> 00:23:19,583
You should rest.

191
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:43,343
SAFE AND HEALTHY, FRIED KING OF SQUID

192
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:08,143
UNLIMITED CREATIVITY, SPICY KING OF SQUID

193
00:24:12,063 --> 00:24:15,143
MARKETING POSITION OF KING OF SQUID

194
00:24:15,223 --> 00:24:18,943
EMBRACE YOUR DREAMS

195
00:24:32,023 --> 00:24:33,983
Daoming Group had faced
some financial troubles

196
00:24:34,063 --> 00:24:35,983
because of over-expansion
and management issues,

197
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:37,223
but now there is hope.

198
00:24:37,303 --> 00:24:39,303
Daoming Feng's only son, Daoming Si,

199
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:42,543
has launched an incubator platform
for young people to embrace their dreams.

200
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:45,183
<i>It has won the support
of many domestic financial companies.</i>

201
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:48,263
<i>They have joined the strategic alliance</i>

202
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:51,503
<i>and some even plan to invest.</i>

203
00:24:51,663 --> 00:24:53,863
<i>The Shenzhen Tencent Technology Platform</i>

204
00:24:53,943 --> 00:24:56,543
<i>has provided a building
for all the entrepreneurs,</i>

205
00:24:56,623 --> 00:24:58,823
<i>which will become the future
dream incubator headquarters.</i>

206
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,183
<i>It's closed today?</i>

207
00:26:41,423 --> 00:26:42,423
<i>How is that possible?</i>

208
00:26:51,103 --> 00:26:52,103
Hello, Ximen?

209
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:53,623
I'm here.

210
00:26:53,743 --> 00:26:54,823
Yeah, it's weird.

211
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:58,183
It says that it's closed today.

212
00:26:59,103 --> 00:26:59,983
Where are you?

213
00:27:00,383 --> 00:27:01,423
What are you talking about?

214
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:06,503
Aren't we sending off Lei today?

215
00:27:07,303 --> 00:27:08,703
That was yesterday.

216
00:27:09,183 --> 00:27:10,623
We already sent him off.

217
00:27:11,023 --> 00:27:13,463
You didn't show up.
And you weren't answering your phone.

218
00:27:16,943 --> 00:27:18,743
Yesterday?

219
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:20,783
I didn't show up?

220
00:27:21,743 --> 00:27:22,663
What's going on?

221
00:27:23,103 --> 00:27:25,703
-Where's Si?
-Si went to London with Lei.

222
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:27,463
To London?

223
00:27:27,823 --> 00:27:28,663
How is that possible?

224
00:27:28,743 --> 00:27:30,823
Why would he ditch me
and go to London himself?

225
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:35,223
Shancai, did you forget everything?

226
00:27:41,303 --> 00:27:42,663
What's going on?

227
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:47,103
You and Si broke up.

228
00:27:49,183 --> 00:27:50,463
Broke up?

229
00:27:51,143 --> 00:27:51,983
That's impossible.

230
00:27:52,743 --> 00:27:54,863
Si was held captive
by his mom and stopped eating.

231
00:27:54,983 --> 00:27:57,143
I stood outside his house
and didn't eat too.

232
00:27:57,983 --> 00:27:59,983
<i>Everything was taken care of.</i>

233
00:28:00,063 --> 00:28:01,463
<i>We got back together.</i>

234
00:28:02,343 --> 00:28:03,903
What are you talking about?

235
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,063
That never happened.

236
00:28:05,823 --> 00:28:06,943
<i>You rejected Si.</i>

237
00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:08,823
<i>So he married Xiaozi.</i>

238
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:12,223
His mom took him to London today.

239
00:28:17,023 --> 00:28:18,103
That can't be.

240
00:28:18,423 --> 00:28:19,303
That can't be.

241
00:28:19,623 --> 00:28:21,503
Where is Si? I need to go see him.

242
00:28:22,663 --> 00:28:23,903
He's probably at the airport.

243
00:28:24,463 --> 00:28:25,543
I have to go there.

244
00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:45,983
Daoming Si.

245
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:49,343
Where is this?

246
00:29:50,063 --> 00:29:50,943
London.

247
00:29:53,143 --> 00:29:54,023
London?

248
00:29:55,023 --> 00:29:56,423
Why are you in London?

249
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:00,983
No.

250
00:30:02,103 --> 00:30:03,183
This is a dream.

251
00:30:04,743 --> 00:30:05,823
You know what?

252
00:30:06,143 --> 00:30:09,223
If you listen to me,
I'll let you be my girlfriend.

253
00:30:11,023 --> 00:30:11,903
Wait.

254
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:15,703
I remember that.

255
00:30:16,663 --> 00:30:17,583
I do.

256
00:30:17,823 --> 00:30:18,823
You know what?

257
00:30:19,263 --> 00:30:22,223
If you listen to me,
I'll let you be my girlfriend.

258
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:26,423
Gosh, it is a dream.

259
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:30,303
This dream brought me back
to the arrogant and annoying Si.

260
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:36,463
No. Wake up!

261
00:30:36,983 --> 00:30:37,823
Wake up!

262
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,623
Shancai.

263
00:30:41,503 --> 00:30:42,503
Listen to me.

264
00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:46,663
No matter where I go, you can be
with me within a one-meter radius.

265
00:30:46,743 --> 00:30:49,143
When I eat, you can sit with me.

266
00:30:49,423 --> 00:30:50,383
Even better,

267
00:30:50,463 --> 00:30:51,903
you can find me anytime you want

268
00:30:52,463 --> 00:30:54,423
and be with me immediately.

269
00:30:54,943 --> 00:30:55,823
Of course,

270
00:30:55,903 --> 00:30:58,423
I can take you to and from school
once a week.

271
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:01,183
I can give you good snacks at school.

272
00:31:01,743 --> 00:31:04,063
I can help you with homework
if you need it.

273
00:31:04,783 --> 00:31:08,023
We can go to the best restaurant
in Shanghai on your birthday.

274
00:31:08,103 --> 00:31:10,903
When we play games, I'll let you beat me.

275
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:13,703
You can also enjoy the meteor garden
I designed for you.

276
00:31:13,783 --> 00:31:14,783
Also,

277
00:31:15,343 --> 00:31:17,503
I can get you a new phone
to replace the broken one.

278
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,663
The content is different,

279
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:24,223
but why does it still make me mad?

280
00:31:28,183 --> 00:31:29,023
What?

281
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:32,903
You must feel really happy now.

282
00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:35,743
You must be kidding me!

283
00:31:35,823 --> 00:31:37,583
Who do you think I am?

284
00:31:43,703 --> 00:31:44,663
Hey!

285
00:31:44,743 --> 00:31:45,983
Hey! What are you doing?

286
00:31:46,423 --> 00:31:47,263
Daoming Si.

287
00:31:47,943 --> 00:31:50,103
I'm not sure if you're crazy
or if you're dumb.

288
00:31:50,183 --> 00:31:52,223
I don't know
why you said all of that to me.

289
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:54,943
I don't need your charity
or some special treatment.

290
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:56,983
I also don't need your money
or a new phone.

291
00:31:57,063 --> 00:31:58,383
I want to go home!

292
00:31:58,463 --> 00:31:59,303
Hey, listen to me.

293
00:31:59,863 --> 00:32:01,263
You'd better not come back crying.

294
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,423
There's nothing in this world
that I can't have.

295
00:32:03,983 --> 00:32:05,223
Who do you think you are?

296
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:07,303
I don't give a damn.

297
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:08,423
Well?

298
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:11,063
You can't have me even
if you give me everything in the world.

299
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:12,503
Listen.

300
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:16,183
I, Dong Shancai, simply won't
date a narcissist like you.

301
00:32:16,623 --> 00:32:18,783
What you just said is as stupid
as your pineapple head.

302
00:32:19,343 --> 00:32:20,303
Goodbye!

303
00:32:38,783 --> 00:32:39,783
Fine.

304
00:32:39,863 --> 00:32:41,263
I guess you don't like those things.

305
00:32:42,183 --> 00:32:43,303
Listen to me.

306
00:32:43,383 --> 00:32:45,983
There's nothing in this world
that I can't have.

307
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:47,583
You're a handful.

308
00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:49,783
You'll be a difficult wife.

309
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:53,143
I'm leaving.

310
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:55,063
Don't regret this.

311
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:00,223
Daoming Si, don't go!

312
00:33:00,303 --> 00:33:01,423
Don't go!

313
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:04,183
Daoming Si! Stop! Don't go!

314
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:31,303
If apologies worked,
why would we need the police?

315
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:32,503
Come back here!

316
00:34:33,903 --> 00:34:36,423
She didn't mean to do it.
She apologized to you, didn't she?

317
00:34:36,863 --> 00:34:38,183
Why do you have to be so mean?

318
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:41,663
You've got guts.

319
00:34:44,063 --> 00:34:44,903
Daoming Si!

320
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,183
Hey!

321
00:35:01,343 --> 00:35:02,383
You're a bad girl.

322
00:35:02,663 --> 00:35:04,143
Why are you so mean?

323
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,303
It's all your fault!

324
00:35:11,263 --> 00:35:12,503
Si...

325
00:35:13,383 --> 00:35:14,303
<i>Stop crying.</i>

326
00:35:17,863 --> 00:35:19,503
<i>I won't hurt you anymore.</i>

327
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:35,423
Sorry, I'm late.

328
00:35:36,183 --> 00:35:38,903
If you say you didn't do it,
I believe you.

329
00:35:41,903 --> 00:35:43,303
If you dare kick her,

330
00:35:44,263 --> 00:35:46,103
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

331
00:35:46,983 --> 00:35:48,023
Stupid boy.

332
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:50,703
Why did you come here?

333
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:53,303
Don't look at me with your filthy face.

334
00:35:55,063 --> 00:35:56,223
Close your eyes.

335
00:35:57,583 --> 00:35:58,463
<i>Idiot.</i>

336
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:00,783
<i>Didn't I tell you before?</i>

337
00:36:02,383 --> 00:36:05,263
<i>Even if you went to Mars,
I'd still go after you.</i>

338
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:08,503
<i>You wouldn't be able
to get rid of me in this life.</i>

339
00:36:09,223 --> 00:36:12,183
Stop struggling for no reason.

340
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:14,623
<i>Shancai.</i>

341
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,703
<i>I just want to be with you.</i>

342
00:36:17,063 --> 00:36:18,943
<i>I, Dong Shancai,
will be with you no matter what.</i>

343
00:36:19,783 --> 00:36:21,223
<i>Can you not leave me?</i>

344
00:36:25,343 --> 00:36:26,663
<i>To the end of the world,</i>

345
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:28,983
<i>to hell or heaven,</i>

346
00:36:30,663 --> 00:36:31,943
<i>I'll be with him.</i>

347
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,063
Daoming Si!

348
00:36:39,423 --> 00:36:40,543
I'm very happy.

349
00:36:41,823 --> 00:36:46,063
Because you're the only one I'm willing
to trade all the meteors in the sky for.

350
00:37:01,103 --> 00:37:02,183
Shancai.

351
00:37:02,743 --> 00:37:04,423
Do you know what the lyrics mean?

352
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:07,063
I do.

353
00:37:07,983 --> 00:37:09,023
Do you love Daoming Si?

354
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:11,463
I do.

355
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,783
Do you want me to bring him out?

356
00:37:14,423 --> 00:37:16,223
Yes, please, Zhuang.

357
00:37:21,663 --> 00:37:23,183
I ask of the world, what is love?

358
00:37:23,263 --> 00:37:24,983
People live and die for it.

359
00:37:25,783 --> 00:37:27,703
I ask of the world, what is love?

360
00:37:27,903 --> 00:37:29,703
