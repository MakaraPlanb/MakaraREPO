EPISODE 1

4
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,366
<i>Have you ever wondered
what will happen to you in the future?</i>

5
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:37,646
<i>At least the 18-year-old me</i>

6
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:41,006
<i>never thought something like this
would happen in real life.</i>

7
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:21,926
<i>My name is Dong Shancai.</i>

8
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:24,566
<i>I'm just an ordinary 18-year-old girl.</i>

9
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:26,606
<i>This is my mother.</i>

10
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:29,446
<i>She has plump cheeks,
stubby legs, and a loud voice.</i>

11
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:32,206
<i>She's very healthy
and has an optimistic outlook on life.</i>

12
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:34,606
<i>I think I'm a lot like her.</i>

13
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,286
You silly girl.

14
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,926
How did your face get so dirty
just by buying vegetables?

15
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:48,646
I'd like this one.

16
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:57,686
<i>Sweet and sour pork ribs is
the signature dish of the Dong family.</i>

17
00:02:57,926 --> 00:02:59,126
<i>Ever since I was a child,</i>

18
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:03,446
<i>eating my mom's food together
at the table has been the best thing ever.</i>

19
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:06,726
What smells so good?

20
00:03:07,526 --> 00:03:09,046
It looks delicious.

21
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,446
Done.

22
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:18,646
Silly girl. Who said you could have some?

23
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:19,846
This is for our customers.

24
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:21,766
You've had them for 18 years.
Isn't that enough?

25
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:24,286
I'll never have enough.

26
00:03:25,646 --> 00:03:28,526
<i>I made up my mind to get into
Mingde University's Nutrition Department</i>

27
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:31,366
<i>so that I could expand
my mom's catering business.</i>

28
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:33,486
<i>I want more people to enjoy her food.</i>

29
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:45,126
My Sweetheart.

30
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:46,286
Dad.

31
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:47,526
<i>This is my dad.</i>

32
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:49,326
<i>He's just an ordinary logistics manager.</i>

33
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:52,446
<i>But he's also a good husband
who loves his wife</i>

34
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:54,246
<i>and a good father who loves his daughter.</i>

35
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:58,126
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

36
00:03:58,206 --> 00:04:00,406
<i>This is my high school classmate, Xiaoyou.</i>

37
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:02,406
<i>She loves tea,</i>

38
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:06,006
<i>so after taking the college entrance exam,
we worked part-time at this tea shop.</i>

39
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:09,646
<i>It was a long and peaceful summer.</i>

40
00:04:09,926 --> 00:04:11,886
<i>Just like the last 18 years.</i>

41
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:16,806
<i>But, the peace was broken on that day.</i>

42
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:20,926
-Three.
-Three.

43
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:22,366
-Two.
-Two.

44
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:24,206
-One.
-One.

45
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:26,686
-You got in!
-You got in!

46
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,646
-I got in!
<i>-Xiaoyou got into</i>

CELEBRATION BANQUET

50
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:37,406
Thanks to all her teachers,

51
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:41,326
our baby girl Shancai
got into Mingde University.

52
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:44,006
-Congratulations to Shancai!
-Congratulations!

53
00:04:44,086 --> 00:04:44,966
-Thank you.
-Cheers!

54
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:45,886
Thank you.

55
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:48,326
<i>I got into the school of my dreams,
Mingde University.</i>

56
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:51,286
<i>And I became a freshman
in the Nutrition Department.</i>

57
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:53,926
Mom.

58
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:56,246
Is this the legendary Mingde University?

59
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:57,166
Yes.

60
00:04:57,286 --> 00:04:59,126
It's the best school.

61
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:00,486
Shancai, work hard.

62
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,806
Your future starts here.

63
00:05:03,086 --> 00:05:03,926
Fist bump?

64
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:04,846
Cheers.

65
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:09,446
Shancai.

66
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:10,566
I'm so happy

67
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,766
that we got into Mingde together.

68
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:17,246
My best friend in high school
will now be my best friend in university.

69
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:19,566
I'm so lucky.

70
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,366
It's better than winning the lottery.

71
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:22,766
I'm happy too!

72
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:23,806
Shancai.

73
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,406
You're...

74
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,326
Let me think about it.

75
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,206
Li Zhen.

76
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:37,326
You're the quiet girl with
the best grades in the other class.

77
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:38,526
This is Chen Qinghe.

78
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,446
He's my best friend.

79
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:42,086
We were classmates in high school
and got into the same university.

80
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:44,526
You must be very close.

81
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:47,246
Of course, we're so close

82
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,846
that I applied to the same
universities as her.

83
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:51,926
Why did you apply
to the same universities?

84
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:55,446
I didn't want to be apart from her.

85
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:58,486
Also, it doesn't matter what I major in.

86
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:01,846
I'm going to take over the family company,
a banana processing factory.

87
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:05,126
Bananas are great.
They're very nutritious and delicious.

88
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:07,126
Yes, most importantly,

89
00:07:07,686 --> 00:07:08,886
they're never lonely.

90
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,366
Bananas are never lonely?

91
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:11,966
Because...

92
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:15,486
-Bananas hang around in bunches!
-Bananas hang around in bunches!

93
00:07:16,846 --> 00:07:19,046
-You're so in sync.
-Of course.

94
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,366
No matter what,

95
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:22,246
I'm going to be Shancai's classmate again.

96
00:07:22,886 --> 00:07:24,846
Shancai, it's good that I know you,

97
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:27,526
I'd be so lonely all by myself.

98
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:31,726
We'll be best friends from now on
for the next four years.

99
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:46,246
<i>I, Dong Shancai, am ready.</i>

100
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:49,206
<i>I'm going to work hard
at Mingde University</i>

101
00:07:49,526 --> 00:07:52,046
<i>and start this new chapter in my life.</i>

102
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:12,126
-Are you okay?
-Be careful.

103
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:13,566
-I'm fine.
-Sit down.

104
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:15,246
-The lecture's about to start.
-Hurry up.

105
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:22,846
<i>Next, let's welcome our guest
from University of Pennsylvania,</i>

106
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:24,286
<i>Mr. Bobbit.</i>

107
00:08:30,806 --> 00:08:32,646
-Mr. Bobbit?
-So impressive.

108
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:34,846
I can't believe Mingde invited him.

109
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:36,446
I'm going to tell my parents.

110
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:38,126
They'll be so jealous.

111
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,166
Hey, look at my pictures.

112
00:09:03,286 --> 00:09:05,046
Shancai, you got really good ones.

113
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:06,086
Send this one to me.

114
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,126
-I'm making birthday emojis.
-It's your birthday?

115
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:09,726
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

116
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:12,126
It's not today. It's in two days.

117
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:13,846
-I sent it.
-Okay.

118
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:16,326
-That lecture was awesome.
-Look.

119
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:18,886
-That's great.
-Yeah.

120
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:19,886
I think so too.

121
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:32,726
Hey, who's that?

122
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,406
-I don't know.
-What's happening?

123
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:40,246
Is it F4?

124
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:42,446
-Let's go take a look.
-Okay.

125
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:48,726
Shancai!

126
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:30,286
Sorry.

127
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:31,966
Excuse me.

128
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,406
<i>Dong Shancai,</i>

129
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:44,486
<i>go home and reflect
upon your actions today.</i>

130
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:46,246
<i>Regardless of the reason,</i>

131
00:11:46,326 --> 00:11:49,006
<i>you should never be
so rude to our school's</i>

132
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:51,046
<i>special guest, Mr. Bobbit!</i>

133
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:55,566
Look, that's her.

134
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,246
She's that freshman, Dong Shancai?

135
00:11:58,326 --> 00:11:59,726
Why did she attack Mr. Bobbit?

136
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:01,966
Yeah, is she crazy?

137
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:04,326
Something must be wrong with her.

138
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:06,326
This is terrible.

139
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:09,126
Is she really a student here?

140
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:10,046
Yeah.

141
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:11,166
Look. That's her.

142
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:18,766
Shancai, are you hurt?

143
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:20,606
Shancai, I'm sorry.

144
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:21,686
It was all my fault.

145
00:12:21,846 --> 00:12:23,326
I wasn't able to protect you.

146
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:27,046
Why did you attack Mr. Bobbit?

147
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:30,806
I didn't want to attack him.

148
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:33,686
I was trying to find
the F4 member with green shoes.

149
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:35,886
One of them stepped
on my phone and broke it.

150
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:37,446
F4?

151
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:38,766
Who's F4?

152
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:39,766
Where are they?

153
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:42,566
Are they the ones
those girls were taking photos of?

154
00:12:43,126 --> 00:12:45,166
They seem to be very popular.

155
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:48,726
The F4 members are very popular seniors.

156
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:52,566
Are you guys new?

157
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:53,886
Yes.

158
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,166
We're freshmen
from the Nutrition Department.

159
00:12:58,326 --> 00:12:59,526
And you are?

160
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:00,886
Junior in Journalism.

161
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:02,286
I'm Guo Caijie.

162
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:04,686
You're so pretty.

163
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:06,606
Caijie,

164
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,566
why is F4 so popular?

165
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:13,726
They're four senior students at Mingde.

166
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:15,806
Their average height is 185cm.

167
00:13:15,926 --> 00:13:18,806
They're all very handsome,
talented and outgoing.

168
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:20,926
Most importantly, at school,

169
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:23,926
they all excel in their respective fields.

170
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:39,006
<i>Huaze Lei majors in music.</i>

171
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:40,326
<i> Ximen, Meizuo, and Daoming Si</i>

172
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:42,206
<i>major in business administration.</i>

173
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:45,686
<i>They attract a lot of attention at school.</i>

174
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:48,566
<i>They always get the best scholarships</i>

175
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:51,046
<i>and they're all skilled
in at least three languages.</i>

176
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:54,566
<i>They're not only smart,
they have great taste too.</i>

177
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:56,966
<i>They might look like players,</i>

178
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,206
<i>but they respect women.</i>

179
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:04,286
<i>The four of them are very close.</i>

180
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:06,206
<i>They've been friends
since they were little.</i>

181
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:08,606
<i>It's almost impossible
for someone new to join them.</i>

182
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,326
<i>Because of that,</i>

183
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:14,046
<i>F4 has always been
very mysterious at Mingde.</i>

184
00:14:14,326 --> 00:14:16,166
<i>The girls all love them,</i>

185
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:18,726
<i>and there are a lot of boys
who want to prove</i>

186
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:20,566
<i>that they're better than them.</i>

187
00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:24,206
<i>These boys challenge them
to prove that they're more popular</i>

188
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:25,886
<i>and more attractive.</i>

189
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:29,046
Challenge? How do they challenge them?

190
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:30,046
With Bridge.

191
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:32,566
-Bridge?
-Bridge?

192
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:34,566
What is Bridge?

193
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:36,006
I've never heard of it.

194
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:40,406
Bridge is an international card game
that's elegant and civilized.

195
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:43,206
It's competitive and requires skill
and cooperation.

196
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:47,526
They're not only the stars of Mingde,
they're also stars in the Bridge world.

197
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:49,366
If anyone wants to beat them,

198
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:51,766
they'll have to be really good.

199
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:54,886
But, since F4 founded the Bridge club,

200
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:56,566
no one has been able to beat them.

201
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:58,566
They're that good?

202
00:14:59,206 --> 00:15:02,366
The four of them have different
strengths when playing Bridge.

203
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:05,006
<i>Feng Meizuo is the artistic one.</i>

204
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:06,686
<i>He loves literature and art.</i>

205
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:09,206
<i>He's good at designing exhibitions
and holding salons.</i>

206
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:11,646
<i>At the Bridge table,
he has incredible memory.</i>

207
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:12,966
<i>He never forgets anything.</i>

208
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,726
<i>He's also very humorous.</i>

209
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:16,366
<i>After listening to his jokes,</i>

210
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:18,766
<i>his opponents often lower their defense.</i>

211
00:15:18,846 --> 00:15:20,726
<i>They start to take
the game less seriously.</i>

212
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:24,886
<i>Ximen is very subtle and cautious.</i>

213
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,446
<i>His family adores tea.</i>

214
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,846
<i>He is very skilled in the art of tea.</i>

215
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:31,406
<i>At the Bridge table,
he's good at strategies.</i>

216
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:33,526
<i>He knows how to play mind games.</i>

217
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:35,046
<i>He distracts his opponents.</i>

218
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:37,846
<i>They often don't even know how they lost.</i>

219
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:39,646
<i>They call him the Battle God.</i>

220
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:43,446
<i>Huaze Lei is a music genius.</i>

221
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,526
<i>He has perfect pitch
and plays many instruments.</i>

222
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:49,286
<i>He earns many
music scholarships every year.</i>

223
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:51,966
<i>At the Bridge table, he's calm and poised.</i>

224
00:15:52,046 --> 00:15:55,326
<i>The opponent can never tell
what his hand is like.</i>

225
00:15:55,406 --> 00:15:58,046
<i>Some say he has laser eyes</i>

226
00:15:58,286 --> 00:16:01,126
<i>that can see through others' trickery.</i>

227
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:04,646
<i>Also, they say that when
the opponent sees his smile,</i>

228
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:07,846
<i>they'll give up their best card.</i>

229
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:12,326
<i>As for the leader of F4, Daoming Si,</i>

230
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:16,606
<i>he has great interest
and talent in finance.</i>

231
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:19,446
<i>When he turned 18,
he earned a million yuan</i>

232
00:16:19,526 --> 00:16:20,886
<i>through trading securities.</i>

233
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:23,366
<i>That made him a legend
at Mingde's business school.</i>

234
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:26,126
<i>At the Bridge table, he's very aggressive.</i>

235
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:30,686
<i>Some people sit down
and get scared into making mistakes.</i>

236
00:16:30,886 --> 00:16:33,046
<i>They fail to utilize their best cards</i>

237
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,566
<i>and regret it afterwards.</i>

238
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:43,166
The four of them

239
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:46,166
have won many Bridge awards
for the school.

240
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,446
The school is very proud of them.

241
00:16:49,046 --> 00:16:50,246
That's awesome.

242
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:51,486
Even if they're good at cards,

243
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:53,606
they should apologize
when they break someone's phone.

244
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:55,886
Yeah, we should go
to their club right now.

245
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:57,326
If they don't apologize,

246
00:16:57,406 --> 00:16:59,286
I'll challenge them and beat them.

247
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,646
It's not that easy to challenge them.

248
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:05,806
You have to get the joker first.

249
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:07,606
What's the joker?

250
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,686
F4's challenge invitation.

251
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:11,486
-Invitation?
-Invitation?

252
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:15,366
So many people want to challenge them.

253
00:17:15,486 --> 00:17:18,406
They got annoyed and made this rule.

254
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:21,806
Anyone who wants to challenge them
needs to find the opportunity

255
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:24,486
to tell them in person
that they want a challenge.

256
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:27,566
If F4 believes that you're qualified,

257
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,886
they'll give you a joker card
and give you a time.

258
00:17:31,126 --> 00:17:34,806
But, before the game,
you need to wager something.

259
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:35,926
Wager something?

260
00:17:36,646 --> 00:17:39,206
There's a lot of rumors about that.

261
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:40,366
Some are funny.

262
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:42,366
Some are unbelievable.

263
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:44,326
For example?

264
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,006
<i>For example,</i>

265
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:54,526
<i>if you lose, you'll have to clean
the school for one semester.</i>

266
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:58,166
<i>or squat in the school fountain
for half a day,</i>

267
00:17:59,606 --> 00:18:03,646
<i>or stay the night in the biology lab
with all the specimens.</i>

268
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,406
<i>That person fainted.</i>

269
00:18:09,886 --> 00:18:12,286
<i>Or, you might have to eat</i>

270
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:14,766
<i>a hundred steamed pork buns in an hour.</i>

271
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:20,286
<i>Some losers have to do
a traditional dance by the sea.</i>

272
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:23,686
One of the most ridiculous rumors

273
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:25,526
that no one has been able to prove yet

274
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:28,926
is that one time, someone who lost to them

275
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,566
had to eat a pair of slippers.

276
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:36,966
So? Do you still want to challenge them?

277
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:41,646
That's the Bridge club.

278
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:47,246
Good luck.

279
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:55,206
Shancai, should we go find them?

280
00:18:58,046 --> 00:19:00,646
Yes. Why not?

281
00:19:01,286 --> 00:19:04,086
The guy with green shoes
is the one in the wrong.

282
00:19:04,366 --> 00:19:05,326
I'm not afraid.

283
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:08,086
Yeah, why should we be afraid?

284
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:09,206
Let's go.

285
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:16,686
-Right here?
-Yeah. Right here.

286
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:17,726
F4.

287
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,126
Come out right now.

288
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:21,566
Yeah. F4, come out right now!

289
00:19:21,646 --> 00:19:23,486
The guy in the green shoes,
you broke my phone.

290
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:25,366
You have to buy me a new one.

291
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:27,366
Yeah. Buy Shancai a phone!

292
00:19:27,926 --> 00:19:29,566
If you don't come out, we're coming in.

293
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:30,886
Yeah.

294
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:33,446
If you don't come out,
we're coming in to challenge you.

295
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:42,726
I think they're not here.

296
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:45,126
Let's go.

297
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:47,046
Yes.

298
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:50,366
According to what Caijie just said,
they should be easy to find.

299
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,406
That's right.

300
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,806
If we see some tall, long-legged,

301
00:19:56,886 --> 00:19:58,526
arrogantly handsome guys,

302
00:19:58,606 --> 00:19:59,926
it should be them.

303
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:03,286
What?

304
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:04,966
Is that them?

305
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:07,726
I think so.

306
00:20:08,086 --> 00:20:09,726
I can feel their presence.

307
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,366
Hey.

308
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:30,526
Green shoe guy.

309
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:33,126
What do you want?

310
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:37,126
-What's this?
-A broken phone.

311
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:41,086
Do you know why it's broken?

312
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:44,126
-It's none of my business.
-None of your business?

313
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:46,406
You broke it by stepping on it.

314
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:47,726
When?

315
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:49,126
After the lecture.

316
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,286
Those girls wanted to see you
and they pushed me.

317
00:20:52,366 --> 00:20:53,646
My phone fell on the floor.

318
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,726
You stepped on it and broke it.

319
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,006
Hey! I'm not done yet!

320
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:19,806
That's enough.

321
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:22,526
-Stop it.
-Hey!

322
00:21:23,886 --> 00:21:25,286
Shancai, stop it.

323
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:26,726
Hey!

324
00:21:29,126 --> 00:21:31,486
I'm Professor Ma.
This is Introduction to Nutrition.

325
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:33,926
This is your first class.

326
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,006
Can anyone tell me why you came to Mingde?

327
00:21:40,486 --> 00:21:41,486
This is the best school.

328
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:42,846
To get hands-on experience.

329
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,366
Learn how to work with others.

330
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,846
Mingde has the best teachers
and learning environment.

331
00:21:48,246 --> 00:21:50,686
So, we'll become top students.

332
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:52,686
Good answers, everyone.

333
00:21:53,326 --> 00:21:55,286
But, what I want to tell you is that

334
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:57,286
most people won't pass.

335
00:21:57,846 --> 00:21:59,046
During these four years,

336
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:01,246
I will hold you to the strictest criteria.

337
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,006
You might feel tortured.

338
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:05,206
You might hate me.

339
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,326
Even so,

340
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,206
I won't make it easier for you.

341
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:10,926
Let me tell you this.

342
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:13,486
We have limited capability,

343
00:22:14,206 --> 00:22:15,046
but...

344
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,486
WE HAVE UNLIMITED DETERMINATION.

345
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:19,846
We have unlimited determination.

346
00:22:20,846 --> 00:22:22,686
Don't be held back by your capability.

347
00:22:24,486 --> 00:22:26,366
Now, form groups of four.

348
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,286
We're going to do group reports.

349
00:22:58,606 --> 00:23:00,126
Silly girl. What are you doing?

350
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:01,886
Mom.

351
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:04,806
A girl from my high school, Li Zhen,
got into Mingde with me.

352
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:06,446
Tomorrow's her birthday.

353
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,286
I want to make a delicious
but low-fat cake for her.

354
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:12,926
There's no such thing as a low-fat cake.

355
00:23:13,006 --> 00:23:14,126
Of course, there is.

356
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:15,926
Our nutrition professor said

357
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:18,326
you can use skimmed milk
instead of whole milk

358
00:23:18,406 --> 00:23:19,846
and half the amount of sugar.

359
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,806
Look what you've learned already.

360
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:24,846
That cake is looking good.

361
00:23:26,126 --> 00:23:29,086
How can you get your face dirty
by making a cake?

362
00:23:29,806 --> 00:23:31,006
All right. Carry on.

363
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:35,406
Shancai.

364
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:37,446
It's kind of ugly. I hope you don't mind.

365
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,366
I love it.

366
00:23:40,646 --> 00:23:44,326
Did you know that this is the first time
someone made a cake for me?

367
00:23:44,726 --> 00:23:46,926
I don't have money to buy a nice gift.

368
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,086
This is nothing big.

369
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:50,446
It's low in fat so you won't gain weight.

370
00:23:52,086 --> 00:23:53,686
-There's a card too.
-Hey!

371
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,886
Don't read it yet. Read it at home.

372
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:57,526
I'll feel embarrassed.

373
00:23:57,606 --> 00:23:59,446
How about we take a photo with the cake?

374
00:24:01,846 --> 00:24:03,406
There's a lot of people here.

375
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:04,846
Let's go...

376
00:24:05,286 --> 00:24:06,126
Over there.

377
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:07,486
-Okay. Let's go.
-Let's go.

378
00:24:14,806 --> 00:24:15,646
How about here?

379
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:17,086
-Let's take the photo here.
-Okay.

380
00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:26,366
Stand over there. I'll take one of you.

381
00:24:26,486 --> 00:24:27,326
Okay.

382
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:32,126
-A bit to the right.
-Like this?

383
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:34,886
I can't get the cake in.

384
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:36,246
-Step back a bit.
-Okay.

385
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:43,846
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

386
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:45,646
You scared me. Be careful.

387
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,126
-Here's your phone.
-But my cake...

388
00:24:48,206 --> 00:24:49,446
I need to get it.

389
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:54,446
You again.

390
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:56,606
I'm sorry.

391
00:24:56,966 --> 00:24:58,166
I didn't mean to do that.

392
00:25:01,526 --> 00:25:04,086
If apologies worked,
why would we need the police?

393
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:08,886
Si, let me help you clean up.

394
00:25:11,726 --> 00:25:13,566
-Go away!
-Hey!

395
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:17,926
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

396
00:25:18,086 --> 00:25:19,766
Hey! Come back here!

397
00:25:22,206 --> 00:25:23,606
She didn't mean to do it.

398
00:25:23,966 --> 00:25:25,566
She apologized to you, didn't she?

399
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:27,206
Why do you have to be so mean?

400
00:25:32,086 --> 00:25:34,966
You're an arrogant,
green shoe-wearing, pineapple head.

401
00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:37,086
You think you're popular at school

402
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:39,166
so you can do whatever you want.

403
00:25:39,406 --> 00:25:41,326
You didn't apologize
for breaking my phone.

404
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,846
You're just a jerk.

405
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:48,566
You.

406
00:25:52,806 --> 00:25:53,646
You've got guts.

407
00:26:29,926 --> 00:26:32,406
Shancai, why did you argue with him?

408
00:26:32,486 --> 00:26:34,606
I don't know why I was so mad.

409
00:26:42,886 --> 00:26:44,526
Okay, I won't do it again.

410
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,246
A joker card?

411
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,606
Shancai, why would you get a joker card?

412
00:27:10,686 --> 00:27:12,726
I bet it's because you made
Si mad that day.

413
00:27:14,286 --> 00:27:16,646
Si wants me to play cards with him?

414
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:18,286
I don't have time for that.

415
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:22,846
Shancai, where are you going?

416
00:27:22,966 --> 00:27:23,806
For a walk.

417
00:27:40,486 --> 00:27:42,246
Those stupid people.

418
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:45,046
All I want to do is study.

419
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:47,206
I didn't want a joker card.

420
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:50,406
They broke my phone

421
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:52,806
and embarrassed me in front of everyone.

422
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:54,726
F4.

423
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:56,526
You're all jerks.

424
00:27:57,406 --> 00:27:58,846
I hope that from tomorrow,

425
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:01,126
your phone signals
will be blocked by aliens.

426
00:28:01,206 --> 00:28:03,846
No calls, no texts, no games, no internet.
No phone in your life.

427
00:28:03,926 --> 00:28:05,606
You'll step on your own foot and fall.

428
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,606
You'll dream of zombies
that eat your face.

429
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,006
Your nostril hair will grow

430
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:11,246
until it penetrates your head
and becomes your hair.

431
00:28:13,286 --> 00:28:14,246
And then?

432
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,646
What happens after it becomes my hair?

433
00:28:45,046 --> 00:28:46,806
-Then--
-Will you be happy?

434
00:28:50,086 --> 00:28:51,526
Are you trying to bully me too?

435
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:53,606
Why would I do that?

436
00:28:55,326 --> 00:28:57,406
Aren't you a member of F4?

437
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:58,566
Yes.

438
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:02,886
I really have no interest
in other people's business.

439
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:20,766
Here.

440
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:22,246
-Pass it.
-Pass the ball.

441
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:23,326
Over here.

442
00:29:23,406 --> 00:29:25,286
-Nice!
-Yeah!

443
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:27,166
Go, Si!

444
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:28,286
All right.

445
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:35,966
Hey, Shancai.

446
00:29:36,206 --> 00:29:37,366
Come over here.

447
00:29:38,926 --> 00:29:39,766
Come here.

448
00:29:41,686 --> 00:29:43,326
Shancai, look.

449
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,486
That's the boy I like.

450
00:29:46,366 --> 00:29:47,806
I want to take a video.

451
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,766
When I give him this drink,

452
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:52,086
take a video of us.

453
00:29:57,726 --> 00:29:59,606
I need to go somewhere.

454
00:29:59,686 --> 00:30:00,966
-See you later.
-Hey.

455
00:30:01,126 --> 00:30:02,086
Shancai.

456
00:30:02,326 --> 00:30:03,726
Don't be so petty.

457
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:05,166
Can't you help me out?

458
00:30:08,486 --> 00:30:09,326
Fine.

459
00:30:29,606 --> 00:30:30,526
Wait.

460
00:30:38,726 --> 00:30:40,286
It's for you...

461
00:30:46,606 --> 00:30:47,566
Are you filming me?

462
00:30:48,286 --> 00:30:49,366
Who's filming you?

463
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:55,846
What are you doing?

464
00:31:11,206 --> 00:31:12,126
Shancai.

465
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:14,286
-Yes?
-A customer ordered 20 takeouts.

466
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:16,446
-Can you deliver them?
-Okay.

467
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:03,486
Sir, excuse me. Where's the Halftime Cafe?

468
00:32:03,926 --> 00:32:04,846
Thanks.

469
00:32:04,926 --> 00:32:07,646
HALFTIME CAFE

470
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:42,406
Sir, here's your takeout.

471
00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:48,246
You?

472
00:32:48,846 --> 00:32:50,166
You ordered takeout?

473
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,126
Yeah.

474
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:53,646
Shouldn't you be glad

475
00:32:53,926 --> 00:32:55,686
that I'm supporting your family?

476
00:32:57,606 --> 00:32:59,166
Here are your 20 takeout meals.

477
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:01,046
Please enjoy.

478
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:02,406
Stop.

479
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,606
What?

480
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:11,286
I didn't check the food yet.

481
00:33:11,646 --> 00:33:14,086
I need to make sure
you didn't get my order wrong.

482
00:33:31,086 --> 00:33:32,806
This is what your family sells?

483
00:33:33,806 --> 00:33:36,006
It doesn't look good at all.

484
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:38,566
Then don't eat it.

485
00:33:39,206 --> 00:33:40,366
I'll take it back.

486
00:33:40,806 --> 00:33:42,486
I spent money on them.

487
00:33:43,046 --> 00:33:45,046
I'll give them to whoever I want.

488
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:46,446
Do you have a problem with that?

489
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:48,366
I know you're bullying me.

490
00:33:48,966 --> 00:33:51,166
But you shouldn't waste food like this.

491
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:55,366
Do you know how much time my mom
spends on making these lunch boxes?

492
00:33:56,406 --> 00:33:57,326
Enough is enough.

493
00:33:57,406 --> 00:33:58,566
Is it my problem now?

494
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,046
You should be nicer to your customers.

495
00:34:02,646 --> 00:34:04,766
I'm nice to good customers.

496
00:34:05,726 --> 00:34:07,086
You don't deserve it.

497
00:34:08,326 --> 00:34:09,286
Say that again.

498
00:34:11,326 --> 00:34:12,566
Or what?

499
00:34:14,406 --> 00:34:16,806
They say only the elite can go to Mingde.

500
00:34:17,366 --> 00:34:19,806
They're polite and have good manners.

501
00:34:20,606 --> 00:34:22,086
But when I see you,

502
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:25,046
I feel ashamed for you.

503
00:34:26,126 --> 00:34:28,646
You don't know how hard
other people have to work.

504
00:34:29,126 --> 00:34:31,406
-You're a parasite of society.
-Shut up!

505
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:51,286
You insulted me first.

506
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,086
You deserve it.

507
00:35:43,086 --> 00:35:45,726
What happened to you, miss?

508
00:35:50,006 --> 00:35:51,646
Don't go, miss.

509
00:35:51,726 --> 00:35:52,766
Let go of me!

510
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:54,446
Don't be shy.

511
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:56,686
-We're good people.
-Let go!

512
00:35:58,606 --> 00:35:59,526
Let go!

513
00:35:59,606 --> 00:36:00,926
-We're good people.
-Yeah.

514
00:36:01,006 --> 00:36:02,446
-Let go of me!
-What are you doing?

515
00:36:10,486 --> 00:36:11,646
Get lost.

516
00:36:13,526 --> 00:36:14,726
What a busybody.

517
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:48,246
Why?

518
00:36:52,966 --> 00:36:55,366
Why did Si do this to me?

519
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:08,486
Wipe it off.

520
00:37:41,566 --> 00:37:44,326
When you feel like crying, do a handstand.

521
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:48,006
That way, your tears won't fall down.

522
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:51,806
Let me borrow this.

523
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:23,566
<i>Eat the slippers!</i>

524
00:39:24,366 --> 00:39:25,686
<i>Eat the slippers!</i>

525
00:39:25,966 --> 00:39:28,206
<i>-Eat the slippers!
-Eat the slippers!</i>

526
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:31,166
-Eat the slippers!
-Eat the slippers!

527
00:39:31,446 --> 00:39:32,966
-Eat the slippers!
-Eat the slippers!

528
00:39:33,526 --> 00:39:34,526
Eat the slippers!

529
00:39:48,406 --> 00:39:49,606
Shancai,

530
00:39:49,726 --> 00:39:51,366
come have breakfast.

531
00:39:51,566 --> 00:39:52,846
Sweetheart, come and eat.

532
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:02,366
You've had two already.

533
00:40:02,446 --> 00:40:03,726
That's for our daughter.

534
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,046
You have to buy me a new one.

535
00:40:11,126 --> 00:40:12,206
It's none of my business.

536
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,086
Go away!

537
00:40:19,966 --> 00:40:21,326
<i>This is what your family sells?</i>

538
00:40:22,806 --> 00:40:24,486

00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:13,846

00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:13,526
