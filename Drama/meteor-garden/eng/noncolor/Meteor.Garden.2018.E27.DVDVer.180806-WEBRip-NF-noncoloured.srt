EPISODE 27

4
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,920
Shancai has arrived, ma'am.

5
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,960
-Ask her to come in.
-Yes.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,920
Please come in.

7
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,760
Bag.

8
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,840
You're all sweaty from running.

9
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,000
Have some tea.

10
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,480
I brought them from London.

11
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,120
There's no need.

12
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,880
I'll leave after I speak my piece.

13
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,280
I like your style.

14
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,000
Then let's get straight to the point.

15
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,520
I'll agree to all your conditions.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,760
Please stop destroying my friends' lives.

17
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Mr. Fang? It's me.

18
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,840
Cancel all of my instructions.

19
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,360
What will you do for me?

20
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,880
I'll leave immediately.

21
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,240
I'll cut my ties

22
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,680
with Daoming Si from now on.

23
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,040
Satisfied?

24
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Then why are you still standing there?

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
Maybe you're a successful businesswoman.

26
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,280
A person in the Forbes' billionaire list.

27
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,920
But you use people as tools

28
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,120
to achieve your goals
with the power you possess

29
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,160
and destroy life's precious things.

30
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,480
You're even more despicable
than a criminal.

31
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,040
Life's precious things?

32
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,080
Don't tell me you're talking about
love and family.

33
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,200
Kid.

34
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,960
You're wasting my time.

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,400
Do you know

36
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,720
that the time I spent listening
to your joke

37
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,320
is enough to close a business deal

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,280
that your family

39
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,760
cannot even earn in three generations?

40
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,440
No matter how nice your make-up is,

41
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,040
it cannot hide your ugly face.

42
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,080
Do you know the price you'll pay
for saying that?

43
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,680
Do whatever you want.

44
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,200
But I'm telling you.

45
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,560
No matter how you break me,

46
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,760
I will continue to pick myself up.

47
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,120
But if you dare to hurt my friends,

48
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,400
I won't let you off easily.

49
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,840
You bitch.

50
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,320
Why is Shancai not back yet?

51
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,680
It's already eight o'clock.

52
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,240
At this time,

53
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,480
she should have already started working.

54
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,360
Mrs. Yu.

55
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,920
Shancai came back earlier.

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,680
She came and left?

57
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,200
Yes, she seemed to be in a hurry.

58
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,480
Why would she be in a hurry?

59
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,440
Where's the president?

60
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,320
She left and went back to London.

61
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,920
TO MRS. YU

62
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,720
<i>Mrs. Yu,</i>

63
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,560
<i>my parents suddenly asked me
to go back to the province.</i>

64
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,320
<i>So I have to leave today.</i>

65
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,520
<i>I hope you understand</i>

66
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,200
<i>how much I miss my family
and want to be with them.</i>

67
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,520
<i>I'm very sorry for being so selfish.</i>

68
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,440
<i>Thank you for taking care of me.</i>

69
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,680
<i>You treated me like my own grandma.</i>

70
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,920
<i>I will never forget you.</i>

71
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,920
<i>I'm really grateful.</i>

72
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,080
<i>Shancai.</i>

73
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Why are you standing here?

74
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,760
Why are you all drenched? Let's go home.

75
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,560
I want to tell you something.

76
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,360
What's the matter?

77
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,160
I...

78
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,720
I can't see you anymore.

79
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,960
What are you talking about?

80
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,560
I'm leaving your house tonight.

81
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,720
Why are you acting like this?

82
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,800
Didn't we go to the Rabbit Hole together?

83
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,560
So sweet.

84
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,800
How do you eat these things?

85
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,240
Cakes are supposed to be sweet.

86
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,240
You even said you want us to be balanced.

87
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,680
And told me not to move out.

88
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,200
We're lovers.

89
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,800
The effort we put in the relationship
should be balanced.

90
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,360
If I'm too reliant on you,

91
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,000
we'll lose this balance.

92
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,080
Have you forgotten already?

93
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,760
I didn't forget.

94
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,400
Then what's going on?

95
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,520
Turns out you didn't want me
to protect you

96
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,040
because you wanted to break up with me?

97
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,440
No.

98
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,360
I meant everything I said.

99
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,720
I meant it when I told you
I wanted to be your girlfriend.

100
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,880
Then why?

101
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,080
Tell me what's wrong.

102
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,400
You're saying this out of the blue.

103
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
I can't accept it!

104
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Your mom said

105
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,680
that if I continue seeing you,

106
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,440
she'll make Qinghe and Xiaoyou's
dads lose their jobs.

107
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,040
I'll talk to her now.

108
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,120
Don't!

109
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,560
I've already decided

110
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,560
to have nothing to do
with the Daoming family.

111
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,720
I've decided not to contact you.

112
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,560
I can't accept it.

113
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,360
You're leaving me because
of such a lousy reason.

114
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,880
That's nonsense!

115
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,400
Shancai.

116
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,480
Do you really think I'm a useless guy?

117
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,760
Forget about my family, my mom,

118
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,760
and everything else.

119
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,480
Have you ever thought of me
as a worthy guy?

120
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,000
<i>Yes.</i>

121
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,640
<i>Since a long time ago.</i>

122
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,360
Stop!

123
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,200
Stop it!

124
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,240
<i>At that time,</i>

125
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,360
<i>to me,</i>

126
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
<i>you're not the successor
of the Daoming Group</i>

127
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,000
<i>or Daoming Feng's son.</i>

128
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,800
Stupid girl.

129
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,040
Good thing I came here early.

130
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,320
Or else what would you do?

131
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,640
You stupid boy!

132
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,440
Why didn't you fight back?

133
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,440
If I fought back,

134
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,240
then I would really lose.

135
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,920
<i>You're just an overbearing,</i>

136
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,680
<i>innocent, kind and gentle man.</i>

137
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,600
I'll put it on for you.

138
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,520
No. It's too expensive.
I can't accept this.

139
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,760
Don't move.

140
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,240
Shancai.

141
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,000
Be my girlfriend.

142
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,560
<i>I was naive</i>

143
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,080
<i>thinking that I can forget everything
and just be with you.</i>

144
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,960
<i>However...</i>

145
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,360
No.

146
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,360
Not even once.

147
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,640
If I really like you,

148
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,920
I wouldn't leave you.

149
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
I should go now.

150
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,880
Bye.

151
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,000
Shancai.

152
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,240
<i>I can't stop walking.</i>

153
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,720
<i>I can't turn back.</i>

154
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,640
<i>If I hesitate,</i>

155
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,040
<i>I'd run into Daoming Si's arms.</i>

156
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,920
<i>If that happens,</i>

157
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,040
<i>the harsh words I tried so hard
to tell him would be in vain.</i>

158
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,240
<i>I'm getting numb.</i>

159
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,240
<i>Aside from the pain of my heart
being torn apart,</i>

160
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
<i>I can't feel</i>

161
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,760
<i>anything else.</i>

162
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,920
Mr. Lu, why don't we have water?

163
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,880
That's right.

164
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,320
This house's pipes are old.
There's nothing we can do.

165
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,360
The pipes burst from the heavy rain.

166
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,520
But don't worry.

167
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,560
Well...

168
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,360
Terence said that he'll take care of it
by wrapping the pipes.

169
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,840
He's outside right now.

170
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,280
He should be done soon.

171
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,440
He's here again?

172
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,360
Yes.

173
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,880
It's good that he's here.

174
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,680
I can go and rest.

175
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,880
It's raining so heavily. Go inside.

176
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,040
I'll be done soon. Go back inside.

177
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,280
Go back inside.

178
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,480
No.

179
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,320
Have some ginger tea.

180
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,960
Did you make it?

181
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,320
It's good.

182
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,800
Let me guess.

183
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,720
You added brown sugar,
lemon, and a little cola.

184
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,560
And a special flavor.

185
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,200
Is it sesame?

186
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,160
Am I right?

187
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,920
You're good.

188
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,120
I'll give you some more.

189
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,920
My heart is already warm.

190
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,400
You got drenched because of me

191
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,320
and fixed our pipes.

192
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,720
I think anyone with that much compassion

193
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,880
would do something seeing you this way.

194
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,400
So you're taking pity on me?

195
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,360
Yes.

196
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,520
I guess so.

197
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,960
Caina.

198
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Actually,

199
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,720
I've always wanted to tell you...

200
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,880
Tell me what?

201
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,560
-Sorry.
-It's fine.

202
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,960
Do you want to take a shower?

203
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,960
There's no need.

204
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,400
Hello? Meizuo.

205
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,360
There's a visitor in your house?

206
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,600
Yes. It's Terence.

207
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,360
Terence is in your house?

208
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
<i>He's taking a shower?</i>

209
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,640
No. I asked him to, but he refused.

210
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,800
No.

211
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,080
That's not what I meant.

212
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,320
Why am I...

213
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,320
I can't explain now.
I'll hang up now. Bye.

214
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,960
I'll get going.

215
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,520
Good night, Caina.

216
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,320
MINGDE UNIVERSITY

217
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,320
<i>Sorry. The subscriber you called
does not answer.</i>

218
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,400
<i>Please try again later.</i>

219
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,640
Si, why did Shancai disappear?

220
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Wasn't she staying with you all this time?

221
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,080
Isn't your relationship going well?

222
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,800
Why would she disappear?

223
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,960
Did you make her mad again?

224
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,600
Daoming Si.

225
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,040
Where's Shancai?

226
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,560
She has no home and no money.

227
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,160
How would she survive?

228
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,200
Is it because of what happened
a few days ago?

229
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,680
Shancai sacrificed herself

230
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,560
to protect them, right?

231
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,640
It looks like what happened
to Xiaoyou's family and mine

232
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
-is all because of your mom?
-Shut up.

233
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,520
Shut up? Daoming Si.

234
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,080
Why did you let your mom
do such a thing to us?

235
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,000
Why did she do such a thing to Shancai?

236
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,560
What did Shancai sacrifice?

237
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,360
Where exactly is she?
Why can't you protect her?

238
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,280
I said shut up! Don't you get that?

239
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,600
-Si.
-Si.

240
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,840
Did you see the look on Si's face?

241
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
It's the same as before.

242
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,040
The old Si is back again.

243
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,840
Didn't Shancai contact you?

244
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,840
No. I'm also very worried.

245
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,840
I can't reach her.

246
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,080
Why did she suddenly disappear?

247
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Actually,

248
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,320
I heard

249
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,200
that Shancai left because of us.

250
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,000
I knew it was strange.

251
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,800
My dad was sued.

252
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,120
After Shancai disappeared,

253
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,520
the lawsuit was withdrawn.

254
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,760
That's right.

255
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,280
After Shancai left my house,

256
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,200
my dad received a call saying he doesn't
need to work in Qinghai anymore.

257
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,240
It must be because of Daoming Si's mom.

258
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,920
How can she do that?

259
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,280
She used us to deal with Shancai.

260
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,280
Because of us, Shancai...

261
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,480
But she never said a word.

262
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,760
That's what she always does.

263
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,120
She silently helps us.

264
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,800
She never complains even when
she's carrying such a heavy burden.

265
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,720
Actually, I don't think it's our fault.

266
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,880
Daoming Si's mom knows that Shancai
values her friends.

267
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,120
That's why she used it to her advantage.

268
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,880
Isn't Daoming Si going to do
anything about it?

269
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,880
Don't mention that scumbag.

270
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Shancai left.

271
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,280
Daoming Si didn't say anything
and wouldn't let us look for her.

272
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,880
She didn't file a leave with the school.
What if she gets expelled?

273
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,080
But did Daoming Si really act that way?

274
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,040
Yes. I'm so furious!

275
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,200
I shouldn't have entrusted Shancai
to that guy.

276
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,120
You're Shancai's best friends.

277
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,160
Tell me. I'm more suitable
for Shancai than Daoming Si

278
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,600
and I can make her happier, right?

279
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,880
Qinghe.

280
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,440
We can see that you really like Shancai.

281
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,720
That's right.

282
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,000
I like Shancai the most.

283
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,480
I wonder where Shancai is.

284
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,320
Is she out crying because of that bastard?

285
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,680
Yes. I wonder how she's doing,

286
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,440
whether she's cold or hungry.

287
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,440
I wish she'd contact us soon.

288
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,240
I'm really worried about her.

289
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,320
<i>Goodbye, Daoming Si.</i>

290
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,240
<i>Goodbye, Mingde University.</i>

291
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,960
Dad.

292
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,960
It's late. What's the matter?

293
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,360
<i>Caina.</i>

294
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,680
<i>When are you coming back to California?</i>

295
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,880
Something came up.

296
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
I'm busy.

297
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,960
<i>You're busy?</i>

298
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,720
<i>What are you busy with?</i>

299
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,000
<i>Your marriage with Tian Ye
was cancelled all of a sudden.</i>

300
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,280
<i>Our relatives keep asking me about it.</i>

301
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,320
<i>Well...</i>

302
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,440
<i>I feel so humiliated.</i>

303
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,920
I have my own thoughts regarding marriage.

304
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,680
<i>All right.</i>

305
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,720
<i>Since you're not planning to get married,
come back immediately.</i>

306
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,680
<i>Our company needs your help.</i>

307
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,240
Dad.

308
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
I don't want to work in our own company.

309
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,680
I want to stay in Shanghai.

310
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,200
<i>Stay in Shanghai?</i>

311
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,600
<i>What do you plan to do in Shanghai?</i>

312
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,160
There are lots of things I can do.

313
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,520
For example,
our ancestral house is so old.

314
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,800
You've always wanted
to renovate it, right?

315
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,400
<i>Caina.</i>

316
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,200
<i>This house was your great grandfather's.</i>

317
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,080
<i>Your mom kept trying to hire
that famous designer.</i>

318
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,320
<i>But she couldn't get him to work on it.</i>

319
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,200
<i>How can you do that?</i>

320
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,880
Dad.

321
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,160
Can I stay in Shanghai
if I can get that famous designer?

322
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,320
<i>That's impossible.</i>

323
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,360
Miss, who are you looking for?

324
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,680
Hi, I'm looking for Mr. Ye.

325
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,720
May I know your name?

326
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,400
I'm Zhou's Development--

327
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,680
Don't construction companies
like you ever get tired?

328
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,480
There's no one by that name here.
Just leave.

329
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,080
Wait.

330
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
I'm not representing any company.

331
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,000
I must see Mr. Ye today.

332
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,480
You people come here
without setting an appointment.

333
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,600
Either you're a nouveau riche
who wants your mansion designed

334
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,080
or a construction company

335
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,480
who wants to use Mr. Ye's name
to sell your properties.

336
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,680
I've seen a lot of people.

337
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
Don't come again.

338
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,400
Mr. Ye would not see you.

339
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,080
Terence?

340
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,880
Why are you here?

341
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,800
Are you stalking me?

342
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,440
Mr. Ye.

343
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,280
Do you know her?

344
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,320
She's my friend, Ms. Zhou Caina.

345
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,520
She's my assistant, Ding Qi.

346
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,760
She's very good.

347
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,200
Ding Qi, coffee for me please.

348
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,480
Your assistant is so fierce.

349
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,120
Actually, not a lot of strangers
come here,

350
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,320
especially beautiful girls like you.

351
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,880
How did you find me?

352
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,720
Or should I say,

353
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,480
how did you find out about me?

354
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,400
I didn't.

355
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,840
I just met you by chance earlier.

356
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,720
I don't even know your real name.

357
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,840
I just know your English name is Terence.

358
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,640
Who knew you're the famous Ye Mingchuan?

359
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,360
Are you mad?

360
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,080
Why should I be mad?

361
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,480
Actually, I didn't mean
to hide it from you.

362
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,640
I wanted to tell you so many times.

363
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,520
However, you didn't seem to be interested.

364
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,480
Indeed.

365
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,360
I'm not interested in you.

366
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,760
-I came for Ye Mingchuan to--
-Mr. Ye.

367
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,480
Mr. Ye. You have an important phone call.

368
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,120
Excuse me for a while.

369
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Help me entertain her.

370
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,120
Thank you. Sorry to bother you.

371
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,400
Never mind.

372
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,400
If you're not here,
I wouldn't be bothered.

373
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,360
Are you...

374
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,440
Mr. Ye's girlfriend?

375
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,480
No.

376
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,120
I came here to ask Mr. Ye

377
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,000
to do an interior design project.

378
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,480
You want Mr. Ye
to design an ordinary house?

379
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,760
It's not ordinary.
Ours is an ancestral victorian house.

380
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,400
We need him to redesign it.

381
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,680
So what?

382
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,360
Do you know how many

383
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,440
large-scale international
cases he rejected?

384
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,080
How can he design your house?

385
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,240
So, it's not possible?

386
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,600
My goodness. Don't you get it?

387
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,880
A famous designer like Mr. Ye

388
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,520
would not accept an ordinary

389
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,600
residential or commercial project
no matter how much your offer is.

390
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,200
Do you understand?

391
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,960
Sorry.

392
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,560
I was too inconsiderate.

393
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,960
Caina.

394
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,720
Where are you going?

395
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,400
What's the matter?

396
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,080
I shouldn't be here.

397
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,800
Then why did you come here?

398
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,120
I wanted to find a master
to do something he wouldn't do.

399
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
I can help you.

400
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,680
<i>"Ye Mingchuan."</i>

401
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,600
RENOWNED ARCHITECT

402
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,200
He graduated from
Catalonia Polytechnic University

403
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,360
with an Architectural Doctorate Degree.

404
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,040
He joined the International Architectural
Design Exhibit when he was 28.

405
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,080
With his brilliant design work,

406
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,520
he received the 2011 Florence
Architecture Gold Award.

407
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,880
In 2012,

408
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,600
he received the Notre Dame
Architecture Gold Award.

409
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,360
But on one condition.

410
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,120
The design, construction,
and budget of your house

411
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,680
are all up to me, all right?

412
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,600
Of course.

413
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,280
Is he such a world-class designer?

414
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,880
I even treated him like a plumber.

415
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,440
And I didn't even pay him.

416
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,960
-Well...
-Mr. Lu.

417
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,240
Stop it.

418
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,360
Isn't this embarrassing enough?

419
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,120
But at least I can tell my dad

420
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,000
that I found the designer
he's been looking for.

421
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,120
I can stay in Shanghai.

422
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,760
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO LATELY?

423
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,760
ARE YOU FREE?

424
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,840
-Any plans for tonight?
-I don't know.

425
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,360
You haven't dealt with your rival yet?

426
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,960
What rival?

427
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,920
I don't consider him a rival at all.

428
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,360
<i>Sorry. Just saw your message.</i>

429
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,920
<i>I'm fine.</i>

430
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,240
<i>That day with Terence
was a misunderstanding.</i>

431
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,840
<i>He just came to my house to fix the pipes.</i>

432
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,240
I knew it.

433
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,800
With him?

434
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,640
I don't think he's that fast.

435
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,880
When have you ever let a girl
decide your fate?

436
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,520
Never, but...

437
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Caina is different.

438
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,240
I don't want to scare her away
that quickly.

439
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,080
That's why I prolonged my plan.

440
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,920
You haven't used any tricks yet?

441
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,200
Meizuo.

442
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,080
Why are you being so polite?

443
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,560
Are you becoming like Si?

444
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,160
What? This is what you call strategy.

445
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,160
But now,

446
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,280
since that guy is making his moves,

447
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,240
I'll also make mine.

448
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,360
Huaze Lei.

449
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,640
Please take care of it.

450
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,440
You mean you want me
to use that old trick?

451
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,520
But that's a killer move.

452
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,120
Still no news from Shancai?

453
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,280
None.

454
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,000
My phone was on the whole night.

455
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,600
I was afraid I'd miss her message.

456
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,960
But there was none.

457
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,040
Where do you think she went?

458
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,360
Isn't that Ximen?

459
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,240
Ximen.

460
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,520
Ximen, bro!

461
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,680
Who's your bro?

462
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,080
You are. We're so close already.

463
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,200
Ximen.

464
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
Any news from Shancai?

465
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,080
I don't know where she is.

466
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,320
So she didn't contact you either.

467
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,360
How about Daoming Si?

468
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,760
Did he try to find her?

469
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,680
Now, Si's who I'm most worried about.

470
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,240
Tell me.

471
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,080
Should I really confess to him?

472
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,560
Go if you like him.

473
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,120
But...

474
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,000
I heard he's dating Shancai.

475
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,680
I heard that he already dumped her.

476
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,080
Really?

477
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,400
Grab the opportunity now.

478
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,160
Daoming Si's coming. Come on.

479
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,120
Go.

480
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,240
Daoming Si.

481
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,200
I made this cake myself for you.

482
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,680
I hope you'll accept it.

483
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,400
He accepted it. She succeeded.

484
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,960
Actually, I started liking you
a long time ago.

485
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,720
I spent all night making this.

486
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,080
If Dong Shancai didn't keep bothering you,

487
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,360
I would have already...

488
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
What happened?

489
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,320
Daoming Si went too far.

490
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,280
How can he throw the cake in her face?

491
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,720
Yes. What's wrong with him?

492
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,000
See?

493
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,160
Si completely changed.

494
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,000
If Shancai doesn't come back,

495
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,600
I don't know what'll happen to him.

496
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,840
Hello?

497
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,320
Hello? Caina.

498
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,120
Meizuo.

499
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,120
You can't miss the dinner your boyfriend's
preparing for you tonight.

500
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,920
All right.

501
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,080
Meizuo. Sorry to keep you waiting.

502
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,160
That's all right.

503
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,920
That's specially for you.

504
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,680
This card contains
the fragrance of grass and soil.

505
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,440
It should be the fragrance of a field.

506
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,280
You're the only girl who can tell.

507
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
You won't ever be sad when I'm here.

508
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,400
Come on.

509
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,960
Let's have a toast.

510
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,480
I want to know all about you.

511
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,800
Me?

512
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,840
Then should I start from when I was a kid?

513
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,920
Sure.

514
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,400
During springtime,
a lot of girls wore dresses.

515
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,400
They were really cute.

516
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,560
But I can't wear them

517
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,160
because I'm allergic to the catkins.
Then I'll...

518
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,880
I'll sneeze.

519
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,960
So I felt so embarrassed
during springtime.

520
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,000
Because the spring wind also wants
to chase your bright smile.

521
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,080
That's why the catkins
flow with the wind towards you.

522
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,440
Meizuo.

523
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,760
You're really cute.

524
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,160
I'm not that pretty, you know?

525
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,160
When you really like someone,

526
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,160
it's easy to give
such a sincere compliment.

527
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,840
I'm not that pretty, you know?

528
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,000
How am I different from other girls?

529
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,480
Three days is not enough to describe it.

530
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,600
Meizuo.

531
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
You're such a cute little boy.

532
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,600
Look.

533
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,200
Your smile is so nice.

534
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,760
That's why the heavens like you so much.

535
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,120
How do you know?

536
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,400
Because they always give you gifts.

537
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,480
They do?

538
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,640
What else will I receive?

539
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,480
You haven't seen the real gift yet.

540
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,320
Where is it?

541
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,480
So where exactly is it?

542
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,240
Count to three.

543
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,960
One.

544
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,880
Two...
