EPISODE 35

4
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:21,349
Shancai, why are you here?

5
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:23,669
Aren't you off today?

6
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:28,749
I just happened to pass by.

7
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:30,589
I'm telling you.

8
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:32,029
There are so many orders today.

9
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:33,509
I can't handle it on my own.

10
00:00:33,589 --> 00:00:35,189
Our boss went out earlier.

11
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:37,189
Do you still have a hangover?

12
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:38,629
Come and help me for a while.

13
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,349
Okay, sure.

14
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:42,509
Go get changed.

15
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:44,509
Okay.

16
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:52,349
Shancai.

17
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:02,109
No matter what happens
to my family in the future,

18
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:05,829
don't disappear on your own again.

19
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:37,149
I'm happy that you and Daoming Si
are together.

20
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:43,189
And I'm even happier to hear
about how you feel.

21
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:46,269
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:53,029
Thank you...

23
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:55,829
for not giving up.

24
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:43,309
Xiaoyou?

25
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:47,509
Why are you here?

26
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:49,389
I was waiting for you.

27
00:02:50,429 --> 00:02:52,309
You just stood here and waited?

28
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:57,909
It seems you like to surprise people.

29
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:01,909
I'm sorry for doing this so suddenly.

30
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:03,829
It's all right.

31
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:07,309
What if I didn't come home?

32
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:09,389
Then I would have left.

33
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,149
Actually, I'm here to apologize to you.

34
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:16,589
Apologize to me?

35
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,909
I'm sorry about yesterday.

36
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:22,789
It's okay. I'm used to it.

37
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:26,949
If I worried about these things,
then I'd be really busy.

38
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:29,989
I thought you'd be mad.

39
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:32,389
It turns out you don't care.

40
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,589
I thought I already caught your attention.

41
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:39,069
Xiaoyou.

42
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:42,389
Do you know

43
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,669
why I never dated any girls
in Mingde University?

44
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:51,109
Because they're too close.
So it'd be too irritating for you?

45
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,549
That's right. You're very smart.

46
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:57,989
You're Shancai's friend.
Shancai is my good friend's girlfriend.

47
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,549
That means you're even
more irritating than Mingde's girls.

48
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:05,549
Sorry to be so blunt.

49
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:10,109
However, I think we'd be good as friends,
don't you think?

50
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:14,589
It's getting late.

51
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,749
You should go home.
It might be dangerous later.

52
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:19,589
I want it all.

53
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:27,509
Last time, you said we can go on dates,
kiss and hug, right?

54
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:30,669
You have to keep your word.

55
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:34,269
Xiaoyou.

56
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:36,269
When did you become so bold?

57
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,509
You're brave enough to say these things.

58
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:40,829
You weren't like that before.

59
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:42,949
If I don't learn to say these things,

60
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,829
how can I like someone like you?

61
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:51,069
-But--
-Arrange your schedule then let me know.

62
00:04:51,549 --> 00:04:54,349
Sorry to disturb you today.
I'll leave now. Bye.

63
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:47,989
Don't you have anything better to do?

64
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:58,509
Welcome home. Shanghai welcomes you.

65
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:03,269
Hey. Bottoms up.

66
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:05,509
-I agree.
-Yes.

67
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:16,909
I just got back
and you're treating me like this.

68
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,469
Why didn't you let us see you off?

69
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,029
I felt so guilty all these months.

70
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:24,189
One or two days in a few months
is more like it.

71
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:26,629
One day.

72
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:29,629
Why are you taking turns
with Si to play cool?

73
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:31,709
You feel like you're the only cool one.

74
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,669
Playing it cool? I was born cool.

75
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,389
Yes, you're the coolest.

76
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:37,429
-The coolest ever.
-Cool.

77
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:38,389
Are you as cool as me?

78
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:40,429
Hey.

79
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:44,069
How's your family situation?
Do you need any help?

80
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:46,589
It's fine.

81
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,469
They told me to just study hard
and not to worry.

82
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:54,349
So, are you willing
to come back to us now?

83
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:56,509
I never left.

84
00:06:57,429 --> 00:06:58,749
You never left?

85
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,029
Then drink some more.

86
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:02,429
-Pour more.
-Here.

87
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:03,429
Full glass.

88
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:05,309
-Fill it up.
-Finish it all.

89
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:07,389
-That's fine.
-That's enough.

90
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:11,149
Drink it.

91
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:13,589
Two seconds. Countdown.

92
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:15,109
One.

93
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:16,309
Two.

94
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:17,789
You took too long.

95
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:21,749
One more.

96
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,669
Then let's toast to our friendship.

97
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:31,589
Okay. Here.

98
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:38,669
-Come on. Cheers.
-Cheers.

99
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:40,109
Cheers.

100
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:55,989
Do you know?

101
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:00,149
If you don't, then ask me.

102
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:02,429
I don't know but I don't want to ask you.

103
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:08,109
Why don't you have any curiosity
towards your friend?

104
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:09,589
I really don't.

105
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:12,029
I don't care.

106
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:13,549
Ask me.

107
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:15,909
Ask me how I'm doing lately.

108
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:20,629
-You're doing great.
-Who told you that?

109
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:23,429
-Aren't you doing great?
-I'm doing great.

110
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:24,429
All right.

111
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:29,549
He played me.

112
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:33,869
Lei.

113
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:35,549
Just do what he wants,

114
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:38,349
or else he'll make a fuss all night.

115
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,069
We all won't be able to sleep.

116
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:43,309
Si, I told Lei as soon as it happened.

117
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:49,149
Not just Ximen and Meizuo,
even Xiaozi told me about it.

118
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:51,589
Three people. Three versions.

119
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:53,509
I don't care.

120
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,109
My version is the original one.

121
00:08:58,069 --> 00:08:59,749
And I want to tell you myself.

122
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:02,029
All right.

123
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:08,909
Si, how are you and Shancai?

124
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:15,149
Shancai and I are officially together.

125
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:17,149
All right.

126
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:22,669
We're together now.

127
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:25,549
That's great!

128
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:28,789
Si.

129
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:31,389
Congratulations.

130
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:36,069
This is great. F4 is now back to normal.

131
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:37,149
I'm so moved.

132
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:40,469
Cut the crap. Let's make a toast!

133
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:45,069
Let's toast to Si officially being taken.
What do you think?

134
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:46,389
Not bad.

135
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:47,709
Come on. Cheers.

136
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,309
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

137
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:10,549
Lei.

138
00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:13,389
When did you come back to Shanghai?

139
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:17,109
How's your family situation?

140
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:20,949
How are you?

141
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:23,829
Why are you here?

142
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:25,749
Yesterday.

143
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:27,389
Good.

144
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:29,669
Because I want to come here.

145
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:34,109
Why are you here?

146
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:38,869
The same reason as you.

147
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,189
It's so good to have you back.

148
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:47,669
What are your plans?

149
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:50,749
To continue preparing for the recital.

150
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:52,429
Really?

151
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:56,229
That's great.
I'd love to hear you play the violin.

152
00:10:57,469 --> 00:10:58,389
Is that so?

153
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:59,789
Yes.

154
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:05,749
Shancai.

155
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:09,589
You and Si are officially together, right?

156
00:11:12,229 --> 00:11:14,109
I think it's a very good start.

157
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:16,909
Yes.

158
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:19,829
It just turned out this way.

159
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:23,669
Actually, I have mixed feelings about it.

160
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:27,349
I'm a little happy and a little sad.

161
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:33,029
On one hand, I hope things
between you and Si go smoothly.

162
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:37,269
On the other hand, you're special to me.

163
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:39,589
Special?

164
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:41,669
To put it bluntly,

165
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:46,269
you're like my pet.

166
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:48,029
Pet?

167
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:52,189
Never mind.

168
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:55,309
What do I expect you to say?

169
00:11:55,869 --> 00:11:56,989
You should be happy.

170
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:59,709
We all should be happy.

171
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:04,269
You're my good friend's girlfriend.

172
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,309
This way,

173
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:09,069
we can be friends forever.

174
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:15,789
I'll go to practice now.

175
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:22,029
Lei.

176
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:25,349
You know I liked you before, right?

177
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:30,989
Goodbye, Shancai.

178
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:40,789
<i>I was able to easily blurt out something
I've had a hard time saying before.</i>

179
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:44,949
<i>I'm happy when I heard Lei say,
"friends forever."</i>

180
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:48,029
<i>My first love has ended.</i>

181
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:51,389
<i>This is the moment when love
became friendship.</i>

182
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:55,389
NEW FRIEND

183
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:59,629
XIAOYOU

184
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:03,189
How are you lately, Master Ximen?

185
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:06,069
I'm all right. Still the same as before.

186
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:08,309
I guess so.

187
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,789
Since your dad retired,

188
00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:15,109
you've been hosting
the tea ceremonies on your own.

189
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,469
That's so great. Unlike me.

190
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:23,869
What's the matter?

191
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:26,669
You've always participated
in the exhibits, right?

192
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:28,989
I only participated.

193
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:31,789
I wasn't responsible for a whole project.

194
00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:33,949
I just needed to take care of my part.

195
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:35,629
It's different now.

196
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,949
Whether it's a major or a minor thing,

197
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:41,629
I have to put in a lot of effort in them.

198
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:43,829
And there are so many details
to take care of.

199
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:47,469
I'm so stressed out.

200
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,869
You're a detailed person,
so you wouldn't have a problem.

201
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:56,069
I don't even have time for dates.

202
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,149
I have to go after finishing my drink.

203
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:11,029
What do you plan to do with Xiaoyou?

204
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:12,389
What can I do?

205
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:15,509
I think she's quite courageous,

206
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,549
but you won't do anything to her, right?

207
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:19,869
Am I crazy?

208
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:23,869
I'm not as brave as Si.
I don't want to get Shancai's flying kick.

209
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:27,269
Girls are like drinks at a bar.

210
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:29,749
Compared to the strong ones,

211
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:33,389
the fruity ones are easy to drink,
but we'd end up with a terrible hangover.

212
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,149
You've had a variety of drinks.

213
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:41,789
What kind of drink is Xiaoyou?

214
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:48,509
Harsh words don't seem to be effective.

215
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:50,829
I know she's forcing herself.

216
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:53,949
But she keeps going forward
and chasing after me.

217
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:58,429
Never hitting the brakes
even when she's speeding.

218
00:14:59,109 --> 00:15:01,869
This girl is really devoted. Be careful.

219
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:03,749
You don't have to worry at all.

220
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:06,509
I'm not the least bit interested
in that kind of girl.

221
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:09,589
Is that so?

222
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,349
I think you've become warmhearted.

223
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:14,949
You see even fewer women now.

224
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:17,669
Meizuo, don't you have a date?

225
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:20,011
I should go.

226
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:24,171
It's hard to date older women.

227
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:27,331
You're always on call
and under strict supervision.

228
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:30,811
That's why dating is so much fun.

229
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:34,171
Age and love are not something
to worry about.

230
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:37,611
Meizuo, do you still like Caina?

231
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:40,891
She's a goddess, indeed.
You can worship her if you want.

232
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:43,851
But don't forget the ordinary humans
around you.

233
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:47,411
Ximen.

234
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:50,331
True love requires responsibility.

235
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:55,211
When it's necessary,
you have to make sacrifices

236
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:56,851
for that person's future.

237
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:01,731
In the 20 years I've known you,

238
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:04,051
this is the first time you've used
the word, "sacrifice."

239
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:07,011
Caina is really incredible.

240
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:08,851
She taught you about sacrifice.

241
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:18,371
I have to go now.

242
00:16:30,331 --> 00:16:32,731
Hey, handsome. It's boring to drink alone.

243
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:34,611
Do you want to have drinks together?

244
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:38,411
Sorry. I can't today. Maybe next time.

245
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:07,971
DAOMING SI

246
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:15,891
<i>I wonder what he's doing now.</i>

247
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:19,011
<i>I want to see him but I can't.</i>

248
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:23,211
<i>It was better when we weren't
officially dating.</i>

249
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:27,491
<i>No.</i>

250
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:31,451
<i>What am I doing?
Why am I thinking about nonsense again?</i>

251
00:17:45,371 --> 00:17:46,411
DAOMING SI

252
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,691
DAOMING SI

253
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:05,891
Hello? Shancai.

254
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:10,891
<i>Hello? Shancai.
Why aren't you saying anything?</i>

255
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:14,251
<i>-Who is it?
</i>-What's the matter?

256
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:17,371
I'm going there now.

257
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:24,651
<i>The thief didn't succeed tonight.
He might strike again.</i>

258
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:27,051
<i>If there's anything suspicious,
call the police immediately.</i>

259
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:29,971
<i>Of course, we'll tighten
our security around the area too.</i>

260
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,611
<i>Please lock your doors.</i>

261
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:11,611
Call the police.

262
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:13,651
Call the police if anything happens.

263
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:17,091
Where's my phone?

264
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:19,171
My phone.

265
00:19:22,771 --> 00:19:25,531
<i>What's happening? Is the thief back?</i>

266
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,011
<i>He's so smug.</i>

267
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:31,811
<i>All right.</i>

268
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,131
<i>I'll punish him. I'll destroy him.</i>

269
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:02,611
Hey.

270
00:20:03,731 --> 00:20:05,371
Why are you so violent?

271
00:20:06,011 --> 00:20:06,971
Daoming Si?

272
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:15,331
Are you thinking clearly now?

273
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:19,131
It's the middle of the night.

274
00:20:19,571 --> 00:20:20,731
Why are you here?

275
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,131
Silly girl. You had me worried.

276
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:53,531
If I catch that thief,
I'd surely cut him in half.

277
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:57,251
It's a good thing you're here.

278
00:20:58,331 --> 00:20:59,891
I feel safe now.

279
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:06,811
I'll find you a nice place.

280
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,611
Don't stay in such a dangerous
area anymore.

281
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:10,531
There's no need.

282
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:13,211
Even though it's nothing great,

283
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:15,611
but it's my house.

284
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:18,611
I want to live here no matter what.

285
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,771
Thank you, Daoming Si.

286
00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:24,131
Who lives next to you?

287
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,211
Nobody, it's empty.

288
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:29,811
Don't worry.

289
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:37,491
Do you want to stay at my house tonight?

290
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:40,691
There's no need. I'll just stay here.

291
00:21:40,771 --> 00:21:42,811
Okay. I'll stay with you then.

292
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:43,771
No.

293
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:45,571
You can't sleep here. Go home.

294
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:47,531
Why? It's not like
we haven't done this before.

295
00:21:47,611 --> 00:21:49,251
No. Go home.

296
00:21:50,731 --> 00:21:52,291
Go home and sleep there.

297
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:53,891
Are you sure?

298
00:21:53,971 --> 00:21:55,331
-Go home.
-I'm worried about you.

299
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:56,251
I'll be fine.

300
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:57,531
-Don't worry.
-Are you sure?

301
00:21:57,611 --> 00:21:58,731
-I'm sure.
-Lock the door.

302
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:00,931
Okay. All right.

303
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:51,091
What are you planning to do?

304
00:22:51,211 --> 00:22:53,931
If the thief comes again,
wouldn't it be dangerous?

305
00:22:54,811 --> 00:22:57,051
What did Daoming Si say?
He must be really worried.

306
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:58,291
Yes.

307
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,171
So?

308
00:23:01,651 --> 00:23:06,251
He asked me to go with him
and sleep at his house.

309
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:08,531
But how can I do that?

310
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:11,131
Why not? He's your boyfriend.

311
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:13,491
That is true,

312
00:23:13,931 --> 00:23:15,371
-but...
-Shancai.

313
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:18,211
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it with Daoming Si?

314
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,171
-Done what?
-Have sex.

315
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:26,611
Xiaoyou, what are you saying?

316
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:28,091
You haven't?

317
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:32,891
I thought liking someone means
giving him everything you can, right?

318
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:35,611
I think it's a natural thing.

319
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:38,091
Xiaoyou.

320
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:42,971
This topic is too much for me.
I can't take it.

321
00:23:43,971 --> 00:23:46,851
Shancai, you're the innocent type.
I'm not.

322
00:23:47,851 --> 00:23:49,011
How can you not be that type?

323
00:23:50,051 --> 00:23:51,411
I'm different now.

324
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:53,051
I'm not the old Jiang Xiaoyou anymore.

325
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,491
Now, I'm full of fighting spirit.

326
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,171
Xiaoyou.

327
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:02,451
I'm very scared of your fighting spirit.

328
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:05,211
What did Ximen do to you?

329
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,251
Hello?

330
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:18,811
<i>Do you want to come over?</i>

331
00:24:21,131 --> 00:24:21,971
Okay.

332
00:24:29,131 --> 00:24:32,171
Shancai, something came up. I have to go.

333
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:35,331
If our boss asks, just tell her I'm off.

334
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:36,771
Why so sudden?

335
00:24:37,771 --> 00:24:40,171
-Okay, go. I'll take care of this.
-Okay.

336
00:24:53,971 --> 00:24:54,851
Shancai.

337
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:59,451
Do you think this lipstick color suits me?

338
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:07,611
I think this suits you better.

339
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,091
Okay. I'll use the Coral Fauve color then.

340
00:25:11,491 --> 00:25:13,851
This lipstick brand
is very popular lately.

341
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:26,531
Do I look strange?

342
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:30,051
Not really.

343
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:32,171
-But--
-Shancai, let's talk next time.

344
00:25:32,251 --> 00:25:33,611
I'll get going. Bye.

345
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:41,091
Shancai.

346
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:44,291
Isn't the weather really nice today?
Even the air smells sweet.

347
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:47,971
I really like it.

348
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,971
I'm so happy today.

349
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:52,211
Hey, Xiaoyou.

350
00:25:53,731 --> 00:25:56,851
Don't you want to get changed first?

351
00:25:58,411 --> 00:25:59,251
That's right.

352
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:07,931
<i>Is it because of the lipstick?</i>

353
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:13,331
<i>I think Xiaoyou seems really happy
and pretty today.</i>

354
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:17,971
<i>The air around her
seems to be a light pink hue.</i>

355
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:20,251
<i>It seems like she's floating.</i>

356
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:36,331
Si has a bad temper and can be rash.

357
00:26:37,211 --> 00:26:38,291
But he's all right.

358
00:26:40,411 --> 00:26:42,171
Shancai is the same.

359
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:46,971
Maybe Shancai can only date Si.

360
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:50,891
That's right. They really suit each other.

361
00:26:59,811 --> 00:27:01,851
We've only been talking
about Si and Shancai.

362
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:03,571
Shouldn't we talk about us?

363
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:08,611
All right.

364
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:14,571
How's the milk tea shop doing?

365
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:19,691
Not bad.

366
00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:22,371
Do you have any new drinks lately?

367
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:25,131
Yes, it's called...

368
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:27,771
It's called...

369
00:27:30,611 --> 00:27:31,451
It's fine.

370
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,491
I'll just go and try it some time.

371
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:43,571
Miss, "You're Most Beautiful Tonight."

372
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:48,971
That's the name of this dessert.
This gentleman ordered it for you.

373
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:54,771
Don't hesitate.

374
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:56,211
Open it.

375
00:28:07,251 --> 00:28:08,691
1573.

376
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:14,051
Does it mean "Our feelings are so true"?

377
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:18,331
No.

378
00:28:19,091 --> 00:28:20,331
That's my room number.

379
00:28:50,451 --> 00:28:53,411
<i>That's strange.
I thought nobody's staying next door.</i>

380
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:55,851
<i>Did someone move in?</i>

381
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:10,611
<i>He's so clumsy.</i>

382
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:12,731
<i>The key is still in the door.</i>

383
00:29:21,651 --> 00:29:23,971
Hello. Is anybody home?

384
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:27,131
I'm Dong Shancai from next door.

385
00:29:27,491 --> 00:29:29,771
You left your key in the door.

386
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:38,211
Is anybody home?

387
00:29:50,771 --> 00:29:51,851
I didn't forget it.

388
00:29:52,611 --> 00:29:53,811
I left it especially for you.

389
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:57,131
Why are you here?

390
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,411
I rented this place.

391
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:03,371
What?

392
00:30:04,131 --> 00:30:05,491
You're staying next door?

393
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:07,811
I'm on a secret mission.

394
00:30:08,011 --> 00:30:10,011
-I need an empty house.
-Secret--

395
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:43,651
I'm protecting a very precious little pig.

396
00:30:44,331 --> 00:30:46,531
She might be attacked anytime.

397
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,371
I have to protect her in secret.

398
00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:50,851
Who's a pig?

399
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:52,891
I didn't say it was you.
Why are you so mad?

400
00:30:57,611 --> 00:30:59,131
There are so many empty houses.

401
00:30:59,251 --> 00:31:00,771
Why are you renting the one next door?

402
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:03,091
The location is good.
It's very convenient.

403
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:08,851
If your family finds out,
then will the mission fail?

404
00:31:08,971 --> 00:31:09,971
Don't worry.

405
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,731
The landlady won't speak a word.

406
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:14,171
How come?

407
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:15,971
Did you stuff her mouth with cloth?

408
00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:18,011
You're really a very stupid pig.

409
00:31:18,091 --> 00:31:19,811
I have my ways.

410
00:31:21,411 --> 00:31:23,371
Money. I'm sure you used money.

411
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:24,971
You're exactly the type.

412
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:26,771
Or did you threaten her?

413
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:28,651
Can you let me finish first?

414
00:31:29,011 --> 00:31:30,011
Listen.

415
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:32,811
Your boyfriend is so handsome.

416
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:35,811
She fell for my charms, of course.

417
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:37,531
That's why she rented the house to me.

418
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:40,691
So? Do you feel proud?

419
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:43,011
This handsome guy
is not just your boyfriend.

420
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:44,611
He's even your neighbor now.

421
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,131
Why are you renting such a small house?

422
00:31:48,811 --> 00:31:51,931
If I'm a very stupid pig,
you're the stupidest pig ever!

423
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,251
Are you crazy?

424
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,611
Don't rent the place anymore.

425
00:31:55,971 --> 00:31:59,971
When the stupid pig encounters danger,
I have to be there right away.

426
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:01,411
Don't you get it?

427
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:05,451
<i>Of course I know
that you're worried about me.</i>

428
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:07,891
<i>That's why you rented the place next door.</i>

429
00:32:08,811 --> 00:32:12,851
<i>But this type of move is too shocking.</i>

430
00:32:15,091 --> 00:32:16,371
Why are you staring at me?

431
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:18,931
Your boyfriend is really handsome, right?

432
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:26,051
You and your landlady
seem to have similar tastes.

433
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:09,371
Would you like a drink?

434
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:44,011
Do you need a shower first?

435
00:34:04,531 --> 00:34:05,411
Relax.

436
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:39,371
<i>I wonder if Daoming Si
is already sleeping.</i>

437
00:35:05,931 --> 00:35:07,211
<i>The ceiling's so low.</i>

438
00:35:07,571 --> 00:35:09,371
<i>There's a damp smell in here.</i>

439
00:35:10,211 --> 00:35:12,171
<i>How can it be comfortable to stay here?</i>

440
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:18,931
<i>So Shancai grew up
in this kind of environment.</i>

441
00:35:24,611 --> 00:35:26,651
<i>So now we're the same.</i>

442
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:30,331
<i>I'm also breathing the air
Shancai's breathing.</i>

443
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:50,971
<i>All the challenges we faced
didn't break us apart,</i>

444
00:35:51,731 --> 00:35:53,331
<i>but pulled us closer instead.</i>

445
00:35:55,091 --> 00:35:57,051
<i>Do people really place more value</i>

446
00:35:57,931 --> 00:35:59,971
<i>on a love that was once lost
then found again?</i>

447
00:36:25,171 --> 00:36:26,731
<i>Should I go to Shancai's place now?</i>

448
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:38,851
<i>Never mind. It's already late.</i>

449
00:36:39,251 --> 00:36:40,771
<i>She'll get the wrong idea again.</i>

450
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:42,651
<i>She'll think I want to do
something with her.</i>

451
00:36:55,811 --> 00:36:57,651
<i>Actually, I really do.</i>

452
00:37:17,531 --> 00:37:20,651
<i>I thought I had to force myself
to enter his world.</i>

453
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:25,651
<i>I never thought he'd be willing
to come into my world.</i>

454
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:29,411
<i>I'm so touched.</i>

455
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:32,691
<i>I want to go there now and tell him that.</i>

456
00:37:34,691 --> 00:37:35,971
<i>But...</i>

457
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:39,011
<i>if I really knocked on his door,</i>

458
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:43,851
<i>will he think that I'm a very easy girl?</i>

459
00:38:21,491 --> 00:38:22,731
Don't force yourself.

460
00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:24,891
You're not that type of girl.

461
00:38:29,411 --> 00:38:31,651
I'm not interested in a girl
that's shaking all over.

462
00:38:37,451 --> 00:38:38,851
Treasure yourself.

463
00:38:41,931 --> 00:38:43,331
I treasure...

464
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:47,811
I treasure my feelings for you,
that's why I came here with you.

465
00:38:53,091 --> 00:38:54,291
As long as it makes you happy,

466
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:57,411
I'm willing to do anything.

467
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:06,251
It's normal to be nervous the first time.

468
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:08,011
Please don't mind it.

469
00:39:08,811 --> 00:39:10,491
I won't be nervous again next time.

470
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:12,371
Ximen.

471
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:16,331
Please give me some time
and have patience.

472
00:39:19,811 --> 00:39:21,331
I originally just wanted to scare you.

473
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:24,491
I never thought
you'd be willing to go through it.

474
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:27,811
You're not the Xiaoyou I know at all.

475
00:39:29,091 --> 00:39:31,771
But why can't people
who like each other be together?

476
00:39:41,531 --> 00:39:44,411
Xiaoyou, are you sure you want to do this?

477
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:49,331
I can go through with it.

478
00:39:50,131 --> 00:39:50,971
And then what?

479
00:39:55,131 --> 00:40:00,211
But I'll surely regret it
if I don't follow my heart.

480
00:40:04,971 --> 00:40:07,531
There's always regret in love.

481
00:40:09,411 --> 00:40:12,251
So you also had regrets in love?

482
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:13,691
That's none of your business.

483
00:40:16,251 --> 00:40:18,811
Asking about other people's privacy
is very impolite.

484
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,451
I've already paid for the room.

485
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:30,251
You can stay to watch the view or leave.

486
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:31,691
It's up to you.

487
00:40:32,811 --> 00:40:33,651
Ximen.

488
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:11,251
Why can't people
who like each other be together?

489

<i>Why can't people

490
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:17,931
