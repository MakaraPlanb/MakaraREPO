1
00:00:01,286 --> 00:00:02,966
<i>I shouldn't keep it from Daoming Si.</i>

2
00:00:03,526 --> 00:00:05,726
<i>I should tell him.</i>

3
00:00:09,206 --> 00:00:10,166
Daoming Si.

4
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,806
-There's something I want to tell you.
-Wait.

5
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:16,966
I don't want to hear it.

6
00:00:17,326 --> 00:00:20,366
Every time you talk to me seriously,
it's never good.

7
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:23,246
It's very important.

8
00:00:24,126 --> 00:00:25,806
-It's--
-I don't care. I'm not listening.

9
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,046
-No. I'm not listening.
-Hey.

10
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:27,966
I'm not listening.

11
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:31,246
You graduated kindergarten 20 years ago.
Why are you acting like a three-year-old?

12
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:33,006
And you're acting like an old lady.

13
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:36,686
We're alone here.
But you just keep frowning.

14
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,246
There you go again.

15
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,486
Always making me nervous with those words.

16
00:00:42,046 --> 00:00:42,926
Who?

17
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,446
There's only the two of us here.

18
00:00:56,126 --> 00:00:57,006
Hey.

19
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:01,886
How did you become a good kisser?

20
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:05,526
Didn't you say
you haven't dated anyone before?

21
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:14,526
All right.

22
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:17,046
Let me be honest with you.

23
00:01:17,926 --> 00:01:19,006
Back then,

24
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:21,846
I used to go out partying with Ximen.

25
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:24,766
But it was a long time ago.

26
00:01:26,846 --> 00:01:29,926
Going out with Ximen and Meizuo
always involves lots of girls.

27
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:33,006
Those girls made a move on me.

28
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:34,526
I didn't mind.

29
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:37,686
Of course.

30
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:41,646
Those were the things I did in the past.

31
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:43,726
I've stopped doing them now.

32
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:47,966
Really?

33
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,126
What's wrong?

34
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:52,046
That was a long time ago.

35
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:00,326
Are you jealous?

36
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:03,366
Don't be so full of yourself.

37
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:05,726
I don't care how many girls
you've flirted with.

38
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:07,526
You're jealous.

39
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:10,046
-Yes!
-I told you I'm not.

40
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:14,846
It's good to be jealous.
What's wrong with that? Go ahead.

41
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:16,846
You're so childish.

42
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,646
You don't know what happened today.

43
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,046
I was followed by your bodyguards.

44
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:28,926
I was forced to hide,

45
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,886
and I couldn't go home.

46
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:34,286
Good thing Meizuo helped me.

47
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:37,166
I was terrified.

48
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:39,646
You wouldn't even listen to me.

49
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:42,766
-My bodyguards?
-Yes.

50
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:46,006
-Why didn't you immediately tell me?
-What's the point of telling you?

51
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,646
This is something we should face together.

52
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:50,486
Who would you tell if not me?

53
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:54,326
It would only complicate things
if I told you.

54
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:57,206
Your mom would find out even earlier.

55
00:02:58,406 --> 00:03:00,566
Even Meizuo felt that you'd make it worse.

56
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:06,966
I didn't want to tell you.

57
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:08,926
But I don't want to keep it from you.

58
00:03:13,606 --> 00:03:16,406
That's why I don't want to date in secret.

59
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:22,006
Because I'm not aware of the decisions
you make without me.

60
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:30,686
Hello?

61
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:31,726
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

62
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:34,566
<i>Your bodyguards are looking for you.
I let them in.</i>

63
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:36,646
Why did you turn off--

64
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:51,766
Nobody knows me better than my mom.
So I'm the only one who can protect you.

65
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,246
-But--
-Stop hesitating. Go to London with me.

66
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:00,326
How can we go to London now?

67
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,686
Maybe Qinghe and Xiaoyou's families
are already in trouble

68
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:04,286
before I could even leave.

69
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:06,966
I can't just leave them and run away.

70
00:04:10,326 --> 00:04:13,046
This is the only door that's locked.
He should be in there.

71
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:14,726
What should we do?

72
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:18,326
We'll be exposed.
They'll get in here soon.

73
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:21,406
Are there any other exits?

74
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:24,246
If I'm not mistaken,
there's a window in the bathroom.

75
00:04:24,326 --> 00:04:25,326
Let's go.

76
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:39,126
Hurry up!

77
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:46,966
Move faster.

78
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,686
The president said we're inefficient.
We can't even find Si.

79
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:52,286
Break down the door.

80
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:03,086
May I ask what you're doing?

81
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:06,646
Washing my hair.

82
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:08,486
Can't you see?

83
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:10,566
But why are you wearing your clothes?

84
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,366
I do it my way.

85
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:15,406
Do I need to explain to you
how I wash my hair?

86
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,366
You bunch of idiots.

87
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:21,206
How dare you interfere with my plans.

88
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:23,086
If this happens again,

89
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,246
I'll beat you up until you cry
to your mothers!

90
00:05:28,753 --> 00:05:30,836
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

91
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:34,159
METEOR GARDEN

92
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:41,347
EPISODE 34

93
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,486
What happened?

94
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,366
Why are you so pissed?

95
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:12,646
Who made you angry?

96
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:16,526
She always treats her son like a criminal.

97
00:06:16,606 --> 00:06:19,006
And I had to force Shancai
to run away without her shoes.

98
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,606
Were you doing naughty things?

99
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:28,686
Of course not.

100
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,406
What are you thinking, old woman?

101
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:33,366
As if my mom is not bad enough,
now you sound just like her.

102
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:48,726
My mom asked them to follow me.

103
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:50,806
They're on to Shancai too.

104
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:53,646
We almost got caught.

105
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:55,926
It seems

106
00:06:56,686 --> 00:06:58,446
your mom is getting anxious.

107
00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:04,006
She did the same things to Zhuang before.

108
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:07,846
I know.

109
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:10,086
But Mrs. Yu,

110
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:14,486
what happened to my sister's boyfriend?

111
00:07:19,326 --> 00:07:23,246
He couldn't take your mom's threats
and ran away.

112
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,366
After that happened,

113
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:31,246
your mom locked Zhuang inside the house.

114
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:33,326
She refused to eat.

115
00:07:35,686 --> 00:07:38,766
So I secretly let her go.

116
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:42,566
I hoped she could be happy from then on.

117
00:07:47,246 --> 00:07:48,606
<i>I never thought...</i>

118
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:13,686
ONE MESSAGE RECEIVED

119
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:16,166
<i>Sorry. I won't see you again.</i>

120
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:17,606
<i>Let's break up.</i>

121
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:25,566
<i>That person wasn't
where they agreed to meet up.</i>

122
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:29,366
<i>Instead, he contacted your mom</i>

123
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:32,366
<i>to take Zhuang home.</i>

124
00:08:33,486 --> 00:08:34,886
Ms. Zhuang, let's go home.

125
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,510
Where's that scum right now?

126
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,110
What a useless coward.

127
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,630
He doesn't deserve her!

128
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,630
What worries me the most

129
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,350
was that Zhuang acted normal
during the day,

130
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,630
but always cried herself to sleep.

131
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,430
She faked her smiles

132
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,510
and prepared for a wedding
that she didn't wish for.

133
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,550
She got married soon afterward.

134
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,230
And you already know

135
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,150
what happened next.

136
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,390
Yes.

137
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,190
Who could take

138
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,190
my mom's methods?

139
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,550
Good thing it's all over now.

140
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,310
Don't you think Zhuang is doing well now?

141
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,750
Is she?

142
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,070
Is it good to feel helpless?

143
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,030
Is it good to be

144
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,150
at the mercy of others?

145
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,030
If that's the definition of good,
isn't that really sad?

146
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,670
At that time, my sister
lost the reason to hold on.

147
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,150
She was betrayed by the man she loved.

148
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,150
Si.

149
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,270
Your sister

150
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,710
doesn't blame that person.

151
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,270
So if someday

152
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,110
Shancai gives up on me too,

153
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,830
should I also just accept it?

154
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,270
There were many times

155
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,470
when I thought I'd really lose her.

156
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,990
What are you doing?

157
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,070
How irresponsible.

158
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,550
If Shancai leaves you,

159
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,710
it's definitely not because of your mom.

160
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,710
It's because you gave up so easily.

161
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,750
Stop talking nonsense.

162
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,790
Facing so much restriction and misery
is not easy, you know?

163
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,510
Then you should hold on even more.

164
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,870
I did.

165
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,030
But...

166
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,950
what if I'm the only one holding on?

167
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,590
No matter how much I care for her

168
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,790
and love her,

169
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,430
does she feel the same?

170
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,990
What if Shancai...

171
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,510
What if Shancai gives up on me?

172
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,110
Are you scared?

173
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,110
But this time,

174
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,470
I was really worried that you were scared.

175
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,710
Shancai's not confident

176
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,430
because you're not confident.

177
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,950
Shancai's not at peace because she feels
that you're not at peace.

178
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,110
People's feelings

179
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,870
influence each other.

180
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,110
Nobody knows

181
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,030
what would happen in the future.

182
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,470
But the harder it gets,

183
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,990
the more you should support Shancai.

184
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,950
As long as your hearts
are closely connected,

185
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,070
you'd surely be able
to overcome this together.

186
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,350
I hope the both of you

187
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,030
can be happy.

188
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,630

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,390
YES

191
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,870
<i>Did you get hurt?</i>

192
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,430
<i>Use voice message.
I want to hear your voice.</i>

193
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,150
I'm not hurt.

194
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,070
I'm fine.

195
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,390
How about you?

196
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,510
Daoming Si.

197
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,830
Sorry.

198
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,550
I should've told you earlier.

199
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,030
If you don't reply, I'll come see you now.

200
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,550
<i>If you don't reply, I'll come see you now.</i>

201
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,510
<i>I'm home. I didn't get hurt.</i>

202
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,390
<i>What are you doing?</i>

203
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,870
<i>I took care of what happened today.</i>

204
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,870
<i>Don't think about it anymore.</i>

205
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,590
Is my shoe with you?

206
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,310
<i>Yes.</i>

207
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,710
Then remember to bring it tomorrow.

208
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,510
And...

209
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,910
<i>Thank you.</i>

211
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,710
-Shancai.
-Yes?

212
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,390
I really can't do it without you.

213
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,790
I'm Wonder Woman. I'm strong.

214
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,830
Shancai.

215
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,430
Sorry.

216
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,150
I almost forgot.

217
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,310
You, Ximen and Meizuo
planned to trick me yesterday.

218
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,830
It was all my fault.

219
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,270
I didn't know you'd care about me
so much that...

220
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,870
Sorry.

221
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,030
It's all right.

222
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,150
That's just how they are.

223
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,070
I couldn't say no to Ximen.

224
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,870
I told you it's all right.

225
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,150
Don't worry about it.

226
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,270
What's the matter?

227
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,510
Did something happen with Ximen yesterday?

228
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,830
What did he do to you?

229
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,270
Nothing. We just had some coffee.

230
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,030
-Just coffee?
-Yes.

231
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,110
All right.

232
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,870
But stay away from Ximen.
Don't let your guard down.

233
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,070
Why? I don't want to.

234
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,870
I want to get closer to him
and understand him better.

235
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,510
Wait.

236
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,990
Wait, Xiaoyou. Are you serious?

237
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,990
You really like Ximen?

238
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,150
He's a dangerous, frivolous,
and flirtatious guy.

239
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,350
Don't say that about him.

240
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,110
Sorry.

241
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,150
But are you serious?

242
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,390
Yes.

243
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,750
I never thought I'd have feelings for him.

244
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,630
But what can I do?

245
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,910
I feel like I'm liking him more and more.

246
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,150
<i>I'm so shocked.</i>

247
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,830
<i>This is the first time
I'm seeing Xiaoyou with that expression.</i>

248
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,870
<i>While I'm busy worrying about my problems,</i>

249
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,070
<i>my best friend has fallen
for other F4 members.</i>

250
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,110
<i>I didn't even notice it.</i>

251
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,510
Xiaoyou.

252
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,670
I'm happy that you like someone.

253
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,150
But it's Ximen.

254
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,830
You'll get hurt because of him.

255
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,190
I see him with different girls
every single day.

256
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,350
He's a playboy, you know?

257
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,790
-I know.
-You know...

258
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,670
You know, yet...

259
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,470
I'm not his type.

260
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,990
But I just happen to like him
and I can't even explain it.

261
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,190
I know I'll get hurt,

262
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,270
but I like being around him.

<i>Hello?</i>

-Well...
<i>-What?</i>

00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,750
I...

272
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,670
Did you bring my shoe?

273
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,790
<i>I did.</i>

274
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,190
Okay. Thank you.

275
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,030
-That's it. Bye.
<i>-Hold on.</i>

276
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,310
<i>How do I give it to you?</i>

277
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,470
Right. How would you give it to me?

278
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,110
Look on your right side.

279
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,030
<i>Right side, stupid girl!</i>

280
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,870
The next time you call me,
can you not dance first?

281
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,070
Because you look so funny.

282
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,270
Why are you here?

283
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,830
To return your shoe.

284
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,390
That's just an excuse.
Actually, I want to see you.

285
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,430
<i>I can't stop Xiaoyou.</i>

286
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,150
<i>Because I know better than anyone</i>

287
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,950
<i>that you can't control your feelings.</i>

288
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,990
<i>This is the power of love.</i>

289
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,670
Thank you.

290
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,750
Hey, can you put your phone down now?

291
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,470
So you're off work already?

292
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,550
Yes. Xiaoyou just left.

293
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,310
Wait.

294
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,550
What if they found you here?

295
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,510
Don't worry.

296
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,510
I'm in disguise.

297
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,630
You call that a disguise?

298
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,950
Didn't you notice how much attention
you've attracted?

299
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,630
Stop talking nonsense. Where are we going?

300
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,350
So this is the place you said

301
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,430
we can talk quietly?

302
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,310
How would I know it'd turn out this way?

303
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,390
Or are you

304
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,910
hinting something?

305
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,830
Yeah, right! You think too much.

306
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,830
All right.

307
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,230
What a shame.

308
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,190
Let's go somewhere else.

309
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,830
Why? Do you have something to tell me?

310
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,510
I want to tell you

311
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,230
that I didn't keep anything
from you on purpose.

312
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,270
Initially, I didn't want to mention

313
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,630
that I was followed by your bodyguards
because I meant well.

314
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,630
You did? I'm not sure about that.

315
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,030
-You don't believe me?
-That's not the issue.

316
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,630
Then what's the issue?

317
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,110
I love you.

318
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,590
Why did you suddenly say that?

319
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,390
How about you?
I want to know how you really feel.

320
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,750
-I told you I want to be with you.
-That's not enough.

321
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,590
How is it not enough?

322
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,870
I want it to be clearer.

323
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,430
I don't want vague answers.

324
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,790
I want to clearly confirm
that you really want to be with me.

325
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,110
Why is it still vague to you?

326
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,990
Which part of it do you not understand?

327
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,670
I'm not sure what the fuss is about.

328
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,710
You never told me that you love me.

329
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,910
I feel very uncertain.

330
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,590
Like you'd leave me anytime.

331
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,270
I've been waiting all this time.

332
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,790
But it seems like
you don't plan to say it.

333
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,150
Do you really have to force me
to tell you this?

334
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,510
How stupid can you get?

335
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,830
<i>Turns out Daoming Si wants me
to tell him clearly.</i>

336
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,630
<i>He thinks my answers are vague.</i>

337
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,310
<i>He wants everything to be clear.</i>

338
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,870
That's really nice.

339
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,270
I admire you.

340
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,350
There you go again.

341
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,350
You get on my nerves
every time you speak nonsense.

342
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,950
Hello? What is it?

343
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,350
<i>It's just a simple line.</i>

344
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,510
<i>"I love you."</i>

345
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,350
<i>Why do I always mess it up
when the timing is right?</i>

346
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,910
Okay, no problem.

347
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,190
Shancai?

348
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,950
All right. Cut the crap.

349
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,950
Bye.

350
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,990
Who was it? Why did you mention my name?

351
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,950
Ximen said he'll throw
a National Tea Tasting Party

352
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,950
at his house.

353
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,270
You're invited.

354
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,070
National Tea Tasting Party?

355
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,910
Your friend is invited as well.

356
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,430
Xiaoyou?

357
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,270
Will Ximen be there?

358
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,070
The party is at his house.
What do you expect?

359
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,590
So? Are you going or not?

360
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,230
Of course!

361
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,150
But...

362
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,030
let's go separately.

363
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,550
Haven't we already agreed?

364
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,350
When did you two become familiar
with the Way of Tea?

365
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,710
We were exposed to it
since we were little.

366
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,830
I see.

367
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,990
What do you think about the tea culture?

368
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,430
Because of my good friend, Ximen,

369
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,950
I can call myself a tea expert.

370
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,310
Whether it's green tea, black tea,
semi-fermented tea, or dark tea,

371
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,150
I know them well.

372
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,870
What kind of tea do you personally like?

373
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,950
Assam black tea because it's quite unique.

374
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,270
It has a rich and strong taste.
Its aroma is very pure.

375
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,750
You can enjoy it with milk.

376
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,870
So I think

377
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,230
it's quite special to drink that at home.

378
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,110
-I think everyone should try it.
-Any other recommendations?

379
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,790
Shancai, you're here.

380
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,630
You're so late. We're all waiting for you.

381
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,030
Where are the others?

382
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,510
They changed into cheongsams.
Aren't you going to change too?

383
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,710
Cheongsam?

384
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,110
Is that necessary?
I've never worn one before.

385
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,710
Maybe because green tea is lighter?

386
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,550
The lightness is not the problem. It's...

387
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,030
If you don't know how to wear it,
ask the expert.

388
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,470
Expert?

389
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,350
He's inside.

390
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,830
I don't think I can do it.

391
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,990
It's all right. Leave it to me.

392
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,910
Don't move! Ximen, stop!

393
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,150
You're here.

394
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,390
What are you doing?

395
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,590
I was helping her put it on.

396
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,470
Did it look like
I'm unbuttoning her dress?

397
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,870
What do you think?

398
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,990
Anyone who sees this will think you're...

399
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,390
Shancai, you're really funny.

400
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,030
I'm serious.

401
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,070
Why did she need your help
to button her up?

402
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,590
The cheongsam requires a pair
of patient and skillful hands.

403
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,670
In tea ceremonies,
I'd help ladies in their preparations,

404
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,550
so that they'll look their best.

405
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,710
Shancai.

406
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,310
I don't look good
in this cheongsam, right?

407
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,910
Nonsense.

408
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,310
I prepared this cheongsam just for you.

409
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,750
It fits you well.

410
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:54,190
But isn't cheongsam usually worn
by women with very good figures?

411
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,670
My figure doesn't compliment
this cheongsam.

412
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,910
The only problem is your confidence.

413
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,790
Lack of confidence decreases your charm.

414
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,710
The cheongsam is not for just
one type of woman.

415
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,510
Every woman who wears it
has their own charms.

416
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,790
So you're the cheongsam expert
they were referring to?

417
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,750
Of course. Don't I look like it?

418
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,990
What?

419
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,710
You should go change too.

420
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,550
But experts can also make mistakes

421
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,270
since the cheongsam

422
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,510
cannot be worn by frogs.

423
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,950
You...

424
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,430
Ximen.

425
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,310
Do you usually hold such gatherings?

426
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,910
After graduation,
I rarely hold it like I used to.

427
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,750
However, your waist is really big.

428
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,230
What do you want me to do?
I'm a frog with a big waist. So what?

429
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,310
Don't worry. Si likes you no matter what.

430
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,110
Ximen.

431
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,150
Can you promise me one thing?

432
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,990
What is it?

433
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,870
I want to talk

434
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,910
-about you and Xiaoyou--
-If we're alone too long,

435
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,030
Si won't be happy about it.

436
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,470
Why would he be unhappy?

437
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,150
Hey.

438
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,470
Don't I look handsome?

439
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,950
You look like a waiter in Hengdian.

440
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,550
How could you say that?

441
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,670
You look like you sell pork buns
in tea houses.

442
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,310
Si, aren't you getting Shancai a drink?

443
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,110
Can't she get it herself?

444
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,830
Fine feathers make you look fine.

445
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,990
Fine feathers make fine birds.

446
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,190
Did you purposely say it wrong?

447
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,430
I was complimenting you.

448
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,870
Stupid girl. Don't you get it?

449
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,470
I look hideous in cheongsam.
That's not funny at all.

450
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,310
Then you don't have a sense of humor.

451
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,830
Stop staring, or I'll kill you.

452
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,950
You two are so sweet.

453
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,870
I'm so jealous.

454
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,990
What? We're not.

455
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,630
Gotcha.

456
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,670
Hey, Li Zhen, you too...

457
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,350
Fight some more.

458
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,630
Don't be ridiculous.

459
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,270
It's fun to see Si and Shancai argue.

460
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,510
That's right. It's not any fun otherwise.

461
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,830
All right. We're all here.
Let's start the party!

462
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,630
Yes!

463
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,230
Yes!

464
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,790
Come on. Two, three.

465
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,190
Come on.

466
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:25,190
Drink.

467
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,030
All right.

468
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,510
-Okay. Again.
-Okay. Again.

469
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,230
Drink.

470
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,430
-Drink.
-No. Another round.

471
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,310
-Why do I always lose?
-Drink.

472
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,710
-You drank all these.
-Yes.

473
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,190
-You're not drinking?
-That's enough.

474
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,110
You drank too much.

475
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,990
Daoming Si.

476
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,830
-What should we do?
-About what?

477
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,870
Everyone's worried about us.

478
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,190
They're so sincere.

479
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,710
Yet I've been keeping things from them.

480
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,670
Sorry.

481
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,270
I'm too weak.

482
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,230
<i>Daoming Si should know
that this relationship needs commitment.</i>

483
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,670
<i>I should have made it clear to him
long ago, but I never had the chance.</i>

484
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,430
<i>Should I do it now?</i>

485
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,750
I...

486
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,710
All this time,

487
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,670
I...

488
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,070
I love you.

489
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,350
I didn't say that, right?

490
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,150
I know.

491
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,950
Ximen.

492
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,630
I love you.

493
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,110
Thank you.

494
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,510
I love you too.

495
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,990
Ximen is going to break Xiaoyou's heart.

496
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,630
I'm serious.

497
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,070
I know.

498
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,670
Girls who make serious confessions
are beautiful.

499
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,910
You were quite beautiful earlier.

500
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,350
What is he talking about?

501
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,830
Shut up.

502
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,110
But why

503
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,790
are you saying this?

504
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,950
What do you want?

505
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,310
To go out on a date,

506
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,590
hug, or kiss?

507
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,030
Xiaoyou.

508
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,390
I think you've misunderstood.

509
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,950
I'm a good person,

510
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,310
but not a good man.

511
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,830
You should find a good man to protect you.

512
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,390
All right?

513
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:58,830
Why do you always pretend to act
like a bad guy in front of me?

514
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,670
-Why do you live this way?
-Xiaoyou.

515
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,910
Self-righteous girls

516
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,390
are a turn-off.

517
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,030
That guy is really crazy this time.

518
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,470
Xiaoyou.

519
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,310
Sorry.

520
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,470
I overheard you earlier.

521
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,750
It's so embarrassing.
You saw what happened.

522
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,190
I slapped Ximen earlier.

523
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,350
Turns out hitting someone

524
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,310
also hurts your own hand.

525
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,630
I have to do better.

526
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,150
What are you trying to say?

527
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,870
I think I understand Ximen more now.

528
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,350
I'll do better next time.

529
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,950
But didn't you get rejected earlier?

530
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,430
Shancai.

531
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,510
I hope you'll cheer for me.

532
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,190
Please.

533
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,270
You can do it.

534
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,550
It's a good thing.
I think Ximen's very honest.

535
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,510
Says who?

536
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:41,670
I usually can't tell
whether he's telling the truth or not.

537
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,670
He can reject her all he wants,
but why say such outrageous things?

538
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,830
He didn't flirt or date that girl first.

539
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,270
He rejected her directly.

540
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:54,270
If I didn't see it for myself,
I wouldn't believe it.

541
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,790
So you mean I should even thank him?

542
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,190
Tell your friend to give up.

543
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,070
-Or else, she'll get hurt.
-Don't jinx it.

544
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,230
It's true.

545
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,470
It's not possible for her and Ximen.

546
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,990
She's going to be more upset.

547
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,910
Aren't you worried for the same reason?

548
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,390
Hey.

549
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,070
Don't just think about other people.

550
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,910
Think about us too.

551
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,670
How long will we go on like this?

552
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,950
How long do I have to wait

553
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,590
for you to tell me what you truly feel?

554
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,750
Just...

555
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,790
wait a bit more.

556
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,390
Are you still the same person?

557
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,590
Lately, I feel

558
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,830
that you're not the Shancai
I've always liked anymore.

559
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,150
-It's not that easy.
-It is!

560
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,710
No.

561
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,590
If we tell everyone
about our relationship,

562
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,150
the lives of people around us
would change.

563
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,910
You won't understand.

564
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,070
There you go again.

565
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,950
You're always like this.

566
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,830
I don't understand.

567
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,950
So you do?

568
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,710
Then protect them on your own.

569
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,150
<i>He's right.</i>

570
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,230
<i>This is not like me at all.</i>

571
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,750
<i>I know that better than anyone.</i>

572
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,910
<i>But...</i>

573
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,950
Si, where are you going?

574
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,350
-Home.
-Home?

575
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,710
What?

576
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,750
Home? Who's going home?

577
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,350
It's late. I should get going too.

578
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,070
It's too late. It might be dangerous.

579
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:59,910
Just stay here.

580
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,910
Yes, just stay here.

581
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,470
We can have a sleepover tonight.

582
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,270
A sleepover.

583
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,670
-Si, stay here tonight too.
-No.

584
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,430
What happened?

585
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,230
Why do you suddenly want to go home?

586
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,310
-Nothing happened.
-I'm sure something did.

587
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,390
Shancai, what's going on with you two?

588
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,470
Why are you two so confused?

589
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,270
Daoming Si.

590
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,430
I love you.

591
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,830
Listen, everyone.

592
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,510
Daoming Si and I

593
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,470
have been dating for a while now.

594
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,710
Sorry that we kept it from you.

595
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,030
It's not strange that you're dating,

596
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,150
but did you just confess your feelings?

597
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,310
Yes.

598
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,830
Si, why are you still standing there?
Shancai confessed her feelings.

599
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,670
Aren't you going to do anything?

600
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,190
<i>I want to live like myself.</i>

601
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,390
<i>I finally said it.</i>

602
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,110
<i>Around the arms tightly holding me,</i>

603
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,630
<i>I can hear everyone's cheers.</i>

604
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,750
<i>This moment</i>

605
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,710
<i>is mine.</i>

606
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,630
<i>I cannot explain</i>

607
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,110
<i>how amazing it feels right now.</i>
