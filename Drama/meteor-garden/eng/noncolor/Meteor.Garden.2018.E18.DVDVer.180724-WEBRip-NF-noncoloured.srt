EPISODE 18

3
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:31,763
Ximen.

4
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:34,363
Isn't pleasing girls
one of the things you do best?

5
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,563
Pleasing girls is not the same

6
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:38,323
as apologizing for Si.

7
00:01:39,963 --> 00:01:42,763
Hey, guys. Are you guys looking for me?

8
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:45,083
-Where's Shancai?
-Shancai?

9
00:01:46,203 --> 00:01:47,683
She didn't come to our previous class.

10
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:50,363
I'm not sure what happened to her.

11
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:53,203
She's also not answering her phone.
That's not like her at all.

12
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,843
When was the last time you saw her?

13
00:01:57,043 --> 00:02:00,563
After class earlier,
she left with Shunping.

14
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,163
Shunping?

15
00:02:03,243 --> 00:02:05,403
Yes. He's our high school
classmate's brother, Zhibu.

16
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:08,843
I see. Let us know
when Shancai comes back, Xiaoqing.

17
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:10,883
Sure.

18
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:15,363
Don't call me Xiaoqing anymore.

19
00:02:27,643 --> 00:02:28,483
Hello?

20
00:02:28,843 --> 00:02:31,443
<i>Qinghe, didn't I tell you to call me
when Shancai gets back?</i>

21
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:32,683
<i>I've waited all afternoon.</i>

22
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:35,123
I didn't forget. Shancai
didn't come to class all afternoon.

23
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:38,323
And I couldn't reach her phone.
I'm not sure where she went.

24
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:40,283
<i>Come here now.</i>

25
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:42,123
Okay.

26
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:43,403
I'll be right over.

27
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:50,123
Shancai didn't come back
the whole afternoon.

28
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:52,323
That's so unlike her.

29
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:54,163
I think something happened.

30
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:57,643
Do you remember who Qinghe said
Shancai left with earlier?

31
00:02:58,123 --> 00:03:01,043
Apparently, the guy's name is Shunping.

32
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:02,643
I'll go ask the office about him.

33
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:12,803
-All right, Ximen.
-Hey.

34
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:14,323
Were you able to contact Shancai?

35
00:03:14,883 --> 00:03:17,403
Ximen called earlier
and said that Shunping

36
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:19,323
has dropped out of Mingde University.

37
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:25,123
But he came to see Shancai this morning.

38
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:28,003
I don't feel good about this.

39
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:31,043
You said that your high school classmate
is Shunping's brother.

40
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:32,163
Do you have his number?

41
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:34,363
Let me see.

42
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:37,003
Si's phone is turned off.

43
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:40,403
Yan Zhibu's phone is ringing.

44
00:03:42,443 --> 00:03:43,283
Hello?

45
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,923
Are you Yan Zhibu?

46
00:03:57,283 --> 00:03:58,923
-You're here.
-Mr. Liu, is Si home?

47
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:03,203
Si sits in the library
every time he comes home.

48
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:05,483
He doesn't look happy.

49
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:07,043
What does he do in there?

50
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:08,883
He checks the stock market

51
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:10,123
or reads books.

52
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:11,963
Or plays games or takes naps.

53
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:14,243
He doesn't want to speak to anyone.

54
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:48,883
Boss.

55
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:50,483
She's awake.

56
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:56,563
What are you doing?

57
00:04:57,803 --> 00:04:58,923
What are you doing?

58
00:05:04,683 --> 00:05:07,323
Stop struggling.
You won't be able to escape.

59
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:11,003
Boss.

60
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:12,403
Let's do it.

61
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:15,203
Be patient. Let's take her picture first.

62
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,003
Stop moving around.

63
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:30,443
Boss.

64
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,323
She doesn't look pitiful enough.

65
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:36,283
One more shot.

66
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:42,763
No. I don't think
now is the best time to sell it.

67
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:45,323
-I still want to wait. And tomorrow--
-Si.

68
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,643
-What's up? Did something happen?
-Why won't you answer your phone?

69
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,363
I'm not in the mood. What happened?

70
00:05:57,563 --> 00:05:58,643
Shancai's missing.

71
00:06:05,163 --> 00:06:06,003
Boss.

72
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:10,043
Shunping, you're here.

73
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:21,083
Boss.

74
00:06:21,403 --> 00:06:22,963
Why did you tie Shancai up?

75
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,683
Shunping.

76
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:28,043
What are you doing?

77
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:33,403
Shunping, we did that just in case...

78
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,123
Boss, I don't get it.

79
00:06:35,643 --> 00:06:38,643
This was not the plan when you asked me
to approach Shancai before.

80
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:41,883
Boss.

81
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:45,523
Do you remember Daoming Si,
the one who broke your leg?

82
00:06:48,123 --> 00:06:49,323
How can I forget?

83
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,963
Why? Did you see him?

84
00:06:52,523 --> 00:06:53,923
No, my brother did.

85
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:56,643
He was beaten up by Daoming Si

86
00:06:57,243 --> 00:06:59,763
at his high school reunion two days ago.
He was even hospitalized.

87
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:01,643
He was beaten up?

88
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:02,603
Why?

89
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:06,003
Apparently because of a girl
named Shancai.

90
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:08,563
She's Daoming Si's girlfriend.

91
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,883
Shunping.

92
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:13,003
I think you should become friends
with that girl named Shancai.

93
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,843
And convince her
not to be together with Daoming Si.

94
00:07:19,283 --> 00:07:20,843
All right.

95
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:22,043
Thank you.

96
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:24,003
Shunping?

97
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,963
Shancai, we meet again.

98
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:29,523
Shunping.

99
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:31,123
What happened to your face?

100
00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:35,043
I had an encounter with Daoming Si today.

101
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:37,563
Tell me about it.

102
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:38,603
What happened?

103
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,363
That guy is too arrogant and dominating.

104
00:07:43,123 --> 00:07:44,923
He doesn't know how Shancai feels.

105
00:07:48,323 --> 00:07:50,483
I couldn't contain myself
so we had a fight.

106
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,443
He was also very arrogant and dominating
when I met him before.

107
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:58,723
He's so annoying.

108
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:02,403
That kind of person
needs to be taught a lesson.

109
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:07,523
Shunping, can you arrange for me
to meet Shancai tomorrow?

110
00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:10,763
Sure. But why?

111
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:13,483
Nothing.
I just want to have a chat with her.

112
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:16,683
Maybe I can convince her
to leave Daoming Si soon.

113
00:08:18,643 --> 00:08:19,483
That's a good idea.

114
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:21,563
-I'll set it up.
-Okay.

115
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:33,243
How did Daoming Si treat boss before?

116
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:35,323
Have you forgotten?

117
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:40,043
Shunping, do you plan to betray us?

118
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:43,683
Of course not.

119
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:46,043
A person like Daoming Si

120
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:48,003
doesn't deserve to be forgiven.

121
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:51,323
Boss' leg

122
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:54,123
was crippled because of Daoming Si.

123
00:08:57,243 --> 00:09:00,163
I've already taken a photo.
I'll send it to Daoming Si.

124
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:07,163
<i>He lied to me.</i>

125
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:10,483
<i>Shunping, who said he wanted
to be friends with me,</i> <i>to protect me,</i>

126
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:12,003
<i>lied to me.</i>

127
00:09:12,723 --> 00:09:14,003
<i>Why did this happen?</i>

128
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:17,723
Boss.

129
00:09:18,323 --> 00:09:20,523
I want to talk to her alone.

130
00:09:21,123 --> 00:09:22,083
May I?

131
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:25,763
Don't worry.

132
00:09:26,243 --> 00:09:27,283
I won't let her go.

133
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:29,363
Don't forget.

134
00:09:32,443 --> 00:09:33,723
I'm on your side.

135
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:35,723
Sure.

136
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:37,323
Don't take too long.

137
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:38,963
Okay.

138
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:57,483
Why?

139
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:58,923
Why?

140
00:10:02,523 --> 00:10:03,443
For what?

141
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:21,203
Why are you doing this?

142
00:10:22,363 --> 00:10:23,563
I trusted you.

143
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:25,723
Why?

144
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:27,603
Liar.

145
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,083
Jerk!

146
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:30,163
Scum!

147
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:32,403
Say whatever you want.

148
00:10:33,363 --> 00:10:34,563
If that makes you feel better,

149
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:36,883
do it.

150
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:42,043
Why are you doing this?

151
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:48,083
I think boss wants to use you
to deal with Daoming Si.

152
00:10:49,763 --> 00:10:51,483
Daoming Si crippled his leg.

153
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:54,123
He needs to pay for it.

154
00:10:59,323 --> 00:11:00,683
When I was in junior high school,

155
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,483
I didn't like to be in school.

156
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:07,883
I didn't like being with that stupid Zhibu
at home even more.

157
00:11:10,123 --> 00:11:11,843
So I went out and did some part-time job.

158
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:15,083
But I also got into a lot of trouble.

159
00:11:17,763 --> 00:11:20,763
I met boss at a bar later on.

160
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:23,243
He helped me with my problems.

161
00:11:23,803 --> 00:11:25,843
And he even convinced me
to go back to school.

162
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:27,963
And then one day,

163
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:31,163
that arrogant guy, Daoming Si,

164
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:33,923
argued with boss at a bar.

165
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:38,043
He said boss is a rascal
and that he's useless.

166
00:11:41,683 --> 00:11:44,003
Boss and his men got mad
and had a fight with Daoming Si.

167
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:46,883
But Daoming Si went crazy

168
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,403
and beat everyone up.

169
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:51,843
He also broke...

170
00:11:53,403 --> 00:11:54,603
Boss' leg.

171
00:11:57,763 --> 00:11:58,923
Because of that,

172
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:01,843
everyone got arrested by the police,

173
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:04,163
even Daoming Si.

174
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,243
But boss's leg

175
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:09,523
would never ever recover.

176
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:12,883
Shouldn't Daoming Si
take responsibility for this?

177
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:23,043
Shunping.

178
00:12:24,563 --> 00:12:26,163
What you're doing is against the law.

179
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:29,323
You'll be expelled by the school.
Do you know that?

180
00:12:31,403 --> 00:12:33,043
Even though I got into Mingde University,

181
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:37,323
I couldn't take
the pressure of the competition.

182
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,483
It seems like everyone is doing better

183
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:41,963
than me.

184
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,043
That's why I dropped out a long time ago.

185
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:57,883
So you approached me on purpose

186
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:00,963
in order to avenge boss?

187
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:02,763
I don't understand.

188
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:06,563
Why would a nice girl like you

189
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:09,923
be with a bum like Daoming Si?

190
00:13:11,883 --> 00:13:13,003
A person like you

191
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:15,563
even dare to call Daoming Si a bum?

192
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:19,003
Even though Daoming Si seems overbearing,

193
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:21,683
he's not the person you say he is.

194
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:24,923
You saw boss's leg.

195
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:27,803
Isn't the truth right in front
of your eyes?

196
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:35,603
If you want her to live,

197
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:37,963
come alone to this place immediately.

198
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:41,963
What is it? Is there any update on her?

199
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:49,083
"If you want her to live,
come alone immediately--"

200
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:51,283
Don't follow me.

201
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:55,243
Actually, I feel sorry for you.

202
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:58,443
Because when people get acquainted
with Daoming Si,

203
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:01,003
that is the beginning of their bad luck.

204
00:14:04,363 --> 00:14:06,323
My bad luck is not because of Daoming Si.

205
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:09,523
It's because I trusted you.

206
00:14:10,923 --> 00:14:12,723
Your hypocrisy makes me sick.

207
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:18,923
I thought you would understand me.

208
00:14:20,803 --> 00:14:21,883
Turns out, I was wrong.

209
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:27,603
Don't worry.

210
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,043
After boss deals with Daoming Si,

211
00:14:31,683 --> 00:14:32,803
he'll let you go.

212
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:35,923
You won't succeed with your plan.

213
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:38,723
Because Daoming Si won't come.

214
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,003
He will.

215
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,803
He'll come here.

216
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:45,163
He confessed his feelings
for you that way yesterday.

217
00:14:45,883 --> 00:14:47,283
So he'll surely come.

218
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:50,323
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

219
00:14:51,403 --> 00:14:52,883
<i>Please don't come.</i>

220
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,843
<i>This is my karma</i>

221
00:14:57,043 --> 00:14:59,083
<i>because I didn't believe Daoming Si.</i>

222
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:06,443
Shunping, why did you remove the tape?

223
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:08,043
What if she screams?

224
00:15:08,443 --> 00:15:10,843
Nobody would come to such a remote place.

225
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:15,083
Don't touch me!

226
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:20,803
Watch it.

227
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:22,843
If not for Shunping,

228
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,923
we would have already beaten you up

229
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,963
and broadcasted you crying live
to Daoming Si.

230
00:15:29,243 --> 00:15:30,963
I won't let you see me cry.

231
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:33,723
You despicable people.

232
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:35,323
You're quite tough.

233
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:40,483
Speaking of being despicable,
your man is even more despicable than us.

234
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,683
Last time, he beat us up
until we passed out at the bar.

235
00:15:48,443 --> 00:15:51,163
I thought you had a big feud.

236
00:15:51,803 --> 00:15:53,203
He beat you up until you passed out?

237
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:56,723
That's because you people were useless.

238
00:15:57,683 --> 00:16:01,083
Can't you win over Daoming Si
if you don't use such despicable tricks?

239
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:04,923
Bitch! Shut up!

240
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:20,043
Scalawag.

241
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:22,883
Scumbag.

242
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:26,643
You already lost to Daoming Si

243
00:16:27,043 --> 00:16:28,523
when you used such dirty tricks.

244
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:30,883
I'm telling you.

245
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:34,083
Daoming Si won't come here.

246
00:16:36,923 --> 00:16:38,003
Then we'll just kill you!

247
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:40,763
-We'll see if he comes--
-Wait. Boss.

248
00:16:41,323 --> 00:16:43,123
The goal is not to harm her.

249
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:45,323
The goal is to lure Daoming Si here.

250
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:49,963
I'm not Daoming Si's girlfriend.

251
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:52,283
If you don't believe me,

252
00:16:53,283 --> 00:16:54,723
then just wait here until you die

253
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:57,243
with those hilarious expressions
on your ugly faces.

254
00:17:01,643 --> 00:17:03,683
This wench's mouth is quite tough.

255
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:05,403
If you dare kick her,

256
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,843
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

257
00:17:41,123 --> 00:17:41,963
All right.

258
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:44,483
Let's do this right now.

259
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:49,883
Stupid boy.

260
00:17:51,483 --> 00:17:52,563
Why did you come here?

261
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,123
Foolish guy.

262
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:56,923
Stupid boy.

263
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:08,323
You can choose to fight back,
but I think you shouldn't.

264
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:10,243
You wouldn't want...

265
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,723
to see her get hurt, right?

266
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:24,363
Don't look at me with your filthy face.

267
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:26,683
Close your eyes.

268
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:33,323
What are you waiting for?

269
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:34,763
Kill him!

270
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:51,483
Aren't you stupid?

271
00:18:52,323 --> 00:18:53,803
Don't you fight at all?

272
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:56,323
Fight back.

273
00:18:59,083 --> 00:18:59,923
Fight back!

274
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:11,923
I don't feel anything at all.

275
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:14,603
Is that all you got?

276
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:17,203
Don't you have anything more powerful?

277
00:19:26,723 --> 00:19:27,963
Beat him up!

278
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:30,763
Stop!

279
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,483
Stop it!

280
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:33,443
Stop it!

281
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:49,603
Daoming Si!

282
00:19:57,123 --> 00:19:58,043
Daoming Si.

283
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,363
Where are you going?
It's dangerous over there.

284
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:02,963
Daoming Si!

285
00:20:09,763 --> 00:20:10,923
You hate me, right?

286
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,723
I don't hate you.

287
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,043
Whether you like me or hate me,

288
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:21,363
it doesn't matter anymore.

289
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,483
Bye.

290
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:36,363
Daoming Si!

291
00:20:36,563 --> 00:20:37,563
Wait!

292
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:40,083
It's all my fault! Don't go!

293
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:41,643
Don't go!

294
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:44,243
Daoming Si!

295
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:55,123
Don't...

296
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:58,003
Don't go!

297
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,403
-She's awake.
-She's awake.

298
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:01,323
-Shancai.
-You scared us to death, Shancai.

299
00:21:01,563 --> 00:21:02,403
Shancai.

300
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:05,923
-Hurry.
-Come on.

301
00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:07,083
Come on.

302
00:21:10,363 --> 00:21:11,203
Dad.

303
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:14,043
Mom. Where am I?

304
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:15,163
You're at the hospital.

305
00:21:15,563 --> 00:21:16,843
The police called and said that

306
00:21:17,123 --> 00:21:19,843
you and Daoming Si were found
at an old warehouse behind the school.

307
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:22,043
You both were hurt
and were sent to the hospital.

308
00:21:22,603 --> 00:21:24,763
Tell me. Who beat you up?

309
00:21:24,843 --> 00:21:25,883
I'll take care of him!

310
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,883
What are you doing?
She just woke up. Why are you yelling?

311
00:21:29,683 --> 00:21:31,203
-Tell me.
-Shancai, tell me.

312
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:33,723
Who beat you up? I'll take care of him!

313
00:21:34,243 --> 00:21:35,083
Daoming Si.

314
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:36,443
-Daoming Si?
-Where's Daoming Si?

315
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:38,163
-Shancai.
-Shancai.

316
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:42,283
Stupid boy.

317
00:21:43,683 --> 00:21:44,963
Why did you come here?

318
00:21:46,643 --> 00:21:47,483
All right.

319
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:50,083
Let's do this right now.

320
00:21:55,323 --> 00:21:57,043
Don't look at me with your filthy face.

321
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,323
Close your eyes.

322
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,323
Please don't run in the hallways.

323
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:07,083
Huaze Lei.

324
00:22:12,643 --> 00:22:14,403
Huaze Lei. Where's Daoming Si?

325
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:34,563
<i>Someone who never got beaten up
by anyone before.</i>

326
00:22:35,123 --> 00:22:36,843
<i>Someone who could fight really well.</i>

327
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:40,763
<i>Someone who could win
even if a lot of people ganged up on him,</i>

328
00:22:41,563 --> 00:22:42,883
<i>why didn't he fight back</i>

329
00:22:43,523 --> 00:22:45,083
<i>because of me?</i>

330
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:48,003
Stop!

331
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,403
Stop it!

332
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,403
<i>You stupid boy!</i>

333
00:23:02,723 --> 00:23:04,963
Why didn't you fight back?

334
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:08,643
If I fought back,

335
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:11,123
<i>then I would really lose.</i>

336
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,843
Daoming Si!

337
00:23:15,923 --> 00:23:17,963
Wake up, Daoming Si!

338
00:23:19,163 --> 00:23:20,963
<i>Come on. Wake up, Daoming Si!</i>

339
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:23,163
<i>Help!</i>

340
00:23:24,043 --> 00:23:25,643
<i>Help!</i>

341
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:37,083
It's too late.

342
00:23:38,163 --> 00:23:39,483
Si passed very peacefully.

343
00:23:41,243 --> 00:23:44,163
I never thought
that Si passed away just like that.

344
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:29,523
No.

345
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:32,483
Daoming Si, I won't allow you to die!

346
00:24:39,723 --> 00:24:41,323
Wake up!

347
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:43,843
I haven't even apologized to you!

348
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:47,163
Even though you have a bad temper,

349
00:24:48,763 --> 00:24:50,923
I still...

350
00:24:52,843 --> 00:24:55,403
I still hope that you'd be alive.

351
00:24:55,723 --> 00:24:57,043
Daoming Si!

352
00:24:59,043 --> 00:25:00,403
Wake up!

353
00:25:01,323 --> 00:25:03,443
You did so many bad things to me.

354
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:05,523
I haven't dealt with you yet!

355
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,163
Wake up!

356
00:25:08,483 --> 00:25:09,843
What are you talking about?

357
00:25:12,883 --> 00:25:15,283
Is this how you treat a patient?

358
00:25:21,723 --> 00:25:24,803
Did you see Shancai's expression earlier?
I almost couldn't contain myself.

359
00:25:25,363 --> 00:25:27,203
"No. I don't want you to die!"

360
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,563
Daoming Si.

361
00:25:32,643 --> 00:25:35,363
Daoming Si, you tricked me.
Do you want to scare me to death?

362
00:25:35,443 --> 00:25:37,003
-I'm going to kill you.
-Don't do that.

363
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,803
I'm going to kill you.
You and Huaze Lei tricked me.

364
00:25:45,163 --> 00:25:46,643
Hey, what were you thinking?

365
00:25:46,883 --> 00:25:48,163
Is this how you treat a patient?

366
00:25:48,243 --> 00:25:49,523
I broke three ribs.

367
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,603
I'm hurt all over.
Yet this stupid girl is sitting on me.

368
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:54,443
Who told you to play such a prank?

369
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:58,923
Miss.

370
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:00,523
How long will you sit on me?

371
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:02,163
It hurts.

372
00:26:17,963 --> 00:26:20,923
By the way, the police are already
taking care of those gangsters.

373
00:26:21,003 --> 00:26:24,283
I think Si has already paid
for what he did before.

374
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:26,323
I'm not who I was anymore.

375
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:29,243
What was he like before?

376
00:26:34,163 --> 00:26:36,763
Huaze Lei. How was Daoming Si before?

377
00:26:38,843 --> 00:26:41,403
The old Daoming Si was quite absurd.

378
00:26:42,003 --> 00:26:42,923
Absurd?

379
00:26:43,363 --> 00:26:45,003
Isn't he also quite absurd now?

380
00:26:45,643 --> 00:26:46,843
Compared to how he used to be,

381
00:26:47,403 --> 00:26:48,363
the new Si

382
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:52,203
is Mr. Virtue.

383
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:58,643
What are you looking at?
You're lucky you met the new me.

384
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:00,683
That's right.

385
00:27:00,763 --> 00:27:03,563
The old Si always looked for trouble.
And he was never motivated.

386
00:27:03,643 --> 00:27:05,763
Good thing we were able to change him.

387
00:27:06,243 --> 00:27:08,523
We helped him study
at the library every day.

388
00:27:08,603 --> 00:27:10,523
Good thing that he's naturally smart.

389
00:27:10,683 --> 00:27:12,683
He got into Mingde University
with a very high score.

390
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:15,803
He got into Mingde University indeed.

391
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:18,723
But he's not naturally that smart.

392
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:21,603
All right.

393
00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:24,243
Are you planning to talk
about my past all night?

394
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:27,763
You ungrateful guy.

395
00:27:27,843 --> 00:27:29,923
You forgot all the times
we were with you before.

396
00:27:30,003 --> 00:27:30,843
You...

397
00:27:31,203 --> 00:27:32,643
Never mind. Let's go.

398
00:27:32,723 --> 00:27:34,563
Let's give them some quality time.

399
00:27:34,643 --> 00:27:35,483
Bye.

400
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,043
Why aren't you saying anything?

401
00:28:03,323 --> 00:28:05,883
What's with that attitude?
Is that how you treat a patient?

402
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:09,563
Do you think you're so great?

403
00:28:09,643 --> 00:28:11,323
Why was I so nosy that I risked my life

404
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,403
and got hurt all over just to save
an ungrateful and stupid girl like you?

405
00:28:14,923 --> 00:28:17,203
You're the stupid one.
You even dare to say that to me.

406
00:28:17,403 --> 00:28:18,963
If you didn't cause trouble before,

407
00:28:19,203 --> 00:28:20,203
how would you get hurt?

408
00:28:21,963 --> 00:28:23,683
Cut it out. Stop babbling.

409
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,643
You just know how to fight
with people all day.

410
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:28,403
-Don't you know how to comfort a patient?
-Because...

411
00:28:46,443 --> 00:28:47,283
What...

412
00:28:47,803 --> 00:28:48,683
What are you doing?

413
00:28:52,603 --> 00:28:54,083
Because I had a dream.

414
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:57,483
I dreamt that you died.

415
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:01,123
Then I thought you really died.

416
00:29:03,803 --> 00:29:06,003
I thought you wouldn't come and save me

417
00:29:06,603 --> 00:29:08,043
because I said those things to you.

418
00:29:09,803 --> 00:29:11,603
I never thought you'd still come.

419
00:29:13,563 --> 00:29:16,803
And you got beaten up so badly
by those scums

420
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,123
and turned out this way.

421
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:25,683
Sorry.

422
00:29:27,843 --> 00:29:30,163
Stop looking like that.
You're already ugly as it is.

423
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:33,563
Didn't I tell you before?

424
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:36,003
Even if you went to Mars,
I'd still go after you.

425
00:29:36,363 --> 00:29:38,403
You wouldn't be able to get rid
of me in this life.

426
00:29:38,883 --> 00:29:40,443
Stop struggling for no reason.

427
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:44,123
Stupid boy.

428
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:48,563
Your face is so ugly right now.
Are you planning to laugh or cry?

429
00:29:48,923 --> 00:29:50,043
It's none of your business.

430
00:30:00,963 --> 00:30:03,963
It's good that they came back safely
even though they were hurt this time.

431
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:05,723
But it was really dangerous.

432
00:30:06,363 --> 00:30:07,203
That's right.

433
00:30:07,483 --> 00:30:09,763
If you think about it now,
we almost weren't able to change

434
00:30:10,003 --> 00:30:11,363
the old Si.

435
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:14,443
There were times when
we almost fought with him.

436
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:16,083
It's good we didn't give up.

437
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:18,083
How could we give up on him?

438
00:30:18,803 --> 00:30:19,963
He has helped us a lot.

439
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:22,843
We can't let this kind of thing
happen again.

440
00:30:24,403 --> 00:30:27,283
Even though he's very headstrong now,
he has learned to respect himself

441
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:29,043
because he found someone he loves.

442
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:42,483
Hey.

443
00:30:44,163 --> 00:30:45,003
Who are you?

444
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,163
I'm Shunping, the one who beat up
Daoming Si so badly.

445
00:31:01,283 --> 00:31:03,483
What? You want me to come visit you daily?

446
00:31:03,643 --> 00:31:05,563
-No way.
-Why not?

447
00:31:05,643 --> 00:31:07,923
I need to work. How will I have the time?

448
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:11,123
You ungrateful woman.
I'll double your salary. Come here.

449
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,803
Don't always use money to buy people.

450
00:31:13,963 --> 00:31:15,603
You morally-corrupt bum.

451
00:31:16,363 --> 00:31:18,243
Then how would you repay me? Tell me.

452
00:31:19,163 --> 00:31:20,003
Shut it.

453
00:31:20,363 --> 00:31:21,723
Lie down and rest.

454
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:33,603
Why are you here?

455
00:31:35,403 --> 00:31:36,643
Haven't you done enough?

456
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:39,683
Why are you here?

457
00:31:41,923 --> 00:31:44,763
Your friends are all by the door.
What can I do to you?

458
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,243
Don't worry.

459
00:31:46,803 --> 00:31:47,683
Shancai.

460
00:31:48,563 --> 00:31:49,723
Before I surrender myself,

461
00:31:50,683 --> 00:31:52,203
I want to apologize to you.

462
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:09,403
Boss was already arrested

463
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:11,883
because of what we did to you.

464
00:32:12,523 --> 00:32:15,603
I'll also surrender myself for what I did
and accept my punishment.

465
00:32:16,323 --> 00:32:17,323
I'm really sorry.

466
00:32:20,443 --> 00:32:21,923
It's too late to apologize now.

467
00:32:22,323 --> 00:32:23,323
Get out.

468
00:32:32,203 --> 00:32:33,203
Shancai.

469
00:32:35,603 --> 00:32:37,483
If you're not the girl Daoming Si likes,

470
00:32:38,763 --> 00:32:42,243
I'd hope we can become good friends.

471
00:32:48,163 --> 00:32:49,083
It's really a shame.

472
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:02,723
I originally wanted to beat him up.

473
00:33:03,363 --> 00:33:05,763
But I'm not mad anymore
after seeing his pathetic face.

474
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:08,043
You still want to beat people up?

475
00:33:08,123 --> 00:33:10,643
Ouch! You violent girl.
Why did you hit me where I'm hurt?

476
00:33:11,483 --> 00:33:13,723
Sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

477
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:20,243
I...

478
00:33:20,483 --> 00:33:22,243
This is the most touching love story.

479
00:33:22,363 --> 00:33:24,163
A firm and unyielding man like Daoming Si

480
00:33:24,363 --> 00:33:27,243
risked his life for the woman he loves.

481
00:33:27,643 --> 00:33:30,763
Shancai, you must've done a lot of good
in the past to get a man like Daoming Si.

482
00:33:31,003 --> 00:33:33,243
This man is strong,
handsome and responsible.

483
00:33:33,483 --> 00:33:35,083
What do you think, Shancai?

484
00:33:35,523 --> 00:33:36,563
What do you mean?

485
00:33:36,643 --> 00:33:38,483
-Why are you telling me these things?
-Shancai.

486
00:33:39,843 --> 00:33:40,763
What do you want?

487
00:33:40,883 --> 00:33:42,803
I mean it.
You should treat each other well.

488
00:33:43,363 --> 00:33:44,723
You should help one another.

489
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:47,203
That's right.
With a manly guy like Daoming Si,

490
00:33:47,283 --> 00:33:49,643
even if aliens came to Earth,
he would not let them hurt you.

491
00:33:49,843 --> 00:33:52,203
And Daoming Si is not right in the head.

492
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:54,443
He won't look for another woman.

493
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:57,523
He would risk his life and save you

494
00:33:57,963 --> 00:34:00,123
when you're in trouble.

495
00:34:00,443 --> 00:34:01,883
Stop it.

496
00:34:01,963 --> 00:34:03,283
I...

497
00:34:03,363 --> 00:34:05,363
Take this limited edition Daoming Si now.

498
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,643
Even though his brain
doesn't work that well,

499
00:34:07,763 --> 00:34:09,203
you're not that smart yourself.

500
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:12,203
-I think you suit each other.
-Hey.

501
00:34:12,763 --> 00:34:13,683
Don't come any closer.

502
00:34:14,323 --> 00:34:18,043
Shancai, don't you like
a manly guy like Daoming Si?

503
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,683
Si is invincible.

504
00:34:20,803 --> 00:34:21,643
Hey.

505
00:34:21,723 --> 00:34:23,803
I'm manly too.

506
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:25,003
And...

507
00:34:26,643 --> 00:34:27,483
But...

508
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,083
Then...

509
00:34:30,563 --> 00:34:32,283
-Daoming Si is...
-Damn girl.

510
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:34,763
What are you trying to say?

511
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,283
And...

512
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:38,483
But...

513
00:34:38,563 --> 00:34:39,403
Then...

514
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:41,323
I think

515
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:42,723
of Daoming Si...

516
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:45,123
as a dog.

517
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:50,483
Lei, stop laughing.

518
00:34:51,043 --> 00:34:53,203
But I can relate.

519
00:34:53,363 --> 00:34:54,523
A dog?

520
00:34:55,883 --> 00:34:57,443
Si, be strong.

521
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:03,203
Of course we can't evade it.

522
00:35:03,363 --> 00:35:04,683
We have to face it head on.

523
00:35:06,123 --> 00:35:08,443
Mr. Wu, don't think too much.

524
00:35:08,603 --> 00:35:10,043
You won't suffer any losses.

525
00:35:10,123 --> 00:35:13,763
We prioritize the bonuses for our members.
You can't earn less even if you want to.

526
00:35:14,283 --> 00:35:16,963
Of course. You can find me
any time you call this number.

527
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:18,763
I'll help you resolve your problems.

528
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:23,003
That's good.

529
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:25,803
It seems that your job
is going smoothly lately.

530
00:35:27,363 --> 00:35:28,603
I already have a plan.

531
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:31,603
When I receive my first salary,
I'll add them to the stock immediately.

532
00:35:32,323 --> 00:35:34,003
Be careful.

533
00:35:37,843 --> 00:35:39,963
Is she still in the bathroom
after such a long time?

534
00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:42,483
Did you remind her not to get
her wounds wet?

535
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:44,163
I did.

536
00:35:46,203 --> 00:35:48,523
We really have to thank
Daoming Si this time.

537
00:35:48,843 --> 00:35:49,923
He even got his face hurt

538
00:35:50,203 --> 00:35:51,283
to save Shancai.

539
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:55,603
Shouldn't they settle the things
between them already?

540
00:35:56,163 --> 00:35:57,683
I think so too.

541
00:35:59,763 --> 00:36:01,803
Shancai, hurry.

542
00:36:01,923 --> 00:36:03,363
It's too humid in the bathroom.

543
00:36:03,443 --> 00:36:05,203
It's not good for your wounds.

544
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:16,603
Congratulations on getting discharged.

545
00:36:17,123 --> 00:36:20,243
Si's recovers just like a dog.

546
00:36:21,203 --> 00:36:22,043
A dog?

547
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:24,123
Don't mind being called a dog.
Dogs are nice.

548
00:36:24,723 --> 00:36:27,203
Maybe Shancai was complimenting you
for being as cute as a dog?

549
00:36:28,843 --> 00:36:30,723
Don't let me hear you say
the word "dog" again.

550
00:36:31,043 --> 00:36:31,923
Or else I'll kill you.

551
00:36:37,243 --> 00:36:39,123
I think you were really traumatized.

552
00:36:41,603 --> 00:36:42,923
How can you understand how I feel

553
00:36:43,523 --> 00:36:44,883
when the girl I risked my life for

554
00:36:44,963 --> 00:36:46,003
said,

555
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:48,203
"I think of Daoming Si as a dog."

556
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:52,923
<i>I think</i>

557
00:36:54,723 --> 00:36:55,763
of Daoming Si...

558
00:36:56,363 --> 00:36:57,683
as a dog.

559
00:37:01,243 --> 00:37:02,643
She said I'm like a dog.

560
00:37:04,203 --> 00:37:05,123
That damn girl.

561
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:09,963
I think Si is going to explode.

562
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:15,603
I told you he shouldn't
be discharged so soon.

563
00:37:19,603 --> 00:37:20,483
I'm going to sleep.

564
00:37:30,963 --> 00:37:33,723
But Shancai is really stubborn.

565
00:37:35,483 --> 00:37:37,243
Innocent girls like her are annoying.

566
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,963
They have
a lot of unrealistic expectations

567
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:41,683
on relationships.

568
00:37:44,123 --> 00:37:46,443
Falling in love relies on

569
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:48,363
that sudden feeling of love.

570
00:37:51,323 --> 00:37:53,123
Lei, what do you think?

571
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:54,923
Me?

572
00:37:55,883 --> 00:37:57,403
I don't have any feelings at all.

573
00:38:01,683 --> 00:38:03,483
I think we're the only normal guys here.

574
00:38:04,003 --> 00:38:05,083
There's nothing we can do.

575
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:06,643
We can only help Si

576
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:09,363
make the innocent Shancai

577
00:38:09,643 --> 00:38:10,483
give in.

578
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:31,803
Didn't you just get discharged?
Have you rested enough?

579
00:38:31,883 --> 00:38:33,643
Why are you in such a hurry
to come to school?

580
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:36,043
I was afraid I won't be able to catch up.

581
00:38:36,163 --> 00:38:38,803
-I may have a lot to catch up later.
-I can lend you my notes.

582
00:38:39,723 --> 00:38:40,563
Thank you.

583
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:42,883
But it's better for me to come to class.

584
00:38:43,123 --> 00:38:44,563
Shancai, are you all right?

585
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:46,523
I wanted to visit you after class.

586
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:48,403
Then give you my notes
for the past two days.

587
00:38:48,923 --> 00:38:49,763
Your notes?

588
00:38:49,843 --> 00:38:51,803
Your notes are useless.
Nobody can understand them.

589
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,643
Shancai would be confused.

590
00:38:53,763 --> 00:38:56,723
I wrote my notes carefully for Shancai.

591
00:38:57,563 --> 00:38:59,243
Don't say things you don't know.

592
00:39:00,643 --> 00:39:03,843
All right. I need both of your notes.

593
00:39:06,723 --> 00:39:08,683
Shancai, is it okay
not to bandage your wound?

594
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:11,603
I think it's fine.

595
00:39:12,123 --> 00:39:13,843
It feels fresher this way.

596
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:18,683
Where's Daoming Si?

597
00:39:19,243 --> 00:39:21,443
He was discharged yesterday.
He's taking a sick day today.

598
00:39:21,523 --> 00:39:23,083
His wounds have not fully recovered yet.

599
00:39:23,443 --> 00:39:24,283
Right.

600
00:39:26,443 --> 00:39:27,963
Your wound might get infected this way.

601
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:32,683
I don't want to be all bandaged up
like a mummy.

602
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:35,403
-So I...
-But your wound might get infected.

603
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:38,363
The air is really polluted.
What happens if it scars?

604
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,603
Do you bring this stuff
with you all the time?

605
00:39:45,763 --> 00:39:46,763
Wouldn't you?

606
00:39:49,803 --> 00:39:51,803
So Daoming Si's been discharged already?

607
00:39:52,163 --> 00:39:53,003
That's great.

608
00:39:53,963 --> 00:39:55,803
This is the first time
I've seen Si like that.

609
00:39:56,123 --> 00:39:58,443
We grew up with him
and we're all so surprised.

610
00:39:59,923 --> 00:40:01,923
We can see how much he really likes you.

611
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:03,883
You can see it too, right?

612
00:40:07,963 --> 00:40:09,363
Come on. I'll put it on for you.

613
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:14,283
Lei.

614
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:16,643
I really envy you.

615
00:40:17,843 --> 00:40:21,203
You and Jing shouldn't feel awkward
with each other now, you know?

616
00:40:22,243 --> 00:40:25,283
But I still don't know
how to face him with confidence.

617
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:28,483
It seems so hard.

618
00:40:31,203 --> 00:40:32,203
Just take it slowly.

619
00:40:33,323 --> 00:40:36,203
You and Si can just take it slowly.
It'll be all right.

620
00:40:36,883 --> 00:40:37,723
Really?

621
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,723
You two seem cozy.

622
00:40:47,603 --> 00:40:48,843
What are you doing?

623
00:40:48,923 --> 00:40:50,003
Stupid boy.

624
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:51,843
He's helping me put on a Band-Aid.

625
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:54,603
Didn't you take a sick day?

626
00:40:56,003 --> 00:40:58,363
I got bored sleeping at home.
So I came to school instead.

627
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:02,163
Your ribs haven't healed, right?
Can you move around like this?

628
00:41:02,723 --> 00:41:03,643
So what?

629
00:41:03,803 --> 00:41:05,923
My ability to recover is just like a dog.

630
00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:12,243
I told you it was just a metaphor.
It's just a figure of speech.

631
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:13,963
An interesting figure of speech.

632
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,723
Did I ask for your opinion?

633
00:41:17,323 --> 00:41:18,363
I'll get going then.

634
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:23,483
I didn't tell her what you wanted me to.

635
00:41:23,923 --> 00:41:24,923
Just tell her yourself.

636
00:41:26,763 --> 00:41:28,163
Hey.

637
00:41:28,963 --> 00:41:29,803
What is it?

638
00:41:32,243 --> 00:41:34,123
Do you know what day it is on the 31st?

639
00:41:35,403 --> 00:41:36,403
You don't know?

640
00:41:36,643 --> 00:41:38,323
How dare you? It's my birthday!

641
00:41:38,483 --> 00:41:39,363
Well then.

642
00:41:39,643 --> 00:41:41,163
Happy birthday.

643
00:41:41,723 --> 00:41:45,043
We have a birthday party every year.
You have to bring a gift.

644
00:41:45,123 --> 00:41:47,123
What? How can you act like this?

645
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:48,403
You even asked for a gift?

646
00:41:48,483 --> 00:41:50,403
-Would you give me a gift if I didn't?
-Of course.

647
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,883
All right. Then bring it.

648
00:41:54,203 --> 00:41:56,603
This is your fault.
You have to make it up to me.

649
00:41:56,883 --> 00:41:59,283
By the way, my mom will be there too.
Wear something nice.

650
00:41:59,843 --> 00:42:00,923
Your mom?

651
00:42:01,243 --> 00:42:04,723
-Your mom would be back from overseas?
-Yes. I'll introduce you to her.

652
00:42:05,283 --> 00:42:06,523
What?
