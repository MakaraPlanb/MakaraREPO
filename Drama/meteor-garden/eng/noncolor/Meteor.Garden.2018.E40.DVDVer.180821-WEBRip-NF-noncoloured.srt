EPISODE 40

4
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:42,495
Thomas.

5
00:01:44,575 --> 00:01:47,775
Are you sure this is Daoming Si's house?

6
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:49,695
Yes.

7
00:01:52,295 --> 00:01:53,575
I'll go in with you.

8
00:01:56,775 --> 00:01:57,655
No.

9
00:01:58,575 --> 00:01:59,815
I'll go in myself.

10
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:01,015
Okay.

11
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:02,615
Good luck.

12
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:04,655
I'll wait out here.

13
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:20,935
<i>I feel strangely calm at this moment</i>

14
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:23,855
<i>when I should be nervous instead.</i>

15
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:08,535
<i>I finally realized that
during this whole time,</i>

16
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:12,015
<i>I, Dong Shancai, was never alone.</i>

17
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:17,535
<i>I'm so close to him now.</i>

18
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:20,295
<i>I might see him at any time now.</i>

19
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:54,335
Mrs. Yu?

20
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,175
Shancai.

21
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:00,375
You're here.

22
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:04,695
Mrs. Yu,

23
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:06,775
I missed you so much.

24
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:15,855
You look pale.

25
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:18,295
You've lost weight.

26
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:20,855
Was it a bad trip?

27
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:28,135
I guess it's obvious.

28
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:31,175
I almost had to sleep
on the street in London.

29
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:35,375
How did you know I was coming?

30
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:39,295
Haven't I been here waiting for you?

31
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:47,375
Where's Daoming Si?

32
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:49,975
He's inside.

33
00:04:56,615 --> 00:04:58,255
Can I go see him?

34
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:02,015
Come with me.

35
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:09,575
My dear,

36
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:12,055
promise me one thing.

37
00:05:13,655 --> 00:05:15,335
No matter what happens,

38
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:18,295
you must be strong.

39
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:32,815
Have you forgotten?

40
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:34,895
I'm like a weed.

41
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:09,055
Daoming Si.

42
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:20,015
Why are you here?

43
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,335
I'm here to see you.

44
00:06:28,295 --> 00:06:29,455
Who told you to come here?

45
00:06:30,415 --> 00:06:31,335
Go home.

46
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:33,415
I'm staying in London.

47
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:38,495
Daoming Si, what's wrong with you?

48
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:42,255
You're joking, aren't you?

49
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:44,135
I know.

50
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,895
Your mom must have said or done
something to make you...

51
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:53,255
It has nothing to do with my mom.

52
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,335
This is my decision.

53
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:57,695
It was my decision
to leave Mingde University.

54
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:06,335
You should leave.

55
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,135
It was my own fault.

56
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:30,895
I shouldn't have approached you.

57
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:42,295
Let's just put everything behind us.

58
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:13,455
Daoming Si, turn around.

59
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,815
Look into my eyes.

60
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:20,375
Say that to me again.

61
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:34,615
Don't come here again.

62
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:38,695
<i>Tell me this isn't real.</i>

63
00:08:40,335 --> 00:08:41,735
<i>Please tell me it isn't real.</i>

64
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:19,615
Shancai.

65
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:21,695
I'm sorry.

66
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:24,815
Something happened in my family.

67
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:27,415
I have to focus entirely

68
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:31,695
on helping Daoming Group
get through this rough patch.

69
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,535
I can't be selfish

70
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:41,495
and pretend like my family is fine.

71
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:44,655
But we agreed to face everything together.

72
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:47,055
We can all help you.

73
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,135
Our thoughts were
too simplistic and immature.

74
00:09:51,855 --> 00:09:53,015
I thought I could do that.

75
00:09:55,855 --> 00:09:56,735
But I'm sorry,

76
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:00,495
I can't.

77
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,335
I can't be selfish like you.

78
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:30,055
Fine.

79
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:33,135
I understand.

80
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,215
Sorry for the trouble.

81
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,175
Are you happy now?

82
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:27,415
Are you satisfied now?

83
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:29,975
You disgust me.

84
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:12,015
<i>I came all the way here to see him,</i>

85
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:15,855
<i>but he feels so distant from me.</i>

86
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,735
<i>What if...</i>

87
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:21,655
<i>What if I never see him again after this?</i>

88
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:02,455
Hey.

89
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:04,695
Are you crying?

90
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,855
Did you see Daoming Si?

91
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:11,815
I did.

92
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:14,895
He told me...

93
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:20,895
to never come see him again.

94
00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:23,055
How could he say that?

95
00:14:26,855 --> 00:14:28,015
Don't be sad.

96
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,495
Shancai, you'll meet
someone better than him.

97
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:38,935
Let's go see the city.

98
00:15:16,255 --> 00:15:17,095
Don't worry.

99
00:15:17,175 --> 00:15:18,055
You'll be fine.

100
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:41,843
How much longer
do you want to stay in London?

101
00:15:43,123 --> 00:15:44,883
Or are you heading back to Shanghai now?

102
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,003
I don't know.

103
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:57,843
Huaze Lei.

104
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:00,403
Is that your friend?

105
00:16:01,665 --> 00:16:02,505
Yes.

106
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:06,723
Okay.

107
00:16:06,963 --> 00:16:07,923
I'll get going now.

108
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:10,443
-Call me, okay?
-Okay.

109
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,443
Bye.

110
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:18,683
You weren't answering your phone.

111
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:21,163
I asked the hotel manager,
but you hadn't checked in yet.

112
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:22,883
I was worried about you.

113
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:29,523
Did you see Si?

114
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:35,163
Yes.

115
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:37,803
Are you okay?

116
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:39,003
What's wrong?

117
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:47,603
I went to see him.

118
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,723
And he told me...

119
00:16:55,203 --> 00:16:56,763
He didn't want to see me again.

120
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:04,883
I know he has his reasons, but...

121
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:09,483
I came all the way to see him.

122
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:11,883
But he wouldn't...

123
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,243
He wouldn't even come out.

124
00:17:16,443 --> 00:17:17,683
He didn't want to see me

125
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:47,123
Mrs. Daoming,
you have a video conference with Mr. He.

126
00:17:47,603 --> 00:17:48,603
All right. Set it here.

127
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,403
Hello, Mr. He.

128
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:00,363
<i>Mrs. Daoming,</i>

129
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:03,283
<i>I've heard that Liu Business Group</i>

130
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:04,923
<i>will be acquiring Maple Hotel</i>

131
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:07,403
<i>and Daoming Group for 1.3 million yuan.</i>

132
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:13,763
They've underestimated the value
of Maple Hotel and Daoming Group.

133
00:18:14,323 --> 00:18:15,643
<i>This fiscal report</i>

134
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:18,603
<i>will not influence my sincerity
in working with Daoming Group.</i>

135
00:18:19,163 --> 00:18:21,723
<i>All you need to do is
release your shares to us.</i>

136
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,603
After all,

137
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:27,763
you probably can't find
any investors better than us.

138
00:18:29,403 --> 00:18:33,083
Mr. He, you're our group's
most important board member.

139
00:18:33,803 --> 00:18:35,323
Of course I need your support.

140
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:38,123
<i>Mr. Daoming and I were good friends.</i>

141
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:40,083
<i>I'm willing to support you
for that reason.</i>

142
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:43,643
By the way, my wife wants to thank you

143
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,643
for the gift you gave Xiaozi.

144
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:48,323
Such a valuable gift.

145
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:50,523
There's no need to thank me.

146
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:53,723
Xiaozi is already like a daughter to me.

147
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:08,003
DAOMING GROUP TO BE ACQUIRED
BY LIU BUSINESS GROUP

148
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,323
Why did I have to come home?

149
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:27,883
Why does Shancai have to leave?

150
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,283
I know you don't like her.

151
00:19:29,443 --> 00:19:30,923
But can't you give her a chance?

152
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,243
-I can't!
-Why?

153
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:34,403
Because we have no time.

154
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:36,483
No time?

155
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:37,563
No time?

156
00:19:37,883 --> 00:19:39,683
Are you dying or am I dying?

157
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:42,643
It's Daoming Group.

158
00:19:43,603 --> 00:19:46,163
Daoming Group has no time.
Do you know that?

159
00:19:46,723 --> 00:19:49,043
If I can't gain the trust
of Xiaozi's dad...

160
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:50,923
If he kicks me off the board...

161
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:52,563
If he takes all the shares,

162
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:55,163
then everything your dad left behind...

163
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:56,763
Daoming Group will be gone!

164
00:19:56,843 --> 00:19:58,483
Everything will be gone!
Do you understand?

165
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,123
So you had to sacrifice me and Shancai?

166
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:03,043
Yes.

167
00:20:03,843 --> 00:20:05,403
I'm sacrificing you and Shancai

168
00:20:05,563 --> 00:20:08,003
for the thousands of employees
in Daoming Group.

169
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:03,683
Idiot.

170
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,203
Why would I leave you?

171
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:08,323
I was just joking.

172
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,483
Let's go back to Shanghai together.

173
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:07,563
<i>It was a dream.</i>

174
00:23:09,363 --> 00:23:10,683
<i>The same dream.</i>

175
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:11,403
You're awake?

176
00:24:12,523 --> 00:24:14,003
You slept for 12 hours.

177
00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:15,763
Are you sure you're not sick?

178
00:24:25,203 --> 00:24:26,443
You prepared so much food.

179
00:24:28,363 --> 00:24:29,443
Even instant noodles.

180
00:24:31,963 --> 00:24:33,283
I brought that especially for you.

181
00:24:46,203 --> 00:24:47,043
What?

182
00:24:49,163 --> 00:24:50,003
For me?

183
00:24:52,563 --> 00:24:54,083
Don't disappear again.

184
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:06,523
I'm sorry.

185
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:09,843
So much has happened.

186
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,723
I still can't...

187
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:18,443
Lei.

188
00:25:21,723 --> 00:25:23,203
Thank you for everything.

189
00:25:24,763 --> 00:25:26,003
I'm very happy.

190
00:25:27,123 --> 00:25:28,483
You said that a lot of times.

191
00:25:31,283 --> 00:25:32,163
Really?

192
00:25:33,803 --> 00:25:35,403
I'm very grateful to you.

193
00:25:37,483 --> 00:25:39,003
Everything that happened in London

194
00:25:39,403 --> 00:25:41,163
feels so strange to me.

195
00:25:42,803 --> 00:25:44,643
I think it's Si
who made you feel that way.

196
00:25:46,603 --> 00:25:48,083
I heard that Daoming Group

197
00:25:48,763 --> 00:25:50,163
is facing some trouble now.

198
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,963
Other business groups are trying
to acquire their shares.

199
00:25:54,963 --> 00:25:57,963
I'm sure that Si is acting weird
because of that.

200
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:01,523
I don't know.

201
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:04,883
I'm exhausted.

202
00:26:09,043 --> 00:26:11,963
Why can't we just be together
like a normal couple?

203
00:26:15,483 --> 00:26:17,763
Why can't he stop me from leaving?

204
00:26:40,483 --> 00:26:41,363
I'm sorry.

205
00:26:42,723 --> 00:26:44,443
I shouldn't have complained to you.

206
00:26:49,003 --> 00:26:51,523
You can say anything you want to me.

207
00:27:00,563 --> 00:27:01,883
Why are you in London?

208
00:27:05,443 --> 00:27:08,083
In Shanghai, I was talking
to Ximen and Meizuo.

209
00:27:08,363 --> 00:27:10,483
They said you must be wandering
around in London.

210
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:13,483
After that, I couldn't
stop worrying about you.

211
00:27:14,443 --> 00:27:17,643
So I decided to come to London
just to make sure.

212
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:40,323
Since we're here,

213
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:42,043
let's go sightseeing.

214
00:27:42,723 --> 00:27:43,723
You'll feel better.

215
00:28:03,123 --> 00:28:04,083
Si.

216
00:28:04,923 --> 00:28:06,523
You have to be strong.

217
00:28:07,963 --> 00:28:11,163
You're the only successor
of Daoming Group.

218
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:13,923
How can you be so weak?

219
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:17,003
Yes.

220
00:28:18,003 --> 00:28:19,283
I'm Daoming Si.

221
00:28:21,563 --> 00:28:23,203
What a terrible person to be.

222
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:26,963
If only I weren't Daoming Si.

223
00:28:30,763 --> 00:28:31,643
Mrs. Yu.

224
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:34,883
Shancai...

225
00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:40,803
I kicked her out.

226
00:28:44,963 --> 00:28:46,963
She came all the way
from Shanghai to London

227
00:28:47,963 --> 00:28:49,043
just to see me.

228
00:28:51,003 --> 00:28:52,203
But I pushed her away.

229
00:28:54,403 --> 00:28:55,923
She must be devastated.

230
00:28:57,683 --> 00:28:59,163
She probably doesn't understand why.

231
00:29:03,403 --> 00:29:04,243
She must...

232
00:29:06,923 --> 00:29:07,843
Goodness.

233
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:10,443
Shancai is fine.

234
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:13,843
She'll be fine.

235
00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:18,163
I miss her so much.

236
00:29:23,683 --> 00:29:24,883
-What?
-What?

237
00:29:25,443 --> 00:29:26,403
-London?
-London?

238
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:27,963
Yes.

239
00:29:28,043 --> 00:29:29,603
Shancai is in London.

240
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:31,443
Why?

241
00:29:31,963 --> 00:29:35,683
Si's mom forced him to go to London.

242
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:38,443
What does that have to do with Shancai?

243
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,203
What do you think?

244
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:41,603
Three words.

245
00:29:42,243 --> 00:29:44,443
Because of love.

246
00:29:46,163 --> 00:29:48,243
"Because of love"?

247
00:29:49,883 --> 00:29:51,483
So Shancai isn't coming back?

248
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:54,203
Goodness.

249
00:29:54,443 --> 00:29:56,763
My world has turned dark again.

250
00:29:57,843 --> 00:29:59,683
No wonder I haven't seen her for days.

251
00:29:59,763 --> 00:30:02,723
So Daoming Si isn't coming back
to Shanghai?

252
00:30:03,963 --> 00:30:05,763
Nobody knows anything about him.

253
00:30:07,483 --> 00:30:08,403
But that's weird.

254
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,683
Shancai went to London,

255
00:30:10,763 --> 00:30:12,203
but she hasn't been on her phone.

256
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:14,363
She hasn't replied to any messages.

257
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:16,603
What if something happened to her?

258
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:19,283
Shut your mouth.

259
00:30:22,243 --> 00:30:27,883
LEI SENT YOU A MESSAGE

260
00:30:29,923 --> 00:30:31,403
All right, no need to worry now.

261
00:30:31,883 --> 00:30:32,883
Lei is in London.

262
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,443
Shancai went to London to see Si.

263
00:30:38,643 --> 00:30:40,003
Now Lei is in London too?

264
00:30:40,523 --> 00:30:41,963
Why is everyone in London?

265
00:30:42,603 --> 00:30:43,883
I don't understand.

266
00:30:46,163 --> 00:30:47,243
Just stop worrying.

267
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:49,843
Shancai will be fine.

268
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:20,883
<i>Shancai, are you really
in London to see Si?</i>

269
00:31:23,563 --> 00:31:25,083
<i>Is he bullying you again?</i>

270
00:31:25,363 --> 00:31:26,923
<i>Tell me, I'll beat him up for you.</i>

271
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:29,163
<i>Shancai, where are you?</i>

272
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:31,443
<i>Please reply. Zhen and I are worried sick.</i>

273
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:39,283
Qinghe.

274
00:31:40,723 --> 00:31:42,203
Everything is fine here in London.

275
00:31:42,763 --> 00:31:43,763
Don't worry about me.

276
00:31:54,363 --> 00:31:56,323
Hello, is Ximen in there?

277
00:31:56,603 --> 00:31:57,843
Yes. This way, please.

278
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:13,563
Are you here to find out about Shancai?

279
00:32:16,123 --> 00:32:18,443
Is something wrong with Shancai and Si?

280
00:32:20,843 --> 00:32:21,683
What do you mean?

281
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:24,603
I just think something is wrong.

282
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,843
Shancai didn't mention it,
so I didn't ask her anything.

283
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,043
I don't know any more than you.

284
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,123
I'm worried that

285
00:32:38,643 --> 00:32:40,683
nobody's taking care of Shancai in London.

286
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:45,203
Don't worry.

287
00:32:45,403 --> 00:32:46,403
She's not alone.

288
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:51,283
-So Daoming Si--
-Lei went to London.

289
00:32:52,363 --> 00:32:53,243
With him there,

290
00:32:53,843 --> 00:32:54,843
Shancai will be fine.

291
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:15,643
Every time I see you, you look different.

292
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:17,363
Really different.

293
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:24,803
Really?

294
00:33:26,363 --> 00:33:29,803
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

295
00:33:33,403 --> 00:33:34,683
It is a compliment.

296
00:33:41,523 --> 00:33:42,363
By the way,

297
00:33:43,043 --> 00:33:45,043
I never had a chance to thank you.

298
00:33:48,923 --> 00:33:50,963
So, thank you so much.

299
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:53,963
Thank you for everything you've done.

300
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:07,203
So, how many buildings did you go to?

301
00:34:09,203 --> 00:34:10,323
More than you can imagine.

302
00:34:15,523 --> 00:34:16,563
Your hair...

303
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,723
Is it too short?

304
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:22,443
No.

305
00:34:22,923 --> 00:34:23,843
This haircut is cute.

306
00:34:24,483 --> 00:34:25,843
You look adorable.

307
00:34:33,243 --> 00:34:35,763
It took me a lot of courage to cut it.

308
00:34:36,603 --> 00:34:38,843
I see it as a new start.

309
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:06,563
Hey.

310
00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:08,323
There's an ice cream truck.

311
00:35:08,643 --> 00:35:09,603
Do you want some?

312
00:35:10,043 --> 00:35:10,883
Yes.

313
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:40,203
Before I go, I want to go see Thomas

314
00:35:40,443 --> 00:35:41,443
and thank him.

315
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:44,083
He helped me out a lot.

316
00:35:44,523 --> 00:35:45,603
I'll go with you.

317
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:46,923
Why?

318
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:49,443
I'm worried you'll get lost
before you find him.

319
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:52,643
How is that possible?

320
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:54,323
He took good care of you.

321
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:55,603
I want to thank him too.

322
00:35:56,443 --> 00:35:58,323
How about we ask him out to dinner?

323
00:36:00,683 --> 00:36:01,523
Okay.

324
00:36:52,163 --> 00:36:53,123
Hey.

325
00:36:53,883 --> 00:36:55,763
They're eating so much.

326
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:58,443
You picked an expensive restaurant.

327
00:36:59,003 --> 00:37:00,523
I don't have that much money.

328
00:37:01,323 --> 00:37:02,963
It's fine. I'll take care of it.

329
00:37:13,683 --> 00:37:14,643
Lei.

330
00:37:15,963 --> 00:37:17,563
Thank you for treating us to dinner.

331
00:37:18,643 --> 00:37:19,523
You're welcome.

332
00:37:21,523 --> 00:37:25,043
Did you come from Shanghai
just to find Shancai?

333
00:37:26,003 --> 00:37:26,843
Yes.

334
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:30,203
Do you like Shancai?

335
00:37:32,243 --> 00:37:33,123
I do.

336
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:37,403
I like her too.

337
00:37:38,003 --> 00:37:39,243
When I met Shancai,

338
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:42,243
she told me that she liked me.

339
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,683
Hey.

340
00:37:45,403 --> 00:37:46,483
No, I didn't.

341
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:48,163
I mistook you for someone else.

342
00:37:48,243 --> 00:37:49,723
I thought the guy at the piano was...

343
00:37:54,643 --> 00:37:55,643
Who did you think it was?

344
00:37:57,043 --> 00:37:58,163
Was it Lei?

345
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:04,403
If Daoming Si doesn't like Shancai,

346
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,923
will Shancai date Lei?

347
00:38:13,883 --> 00:38:14,723
Will you?

348
00:38:19,763 --> 00:38:20,603
-Will you?
-Will you?

349
00:38:28,203 --> 00:38:30,683
Cut it out.
Or else I won't pay for your meals.

350
00:38:32,763 --> 00:38:34,283
To Shancai's happiness.

351
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,003
-To Shancai's happiness.
-To Shancai's happiness.

352
00:38:44,643 --> 00:38:45,803
Thank you.

353
00:38:50,723 --> 00:38:51,563
Thanks.

354
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:03,763
Lei.

355
00:39:07,563 --> 00:39:09,123
Hey, how much is it?

356
00:39:09,323 --> 00:39:10,883
I'll pay you once I get back.

357
00:39:11,403 --> 00:39:12,243
It's fine.

358
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:25,603
My wallet is gone.

359
00:39:50,603 --> 00:39:52,203
This is all I have.

360
00:39:56,443 --> 00:39:58,523
Thomas, put that away.

361
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:04,003
What should we do now?

362
00:42:47,763 --> 00:42:50,443
When you feel like crying, do a handstand,

363
00:42:51,923 --> 00:42:53,683
then your tears won't fall down.
