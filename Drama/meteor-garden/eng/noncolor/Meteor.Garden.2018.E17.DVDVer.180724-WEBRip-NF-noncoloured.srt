EPISODE 17

4
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:33,723
Shancai, look.

5
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:37,403
The photos taken in Canada received
a lot of likes after they were shared.

6
00:01:37,483 --> 00:01:38,403
Mine too.

7
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:41,483
But Qinghe seems a little unhappy.

8
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,083
Really? What did he say? Show me.

9
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:45,723
"Someone's forgotten this friend."

10
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:48,283
-I'll reply.
-What will you say?

11
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:51,203
"You're a pet."

12
00:01:51,363 --> 00:01:53,003
You're just making Qinghe madder.

13
00:01:54,163 --> 00:01:55,083
Ximen.

14
00:01:55,163 --> 00:01:56,763
QQ MESSAGE FROM XIMEN YAN

15
00:01:57,563 --> 00:01:59,283
I miss Canada so much.

16
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:02,003
Thinking back,
that place was so beautiful.

17
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:06,563
You little naive girl.

18
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:07,803
Don't be cheated by Ximen.

19
00:02:08,123 --> 00:02:09,203
I know.

20
00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:12,283
You're more long-winded
than my mom about him.

21
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:15,923
-Does your foot still hurt?
-No.

22
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,003
It's fine now.

23
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:19,323
Let's go sit over there.

24
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:22,723
I'm fine.

25
00:02:31,203 --> 00:02:34,123
Anyway, did you hear about Dabao
organizing a gathering?

26
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:35,083
Of course.

27
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:37,123
He invited our circle of friends, right?

28
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,563
Yes. Since graduating from high school,
I haven't seen the rest.

29
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:42,523
-I can't wait.
-Me too.

30
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:44,763
I really miss our high school days.

31
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:48,003
Back then, we only cared about studying
and knew nothing else.

32
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,083
I miss everyone so much.

33
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:53,483
Most of them said
that they're going to attend.

34
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:54,803
Most of them? Who's not coming?

35
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:59,003
Do you remember when we had
to line up for punishment?

36
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,643
Do you mean Yan Zhibu, "Excuse me,
sir. I need to go to the toilet."

37
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,523
Him? It's okay.
Our other friends will be going.

38
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:07,083
I haven't seen Yan Zhibu in a while.

39
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,563
-Yan Zhibu?
-Thinking about him makes me laugh.

40
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:11,843
Yan Zhibu was the clown
in our class, right?

41
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:14,003
Every time he got into trouble, he'd say,

42
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:16,043
"I'm fine. I'm good.

43
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:18,123
-No big deal."
-That's right.

44
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:19,123
That's the way he is.

45
00:03:20,883 --> 00:03:22,443
I wonder how they look now.

46
00:03:25,763 --> 00:03:26,803
I think

47
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:29,283
maybe we're the only ones
who became beautiful.

48
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,123
I bet Yan Zhibu is going to bully us
when he sees us.

49
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:33,803
Yes.

50
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:37,083
He's probably going to make us play
"One Shot."

51
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:39,043
Oh no. I don't want to.

52
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:40,163
You won't be able to dodge.

53
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:48,643
I found the way to win.

54
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,003
I'm going to use my ultimate move.

55
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,123
You said that just now.

56
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:56,323
Shut up.

57
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,883
Don't use your ultimate then.

58
00:03:57,963 --> 00:03:59,243
Why should I listen to you?

59
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:07,523
I lost again.

60
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:09,203
Because I can estimate my Fury.

61
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:11,563
Shut up. You're cheating.

62
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:14,803
I won't use my ultimate
in the next round as a handicap.

63
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:16,363
You said it yourself.

64
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:17,523
One more time.

65
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:18,523
I CALL THE SHOTS

66
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:19,603
I'M SLEEPY

67
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:22,763
Wait.

68
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,003
What?

69
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:25,763
Jing.

70
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:27,723
<i>Lei, how are you?</i>

71
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,443
Jing, I'm here too.

72
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:35,683
Are you coming back?

73
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:41,123
<i>I won't be going back
to see you guys anytime soon.</i>

74
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:48,243
It's okay.

75
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:51,243
Don't worry.
I'm taking good care of everyone.

76
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:00,003
Jing.

77
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:04,403
How is it going with the French guy?

78
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:07,843
Shancai and I are getting along nicely.

79
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,843
<i>Really? I'm happy for you.</i>

80
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:13,683
<i>My engagement has been cancelled.</i>

81
00:05:15,963 --> 00:05:16,803
Really?

82
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:19,923
Does that mean Lei has a chance now?

83
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:22,083
Let go. You're squishing me.

84
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:24,043
Say something.

85
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:27,723
Is it because of your job?

86
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:29,283
<i>Yes.</i>

87
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,923
<i>I don't want anything to hinder my dream.</i>

88
00:05:32,843 --> 00:05:35,003
<i>I think the press will hear
about the news soon.</i>

89
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:36,763
<i>So I called to tell you guys first.</i>

90
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:39,363
All right.

91
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:41,483
You take care.

92
00:05:42,803 --> 00:05:44,763
<i>I will. You guys take care too.</i>

93
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:46,723
We're waiting for your return, Jing.

94
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:49,123
-Bye.
-<i>Bye.</i>

95
00:05:58,643 --> 00:05:59,803
What are you scheming?

96
00:06:00,883 --> 00:06:01,843
Nothing.

97
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,283
Don't lie.

98
00:06:04,883 --> 00:06:07,163
If I win the next round, you'll tell me.

99
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:11,323
You need to win first.

100
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,563
I can't beat you at the game
but I can win with my brawn.

101
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:17,883
Okay, let me go.

102
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:18,843
Well?

103
00:06:19,323 --> 00:06:21,323
If you won't let go,
I'll tell Shancai to ignore you.

104
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:23,723
Shancai is my girlfriend.

105
00:06:24,163 --> 00:06:25,243
You don't get to decide.

106
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:29,203
Beg for mercy.
I'll let you go if you call me sir.

107
00:06:29,283 --> 00:06:30,163
In your dreams.

108
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:46,043
Everyone's here early.

109
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:47,003
-Hi.
-Hi.

110
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:47,923
Hi, long time no see.

111
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:49,363
-Long time no see.
-Shancai is here.

112
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,563
-Hello.
-Hello.

113
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,763
-You're here.
-Is it you?

114
00:06:56,203 --> 00:06:57,563
Not the real one.

115
00:06:58,563 --> 00:06:59,523
Who are you then?

116
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:02,483
Your imitation.

117
00:07:03,043 --> 00:07:04,363
Dong Shancai.

118
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:06,563
Yan Zhibu.

119
00:07:06,683 --> 00:07:08,763
-Long time no see.
-Yes, indeed.

120
00:07:10,523 --> 00:07:13,643
I'm surprised you still remember
our signals from <i>Journey to the West</i>.

121
00:07:14,123 --> 00:07:15,683
Of course I do.

122
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:17,723
Qinghe and I still play in groups.

123
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:20,563
We always bring up
the dragon you had before.

124
00:07:20,883 --> 00:07:21,803
That's right.

125
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,843
Zhibu's beast doesn't even have a takedown

126
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,603
but he leveled up to 70.

127
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:28,243
You're criticizing me?

128
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,203
You two weren't that good either.

129
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,523
Who was it that didn't receive
double experience?

130
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:37,923
And came to help the quest
without potions and I had to give mine?

131
00:07:39,403 --> 00:07:40,243
Okay.

132
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:42,283
Let's not talk about the past.

133
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:43,203
Yes.

134
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:45,123
Shancai is more beautiful now.

135
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:49,403
Don't you start making fun of me.

136
00:07:49,963 --> 00:07:50,963
I'm not.

137
00:07:51,643 --> 00:07:54,483
So many guys were interested in you
back in high school.

138
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:56,563
Like who?

139
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,443
-Who?
-So many.

140
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:02,683
The guys that were punished with you
used to adore you.

141
00:08:02,763 --> 00:08:03,963
Yes!

142
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:05,323
And me.

143
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:08,003
And Qinghe.

144
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:09,883
And them too.

145
00:08:10,443 --> 00:08:12,323
Yes.

146
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:14,843
That's enough.

147
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:18,283
Xiaoyou, he's such a riot. Take him down.

148
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:19,883
Okay.

149
00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:23,803
-You threw it at me?
-Come on.

150
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:25,323
Come on.

151
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:26,283
Come get me.

152
00:08:26,803 --> 00:08:27,643
Here.

153
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:33,203
Yeah.

154
00:08:34,163 --> 00:08:35,003
Okay.

155
00:08:35,843 --> 00:08:36,883
I admit defeat, okay?

156
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:40,883
Are we going to be kicked out like this?

157
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:44,563
Let's punish Zhibu who started it.

158
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:45,883
I'm okay with that.

159
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:48,123
Qinghe too.

160
00:08:54,203 --> 00:08:55,163
What?

161
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:56,723
Punished? How?

162
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:00,483
We'll punish you to do that.

163
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:05,123
Forget it.

164
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:07,323
One shot!

165
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:08,723
One shot!

166
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:10,283
-One shot!
-Okay. Let's do it.

167
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,643
One shot!

168
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:18,083
There's no one else. Only Si and the guys.

169
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:20,523
You can ask him.

170
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:23,203
What?

171
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:29,403
"I, Daosi, is saying
that Ming is really..."

172
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:34,723
Hello?

173
00:09:34,803 --> 00:09:37,163
I'm Daoming Si. What he said is true.

174
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:40,363
Hey.

175
00:09:40,883 --> 00:09:42,843
I've been repeating this over and over.

176
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:43,963
Are we done?

177
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:45,243
I've got no choice.

178
00:09:45,523 --> 00:09:47,163
We didn't invite anyone to Canada.

179
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:48,883
Xinhui and Baihe came along.

180
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:50,643
Many people are complaining.

181
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:53,003
It must be those lame girls.

182
00:09:53,563 --> 00:09:54,963
No, Qinghe Chen too.

183
00:09:55,523 --> 00:09:57,643
Qinghe can be categorized
as a lame girl too.

184
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:03,643
Qinghe is at a high school reunion.

185
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,883
Xiaoyou shared photos in the group.

186
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:09,323
Shancai looks so dumb.

187
00:10:09,403 --> 00:10:10,483
Let me see.

188
00:10:11,763 --> 00:10:13,043
See? Such a dumb look.

189
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:14,203
SHANCAI'S DUMB EXPRESSION

190
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:15,323
Where is this?

191
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:17,883
A restaurant on Huashan Road.

192
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:19,803
I don't know the place.

193
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:26,243
I'm going there.

194
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:27,963
Si.

195
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,483
They're having a reunion.
It doesn't concern you.

196
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,723
I don't think it's okay.

197
00:10:31,803 --> 00:10:33,203
Why not?

198
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:34,563
I think it's perfectly fine.

199
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:37,803
Yeah, it doesn't sound
like a crazy stalker at all.

200
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:41,523
Hey, who are you calling a stalker?

201
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:43,763
I just happen to be nearby.

202
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:46,043
Two thousand meters is nearby?

203
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:48,483
Are you saying you're like
star-crossed lovers?

204
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:53,403
I'm going to see my girlfriend.

205
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:54,563
What's wrong with that?

206
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,723
Hopefully, Shancai thinks so too.

207
00:11:08,203 --> 00:11:09,403
Should we follow him?

208
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:14,283
CUMIN POWDER

209
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:17,003
Oh my gosh.

210
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:30,203
Gosh, Shancai.

211
00:11:30,603 --> 00:11:33,003
Do you think it's salty or sweet?

212
00:11:34,883 --> 00:11:36,683
It's too gross. I'm not playing

213
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,203
-Me neither.
-No.

214
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:42,003
It's been so long. Nobody gets to escape.

215
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,043
All right.

216
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:44,203
Everyone, get ready.

217
00:11:44,723 --> 00:11:47,363
Black or White.

218
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:00,203
Drink.

219
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:02,163
-Drink.
-Okay.

220
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:03,283
-Drink.
-I'll do it.

221
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:04,883
-Drink.
-All right, I will.

222
00:12:08,683 --> 00:12:09,523
I'll go first.

223
00:12:11,283 --> 00:12:12,563
Is Zhibu trying to be a hero?

224
00:12:12,643 --> 00:12:14,043
Everyone needs to drink it.

225
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,443
Yes.

226
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:18,483
Drink.

227
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:20,443
Drink!

228
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:22,083
Drink!

229
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:23,083
-Drink!
-I'll do it.

230
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:24,563
Drink!

231
00:12:27,843 --> 00:12:29,483
Are you going to drink this gross thing?

232
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:32,843
Is this even wine?

233
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:35,403
Daoming Si.

234
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,323
What are you doing here?

235
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:41,403
I came to pick up my girlfriend.
Is there any problem?

236
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:47,003
-Shancai has a boyfriend?
-Yeah.

237
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,443
-Really?
-I didn't know.

238
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:49,923
-Since when?
-She's dating?

239
00:12:50,163 --> 00:12:52,003
-Shancai's boyfriend is handsome.
-Is he?

240
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,043
-Who is he?
-Shancai.

241
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:55,043
You have a boyfriend?

242
00:12:57,363 --> 00:12:58,203
No.

243
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:01,363
He's my senior in university.

244
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:06,003
She doesn't recognize you
as her boyfriend.

245
00:13:06,923 --> 00:13:08,563
You better not harass our Shancai.

246
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:18,003
He's my buddy, Daoming Si.

247
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,283
We are the F4.

248
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:21,523
-What's F4?
-F4?

249
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:22,603
-What?
-Never heard of it.

250
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:23,603
It's such a dated name.

251
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:24,603
Yeah, so ancient.

252
00:13:24,683 --> 00:13:26,243
Like the F4 key on the keyboard?

253
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:27,283
Yeah.

254
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,523
F4? I've never heard of it.

255
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:41,003
Why are you causing trouble?

256
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,603
Causing trouble?
I came here just to see you.

257
00:13:45,963 --> 00:13:47,643
I'm fine and well. What is there to see?

258
00:13:48,123 --> 00:13:49,003
You've seen me.

259
00:13:49,723 --> 00:13:50,563
You can leave.

260
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:52,363
Yeah.

261
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,323
We're having a reunion.

262
00:13:54,923 --> 00:13:56,163
It's none of your business.

263
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:59,603
Do you want to pay to take part?

264
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:02,203
You don't have to pay.

265
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:05,763
Just drink this.

266
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:08,323
And we can be friends.

267
00:14:16,163 --> 00:14:17,563
Shancai, let's go.

268
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:19,923
Why should I go?

269
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:21,803
Hanging out with such lowlifes

270
00:14:21,883 --> 00:14:23,523
at a lousy reunion will make you
like them too.

271
00:14:24,723 --> 00:14:26,283
-Who's a lowlife?
-Yeah.

272
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:27,483
Then you shouldn't have come.

273
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:29,203
-What the hell?
-Who are you calling

274
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:30,803
a lowlife in front of my friends?

275
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:33,563
-That's right.
-What the hell?

276
00:14:34,763 --> 00:14:35,643
Fine.

277
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:38,043
I'm a lowlife. I'm no match for you.

278
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,923
Shancai.

279
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:43,123
Don't.

280
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:44,843
Everyone's staring.

281
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:00,643
If you have a problem with our reunion,

282
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,803
we don't welcome you either.

283
00:15:04,443 --> 00:15:05,603
You should leave.

284
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,043
Shancai.

285
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,923
Who exactly is this guy?

286
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:13,403
He told me to leave.

287
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:17,483
You're hanging out with these
annoying people, drinking gross drinks,

288
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,523
and flirting so nonchalantly?

289
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:23,883
Daoming Si, Shaolin Si or whoever.

290
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:27,323
I won't let you off so easily

291
00:15:28,523 --> 00:15:30,043
if you dare lay a hand on Shancai.

292
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:33,123
You can leave.

293
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:36,323
He hit him.

294
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:39,163
Oh my god. Is he okay?

295
00:15:39,883 --> 00:15:41,283
Si is too rash.

296
00:15:41,363 --> 00:15:44,603
He just made some progress
and already brandishing his authority.

297
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:52,883
My instinct tells me Si will be out soon.

298
00:15:56,003 --> 00:15:57,123
Why do you think so?

299
00:15:57,483 --> 00:15:59,443
What if Si is having fun inside?

300
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:01,363
Why aren't you going in then?

301
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:06,363
My instinct says it's dangerous inside.

302
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,603
Quick, the hospital is ahead.

303
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:14,003
-Go to the hospital.
-Is he okay?

304
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,123
-He's bleeding.
-Yes.

305
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:16,123
Hurry, they're here.

306
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:17,363
How did this happen?

307
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,483
What's his deal?

308
00:16:24,643 --> 00:16:25,523
Daoming Si.

309
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:27,603
I've had enough of you.

310
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,883
Please just disappear
from my sight right now.

311
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:34,883
Why are you angry?

312
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:37,923
You should thank me for saving you
from those low-life friends.

313
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:40,443
Otherwise, you'd be stinking by now.

314
00:16:47,403 --> 00:16:48,243
Sure.

315
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:50,923
They're dirty and smelly.

316
00:16:52,883 --> 00:16:55,363
But they are all my good friends
from high school.

317
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,643
You have no idea how much
I was looking forward to today.

318
00:17:01,283 --> 00:17:02,523
I hate you.

319
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,403
Daoming Si. You've crossed the line.

320
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:24,003
Shancai, wait for me!

321
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:55,843
How embarrassing.

322
00:17:57,123 --> 00:17:59,443
How am I going to explain to them?

323
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:02,883
It's okay. I'll talk to them for you.

324
00:18:02,963 --> 00:18:04,163
They'll understand.

325
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:09,163
But, you should've told us
about Daoming Si coming.

326
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:11,243
I had no idea he was going to show up.

327
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:13,163
I didn't ask him to.

328
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:17,643
But he really crossed the line this time.

329
00:18:20,363 --> 00:18:23,003
I was really looking forward
to the gathering today.

330
00:18:24,363 --> 00:18:25,403
It's okay.

331
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:27,563
I'll talk to them. Don't worry.

332
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:37,643
Here you go.

333
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,083
Eat more.

334
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,403
Time is passing so fast.
It's almost the new year.

335
00:18:47,763 --> 00:18:48,923
It's been a great year.

336
00:18:49,123 --> 00:18:51,123
See how our Shancai
is growing up beautifully.

337
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:53,603
I've mastered
the Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles.

338
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:56,083
And my dear found a good job.

339
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:57,563
Awesome.

340
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:02,643
Anyway, shouldn't we buy something
as new year gifts to Daoming Si?

341
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:05,043
New year gifts?

342
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:07,043
We're not that close with him.

343
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:09,523
That can be fixed with more visits.

344
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,123
What do you think we should buy?

345
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:16,043
What makes you think Daoming Si
will like the things we can afford?

346
00:19:16,803 --> 00:19:18,323
It's the thought that matters.

347
00:19:18,403 --> 00:19:19,643
He will understand.

348
00:19:20,203 --> 00:19:22,083
How about buying a fruit hamper?

349
00:19:23,683 --> 00:19:24,683
All right.

350
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,243
From now on,

351
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:28,443
I don't want to hear that name again.

352
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,283
Okay, I won't say it.

353
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:33,203
Don't be angry. We won't buy anything.

354
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:34,363
You can.

355
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:37,723
But we won't buy anything for that jerk.

356
00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:48,603
All done. Keep the wound dry.

357
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,643
-Okay. Thanks.
-You're welcome.

358
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,083
Thank you.

359
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,963
Shancai, why are you here?

360
00:19:59,363 --> 00:20:00,523
I don't have a concussion.

361
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:02,603
The nurse said that I can go home.

362
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:03,923
I came to see you.

363
00:20:04,043 --> 00:20:05,803
I'm so sorry you got hurt.

364
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:07,883
Don't worry about it. We're friends.

365
00:20:08,243 --> 00:20:09,283
Don't take it so bad.

366
00:20:09,563 --> 00:20:10,643
But I'm worried about you.

367
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,403
-Did you argue with your boyfriend?
-No.

368
00:20:13,803 --> 00:20:15,963
Besides, he's not my boyfriend.

369
00:20:17,003 --> 00:20:17,883
Anyway, Zhibu.

370
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,523
What did you say to your mom?

371
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:23,083
I told her I got injured playing football
with friends.

372
00:20:23,443 --> 00:20:24,443
She believed me.

373
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:26,323
I'm fine. Don't worry.

374
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:27,243
Zhibu.

375
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:29,483
Dad wanted me to settle the bill.

376
00:20:29,723 --> 00:20:31,723
Shancai, this is my brother, Shunping.

377
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:33,163
Brother?

378
00:20:33,243 --> 00:20:35,403
How come I never heard about him before?

379
00:20:35,643 --> 00:20:37,043
We are stepbrothers.

380
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:40,083
Our dad divorced his mom
and then married my mom.

381
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:41,483
A brother is a brother.

382
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:42,523
No need to say more.

383
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,283
Shancai.

384
00:20:45,363 --> 00:20:46,883
My brother is really smart.

385
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:48,403
He's a freshman at Mingde too.

386
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:50,043
Really?

387
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,683
I'm in Nutrition. How about you?

388
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,603
I'm doing a less popular subject.

389
00:20:54,803 --> 00:20:56,003
I'm doing Mining.

390
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,043
Unheard of, right?

391
00:20:58,323 --> 00:20:59,643
Okay. I'm done.

392
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:01,163
-Let's go.
-Okay.

393
00:21:02,723 --> 00:21:04,563
-I brought fruits.
-I'll carry it.

394
00:21:04,803 --> 00:21:05,643
Thanks.

395
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,083
Zhibu, wait for me.

396
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:18,763
Listen.

397
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:21,843
This is low risk, high reward.

398
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:23,323
You'll be rewarded handsomely.

399
00:21:23,643 --> 00:21:25,523
What's the slogan nowadays?

400
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:28,163
If you don't manage your money,
it will bid goodbye.

401
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:31,283
If you rather say goodbye to money,

402
00:21:31,363 --> 00:21:33,043
you can say goodbye to me.

403
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,603
The investment rate this year
peaked at 200 percent.

404
00:21:37,203 --> 00:21:38,883
It's the best time to invest.

405
00:21:39,763 --> 00:21:41,003
I will be frank with you.

406
00:21:41,523 --> 00:21:43,243
Even I invested in it.

407
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,683
Let's do it then.

408
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,243
Happy New Year.

409
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:48,643
I wish you a prosperous one.

410
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:52,363
Dad, why are you so happy?

411
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:54,083
I just bagged a huge deal.

412
00:21:54,723 --> 00:21:56,083
With my smooth talking skills,

413
00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:59,683
our family will soon
be at Daoming Si's level

414
00:21:59,843 --> 00:22:01,043
based on company shares.

415
00:22:01,763 --> 00:22:02,683
Dad.

416
00:22:03,163 --> 00:22:05,083
Can you stop mentioning Daoming Si?

417
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:08,483
Did you two argue again?

418
00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:11,443
He went and started a fight
at my high school reunion.

419
00:22:11,523 --> 00:22:13,083
He ridiculed my friends.

420
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:15,723
I'll never forgive him.

421
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:19,723
Okay. Let's not talk about it.

422
00:22:19,803 --> 00:22:21,923
Let's eat. We've got delicious food.

423
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:25,083
-Have some prawns.
-Wait, let me take a photo.

424
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:27,203
Hurry and eat.

425
00:22:28,243 --> 00:22:29,243
Look here.

426
00:22:30,243 --> 00:22:32,003
Happy new year.

427
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,723
Have a prosperous year.

428
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:36,123
-Let's dig in.
-Okay.

429
00:22:47,443 --> 00:22:50,603
I apologize to you
from the bottom of my heart.

430
00:22:52,843 --> 00:22:54,083
Look at that face.

431
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:56,963
You don't seem sincere at all.
Try imitating Lei's innocent expression.

432
00:23:07,203 --> 00:23:08,603
Yes, that's right.

433
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:10,643
Now, repeat after Ximen.

434
00:23:11,763 --> 00:23:14,923
My harsh behavior
has brought harm to your gentle soul.

435
00:23:17,883 --> 00:23:20,603
For that, I'm ashamed and sorry.

436
00:23:25,963 --> 00:23:27,203
"My harsh..."

437
00:23:28,723 --> 00:23:30,483
I can't. It's too phony.

438
00:23:31,483 --> 00:23:32,523
Si.

439
00:23:33,763 --> 00:23:36,363
We stayed up late all night
to draft this letter of apology.

440
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:39,163
Who else would help you if not for us?

441
00:23:39,843 --> 00:23:41,723
He's the one who got on my nerves.

442
00:23:42,283 --> 00:23:43,563
It doesn't matter who started it.

443
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:46,283
The point is, Shancai is angry.

444
00:23:52,523 --> 00:23:53,763
Just look at him.

445
00:23:54,403 --> 00:23:57,203
If you were Shancai,
would you forgive him?

446
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:02,483
You mean someone who beat up
my friend without reason?

447
00:24:02,763 --> 00:24:03,723
Yes.

448
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:05,483
Never in my life.

449
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,763
School is starting soon.

450
00:24:11,443 --> 00:24:13,283
You need to figure out how to make up.

451
00:24:18,563 --> 00:24:19,563
Let's continue.

452
00:24:22,643 --> 00:24:23,523
Hurry up.

453
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:34,723
"My rash behavior has brought harm
to your gentle soul.

454
00:24:35,603 --> 00:24:36,563
I..."

455
00:24:37,363 --> 00:24:38,683
And then what?

456
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,803
"For that, I'm ashamed and sorry.

457
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:45,123
I hope the beautiful and merciful you
will be able to forgive my stupidity.

458
00:24:45,523 --> 00:24:47,403
Don't leave me in the dark."

459
00:24:53,523 --> 00:24:55,403
Since you've memorized it,
you can do it then.

460
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:20,243
The Nutrition Class is ahead.

461
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:21,803
Shancai will be there.

462
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:26,083
Qinghe, come here.

463
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,243
Who did you call?

464
00:25:34,323 --> 00:25:36,843
You, of course. Who else?

465
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,683
I'm still pissed at Daoming Si.

466
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:45,883
Stay out of it.

467
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:48,603
Si will settle it with Shancai himself.

468
00:25:48,683 --> 00:25:49,603
I...

469
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:52,083
Shancai's problem is my problem.

470
00:25:53,483 --> 00:25:54,403
Listen up.

471
00:25:56,563 --> 00:25:57,883
I'm not scared of you.

472
00:25:59,763 --> 00:26:02,483
It's Daoming Si's fault
for making Shancai unhappy

473
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:04,083
and ruining our gathering.

474
00:26:07,843 --> 00:26:08,723
So...

475
00:26:09,323 --> 00:26:11,563
That guy at the reunion...

476
00:26:11,643 --> 00:26:13,963
You mean Zhibu?

477
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:16,763
He's recovered.
He beat me in a basketball...

478
00:26:18,403 --> 00:26:19,363
Basketball game.

479
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:20,963
You must be bad.

480
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:27,403
Si.

481
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:28,723
She's here.

482
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:39,723
The first sentence is,

483
00:26:40,043 --> 00:26:40,963
"Hello, Shancai."

484
00:26:42,363 --> 00:26:43,283
I know.

485
00:26:51,763 --> 00:26:52,803
Shancai.

486
00:27:05,043 --> 00:27:06,723
Morning, Qinghe. Let's go to class.

487
00:27:17,923 --> 00:27:19,003
I'm leaving. Bye.

488
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:23,083
Shancai, Daoming Si got here so early.

489
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,803
Stop right there!

490
00:27:32,043 --> 00:27:32,923
Shancai.

491
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:35,043
Are you sure it's okay to ignore him?

492
00:27:35,163 --> 00:27:37,203
-I can't be bothered.
-I'm not getting through to you.

493
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,003
I told her to stop and she disobeyed.

494
00:27:40,323 --> 00:27:41,603
She's the rude one.

495
00:27:49,443 --> 00:27:52,283
You guys seemed not to care
about the holiday assignment.

496
00:27:55,683 --> 00:27:59,083
Only three students in the whole class
received above 90 points.

497
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:01,483
The three are

498
00:28:03,163 --> 00:28:04,883
-Li Zhen.
-Here.

499
00:28:06,963 --> 00:28:08,483
-Dong Shancai.
-Here.

500
00:28:08,843 --> 00:28:10,003
You're amazing.

501
00:28:10,843 --> 00:28:13,283
-And the last one is Li Xinhui.
-Here.

502
00:28:15,603 --> 00:28:16,443
Good.

503
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:19,403
As for the rest, redo the assignment.

504
00:28:20,443 --> 00:28:21,563
Dismissed.

505
00:28:21,963 --> 00:28:23,643
-No.
-Damn.

506
00:28:25,043 --> 00:28:26,043
No way.

507
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,163
Unlucky.

508
00:28:27,523 --> 00:28:29,603
Shancai, Li Zhen, congratulations.

509
00:28:29,683 --> 00:28:31,043
You two improved a lot.

510
00:28:31,683 --> 00:28:33,043
I'm sure you worked hard.

511
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:35,403
Li Zhen helped me a lot.

512
00:28:35,483 --> 00:28:37,563
No, you worked hard on your own.

513
00:28:38,123 --> 00:28:40,803
My results are still trailing
behind you guys.

514
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:43,443
Shancai.

515
00:28:43,523 --> 00:28:46,123
Remember to team up with me
for the next assignment.

516
00:28:46,203 --> 00:28:48,163
Stop taking Shancai from me, okay?

517
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:50,243
Does Shancai belong to you?

518
00:28:55,003 --> 00:28:56,523
How do you do your reports?

519
00:28:57,163 --> 00:28:58,003
You can do it.

520
00:28:58,683 --> 00:28:59,603
All the best.

521
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:13,603
<i>FOOD NUTRITION</i>

522
00:29:22,403 --> 00:29:23,323
Thanks.

523
00:29:23,923 --> 00:29:25,923
-Shunping.
-Shancai.

524
00:29:26,043 --> 00:29:27,203
We meet again.

525
00:29:27,403 --> 00:29:28,443
What a coincidence.

526
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:32,803
Is Zhibu doing well?

527
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,483
Has he fully recovered?

528
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:38,363
The coach must be worried
after what happened.

529
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:41,163
My dad is actually was very worried
about Zhibu.

530
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:44,603
He took the university exam once
and didn't do too well.

531
00:29:44,923 --> 00:29:46,643
He's often out with his low-life friends.

532
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,443
And now he got hospitalized.

533
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:52,883
I could tell that
he didn't fall and injure himself.

534
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:54,363
He was beaten.

535
00:29:54,603 --> 00:29:57,643
He must have fought with someone
at the reunion that day.

536
00:29:58,523 --> 00:29:59,483
It wasn't like that.

537
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:00,923
If Daoming Si hadn't...

538
00:30:01,563 --> 00:30:04,283
acted so rashly,
it wouldn't have happened.

539
00:30:05,883 --> 00:30:08,843
Don't misunderstand your brother.
He's a good guy.

540
00:30:09,523 --> 00:30:11,363
Yes, he's a little naughty sometimes,

541
00:30:11,963 --> 00:30:15,163
but he always took care of us
back in high school.

542
00:30:15,403 --> 00:30:17,963
This is actually the first time
someone defended him.

543
00:30:18,963 --> 00:30:20,203
Hearing you say this,

544
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:22,083
I might have ignored him in the past.

545
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:23,963
I'm a terrible brother.

546
00:30:24,603 --> 00:30:25,723
Don't say that.

547
00:30:26,043 --> 00:30:27,123
You're nice too.

548
00:30:27,443 --> 00:30:29,723
You went to visit him
at the hospital, right?

549
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:31,323
Shancai.

550
00:30:31,683 --> 00:30:32,643
You're so nice.

551
00:30:33,683 --> 00:30:35,163
Can I be friends with you?

552
00:30:35,803 --> 00:30:36,763
Of course.

553
00:30:36,843 --> 00:30:38,443
Zhibu's brother is my brother too.

554
00:30:41,483 --> 00:30:43,683
Si. How long will you stand here?

555
00:30:44,403 --> 00:30:46,323
I wouldn't forgive you if I were Shancai.

556
00:30:46,403 --> 00:30:48,323
I've already apologized.
What else does she want?

557
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,003
Please, Si.

558
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,323
"Stop right there."

559
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,003
Is that an apology?

560
00:30:53,563 --> 00:30:56,283
It's considered one in his vocabulary.

561
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:00,283
Since you refuse to apologize,

562
00:31:00,883 --> 00:31:03,203
why not visit the guy you beat up?

563
00:31:03,283 --> 00:31:04,603
Maybe that will appease Shancai.

564
00:31:05,403 --> 00:31:06,363
Yes.

565
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:07,923
You beat him up real good.

566
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,683
You should at least apologize.

567
00:31:10,723 --> 00:31:11,683
You guys are annoying.

568
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:13,923
My brother actually
played basketball a few days ago.

569
00:31:14,243 --> 00:31:17,003
I think it was with that Qinghe guy
from your class.

570
00:31:17,163 --> 00:31:19,803
He supposedly wanted to beat him
while he's injured.

571
00:31:20,043 --> 00:31:22,123
-And?
-But he failed.

572
00:31:22,203 --> 00:31:24,403
That Qinghe lost pretty badly.

573
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:26,043
That sounds just like Qinghe.

574
00:31:26,123 --> 00:31:27,283
Are you done?

575
00:31:27,523 --> 00:31:29,043
Are you guys my friends or Shancai's?

576
00:31:29,123 --> 00:31:30,803
-Isn't that Daoming Si?
-We're helping you

577
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:31,963
because we're your friends.

578
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,083
Why are we hiding?

579
00:31:33,403 --> 00:31:35,163
Because I don't want to see him.

580
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,243
What?

581
00:31:39,363 --> 00:31:40,803
I want to hear what they're saying.

582
00:31:42,723 --> 00:31:43,683
If you don't yield,

583
00:31:43,883 --> 00:31:45,963
Shancai is the type that will
ignore you forever.

584
00:31:46,163 --> 00:31:47,483
Ignore me then.

585
00:31:47,563 --> 00:31:48,723
What's the big deal?

586
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:51,083
A bad-tempered tomboy like her

587
00:31:51,163 --> 00:31:54,243
with short and stubby legs
like a frog can stay away.

588
00:31:54,363 --> 00:31:55,443
I have nothing to lose.

589
00:31:57,003 --> 00:31:58,963
They aren't talking about you, right?

590
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:03,083
You're right.

591
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:04,323
She lacks femininity.

592
00:32:04,963 --> 00:32:07,003
She's clumsy and stubborn too.

593
00:32:07,563 --> 00:32:08,803
We never saw her as a girl.

594
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:10,323
I agree.

595
00:32:10,723 --> 00:32:12,763
But she's exactly the fierce woman
that you like.

596
00:32:14,563 --> 00:32:15,843
Me? Like her?

597
00:32:16,003 --> 00:32:16,923
Yeah right.

598
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:20,043
She's the one who's always staring at me
with those beady cow eyes,

599
00:32:20,123 --> 00:32:21,763
begging me to be with her.

600
00:32:22,323 --> 00:32:23,563
Do I look like a cow?

601
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:24,683
No.

602
00:32:24,763 --> 00:32:27,163
She should be grateful
that I accepted her flaws

603
00:32:27,243 --> 00:32:28,643
and her nagging.

604
00:32:28,723 --> 00:32:30,643
I don't want a water buffalo.

605
00:32:30,843 --> 00:32:32,443
You and Ms. Zhuang said the same thing.

606
00:32:32,563 --> 00:32:33,923
She called her a water buffalo too.

607
00:32:34,323 --> 00:32:37,083
Yes. Every time she got angry,

608
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,523
her eyes would get really huge.

609
00:32:38,643 --> 00:32:40,243
She would huff and puff.

610
00:32:40,323 --> 00:32:42,323
Just like a beady-eyed frog.

611
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:43,363
Just like this, right?

612
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:48,803
You can imitate Shancai so well.

613
00:32:50,523 --> 00:32:51,763
They're making fun of you.

614
00:32:51,923 --> 00:32:53,083
I'll show them.

615
00:32:53,163 --> 00:32:55,043
Daoming Si, you bastard. Retard!

616
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:03,643
Get going.

617
00:33:07,243 --> 00:33:09,283
Did you hear someone calling Si?

618
00:33:10,123 --> 00:33:11,603
I thought I imagined it.

619
00:33:12,163 --> 00:33:13,643
I heard "retard" too.

620
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:16,843
Who dare criticize me? Show yourself!

621
00:33:31,563 --> 00:33:32,483
Are you okay?

622
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,323
We ran far away from them.
I don't think they'll find us.

623
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:39,203
You almost gave me a heart attack.

624
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:41,603
I was surprised that I said that myself.

625
00:33:42,243 --> 00:33:43,803
Why did I suddenly lose control?

626
00:33:44,003 --> 00:33:45,603
Thankfully, we got away.

627
00:33:45,883 --> 00:33:47,083
It felt good though

628
00:33:48,043 --> 00:33:49,403
thinking back on it.

629
00:33:49,683 --> 00:33:50,643
I think so too.

630
00:33:50,843 --> 00:33:52,483
I feel like I vented my anger.

631
00:33:52,883 --> 00:33:54,203
It's a rare chance.

632
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:58,483
The timing, place and people had to align.

633
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:01,563
You know what?

634
00:34:02,203 --> 00:34:04,443
I wish I had known you
as soon as I joined Mingde.

635
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,643
I think I'd enjoy those days more.

636
00:34:08,243 --> 00:34:11,443
Actually, I heard about you
and what happened.

637
00:34:11,643 --> 00:34:13,123
I've met you before too.

638
00:34:14,003 --> 00:34:14,923
Really?

639
00:34:15,003 --> 00:34:18,443
I saw you when you delivered
an order to our house.

640
00:34:19,203 --> 00:34:22,803
I think you looked
really nice on the bike.

641
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:25,243
Your hair was billowing.

642
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,403
Just like a leading actress in a movie.

643
00:34:28,003 --> 00:34:29,683
After that, I ordered
from your shop a lot.

644
00:34:30,163 --> 00:34:31,563
It wasn't always you who delivered.

645
00:34:32,723 --> 00:34:34,083
But the food is really good.

646
00:34:35,123 --> 00:34:35,963
I didn't expect

647
00:34:36,043 --> 00:34:38,283
you would win the special award
at the cooking competition.

648
00:34:38,923 --> 00:34:42,763
I guess it's harder to order
for delivery now.

649
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:47,043
Next time, you can come to my house
and I'll cook for you.

650
00:34:52,843 --> 00:34:55,603
When I was in high school,
your brother, me,

651
00:34:55,683 --> 00:34:58,683
Qinghe and the rest
often ate the corn from this shop.

652
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,603
Really?

653
00:35:00,643 --> 00:35:02,323
But after we entered university,

654
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:05,443
we became occupied with our own things.

655
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:07,643
It was hard to meet up.

656
00:35:08,643 --> 00:35:11,883
That's why I really anticipated
the gathering that time.

657
00:35:12,363 --> 00:35:15,003
If you are free and want to hang out

658
00:35:15,163 --> 00:35:17,723
or if you crave for corn, you can call me.

659
00:35:17,843 --> 00:35:19,723
We study at the same place anyway.

660
00:35:20,443 --> 00:35:22,003
We can call Zhibu too.

661
00:35:30,043 --> 00:35:30,923
What?

662
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:32,443
Do you want a bite of my corn?

663
00:35:33,203 --> 00:35:34,443
Okay, here you go.

664
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:38,323
Hey, that's a big bite! Give it back!

665
00:35:38,443 --> 00:35:39,283
Give it back.

666
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:46,483
There's only one now.

667
00:35:46,763 --> 00:35:48,443
You can have it.

668
00:35:49,603 --> 00:35:50,563
Okay.

669
00:35:50,923 --> 00:35:52,163
So now we're considered

670
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:53,683
bosom buddies, yes?

671
00:35:54,323 --> 00:35:55,443
Bosom buddies?

672
00:35:55,523 --> 00:35:57,363
Hello, you're a guy, okay?

673
00:35:57,843 --> 00:35:59,523
You can call me your buddy then.

674
00:35:59,723 --> 00:36:02,483
Next time you run into Daoming Si,
you won't have to hide.

675
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:04,603
I'll protect you.

676
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:12,003
-Who is this?
-It's none of your business.

677
00:36:16,563 --> 00:36:19,603
The one who called me a retard
was you, right?

678
00:36:19,723 --> 00:36:22,443
I was standing up for my girlfriend.
What's the problem?

679
00:36:23,243 --> 00:36:24,723
Shunping, what did you say?

680
00:36:25,723 --> 00:36:28,163
Shancai, have you lost your mind?

681
00:36:28,483 --> 00:36:32,523
Why are you flirting
with such a pathetic guy?

682
00:36:35,603 --> 00:36:37,963
Why do you care who I'm flirting with?

683
00:36:38,523 --> 00:36:41,523
In your mind,
everyone apart from yourself is pathetic.

684
00:36:43,003 --> 00:36:44,683
Why? Are you jealous?

685
00:36:45,523 --> 00:36:47,683
Do you feel uneasy every time
Shancai is out of sight?

686
00:36:47,763 --> 00:36:49,443
You lash out when things
don't go your way.

687
00:36:50,003 --> 00:36:52,403
Are you still a suckling child
that can't live without Shancai?

688
00:36:53,203 --> 00:36:54,043
It's too bad.

689
00:36:54,123 --> 00:36:56,123
You have no idea what Shancai likes.

690
00:36:56,203 --> 00:36:57,923
She enjoys eating corn with me

691
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:00,043
more than being with you.

692
00:37:02,283 --> 00:37:03,163
Say it again.

693
00:37:03,483 --> 00:37:04,803
Stop it, Daoming Si.

694
00:37:04,883 --> 00:37:06,523
What? Why should I shut up?

695
00:37:07,163 --> 00:37:08,043
Shancai.

696
00:37:08,203 --> 00:37:09,483
You need to be clear with him.

697
00:37:10,123 --> 00:37:13,203
If you don't reject him,
he'll pester you forever.

698
00:37:14,323 --> 00:37:15,243
One more word...

699
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:17,803
Daoming Si, stop! Let him go.

700
00:37:20,723 --> 00:37:21,563
Let go.

701
00:37:24,163 --> 00:37:25,483
-Are you okay, Shunping?
-I'm fine.

702
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,243
Daoming Si.

703
00:37:28,923 --> 00:37:30,643
Why must you always be this way?

704
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,923
I feel suffocated.

705
00:37:33,683 --> 00:37:35,163
Please just let me go, okay?

706
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:36,843
Shancai.

707
00:37:37,403 --> 00:37:38,283
Let's go.

708
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,243
Get away from him.

709
00:37:44,203 --> 00:37:45,643
Do you want some corn?

710
00:37:46,403 --> 00:37:47,283
You can have it.

711
00:38:00,323 --> 00:38:01,523
Dong Shancai!

712
00:38:10,363 --> 00:38:11,323
I like you.

713
00:38:28,043 --> 00:38:29,083
I don't know why.

714
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:32,883
Even I'm surprised by how much I like you.

715
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:37,963
No matter where I go,
you're the only person that I see.

716
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:40,443
Damn, you're annoying.

717
00:38:40,563 --> 00:38:42,083
Just like a buzzing fly.

718
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,483
Shancai.

719
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:45,403
I know I'm annoying.

720
00:38:46,163 --> 00:38:49,323
If you want to run away,
I'll chase after you.

721
00:38:50,043 --> 00:38:51,643
If you run to Mars,

722
00:38:52,483 --> 00:38:53,563
I'll go there too.

723
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:06,923
Let's go. He's crazy.

724
00:39:51,283 --> 00:39:52,443
<i>History repeats itself.</i>

725
00:39:53,363 --> 00:39:55,843
Si had a long face
and left without a word.

726
00:39:57,403 --> 00:39:58,603
Lei, you're here.

727
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,803
I saw Si in the hallway but he ignored me.

728
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:05,523
I think his failed apology
affected him badly.

729
00:40:06,643 --> 00:40:09,843
If we could transfer dating know-how
through our blood,

730
00:40:10,043 --> 00:40:11,603
I'm willing to transfuse mine to him.

731
00:40:11,683 --> 00:40:14,283
I'm even willing to donate my bone marrow,
brain cells and heart.

732
00:40:14,843 --> 00:40:18,163
If so, you guys should look for Shancai
and persuade her.

733
00:40:18,243 --> 00:40:20,523
-No thanks.
-You wanted to donate blood, right?

734
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:22,043
You know what?

735
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:25,083
There are two phrases in this world
that you need to say yourself.

736
00:40:32,403 --> 00:40:34,323
"I love you" and "I'm sorry."

737
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:36,363
Exactly.

738
00:40:43,843 --> 00:40:45,363
Let's check the cafeteria later.

739
00:40:49,523 --> 00:40:50,603
Shunping?

740
00:40:50,683 --> 00:40:51,523
Shancai.

741
00:40:51,603 --> 00:40:52,963
I was looking for you.

742
00:40:53,523 --> 00:40:54,723
How's your injury?

743
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:58,043
It's just a little bruise. I'm okay.

744
00:40:58,843 --> 00:40:59,763
Who's he?

745
00:41:00,483 --> 00:41:01,683
Zhibu's younger brother.

746
00:41:01,803 --> 00:41:02,763
He's studying Mining.

747
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:04,523
Zhibu has a brother?

748
00:41:04,843 --> 00:41:05,723
I never knew that.

749
00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:07,203
I know you.

750
00:41:07,283 --> 00:41:09,363
You lost to my brother at basketball.

751
00:41:09,723 --> 00:41:11,683
He said you should train
for another ten years.

752
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:13,283
Is that what he said about me?

753
00:41:14,043 --> 00:41:15,563
Tell him I want to challenge him again.

754
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:16,643
Okay.

755
00:41:17,243 --> 00:41:19,683
Shunping, why did you want to see me?

756
00:41:20,763 --> 00:41:21,683
Let's talk elsewhere.

757
00:41:27,323 --> 00:41:28,523
Where are you going?

758
00:41:33,803 --> 00:41:34,683
Shancai.

759
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:36,483
Sorry.

760
00:41:37,883 --> 00:41:39,643
Why are you saying sorry?

761
00:41:40,043 --> 00:41:41,723
I said you were my girlfriend yesterday.

762
00:41:42,283 --> 00:41:44,203
I wanted to piss Daoming Si off.

763
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:45,923
I was too harsh.

764
00:41:46,323 --> 00:41:47,203
I hope it's okay.

765
00:41:48,443 --> 00:41:49,523
Of course.

766
00:41:50,123 --> 00:41:51,563
I know you just wanted to help me.

767
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:52,923
I'm glad you don't mind.

768
00:41:53,843 --> 00:41:55,763
Shancai, since we're bosom buddies,

769
00:41:55,963 --> 00:41:58,123
I want to be honest with you.

770
00:41:59,203 --> 00:42:00,123
I think

771
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,363
you should stop seeing Daoming Si.

772
00:42:03,043 --> 00:42:04,243
He's not a good guy.

773
00:42:09,003 --> 00:42:12,203
To be honest, sometimes I think he's nice.

774
00:42:12,883 --> 00:42:14,483
Sometimes he's crazy.

775
00:42:15,923 --> 00:42:18,443
To me, he's too extreme.

776
00:42:19,323 --> 00:42:21,683
I feel like I'm on a tightrope
when I'm with him.

777
00:42:22,963 --> 00:42:24,523
I hope you aren't offended.

778
00:42:25,883 --> 00:42:27,243
I'm not.

779
00:42:27,363 --> 00:42:28,683
It's because you care.

780
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:34,763
I have some friends
who knew Daoming Si from before.

781
00:42:36,243 --> 00:42:37,603
They want to talk to you.

782
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:38,603
Will you see them?

783
00:42:39,403 --> 00:42:40,883
To talk about what?

784
00:42:42,563 --> 00:42:43,723
They'll be here soon.

785
00:42:43,963 --> 00:42:45,243
Let's talk when they get here.

786
00:42:51,123 --> 00:42:52,003
Shancai.

787
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:54,603
I'm thirsty. I'll get some drinks.
What do you want?

788
00:42:55,883 --> 00:42:56,763
Juice.

789
00:42:56,843 --> 00:42:58,283
I can go with you.

790
00:42:58,403 --> 00:43:00,283
It's okay. I'll be right back.

791
00:43:30,203 --> 00:43:31,043
Shancai.

792
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,163
Shancai!
