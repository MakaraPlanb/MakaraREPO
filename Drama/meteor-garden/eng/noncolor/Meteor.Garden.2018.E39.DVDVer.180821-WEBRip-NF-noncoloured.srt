METEOR GARDEN

00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:30,023
EPISODE 39

4
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:52,063
This steak is so delicious.
How can it be this good?

5
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:53,943
I'm so happy today.

6
00:01:56,743 --> 00:01:59,823
Every time I see you eat,
I feel like the food tastes even better.

7
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:02,423
They really taste good.

8
00:02:06,623 --> 00:02:07,743
Out of all the girls I know,

9
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:10,343
nobody is as lively as you are
when they're eating.

10
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:12,503
Not my mom, my sister or Jing.

11
00:02:13,903 --> 00:02:18,703
That's because you eat
on a really long table.

12
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:21,743
Everybody just focuses on eating.
You can't see each other's expressions.

13
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:23,103
Of course it's not lively.

14
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:27,583
Then how should we eat?

15
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:36,023
The most ideal situation is
when eating the Chongqing hot pot.

16
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:39,063
Everyone surrounds the pot.

17
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:40,783
The food is just within reach.

18
00:02:41,223 --> 00:02:44,423
Everyone's faces are so red and happy.

19
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:47,223
That sounds interesting.

20
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:49,663
Haven't you had hot pot before?

21
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:52,463
Nonsense. Of course I have.

22
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:54,703
But we each had our own pot.

23
00:02:56,463 --> 00:02:58,303
Let's go eat hot pot next time.

24
00:02:59,543 --> 00:03:00,503
Sure.

25
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:21,263
Are you full?

26
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:24,303
Yes.

27
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:27,583
Bill, please.

28
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:37,063
Please wait a moment.

29
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:39,703
Daoming Si.

30
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:41,903
I'll pay for my share.

31
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,903
What are you talking about?
I'm treating my girlfriend.

32
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:47,863
Please enter your password.

33
00:03:55,063 --> 00:03:57,583
Sorry, sir. Can you try again?

34
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,583
Sorry, sir. It still doesn't work.

35
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:17,823
Does your machine have a problem?

36
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:20,463
I have a suggestion.

37
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:23,663
We have an Ultimate Friday promo
for BOCOM credit cards.

38
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:25,703
Do you have one?

39
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:31,223
BANK OF COMMUNICATIONS

40
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:32,263
Let me pay.

41
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:33,863
Use mine.

42
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:35,183
PAY MERCHANT

43
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:37,743
All right.

44
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:08,983
She has started to take action.

45
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:13,783
My mom has started to take action.

46
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:19,863
Mobile payment doesn't work.
My credit cards might not work either.

47
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:21,903
This is not right.

48
00:05:22,503 --> 00:05:24,223
It's impossible as well.

49
00:05:31,863 --> 00:05:34,223
<i>The look on Daoming Si's face
completely changed.</i>

50
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:38,463
<i>But I won't take a step back this time.</i>

51
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:40,463
<i>I've made my decision.</i>

52
00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:43,943
<i>No matter what happens,
I have to bravely move forward.</i>

53
00:05:49,063 --> 00:05:49,983
Daoming Si.

54
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:02,463
No matter what happens after this,

55
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:05,863
I just want to treasure
every moment with you.

56
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,143
I won't be shaken by your mom.

57
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:36,823
Si's funds have been cut.

58
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:39,503
-Where are they now?
-We're not sure yet.

59
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:42,423
-Look for them immediately.
-Yes, ma'am.

60
00:06:50,503 --> 00:06:51,863
-We're here.
-Yes.

61
00:07:14,983 --> 00:07:16,183
Shoot.

62
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:32,663
-It's so much fun.
-Are you happy?

63
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:50,703
I haven't had so much fun in a long time.

64
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,423
It's good that you're happy.

65
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:06,623
It's getting late. I should go.

66
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:13,023
I'll take you home.

67
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:53,143
What should I make for lunch tomorrow?

68
00:08:53,703 --> 00:08:55,063
I always have a hard time deciding.

69
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:56,863
You still make your own lunch?

70
00:08:58,143 --> 00:08:58,983
Yes.

71
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:01,623
I'm used to eating something
I make myself.

72
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,143
By the way, should I cook for you too?

73
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:14,143
Sure. If you want to.

74
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:17,543
I'm used to eating
bad tasting food anyway.

75
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:21,303
Does the food I make taste bad?

76
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,423
All right.

77
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:39,263
See you at lunchtime
in the bridge room tomorrow.

78
00:09:47,943 --> 00:09:49,103
I'll go inside.

79
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:55,863
Shancai.

80
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,583
Kiss me.

81
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:07,703
Kiss you?

82
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:11,103
Now?

83
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:14,303
There's nobody here. Why not?

84
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:21,503
I'll do it next time.

85
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,103
Sometimes, there are no next times.

86
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,583
Why are you saying
something so unfortunate?

87
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:35,103
Okay, fine.

88
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:09,663
See you tomorrow.

89
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:15,783
Come out.

90
00:12:30,103 --> 00:12:32,703
You don't seem to be
the usual bodyguards at my house.

91
00:12:33,783 --> 00:12:36,183
CALLING: LEI

92
00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:49,303
It's Si.

93
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:53,463
Hello?

94
00:12:54,663 --> 00:12:56,023
<i>Please come with us.</i>

95
00:12:59,183 --> 00:13:00,503
<i>This is your mother's command.</i>

96
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,783
DAOMING SI

97
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:03,823
<i>All right. I'll go with you.</i>

98
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:08,623
<i>But if you dare to hurt Dong Shancai,</i>

99
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:11,023
<i>I'd surely make you pay for it.</i>

100
00:13:42,303 --> 00:13:43,183
<i>Shancai.</i>

101
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:45,823
Kiss me.

102
00:14:06,903 --> 00:14:10,983
What should I make for Daoming Si's lunch?

103
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:16,303
I know.

104
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:19,143
I'll make him the Squid King's
grilled squid.

105
00:14:28,103 --> 00:14:29,463
Why am I so clumsy?

106
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:49,903
<i>What's going on?</i>

107
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:52,023
<i>Didn't we agree to have lunch together?</i>

108
00:14:52,103 --> 00:14:54,143
<i>It's already 12:30 p.m.</i>

109
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:53,343
Ximen?

110
00:15:53,623 --> 00:15:54,863
Why are you here in school?

111
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:11,023
Why are you all here?

112
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:13,343
Did something happen?

113
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,703
Si temporarily left Mingde.

114
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:26,103
Left Mingde?

115
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:30,423
Yesterday, we still...

116
00:16:30,663 --> 00:16:33,783
We think his mom found out about you two.

117
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:41,263
The reason why we came here is because Lei
received a strange phone call yesterday.

118
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:45,863
What kind of phone call?

119
00:16:47,303 --> 00:16:50,263
Si called him yesterday
but didn't say a word.

120
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,023
We heard him telling someone
not to hurt you.

121
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:56,783
So we know something happened to Si.

122
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:01,583
DAOMING SI

123
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:02,943
<i>Please come with us.</i>

124
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:07,583
This is your mother's command.

125
00:17:08,983 --> 00:17:10,943
All right. I'll go with you.

126
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:14,943
But if you dare to hurt Dong Shancai,

127
00:17:15,623 --> 00:17:17,263
I'd surely make you pay for it.

128
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:33,263
Si must have called Lei
to let us know he's gone.

129
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:36,703
After this happened, I went to Si's house.

130
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:37,943
They said

131
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:40,383
that Si already went back to London.

132
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:56,943
<i>Went back to London?</i>

133
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:01,103
<i>Why did this happen?</i>

134
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:03,543
<i>Everything was fine yesterday.</i>

135
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:22,543
See you tomorrow.

136
00:18:38,543 --> 00:18:39,983
I'll try calling Ms. Zhuang again.

137
00:18:40,623 --> 00:18:42,343
I haven't been able
to reach her all morning.

138
00:18:44,263 --> 00:18:46,103
If Ms. Zhuang knows what's happening,

139
00:18:46,743 --> 00:18:48,623
she would've immediately
tried to contact us.

140
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:53,263
You know their family situation.

141
00:18:54,063 --> 00:18:57,783
Ms. Zhuang cannot change
whatever Si's mom has decided.

142
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:01,823
Shancai.

143
00:19:02,903 --> 00:19:03,783
So...

144
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,143
what do you plan to do?

145
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:14,823
Every single time,

146
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:17,903
it's Daoming Si
who has been protecting me...

147
00:19:21,023 --> 00:19:22,063
and loving me.

148
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:26,423
I never did anything for him.

149
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:29,903
This time,

150
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:33,583
I won't just wait for him.

151
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,383
I'm going to London...

152
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:45,463
to fulfill our promise to each other.

153
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:51,423
Are you sure?

154
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,103
This is serious.

155
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:58,623
You're going to face Daoming Feng.

156
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:02,623
She can deport you from England
with a flick of her finger.

157
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:05,823
No one would be able to help you.
It might end badly for you.

158
00:20:13,023 --> 00:20:14,903
I need to see Daoming Si
no matter what happens.

159
00:21:01,263 --> 00:21:02,343
You're all here.

160
00:21:10,383 --> 00:21:12,383
-Did you bring your passport?
-Yes.

161
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:14,263
Have you booked a place to stay?

162
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:22,183
I booked it in Airbnb.

163
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:26,143
I've already contacted the landlady.
It will be fine.

164
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:28,783
Shancai.

165
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:32,623
We came to see you off in person,
aren't we nice?

166
00:21:34,263 --> 00:21:36,383
Meng Jiangnü brought down
the Great Wall with her tears.

167
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:38,743
You traveled a thousand miles
to look for your boyfriend.

168
00:21:38,823 --> 00:21:40,103
What a nice tale.

169
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,903
Bring down the Great Wall with tears?

170
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,503
Daoming Si's still alive.

171
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:49,103
By the way, Shancai,

172
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:52,863
we'll take care
of Xiaoyou and Qinghe's families.

173
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:55,783
No need to thank me.
I'm just naturally nice.

174
00:21:57,223 --> 00:21:59,183
Don't use this chance
to take advantage of Xiaoyou.

175
00:22:02,223 --> 00:22:03,063
All right.

176
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:04,903
My ride is here.

177
00:22:05,463 --> 00:22:06,623
I need to get to the airport.

178
00:22:07,863 --> 00:22:09,223
Thanks for coming.

179
00:22:22,623 --> 00:22:23,463
Shancai.

180
00:22:24,823 --> 00:22:26,423
Call us when you arrive.

181
00:22:26,503 --> 00:22:28,623
Call us when you reach the place
you're staying at.

182
00:22:29,023 --> 00:22:32,303
Also, call us when you see Si.

183
00:22:34,823 --> 00:22:35,663
Okay.

184
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:06,143
Just try it.
How do you know it's not good?

185
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,743
Hurry up. My arm is aching.

186
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,463
You're so pushy.

187
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:20,103
Beg me.

188
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:23,183
Beg me and I'd consider staying
in Shanghai for you.

189
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:26,943
You'll stay if I beg you?

190
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:28,663
You silly girl.

191
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:31,623
Why are you so stupid?
You want me to say everything.

192
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:34,023
You're the stupid one here.

193
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:35,823
What do you want me to say?

194
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:38,223
You should say,

195
00:23:39,223 --> 00:23:40,583
"Can you not go to London?

196
00:23:40,663 --> 00:23:43,303
Can you go to graduate school
and wait for me to graduate?

197
00:23:43,383 --> 00:23:45,503
Can you stay with me forever
after I graduate?"

198
00:23:48,063 --> 00:23:49,743
Sleep beside me like this.

199
00:23:50,543 --> 00:23:52,183
-What are you doing? Let go.
-No.

200
00:23:52,743 --> 00:23:54,583
-Let go.
-No.

201
00:23:57,263 --> 00:23:59,943
<i>If you want to run away,
I'll chase after you.</i>

202
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,303
<i>If you run to Mars,</i>

203
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:04,343
<i>I'll go there too.</i>

204
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:25,503
<i>I'm also thinking why loving someone
has to be so hard.</i>

205
00:24:26,343 --> 00:24:28,223
<i>Why should I torture myself this way?</i>

206
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:29,863
<i>However...</i>

207
00:24:30,383 --> 00:24:32,703
<i>Your determination
and perseverance moved me.</i>

208
00:24:33,983 --> 00:24:35,623
<i>I'm not able to hate you.</i>

209
00:24:37,023 --> 00:24:38,023
<i>This time,</i>

210
00:24:38,383 --> 00:24:41,263
<i>I should also be ready
to fight for my future.</i>

211
00:24:42,223 --> 00:24:45,263
<i>Now, it's my turn. Even if you go to Mars,</i>

212
00:24:45,823 --> 00:24:46,943
<i>I'd surely come and find you.</i>

213
00:25:01,503 --> 00:25:03,423
I must find Daoming Si.

214
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:05,543
Please let me find him.

215
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,543
Hello? Lei, I've already arrived.

216
00:27:12,943 --> 00:27:14,703
I'm going to the rental home later.

217
00:27:15,623 --> 00:27:16,743
Do you have all your luggage?

218
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:20,823
Yes. I checked before I left the airport.

219
00:27:22,703 --> 00:27:23,823
How about your wallet?

220
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:27,063
It's in my bag. It's just within reach.

221
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,943
Also, don't lose your passport.

222
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:34,463
I placed my passport
in the inner part of my luggage.

223
00:27:34,823 --> 00:27:36,663
Don't worry.

224
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:41,383
I'm afraid you'll get lost
before you even find Si.

225
00:27:41,863 --> 00:27:43,743
Call me when you get
to the place you're staying.

226
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,983
The landlady already sent me the map.
I'll let you know when I get there.

227
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:05,223
Hey!

228
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,103
Stop!

229
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:10,383
Thief!

230
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,183
Hey!

231
00:30:13,743 --> 00:30:14,983
Stop right there!

232
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:17,263
Hey!

233
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:20,623
Thief, stop!

234
00:30:21,823 --> 00:30:22,983
Stop!

235
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:26,343
Hey!

236
00:30:29,343 --> 00:30:30,223
Stop running!

237
00:30:30,543 --> 00:30:31,383
Hey!

238
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:34,823
Hey!

239
00:30:35,303 --> 00:30:36,143
Thief!

240
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,303
<i>What should I do?</i>

241
00:32:09,783 --> 00:32:11,263
<i>Without the navigation map,</i>

242
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:13,623
<i>I won't be able to find
the place I'm staying at.</i>

243
00:32:25,463 --> 00:32:27,503
LONDON CHINATOWN

244
00:32:42,063 --> 00:32:44,383
EIGHT TREASURES SPICY NOODLES

245
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:18,503
For how many people?

246
00:33:19,743 --> 00:33:20,583
I...

247
00:33:27,223 --> 00:33:28,103
I...

248
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:29,983
Can you give me some water?

249
00:33:32,423 --> 00:33:34,903
Of course. Yue, come here.

250
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:36,943
Please give this cute girl some water.

251
00:33:37,023 --> 00:33:37,983
All right.

252
00:33:39,023 --> 00:33:39,863
Be careful. It's hot.

253
00:33:39,943 --> 00:33:41,263
-Thank you.
-Be careful. It's hot.

254
00:33:43,303 --> 00:33:45,023
Drink slowly.

255
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:47,103
Are you all right?

256
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:50,303
Yes.

257
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:53,463
You look so pale.

258
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:55,903
One more, please.

259
00:33:55,983 --> 00:33:57,503
What's your name?

260
00:33:58,463 --> 00:33:59,583
My name is Dong Shancai.

261
00:34:01,183 --> 00:34:02,783
Dong Shancai?

262
00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:04,103
Yes.

263
00:34:06,703 --> 00:34:08,503
What a familiar name.

264
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:10,943
Dong Shancai.

265
00:34:11,743 --> 00:34:13,663
Because there was a very
popular series before.

266
00:34:14,823 --> 00:34:16,423
The female lead's name was Shancai.

267
00:34:16,983 --> 00:34:19,863
She lived happily ever after.
So my mom named me Shancai too.

268
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:23,103
I knew it. I saw that series too.

269
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,823
It was so popular then.

270
00:34:26,183 --> 00:34:31,143
And many people told me
that I look like that female lead's mom.

271
00:34:31,343 --> 00:34:32,623
What do you think?

272
00:34:33,983 --> 00:34:36,703
Did you come to London alone?
For vacation?

273
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:39,223
No.

274
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:40,783
I came to look for someone.

275
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:43,783
Your boyfriend?

276
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:46,383
Yes.

277
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:51,063
He must be a very nice boy.

278
00:34:54,783 --> 00:34:55,703
He is.

279
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,983
Sometimes, he's so nice
that I feel like I don't deserve him.

280
00:35:03,383 --> 00:35:04,263
Goodness.

281
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:05,783
Why would you say that?

282
00:35:06,543 --> 00:35:08,423
You look like a nice girl.

283
00:35:08,743 --> 00:35:11,623
You also deserve to be happy.

284
00:35:12,983 --> 00:35:14,143
Thank you, ma'am.

285
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,823
But why are you selling
Eight Treasures Spicy Noodles here?

286
00:35:18,623 --> 00:35:20,663
Because I have a friend who likes it.

287
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,503
So I tried to make it for him.

288
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:25,663
I never thought my customers
would like it too.

289
00:35:25,743 --> 00:35:28,983
So it became our signature dish.

290
00:35:29,783 --> 00:35:31,183
Do you want some?

291
00:35:33,543 --> 00:35:34,983
I do.

292
00:35:36,223 --> 00:35:37,223
But...

293
00:35:38,743 --> 00:35:40,623
But I...

294
00:35:44,223 --> 00:35:45,143
Shancai.

295
00:35:47,863 --> 00:35:48,783
Thomas.

296
00:35:49,743 --> 00:35:50,743
Shancai.

297
00:35:51,423 --> 00:35:53,343
Is he your friend? Your boyfriend?

298
00:35:54,423 --> 00:35:55,503
Just a friend.

299
00:35:56,103 --> 00:35:58,823
-I'll just go there, ma'am.
-Okay. I'll make it for you then.

300
00:35:58,903 --> 00:35:59,863
All right.

301
00:36:00,983 --> 00:36:03,143
Shancai. Why are you here?

302
00:36:03,783 --> 00:36:04,943
It's such a coincidence.

303
00:36:05,423 --> 00:36:06,503
Come here.

304
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:07,823
-Come here.
-Okay.

305
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:12,623
-You look really hungry.
-Yes.

306
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:13,543
Here.

307
00:36:13,903 --> 00:36:15,623
This is our signature dish.

308
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:18,183
Eight Treasures Spicy Noodles.

309
00:36:18,383 --> 00:36:20,383
-And some Yakult.
-Thank you.

310
00:36:20,703 --> 00:36:22,063
Thank you, ma'am.

311
00:36:22,143 --> 00:36:23,823
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

312
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:25,863
Everybody calls me Ms. Yue.

313
00:36:26,063 --> 00:36:27,383
Just call me Ms. Yue.

314
00:36:27,983 --> 00:36:29,023
Thank you, Ms. Yue.

315
00:36:29,303 --> 00:36:30,383
Enjoy.

316
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:42,863
So you're here to look for Daoming Si?

317
00:36:47,343 --> 00:36:49,903
Why did he just disappear
and stopped contacting you?

318
00:36:50,503 --> 00:36:53,463
In Shanghai, he told me so fiercely,

319
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:55,823
"This is my woman."

320
00:36:56,703 --> 00:36:57,783
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

321
00:36:58,023 --> 00:37:00,183
<i>She's my woman. Don't touch her.</i>

322
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,383
I'm not sure either.

323
00:37:07,543 --> 00:37:10,343
That's why I came to look for him.
I want to ask him face to face.

324
00:37:16,063 --> 00:37:16,943
But...

325
00:37:17,783 --> 00:37:20,463
my phone and my wallet
got stolen when I arrived.

326
00:37:21,103 --> 00:37:22,623
I don't have any money with me.

327
00:37:23,983 --> 00:37:26,583
It'll be all right.
What's important is that you're safe.

328
00:37:27,303 --> 00:37:28,943
Good thing I saw you here.

329
00:37:30,063 --> 00:37:32,743
Something came up
and my friends couldn't come.

330
00:37:33,663 --> 00:37:37,183
But it's really good to see you.

331
00:37:42,823 --> 00:37:44,143
Don't worry.

332
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:50,063
Calm down. Eat first.

333
00:37:50,943 --> 00:37:52,863
Stay at my place tonight.

334
00:37:53,783 --> 00:37:56,103
I'll help you look for Daoming Si.

335
00:37:56,903 --> 00:37:58,423
You know where Daoming Si lives?

336
00:37:59,743 --> 00:38:01,623
After I came here, I found out

337
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:05,703
that Daoming Si and his family
are very popular here.

338
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:07,423
We'll surely find him.

339
00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:11,783
Thank you.

340
00:38:51,543 --> 00:38:52,543
It's quite messy here.

341
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:54,023
I hope you don't mind.

342
00:38:58,543 --> 00:38:59,743
This is where you live?

343
00:39:00,623 --> 00:39:01,583
Yes.

344
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:04,623
I'm not sure who left
this old warehouse empty.

345
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:10,823
My musician friends and I
don't have money so we stayed here.

346
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:12,583
We don't need to pay rent.

347
00:39:14,063 --> 00:39:15,103
It's quite nice.

348
00:39:16,903 --> 00:39:17,743
Hey.

349
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:20,143
Can you lend me your laptop for a while?

350
00:39:20,343 --> 00:39:22,063
I have to contact my friends in QZone.

351
00:39:22,623 --> 00:39:24,303
Sure, no problem. Wait a moment.

352
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:27,743
-Feel free to use it.
-Thank you.

353
00:39:40,303 --> 00:39:42,063
I forgot to pay the internet bill.

354
00:39:47,463 --> 00:39:48,423
Goodness.

355
00:39:50,623 --> 00:39:52,583
Then I've really lost contact
with the world.

356
00:40:01,383 --> 00:40:03,823
-My housemates are here.
-Beer.

357
00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:13,783
Shancai.

358
00:40:30,743 --> 00:40:31,583
Hey!

359
00:40:33,943 --> 00:40:35,623
You thieves!

360
00:40:35,903 --> 00:40:36,983
Hey, stop!

361
00:40:42,783 --> 00:40:44,383
They stole my wallet!

362
00:40:59,183 --> 00:41:03,023
They said they already sold your phone

363
00:41:04,063 --> 00:41:05,023
and bracelet.

364
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:06,703
They sold them?

365
00:41:06,823 --> 00:41:09,503
But they bought beer and food.

366
00:41:10,863 --> 00:41:11,903
Where's my wallet?

367
00:41:23,823 --> 00:41:24,943
Your wallet's here.

368
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,823
This is what's left.

369
00:41:52,023 --> 00:41:53,143
We'll think of something.

370
00:41:53,703 --> 00:41:55,103
Don't be mad, Shancai.

371
00:41:57,543 --> 00:41:58,463
Shancai.

372
00:42:01,943 --> 00:42:03,263
-Shancai.
-Shancai. Hey.

373
00:42:03,343 --> 00:42:05,063
-Shancai.
-Shancai.

374
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:07,543
Shancai.

375
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:28,383
<i>The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.</i>

376
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:30,143
<i>Please try again later.</i>

377
00:42:32,423 --> 00:42:35,423
We lost contact with Shancai
after her message this afternoon.

378
00:42:36,143 --> 00:42:37,663
She probably saw Si already.

379
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:41,743
Si must have been so touched.

380
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,983
Shancai, why are you here?

381
00:42:46,423 --> 00:42:48,743
Si, I missed you so much.

382
00:42:49,343 --> 00:42:51,543
I'd surely be with you
no matter where you go.

383
00:42:56,663 --> 00:42:58,023
I have a bad feeling.

384
00:43:00,383 --> 00:43:01,663
Don't worry.

385
00:43:02,223 --> 00:43:03,943
Believe in the fighting spirit
of the weed.

386
00:43:09,663 --> 00:43:12,423
Why does it feel like
the calm before the storm?

387
00:43:15,183 --> 00:43:17,423
It seems Si's mom
had everything figured out.

388
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:20,503
So it went without a glitch this time.

389
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:24,583
I hope...

390
00:43:25,743 --> 00:43:27,543
Si can come back safely.
