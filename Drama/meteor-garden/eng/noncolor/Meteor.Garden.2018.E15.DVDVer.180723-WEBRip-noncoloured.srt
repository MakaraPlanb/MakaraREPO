EPISODE 15

4
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:50,424
Hey, can you be more punctual?

5
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:52,944
You're always late for our dates.
Is your watch using local US time?

6
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,264
I was late by just ten minutes.

7
00:01:55,344 --> 00:01:56,864
-Don't be so irritated.
-I'm irritated?

8
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:59,304
You're the one who's late,
but you're complaining about me?

9
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:02,984
It's not nice to shout at a girl.

10
00:02:03,104 --> 00:02:05,064
You're such an embarrassment to us men.

11
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:07,304
Where did this brat come from?

12
00:02:07,864 --> 00:02:10,944
I'm not a brat. My name is Xiao Long.

13
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:13,744
He's the kid my neighbor
asked me to care of.

14
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:16,264
He's alone so I brought him here
or else he'd feel so sad.

15
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,744
Him? He looks like a gangster.
How can he be sad?

16
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,944
-It hurts.
-How can you be sad?

17
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:23,624
It hurts. Let go.

18
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:24,664
-Hey.
-You're a bad guy.

19
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,264
Don't bully a kid, okay?

20
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:31,064
Shancai, you're the best.

21
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:33,064
Can we go play?

22
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:36,064
Hey, you're putting on an act
and pretending to be cute.

23
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:37,664
Shancai, don't be fooled by him.

24
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:39,024
Why are you fighting with a kid?

25
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:41,864
Xiao Long. Where would you like to go?

26
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:43,544
I don't know.

27
00:02:45,384 --> 00:02:47,744
I remember you told me
that you haven't been to the zoo.

28
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:50,304
-Do you want to go there?
-Sure.

29
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:52,944
Zoo? We just got here
and now you're going to the zoo.

30
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:55,104
-Do you know how far that is?
-No.

31
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:56,424
Let's go.

32
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:16,184
Are you having fun?

33
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:23,664
Is that a monkey?

34
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,504
Let's go and see the monkeys.

35
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:28,144
She's even more childish than the kid.

36
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:41,344
Have you seen that before?

37
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:43,944
I've never seen a real monkey before.

38
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,464
Yes, it's been awhile
since I saw a real monkey.

39
00:03:55,584 --> 00:03:57,184
What's that monkey doing?

40
00:03:57,544 --> 00:03:59,184
Guess what?

41
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:01,984
That monkey looks so ugly.

42
00:04:02,064 --> 00:04:03,304
As ugly as you.

43
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:05,624
Who are you calling ugly, stupid boy?

44
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:12,304
Go slowly.

45
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:16,264
I'm way more handsome than you guys.

46
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:23,664
Shancai, is this a goat?

47
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:24,664
Yes.

48
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:27,304
Goat's milk is similar to cow's milk.
You can drink it.

49
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:29,104
And it's even more nutritious.

50
00:04:29,424 --> 00:04:30,464
Really?

51
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:33,264
Then I want to have him as a pet.

52
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:37,144
That way, I can ride him
and go to you so we can play.

53
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:39,544
<i>No. That's too dangerous.</i>

54
00:04:40,104 --> 00:04:42,064
<i>Then can I feed him?</i>

55
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:50,424
Can we go down now?

56
00:04:56,344 --> 00:04:57,584
Do you see the tiger?

57
00:04:57,944 --> 00:04:59,064
I don't see it.

58
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:00,984
You don't? He's over there.

59
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:03,144
No. I don't see it.

60
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:05,224
-You still can't see it?
-No.

61
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:10,584
Come on. Can you see it, little midget?

62
00:05:10,664 --> 00:05:12,184
I see it.

63
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:14,624
Shancai, the tiger is so beautiful.

64
00:05:16,144 --> 00:05:17,384
Xiao Long, do you know

65
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,384
that feline animals would produce
a sound when they're happy?

66
00:05:21,544 --> 00:05:22,824
Really? I didn't know that.

67
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:24,984
Of course not.

68
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:26,824
Because you're a canine.

69
00:05:40,304 --> 00:05:42,624
He really is a kid.
He can fall asleep just like that.

70
00:05:42,704 --> 00:05:43,544
Yes.

71
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:48,504
Let me hold that for him.

72
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:49,784
There's no need for that.

73
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:12,064
-Daoming Si.
-What?

74
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:15,264
-Why?
-What do you mean "why"?

75
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:16,984
You said that out of the blue.

76
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:18,944
How could I understand that?

77
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:21,424
Why did you lend me money?

78
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:23,864
Why did you support me to join
the competition?

79
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,704
-Why are you spending the day with me?
-Because you're stupid.

80
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:29,824
What did I do to infuriate you again?

81
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:31,344
Don't you know the answer to that?

82
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,104
Can't you use your brain
to think about it?

83
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,064
I...

84
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:36,784
If I can figure it out,
why would I ask you?

85
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:40,024
You're a bipolar, manic-depressive guy who
can't talk normally and likes to shout!

86
00:06:40,104 --> 00:06:42,304
-I don't want to talk to you!
-Then don't!

87
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:44,624
It's really tiring to talk
with someone dumb like you.

88
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,424
-Why did this brat pee on me?
-Hey!

89
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:50,424
-You'll wake him up!
-So what?

90
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,624
-Why are you so annoying?
-Who's annoying?

91
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,424
-You!
-I'm annoying, right?

92
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:58,704
-I'll show you what's even more annoying.
-Hey! You'll hurt him.

93
00:06:59,024 --> 00:07:00,944
Since I'm so annoying,
don't ever see me again.

94
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:02,264
Fine! I won't see you again!

95
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:24,064
Xiao Long, it's okay.

96
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,944
Don't cry anymore, okay?

97
00:07:26,024 --> 00:07:28,424
I peed in my pants.

98
00:07:28,504 --> 00:07:31,784
It's so embarrassing!

99
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:57,304
Xiao Long. Look.
Do you want some strawberry cake?

100
00:08:04,624 --> 00:08:07,184
I want to eat the strawberries.

101
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:09,664
Okay, sure.

102
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:23,744
Shancai, this one's for you.

103
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:27,704
That's nice. You know how to share.

104
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:34,024
Shancai.

105
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:36,504
Is there any problem?

106
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:40,704
I must have messed up that guy's clothes.

107
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:42,184
You mean Daoming Si?

108
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:43,664
Forget about him.

109
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:47,064
Let me give you some advice.

110
00:08:47,384 --> 00:08:50,104
Don't be like him when you grow up.

111
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:54,864
But when he lifted me on his shoulders,

112
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:58,144
it felt like he was my dad.

113
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:02,824
Anyway,

114
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:04,824
I think he's quite nice.

115
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:13,544
<i>I know.</i>

116
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:16,864
<i>That guy is nice at times.</i>

117
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,504
<i>But I always want to fight with him
when I see him.</i>

118
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,584
Shancai, I want to come
and play with you again.

119
00:09:27,544 --> 00:09:28,784
You're welcome here anytime.

120
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:32,904
Remember you have to keep
that thing a secret.

121
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:35,544
What thing?

122
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:39,424
You mean peeing in your pants?

123
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:41,024
Xiao Long.

124
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:42,424
You peed in your pants again?

125
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:44,264
How old are you?

126
00:09:46,624 --> 00:09:48,784
I told you to keep it a secret.
I'm so mad.

127
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:51,584
All right. I'm not going to tell
anybody else.

128
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:53,504
Tell that guy,

129
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:57,104
after I get more practice on that game,
I'll seek him out for revenge.

130
00:09:58,424 --> 00:09:59,744
All right. Let's go home then.

131
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:00,944
Say goodbye to Shancai.

132
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:02,304
-Shancai, bye.
-Bye.

133
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:03,264
Thank you.

134
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:04,984
Bye.

135
00:10:09,744 --> 00:10:11,264
<i>Why did you lend me money?</i>

136
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:13,744
Why did you support me to join
the competition?

137
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:16,784
-Why are you spending the day with me?
-Because you're stupid.

138
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:19,144
What did I do to infuriate you again?

139
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:21,104
Don't you know the answer to that?

140
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:22,904
Can't you use your brain
to think about it?

141
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:31,184
This is our restaurant's signature dish,
Lobster Thermidor.

142
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,704
I made that sauce using my own recipe.

143
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:36,144
It contains a lot of ingredients.

144
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,424
And it needs to be cooked for three hours
in order to create this flavorful dish.

145
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:43,664
If the timing is not precise,
the flavor would be wrong.

146
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:46,504
As for this steak, it's also
one of our restaurant's specialties.

147
00:10:47,184 --> 00:10:49,024
The sauce is very unique.

148
00:11:12,944 --> 00:11:13,864
Hello?

149
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:15,104
Dad.

150
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:17,104
I've thought about it already.

151
00:11:18,104 --> 00:11:19,584
Tian Ye is not the man I want.

152
00:11:20,704 --> 00:11:22,504
<i>What's the matter?
You don't like him anymore?</i>

153
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:23,904
No, it's not that.

154
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:27,464
<i>Then what happened?</i>

155
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,344
He wants to live a certain way.

156
00:11:33,384 --> 00:11:34,864
But I don't want

157
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:36,904
that kind of life.

158
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:37,664
Thank you.

159
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:39,984
Wait.

160
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:41,544
How do I know this is yours?

161
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:45,824
Isn't it obvious?

162
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:49,944
I think it's better to give
a lost item to the police.

163
00:12:51,864 --> 00:12:53,224
You're quite interesting.

164
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:55,184
What do you want?

165
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,184
Buy me a drink.

166
00:13:00,704 --> 00:13:05,304
Turns out the famous F4 is so cheap.

167
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:10,224
Turns out the cooking competition
champion is so stingy.

168
00:13:14,824 --> 00:13:17,824
That Hong Kong style fried crab you made
with garlic was really interesting.

169
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:20,984
I know, right? When I was overseas,
I cooked it every day

170
00:13:21,064 --> 00:13:22,944
because I missed the taste of home.

171
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:26,544
Honestly, you really cooked that dish
so well that day.

172
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:28,264
Stop it.

173
00:13:28,344 --> 00:13:32,584
I know you guys were there
to cheer for Shancai.

174
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,024
I'm an exception.

175
00:13:34,224 --> 00:13:36,904
When you won, I clapped so hard.

176
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:38,584
It's a pity you didn't hear it.

177
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:39,904
Is that so?

178
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:42,664
Then why were you cheering for me?

179
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:44,664
You're all Shancai's friends, right?

180
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:47,584
That's true,

181
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:50,024
but after the cooking competition started,

182
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:52,064
I also wanted you to be my friend.

183
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:55,504
Are you interested in me?

184
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,184
You think too much.

185
00:13:57,464 --> 00:13:58,704
We're not that close.

186
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:00,904
I just want to be your friend.

187
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:04,904
Aren't you buying me a drink?

188
00:14:05,864 --> 00:14:06,704
Sure.

189
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:09,024
What do you want? Order it. It's my treat.

190
00:14:09,104 --> 00:14:10,304
Wei Xun.

191
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,104
What can I do for you?

192
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:17,784
The bartender here is my friend.

193
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:19,224
He has a special talent.

194
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:23,184
He can make any drink you want.

195
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:25,464
Is that so?

196
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:26,944
Then I have to test him.

197
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:30,144
I want to order a drink
that would prevent me

198
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:33,544
from ever meeting someone who asks
for favors after finding up a lost item.

199
00:14:37,104 --> 00:14:38,424
Well...

200
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:44,424
I guess you two didn't expect that.

201
00:14:47,064 --> 00:14:48,464
We have that, of course.

202
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:51,344
A drink that would not ask favors
after picking up a lost item, right?

203
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:54,504
Then I want one too.

204
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:57,944
A drink that would let me meet
a cute but arrogant girl again.

205
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:01,784
Do you have that too?

206
00:15:03,344 --> 00:15:04,904
Well...

207
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:08,064
We have that, of course.

208
00:15:08,144 --> 00:15:11,224
A drink that would let you meet
a cute but arrogant girl again.

209
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:12,704
Just those two, right?

210
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:14,264
Yes, thank you.

211
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:28,504
Here you go.

212
00:15:39,784 --> 00:15:41,104
This drink is so sour.

213
00:15:41,304 --> 00:15:43,544
I think he wants that person
who picked up a lost item

214
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:45,224
and asked for favors to suffer.

215
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:48,904
All right.

216
00:15:49,104 --> 00:15:50,224
Now it's your turn.

217
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:55,424
You're wasting time.

218
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:56,664
Are you scared of drinking it?

219
00:15:57,384 --> 00:15:58,344
Of course not.

220
00:15:58,784 --> 00:16:00,104
I'm afraid that I'll meet

221
00:16:00,184 --> 00:16:02,304
a cute but arrogant girl
daily after I drink it.

222
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:03,224
What should I do?

223
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:07,024
I get it.

224
00:16:07,224 --> 00:16:09,064
You don't want to drink it.

225
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:11,304
I'm not afraid of drinking it.

226
00:16:11,624 --> 00:16:14,944
I'm afraid that
you'll fall in love with me.

227
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:20,664
It's bitter.

228
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,824
It tells you that falling in love with
a cute but arrogant girl is going to be

229
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,104
a very bitter experience.

230
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:55,744
Meizuo, who did you go
on a date with yesterday?

231
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:57,584
You weren't answering your phone.

232
00:16:58,744 --> 00:16:59,624
It's a secret.

233
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:01,464
Why are you being so mysterious?

234
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:05,144
Didn't you mention the other day
that you're going out with an older woman?

235
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:11,424
Where did you guys go during the holiday?

236
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:15,944
Lei, what did you do?

237
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:18,024
I slept and played games at home.

238
00:17:19,944 --> 00:17:20,864
Never mind.

239
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:23,304
How about you, Si?

240
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:26,224
You must have been happy
on your date with Shancai.

241
00:17:27,984 --> 00:17:29,264
What's there to be happy about?

242
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:33,424
Did you two fight again?

243
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:35,024
No way.

244
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:38,304
Is Shancai that hard to figure out?

245
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:40,224
Who says Shancai is the problem?

246
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:41,624
Si.

247
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:44,184
You have a bad temper.

248
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,184
You're wrong.

249
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,624
How could Si be the problem?

250
00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:50,944
Si has always been
straightforward and honest.

251
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:55,464
His temper is just a little bit bad.

252
00:17:56,344 --> 00:17:58,624
But is that a crime?

253
00:17:59,144 --> 00:17:59,984
That's right.

254
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:01,704
It's all Shancai's fault.

255
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:03,984
-Who knew Shancai's IQ would be so low?
-That's right.

256
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:06,984
Falling in love with a person with low IQ

257
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,784
-will also make your IQ low.
-Are you done talking?

258
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:11,584
You're babbling! Aren't you tired?

259
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:24,304
Lei. Did we say anything wrong?

260
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:28,824
The point is that you didn't say
anything wrong.

261
00:18:29,144 --> 00:18:30,184
That's why Si walked out.

262
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:33,504
Si doesn't have the capability
to date girls.

263
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:35,584
The problem is right in front of us.

264
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:36,944
We all see it very clearly.

265
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:38,944
The problem is how do we solve it?

266
00:18:39,504 --> 00:18:40,384
Indeed.

267
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:43,184
Si will end up dying alone
if he stays this way.

268
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:47,984
At that time, if nobody will push
his wheelchair to let him get some sun,

269
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:51,424
we'd all be sad when we see that, right?

270
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,264
So what should we do?

271
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:16,624
TALENT'S TEA SHOP
COME IN AND RECEIVE A GIFT

272
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:24,024
Shancai. How was your holiday?

273
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:25,824
Don't even mention it.

274
00:19:26,264 --> 00:19:28,344
I really hope I can go back in time.

275
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:32,024
Why?

276
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:35,104
Nothing.

277
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:38,184
I'm not in the mood to think about it.

278
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:39,864
Let's just sell milk tea.

279
00:19:40,624 --> 00:19:43,104
Yes. If we don't sell enough of them,

280
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:44,864
we won't receive
our bonus again this month.

281
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:47,264
We haven't received our bonus
for three months already.

282
00:19:48,264 --> 00:19:49,304
There's nothing we can do.

283
00:19:49,904 --> 00:19:52,544
The weather's so cold.
Nobody wants to go out and buy tea.

284
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:56,744
Shancai.

285
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,704
That "different" guy is here.

286
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:06,024
Lei.

287
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:09,464
Why are you guys here?

288
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:11,664
Hi, Ximen.

289
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:15,664
Long time no see. Welcome to our store.

290
00:20:15,784 --> 00:20:16,624
Hi, Xiaoyou.

291
00:20:16,704 --> 00:20:17,704
How are you doing?

292
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:19,704
Long time no see.

293
00:20:19,904 --> 00:20:20,904
You're still so cute.

294
00:20:28,904 --> 00:20:31,064
Don't look directly at this guy.
It's very dangerous.

295
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:35,864
Shancai, you're so busy.

296
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:38,184
It's the holidays
but you're still working.

297
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:41,344
How can I rest when I have
a part-time job?

298
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:44,144
How can I earn a lot of money
if I don't work hard?

299
00:20:45,264 --> 00:20:46,944
That's Dong Shancai.

300
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:52,104
Why exactly are you guys here?

301
00:20:52,264 --> 00:20:55,264
You're not buying milk tea.
You're just getting in the way of our job.

302
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:57,704
If our sales don't increase
by the end of the year,

303
00:20:57,784 --> 00:20:59,504
we won't get any bonus for this year.

304
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:13,224
Leave it all up to us.

305
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:26,904
Hey, pretty girl, come and taste
our store's new milk tea flavors.

306
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:28,024
Try the White Jasmine Dew.

307
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:30,224
The tea is very refreshing.

308
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:31,304
This is Peach Red Royale.

309
00:21:31,384 --> 00:21:32,824
It's sweet with a fruity fragrance.

310
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:38,744
There are many flavors to choose from.

311
00:21:39,304 --> 00:21:40,504
-Do you want to try this?
-Yes.

312
00:21:40,704 --> 00:21:42,264
-He's so handsome!
-Hey, handsome.

313
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,704
-Can I have your Weibo ID?
-And...

314
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:44,624
This is yours.

315
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:47,304
-I like this.
-This latte and cheese are good.

316
00:21:47,384 --> 00:21:48,904
-I like it too.
-And it's not fattening.

317
00:21:48,984 --> 00:21:50,184
-If you order...
-Don't push me.

318
00:21:50,264 --> 00:21:52,264
-Bye, handsome.
-Which tea do you want?

319
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:57,104
-This is your Peach Red Royale.
-Thank you.

320
00:21:57,184 --> 00:21:59,864
-Welcome to our store. What's your order?
-I want what she's having.

321
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:01,504
-Do you want ice on it?
-No.

322
00:22:01,824 --> 00:22:02,944
Do you want to try it?

323
00:22:03,024 --> 00:22:05,104
That's right. I really recommend this.

324
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:06,544
They're so handsome.

325
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:08,904
-It smells really good.
-Do you want to try it?

326
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:11,184
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

327
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,704
It's so amazing!

328
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:19,584
Today's sales are even higher
than the past three months altogether.

329
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:23,584
Mission accomplished.

330
00:22:23,784 --> 00:22:25,464
I'm giving you extra on your bonuses.

331
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,304
Here. These are for you.

332
00:22:27,384 --> 00:22:28,784
-Thank you, ma'am!
-Thank you, ma'am!

333
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:30,224
You're welcome.

334
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:31,824
Keep up the good work!

335
00:22:31,904 --> 00:22:33,464
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

336
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:39,624
Thank you for what you guys did today.

337
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:42,224
I've never gotten a bonus this big.

338
00:22:44,544 --> 00:22:45,504
No.

339
00:22:45,704 --> 00:22:47,384
I can't accept this bonus.

340
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:51,104
You were the ones who sold
those milk teas.

341
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:52,704
Take this.

342
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:57,384
We sold them outside.

343
00:22:57,464 --> 00:22:59,024
You prepared them inside.

344
00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:00,264
It was teamwork.

345
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:02,304
How can you say that you don't deserve it?

346
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:06,104
Do you want to return that to your boss?

347
00:23:06,424 --> 00:23:09,224
Then all our efforts this afternoon
would be wasted.

348
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,504
Just accept it, Shancai.

349
00:23:11,184 --> 00:23:12,704
We helped out just for you.

350
00:23:14,264 --> 00:23:16,664
All right.

351
00:23:16,784 --> 00:23:19,544
I'll treat you guys for dinner
as a reward for your efforts.

352
00:23:19,624 --> 00:23:21,144
That's right. We can all eat together.

353
00:23:21,224 --> 00:23:23,184
Shancai, if you really want
to treat us for dinner,

354
00:23:23,544 --> 00:23:25,664
how about using this money
to have fun with us instead?

355
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:27,624
Have fun?

356
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:28,904
Where?

357
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:31,784
We're going to Canada
during the New Year holidays.

358
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:33,224
And we'll do the countdown there.

359
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:34,944
What?

360
00:23:35,264 --> 00:23:36,384
Canada?

361
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:38,144
Join us, Xiaoyou.

362
00:23:39,024 --> 00:23:42,144
Really? Can I really go with you?
I've never been out of the country before.

363
00:23:42,744 --> 00:23:43,824
But...

364
00:23:44,784 --> 00:23:47,104
Is this enough to go to Canada?

365
00:23:47,184 --> 00:23:48,344
Don't worry.

366
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:52,144
Si's family has a chalet mansion
with a very nice view in Canada.

367
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:53,864
Food and lodging would not be a problem.

368
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:59,384
Shancai, let's go with them.
I really want to go.

369
00:24:03,304 --> 00:24:04,784
<i>I want to go too.</i>

370
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:06,224
<i>But...</i>

371
00:24:06,624 --> 00:24:08,664
<i>Daoming Si would probably be there too.</i>

372
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:11,904
<i>We had such a big fight.</i>

373
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:15,224
<i>How can I pretend like nothing happened</i>

374
00:24:16,504 --> 00:24:18,344
<i>and stay at his mansion?</i>

375
00:24:24,984 --> 00:24:27,304
-I'm home.
-You're back?

376
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,224
Shancai.

377
00:24:31,984 --> 00:24:34,184
I heard that you're going to Canada
in a couple of days.

378
00:24:34,824 --> 00:24:37,304
Remember to buy smoked salmon for me.

379
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:39,784
Yes. And maple syrup.

380
00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:41,144
Buy a few bottles.

381
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:43,784
I heard the stewed chicken leg
is delicious there.

382
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:45,944
How did you know?

383
00:24:46,024 --> 00:24:47,824
Ximen called and told us about it.

384
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,264
Ximen?

385
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:51,304
I haven't even agreed yet.

386
00:24:51,464 --> 00:24:52,584
I'm still thinking about it.

387
00:24:53,344 --> 00:24:54,464
What's there to think about?

388
00:24:54,864 --> 00:24:57,224
I think it's good to go out
and see the world.

389
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,064
I'm usually busy with school.

390
00:25:00,144 --> 00:25:03,144
I need to accompany Mom to the market
to buy ingredients during the holidays.

391
00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:05,744
Don't worry about that.

392
00:25:06,344 --> 00:25:08,824
We only have a few days
of holiday vacation.

393
00:25:08,904 --> 00:25:09,864
It's the New Year.

394
00:25:09,944 --> 00:25:12,984
You must be really busy with cooking.
I have to help you with the deliveries.

395
00:25:13,264 --> 00:25:14,664
Don't worry. I'm here.

396
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:17,024
My working hours are quite flexible.

397
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:18,624
That's right.

398
00:25:18,704 --> 00:25:21,744
Don't worry about these things.
Your dad and I will take care of it.

399
00:25:21,864 --> 00:25:24,304
You rarely have a chance to go out
and have fun. Enjoy yourself.

400
00:25:24,384 --> 00:25:27,264
Your friends can take care of you
and you won't be alone. Isn't that great?

401
00:25:27,344 --> 00:25:28,424
It's good. Just go.

402
00:25:30,824 --> 00:25:33,504
Remember to buy smoked salmon for me.

403
00:25:38,984 --> 00:25:40,664
Shancai, are you still thinking about it?

404
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,304
I'm still worried about my family's
food business.

405
00:25:47,864 --> 00:25:48,904
Do you really want to go?

406
00:25:51,064 --> 00:25:53,464
Yes. I want to go to Canada with you.

407
00:25:57,744 --> 00:25:58,704
But...

408
00:25:59,104 --> 00:26:01,024
I haven't made up my mind yet.

409
00:26:01,704 --> 00:26:08,584
DAOMING SI CALLING FROM QQ

410
00:26:13,504 --> 00:26:14,944
I heard you're going to Canada.

411
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,624
So what?

412
00:26:18,304 --> 00:26:20,104
What has that got to do with you?

413
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:23,144
Of course!
If you're going, I'm staying behind.

414
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:25,544
What do you mean?

415
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:27,584
Let me make it even clearer.

416
00:26:27,904 --> 00:26:29,184
You can't go to Canada.

417
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:33,304
Daoming Si, who are you to stop me
from going to Canada?

418
00:26:34,544 --> 00:26:36,304
<i>It's too luxurious
for a stupid girl like you.</i>

419
00:26:37,024 --> 00:26:39,144
You don't know how to ski
and you're afraid of the cold.

420
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,464
You won't enjoy it there.

421
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:42,264
I think you shouldn't go.

422
00:26:44,384 --> 00:26:45,464
Who says so?

423
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,984
I'm not afraid of the cold.

424
00:26:47,304 --> 00:26:49,424
I'll enjoy it even if I fall while skiing!

425
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:50,864
<i>I'm definitely going!</i>

426
00:26:51,104 --> 00:26:52,824
<i>And I'll go there happily.</i>

427
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:54,184
I didn't invite you to go.

428
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:55,864
And I don't want to see you.

429
00:26:56,344 --> 00:26:58,264
You weren't the one who invited me there.

430
00:26:58,344 --> 00:27:00,544
If you don't want to see me,
then don't go!

431
00:27:00,664 --> 00:27:02,704
I don't need your approval for my actions!

432
00:27:03,264 --> 00:27:05,744
Fine, I'm not going!
I'll tell them all not to go.

433
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:06,944
Just go alone.

434
00:27:07,104 --> 00:27:09,384
When you encounter wild animals
in the wilderness,

435
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:11,024
don't call and cry to me!

436
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:12,904
Cry?

437
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,384
You think too little of me.

438
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:17,624
It's better to encounter wild animals
than beasts like you!

439
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:20,304
-Bye!
-Goodbye!

440
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:43,904
Si, why did you think we sold milk tea
in such a cold weather?

441
00:27:43,984 --> 00:27:47,024
You guys like to sell milk tea.
What does that have to do with me?

442
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:53,704
In life, it's very lucky
to have good friends.

443
00:27:54,624 --> 00:27:57,384
It's also very unlucky to meet Daoming Si.

444
00:28:01,744 --> 00:28:02,704
Lei.

445
00:28:02,824 --> 00:28:04,264
You can freely court Shancai now.

446
00:28:05,024 --> 00:28:07,024
Si and Shancai are now enemies.

447
00:28:07,504 --> 00:28:10,144
He wouldn't care
about what happens with you and Shancai.

448
00:28:13,904 --> 00:28:15,544
Really? I'll do that then.

449
00:28:22,464 --> 00:28:23,304
Don't regret it.

450
00:28:23,864 --> 00:28:26,424
Don't play tricks with me!
I said I'm not going so I'm not going!

451
00:28:27,184 --> 00:28:28,384
Then don't go.

452
00:28:28,864 --> 00:28:30,824
That's right. Nobody's forcing you to go.

453
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:35,584
Let's go and pack.

454
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,184
We'll leave you all alone
in Shanghai then.

455
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:44,184
We'll go.

456
00:28:48,224 --> 00:28:49,504
-Si.
-Bye.

457
00:28:49,824 --> 00:28:51,184
We're leaving.

458
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:56,424
Si. Have a happy holiday!

459
00:29:07,264 --> 00:29:09,384
Really? You've decided to go to Canada?

460
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:12,784
My parents encouraged me to go.

461
00:29:13,744 --> 00:29:15,344
Your parents are so nice.

462
00:29:15,944 --> 00:29:16,904
Yes.

463
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:20,864
Daoming Si is not going anyway.

464
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:22,704
Then I don't have any reason not to go.

465
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:25,824
Honestly, I really wanted to go.

466
00:29:25,904 --> 00:29:27,504
Yes. Let's go together.

467
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:29,904
Shancai, you're so nice.

468
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:31,664
I love you to death!

469
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:34,704
What should we wear in Canada?

470
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:42,064
Let's take a selfie and post it in QQ
to celebrate our trip to Canada, okay?

471
00:29:42,144 --> 00:29:43,024
Sure.

472
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:54,064
DONG SHANCAI: GOING TO CANADA
WITH MY BESTIE, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT!

473
00:29:54,144 --> 00:29:57,824
IT'S A GOOD THING THAT
ANNOYING PEOPLE ARE NOT COMING!

474
00:30:19,104 --> 00:30:21,304
GOING TO CANADA WITH MY BESTIE,
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT!

475
00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:23,144
Xinhui.

476
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,584
Xinhui.

477
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,704
-What? I'm not done trying yet.
-Come here and see this.

478
00:30:28,784 --> 00:30:30,664
Shancai is going to Canada.

479
00:30:32,744 --> 00:30:33,584
Shancai?

480
00:30:34,664 --> 00:30:37,024
Is she going with Daoming Si?

481
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:38,784
F4.

482
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:40,784
I want to go too.

483
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:41,984
Can I go?

484
00:30:44,464 --> 00:30:45,584
It's impossible.

485
00:30:48,904 --> 00:30:50,864
How about we call Shancai?

486
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:53,504
Let's ask if we can go with them.

487
00:30:58,184 --> 00:30:59,384
F4.

488
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:09,024
<i>I was too excited to sleep all night
thinking about going to Canada with you.</i>

489
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:12,224
I searched online
for the places we can go.

490
00:31:12,464 --> 00:31:14,064
Canada's snow is so pretty.

491
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:19,904
Shancai. I saw your post in QQ.
Are you going to Canada for the New Year?

492
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,504
You said you're going with your bestie.

493
00:31:24,584 --> 00:31:25,504
Who's that?

494
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:30,064
My friend from senior high school.

495
00:31:30,144 --> 00:31:31,104
Xiaoyou.

496
00:31:31,704 --> 00:31:33,424
We're all classmates.

497
00:31:33,544 --> 00:31:35,144
Let us go with you.

498
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:41,544
But it was Ximen who invited me.

499
00:31:41,744 --> 00:31:45,064
Then I'll call Ximen
and tell him that you invited us.

500
00:31:46,144 --> 00:31:47,144
Shancai.

501
00:31:47,464 --> 00:31:49,264
Don't you consider us your close friends?

502
00:31:50,384 --> 00:31:55,144
Could it be that you were referring
to Xinhui and me on QQ when you said,

503
00:31:55,224 --> 00:31:57,344
"It's a good thing that
annoying people are not coming"?

504
00:31:57,984 --> 00:31:59,264
No, I wasn't talking about you.

505
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:01,144
Good. It's settled then.

506
00:32:01,224 --> 00:32:04,704
I'll tell Ximen later
that you invited us to go to Canada.

507
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:06,264
Thanks, Shancai.

508
00:33:08,664 --> 00:33:09,624
It's so beautiful.

509
00:33:09,704 --> 00:33:11,584
Yes. What a beautiful mansion!

510
00:33:16,184 --> 00:33:17,024
Let's go.

511
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:42,224
-We finally arrived.
-Yes.

512
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,704
Why is the fireplace burning?

513
00:33:45,184 --> 00:33:47,264
Did the attendant come
and prepare the fire first?

514
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,104
Daoming Si.

515
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:57,064
You're so late.

516
00:33:57,264 --> 00:33:59,504
What kind of plane can be that slow?

517
00:34:03,744 --> 00:34:05,904
Si, how did you arrive before us?

518
00:34:06,584 --> 00:34:10,144
Yes. I even had time to go
around the city and eat ice cream.

519
00:34:10,224 --> 00:34:11,624
I bought yours too.

520
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,704
It's good that you're here.

521
00:34:29,264 --> 00:34:30,704
Lei, aren't you cold?

522
00:34:32,024 --> 00:34:34,704
Eating ice cream in front
of the fireplace sounds interesting.

523
00:34:51,784 --> 00:34:53,144
-Hi, Daoming Si.
-Hi, Daoming Si.

524
00:34:58,264 --> 00:34:59,704
Stupid girl, you came anyway.

525
00:35:01,984 --> 00:35:03,384
I should be the one saying that.

526
00:35:03,864 --> 00:35:06,344
Somebody said he's not coming
but he has come secretly?

527
00:35:06,424 --> 00:35:07,784
Whose words cannot be trusted?

528
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:12,104
Get your facts straight. This is my house.

529
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:14,104
I can come anytime I want.

530
00:35:14,424 --> 00:35:16,344
If you're not happy about it,
you can go home now.

531
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:19,384
-Daoming Si, you--
-That's enough.

532
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:20,504
We came all the way here.

533
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:22,104
Just get along.

534
00:35:22,184 --> 00:35:23,664
Si, can you mellow out a bit?

535
00:35:28,824 --> 00:35:30,424
Stop flirting with each other.

536
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:32,504
-Who's flirting with whom?
-Who's flirting with whom?

537
00:35:43,504 --> 00:35:44,664
This is so comfortable.

538
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,144
I've always wanted to just
lie down here like this.

539
00:35:47,264 --> 00:35:51,184
I never thought the handsome Daoming Si
would be so scary when he's mad.

540
00:35:51,784 --> 00:35:52,984
He's handsome?

541
00:35:53,664 --> 00:35:54,504
Which part?

542
00:35:54,584 --> 00:35:56,944
You don't think he's handsome
because you're mad right now.

543
00:35:57,984 --> 00:35:59,904
But this vacation house is really great.

544
00:36:00,264 --> 00:36:01,864
I'm able to come here because of you.

545
00:36:03,264 --> 00:36:04,624
Not really.

546
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:08,064
Isn't this our first trip together after
we graduated from senior high school?

547
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:09,864
This is so nice.

548
00:36:09,944 --> 00:36:11,064
I'm so happy!

549
00:36:15,064 --> 00:36:15,904
Xiaoyou.

550
00:36:16,624 --> 00:36:17,744
Let's have a snowball fight!

551
00:36:18,784 --> 00:36:19,624
Okay!

552
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:23,744
Jiang Xiaoyou.

553
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:25,544
You hit me.

554
00:36:27,704 --> 00:36:29,504
I'm dying from so many hits.

555
00:37:11,144 --> 00:37:12,024
Come on.

556
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,784
Can't you and Shancai get along?

557
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:41,104
How long will you be fighting like this?

558
00:37:42,144 --> 00:37:43,304
Who's fighting with her?

559
00:37:43,584 --> 00:37:44,664
I'm so angry with her.

560
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:46,064
I'm the victim.

561
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:51,704
It's no use being nice
to that stupid girl.

562
00:37:53,744 --> 00:37:54,584
Is that so?

563
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:56,104
Isn't that so?

564
00:38:14,704 --> 00:38:15,664
Are you all right?

565
00:38:24,384 --> 00:38:25,224
Daoming Si.

566
00:38:25,664 --> 00:38:27,304
Why are you so childish?

567
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,264
You deserved it.

568
00:38:32,664 --> 00:38:33,984
Look where you're going.

569
00:38:42,704 --> 00:38:44,344
Are you stupid?

570
00:38:46,264 --> 00:38:48,224
-Daoming Si, you jerk!
-Hey!

571
00:38:48,344 --> 00:38:49,384
What are you doing?

572
00:38:50,864 --> 00:38:51,944
Daoming Si!

573
00:38:55,184 --> 00:38:56,544
Calm down. Hey!

574
00:38:56,624 --> 00:38:57,824
Calm down!

575
00:39:16,144 --> 00:39:17,584
I'll really get my revenge on him.

576
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:18,944
Xiaoyou, you can shower now.

577
00:39:29,144 --> 00:39:32,584
<i>Shancai, the picture of the snow
you sent earlier was so nice.</i>

578
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,344
<i>Just enjoy yourself.</i>

579
00:39:37,904 --> 00:39:39,584
<i>I'm with you in spirit.</i>

580
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:42,784
<i>Don't forget to bring back some
smoked salmon and maple syrup.</i>

581
00:39:45,224 --> 00:39:46,384
I know.

582
00:39:46,744 --> 00:39:48,784
I won't forget to bring them back to you.

583
00:39:53,584 --> 00:39:55,704
Xiaoyou, I already showered.

584
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,944
Come back now.

585
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:12,224
I'M NOT TELLING YOU!

586
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:18,064
LOG IN

587
00:40:21,104 --> 00:40:23,904
I MAKE THE DECISIONS

588
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:30,264
I MAKE THE DECISIONS

589
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,744
Shancai, this lousy teammate.

590
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:32,944
She's still playing this?

591
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,384
What happened to Xiaoyou?

592
00:40:48,424 --> 00:40:49,504
She's still not back yet.

593
00:41:21,984 --> 00:41:23,504
Lei, have you seen Xiaoyou?

594
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:25,464
Which one is Xiaoyou?

595
00:41:28,024 --> 00:41:29,384
I'll just find her myself.

596
00:41:34,984 --> 00:41:35,864
Excuse me.

597
00:41:36,184 --> 00:41:37,624
Have you seen Xiaoyou?

598
00:41:38,424 --> 00:41:39,304
Xiaoyou?

599
00:41:39,504 --> 00:41:41,824
-The one from the snowball fight?
-Yes.

600
00:41:42,464 --> 00:41:43,464
Have you seen her?

601
00:41:44,384 --> 00:41:45,664
Oh, that's Xiaoyou.

602
00:41:46,544 --> 00:41:47,704
Let me think.

603
00:41:51,304 --> 00:41:54,064
It looked like she went out
to see the night view.

604
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:55,184
Yes.

605
00:41:55,424 --> 00:41:56,504
About ten minutes ago,

606
00:41:56,584 --> 00:41:59,184
I saw her walk out the door
with her coat on.

607
00:42:01,184 --> 00:42:02,424
See the night view?

608
00:42:03,824 --> 00:42:05,384
But it's snowing outside.

609
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:07,624
She insisted on going
for a walk around the area.

610
00:42:10,064 --> 00:42:11,544
We forgot to remind her.

611
00:42:12,104 --> 00:42:15,824
She might not find her way back
if she walks all alone in the snow.

612
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:17,984
Could she have gotten lost?

613
00:42:36,184 --> 00:42:37,624
Shancai, where are you going?

614
00:42:37,824 --> 00:42:40,544
I'm going to find Xiaoyou.
She went out to see the night view.

615
00:42:41,784 --> 00:42:43,144
But it's a blizzard out there.

616
00:42:45,584 --> 00:42:47,784
I'll search for her around the area.
I'll be right back.

617
00:43:01,424 --> 00:43:02,304
What should we do?

618
00:43:02,384 --> 00:43:03,944
They really went out.

619
00:43:05,384 --> 00:43:07,024
Lei went with her anyway.

620
00:43:07,344 --> 00:43:10,224
They should be back soon
if they can't find her.

621
00:43:10,664 --> 00:43:11,504
Let's go.
