EPISODE 33

4
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:32,199
Give up on Shancai, understand?

5
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:35,199
-Oh, all right.
-What do you mean, "Oh, all right"?

6
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:36,119
What exactly...

7
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,319
-What did you say again?
-I said all right.

8
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,719
I'll give up on Shancai.

9
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:46,719
Why?

10
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,199
-So I can pursue Shancai?
-No.

11
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,079
Do you want to die?

12
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:02,599
You jerk.

13
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,399
I was already feeling down
but you provoked me.

14
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:08,919
You planned all this to make me
admit my feelings.

15
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,159
You think I don't know that?

16
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,039
I wasn't trying to fool you.

17
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,999
You even dare say that.
That's what infuriates me the most.

18
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,639
But that's the most interesting part.

19
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,079
Think about it.

20
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:24,599
You knew I did it on purpose
but you still got mad.

21
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:26,279
-That proves...
-Shut up.

22
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,079
...that your temper is really bad.

23
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,559
Isn't that obvious?

24
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,719
You're so annoying.

25
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,159
You're still laughing?

26
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,439
But Si.

27
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:48,119
When have you started not doing
what you're thinking?

28
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,279
Even though we grew up together
and knew each other well,

29
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:54,999
this time,

30
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,399
I was really worried that you were scared.

31
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:02,079
You don't need to worry about me.

32
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,399
Shancai's the one you should worry about.

33
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,079
It's impossible for you not to know
what I'm thinking.

34
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,839
So what?

35
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,159
You're not saying it
so Shancai won't know either.

36
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,279
I won't pass along the message anymore.

37
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,999
Change your favorite slogan.

38
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,319
You're no longer the Lei who's not
interested in other people's business.

39
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,599
Shancai is not a stranger.

40
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,959
And neither are you.

41
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:31,999
You're both important to me.

42
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,999
I appreciate your gesture.

43
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,559
But I have to remind you again.

44
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,639
This is all just part of your plan.

45
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:53,359
I know, you green-eyed monster.

46
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:55,519
Do you have a problem with that?

47
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,319
What you're worried about won't happen.

48
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,519
I'll leave Shancai to you.

49
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,079
Take good care of her.

50
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,519
Of course.

51
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:11,319
But I'm telling you.

52
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,919
You're still my friend.

53
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,359
But don't play me anymore.

54
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,799
The weather's so nice today.

55
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:39,159
It's time for me to go.

56
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:04,319
Lei, your parting gift is too much.

57
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:07,359
Yes. You fooled me so badly.

58
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,519
I never knew that pursuing Shancai
would have such an impact on you.

59
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:12,399
Why would it?

60
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,479
But it's strange.

61
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,999
You and Si had such a big fight.

62
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,119
I thought we couldn't be friends anymore.

63
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,399
In the end, Ximen and I
were the ones who were fooled.

64
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,439
It's over now.
Why are you still talking about it?

65
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,719
I think it was quite fun.

66
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,599
You're such a weirdo.

67
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:40,239
Is your family situation really bad?

68
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:43,479
It's all right.

69
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,959
I should go see my family anyway.

70
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,119
-When are you leaving?
-My flight is in the afternoon.

71
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,679
Be in touch.

72
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,479
I'm already starting to miss you.

73
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:57,679
If all goes well, I'll be back soon.
You don't have to come to the airport.

74
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:02,759
Does Shancai know?

75
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:19,639
<i>Shancai, there are some things
that I couldn't tell you in person.</i>

76
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,399
<i>So I sent you this voice message.</i>

77
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,399
<i>You already know right?</i>

78
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,079
<i>I only wanted to make Si
face his own feelings.</i>

79
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:29,799
<i>That's why I decided to pursue you again.</i>

80
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,439
<i>Because I can't think of any other way
to help you and Si.</i>

81
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:39,239
<i>Sorry if it caused you any trouble.</i>

82
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:44,479
<i>Even though it was just part of my plan,
but my concern for you is real.</i>

83
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,639
<i>You know that, right?</i>

84
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,639
<i>I'm going back to Taiwan today.</i>

85
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:52,639
<i>I won't be back here anytime soon.</i>

86
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,799
Huaze Lei!

87
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:11,439
Goodbye!

88
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:22,159
<i>When you feel like crying, do a handstand.</i>

89
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,559
<i>That way, your tears won't fall down.</i>

90
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,399
<i>I'm really grateful...</i>

91
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,559
<i>to you.</i>

92
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,639
<i>You really are a nice guy.</i>

93
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:54,039
<i>I did those things because I wanted to.</i>

94
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,079
<i>Do you regret it?</i>

95
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:11,879
<i>I do.</i>

96
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,999
<i>I regret giving up on her so easily.</i>

97
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:19,079
<i>I regret not holding on
a little longer that time.</i>

98
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,079
<i>Shancai, do you get it?</i>

99
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,719
<i>Hold on a little longer.</i>

100
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,399
<i>If you do, a lot of things
might end up differently.</i>

101
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,279
<i>But if you miss that opportunity,</i>

102
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,359
<i>you'll regret it your whole life.</i>

103
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,679
QQ VOICE MESSAGE FROM HUAZE LEI

104
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,359
<i>Shancai.</i>

105
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:17,839
<i>Knowing you was the most interesting thing
that has ever happened to me so far.</i>

106
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:20,199
<i>All this time,</i>

107
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:23,559
<i>everything we've experienced
was so beautiful.</i>

108
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,399
<i>I won't ever forget it.</i>

109
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:27,599
<i>See you again.</i>

110
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,319
<i>Shancai, goodbye.</i>

111
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:36,239
<i>Lei.</i>

112
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:39,079
<i>Thank you for everything you did for me.</i>

113
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,359
<i>Thank you.</i>

114
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,839
It's so hard to face my own feelings.

115
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,639
<i>I see.</i>

116
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,119
Then I'll go ahead.

117
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:45,279
I told him I'm not leaving anymore.

118
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,759
He knows what I meant, right?

119
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,119
Then why did you get off the bus?

120
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,239
Did I misunderstand that?

121
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,159
Why did you get off the bus?

122
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,199
No.

123
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,399
He doesn't get it.

124
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,519
He's not the type who'd care
about people's feelings.

125
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:24,679
I really need to clearly tell him.

126
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,279
Women are so annoying.

127
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,799
What are you babbling about?

128
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:57,479
So how are things?

129
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,199
Did you get to see Shancai yesterday?

130
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,999
Yesterday...

131
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,359
Yesterday...

132
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,799
What is he trying to say?

133
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,839
I think he's saying,
"Something good happened.

134
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,719
He's unhappy."

135
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,119
And,

136
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:31,519
"He doesn't understand."

137
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,639
It seems Si has acquired
more depth of expression

138
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,359
after going to graduate school.

139
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:40,999
What do you care?

140
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:45,119
And are you and Shancai

141
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,519
together or not?

142
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:50,359
Why do you care?

143
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,559
Hey, Si.

144
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,239
Didn't you ask me to come here
to think of a plan?

145
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:59,239
Haven't you settled it with Shancai yet?

146
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,279
There are some things
that you don't understand.

147
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:10,799
Then ask me.

148
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:13,399
Leave your girl problems
to the love expert.

149
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,799
Mr. Love Expert,

150
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,879
let's hear what you have to say.

151
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:22,959
Women.

152
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,959
If you think of them
as a musical instrument,

153
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,839
she's a violin.

154
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,759
You have to accurately control
your strength, position, and tone

155
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,079
in order to play the best music.

156
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,999
So what do you think?

157
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,839
Master Ximen.

158
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,839
Even I didn't quite understand it,
let alone Si.

159
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,799
Right?

160
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:51,399
Where's Si?

161
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,519
What are you doing?

162
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,079
Why are you here?

163
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:10,399
Well...

164
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,359
I have something to tell you.

165
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,079
What is it?

166
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,839
It's not convenient here.
Let's go to the rooftop.

167
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:34,639
<i>I can easily do other things.</i>

168
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:37,999
<i>But why is love so hard?</i>

169
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,839
What do you want to say to me?

170
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,959
Tell me.

171
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,119
I'm starving.

172
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,359
<i>I should tell him openly.
I have to tell him how I really feel.</i>

173
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:53,799
<i>I want to officially
be together with Daoming Si.</i>

174
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:00,279
Well...

175
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,199
It's...

176
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,679
I...

177
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:17,759
<i>Goodness. I must tell him
that I really like him.</i>

178
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:20,679
<i>Or else we can't officially be together.</i>

179
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,399
What is it? Say what you want to say.

180
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:27,039
You're so fierce.

181
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,359
Never mind.

182
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,039
What do you mean? Are you playing with me?

183
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,199
I'm not.

184
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:35,159
Your voice is too loud.

185
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:36,399
Your attitude is so bad.

186
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,119
So I couldn't tell you any more.

187
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:44,679
I really don't get you.

188
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,519
I thought you're with me
but then you'll suddenly run away.

189
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,079
I really don't get what you're thinking.

190
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,319
I'm not thinking of anything.

191
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:55,679
My thoughts are simple.

192
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:59,479
But I never thought
that your thoughts are even simpler.

193
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,079
They are more straightforward.

194
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:02,799
What are you trying to say?

195
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:05,039
I'm warning you.

196
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,759
I don't want to hear harsh words.

197
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,119
Do you want to try this bento box?

198
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,599
You made it for me?

199
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,079
It's not some Michelin dish.

200
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,919
I'm not sure if it will suit your taste.

201
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,119
I'll try it.

202
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,359
What's this jellyfish-like thing?

203
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,399
Enoki mushroom bacon wrap.

204
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:58,159
I see.

205
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:08,759
Never mind. Don't force yourself.

206
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,639
I know you're used to food
made by high-class chefs.

207
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,719
You're not used to these common dishes.

208
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:34,719
Hey.

209
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:40,519
I thought you'd start dating Xiaozi.

210
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,399
Xiaozi?

211
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:43,879
Yes.

212
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:45,999
Last time,

213
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:49,999
I saw you two having a good time
at the coffee shop.

214
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:52,679
Are you crazy?

215
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:55,839
I told you I won't date a girl
that I don't like.

216
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:01,639
Then will you date me?

217
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,399
Are you all right?

218
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,079
Are you all right?

219
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,799
How can you say such things so easily?

220
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,079
I didn't just say it easily.

221
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:22,879
I'm serious.

222
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,279
And...

223
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,399
I hope you can keep it a secret.

224
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,439
Keep what a secret?

225
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:47,599
About us dating.

226
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,279
Don't tell anyone first.

227
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:51,919
-Because--
-You want us to date secretly?

228
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,399
That's not what I meant.

229
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,519
We won't keep it a secret forever.
Just don't tell anyone for now.

230
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,519
Are you freaking kidding me?

231
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,359
You want me to watch movies,
go out, and eat secretly?

232
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:03,799
What are you thinking?

233
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:05,679
I want to be together with you.

234
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:13,839
However,

235
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,719
if your mom finds out,

236
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,239
she'll surely take action again.

237
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:24,399
I don't want to be separated
from you like the last time.

238
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,519
I've had enough.

239
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,839
I've decided not to contact you.

240
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,559
I can't accept it.

241
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,319
You're leaving me
because of such a lousy reason.

242
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:38,879
That's nonsense!

243
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:44,439
I don't want to go through that again.

244
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,479
I've already made up my mind.

245
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,759
For you, even if I have
to leave my family,

246
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:58,399
even if I'm not Daoming Si anymore,

247
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,719
I'd give up everything for you.

248
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,759
You don't need to do anything.

249
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,279
What choice do I have?

250
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:13,519
Let's see when they find out.

251
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,399
You can't tell Ximen and Meizuo too.

252
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,319
We're keeping it from them too?

253
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,319
Is that okay?

254
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,119
Then...

255
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,639
I think Si doesn't have the courage yet.

256
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,799
Me too.

257
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,399
I'm not sure what Shancai is thinking.

258
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,079
She thinks too much.

259
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,519
That's right.

260
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:46,559
They're dating
like primary school students.

261
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,919
What is it? Do you have any ideas?

262
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,719
Let's do what Lei couldn't do.

263
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,559
Let's lend Si a helping hand.

264
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,319
Of course.

265
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:08,919
Wait.

266
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,959
Someone will see us.

267
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,399
There's no one here.

268
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:15,359
There is.

269
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:16,879
Near the back. Somebody's there.

270
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:20,679
Are you part of the Terracotta Army?
Where were you unearthed?

271
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,359
You're the Terracotta Army.

272
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:24,319
Aren't we already dating?

273
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,839
Can't I kiss you?

274
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,919
No.

275
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,399
Why?

276
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,679
If you don't tell me,

277
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,319
I'm not letting you go.

278
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,039
Because...

279
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:43,679
Because my heart's beating so fast.
Because I'm too excited.

280
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,319
Because you're all I think about.

281
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:47,039
Because you're here in front of me.

282
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:49,239
I can't breathe. So, no.

283
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,679
Why are you talking like that?

284
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,399
That's how I speak. So what?

285
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:59,839
Hearing you say those things
make me want to...

286
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:02,239
To...

287
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:05,479
<i>So this is how it feels to be in love.</i>

288
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,359
<i>It's so unbelievable.</i>

289
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:11,999
<i>My feelings are overflowing
like a dam on the verge of bursting.</i>

290
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,599
Xiaoyou.

291
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,839
-Move these inside.
-Sure. Right away.

292
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:27,479
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

293
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,079
Ximen?

294
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:51,319
You should ask Shancai to do these things.

295
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:53,559
She's stronger than you.

296
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,119
Why are you here?

297
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:00,079
Are you here to buy milk tea or...

298
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,759
I came for you.

299
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:03,239
Me?

300
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,479
Why?

301
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:08,079
But I'm a bit busy now.

302
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:09,719
It's fine.

303
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:11,199
I can wait for you.

304
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,519
Xiaoyou, are the ten orders
of White Jasmine Dew

305
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,199
and 15 orders of Peach Red Royale done?

306
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,679
The customer will be here soon.

307
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,159
Right away.

308
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,039
Aren't you the guy who helped
with our sales the last time?

309
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:27,439
-Sorry for disturbing you.
-How could that be? Thank you.

310
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:29,839
-Are you here for Xiaoyou?
-Yes.

311
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:32,479
She still needs to work for another hour.

312
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,079
It's fine. I can wait for her.

313
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,719
It's okay.

314
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,999
Xiaoyou, leave earlier today.

315
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,399
I'll take care of this.

316
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:40,919
Can I do that?

317
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:42,959
Don't let him wait. You can go.

318
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:47,199
-Thank you, ma'am.
-You're welcome.

319
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:16,479
<i>Am I mistaken?</i>

320
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:46,199
<i>Who are they? Why are they following me?</i>

321
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:54,799
Shancai.

322
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:58,239
Are you all right?

323
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,159
Who were you hiding from?

324
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,279
I've been followed by strange guys.

325
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,479
Come, this way.

326
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:22,999
Come here.

327
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,279
Come here.

328
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:47,439
They're obviously Si's bodyguards.

329
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:54,239
What do you plan to do?
Do you want to tell Si?

330
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,519
I should.

331
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:02,519
However,

332
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,439
-I'm worried--
-You're worried that Si

333
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,559
would fight with his mom.

334
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:08,359
Right?

335
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:10,559
Yes.

336
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:20,039
Then let's not tell Si for now.

337
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:23,559
Si loses all reason when it comes to you.

338
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,599
Ximen and I are also afraid
he'll be too rash.

339
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:30,439
It might worsen the situation.

340
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:39,079
I'm not sure what to do anymore.

341
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,159
Well,

342
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,279
I think you'd be fine for now.

343
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,039
However,

344
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:48,239
try not to go home first.

345
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,559
They'll surely be back.

346
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,279
Okay.

347
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:57,399
I'll stay with Xiaoyou for a while.

348
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,719
By the way, why are you in this area?

349
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,799
Xiaoyou's not home.

350
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,599
How do you know?

351
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:13,719
She's at Ximen's house.

352
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:15,439
Who told you that?

353
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,879
Is it true?

354
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:22,839
Ximen told me earlier
that Xiaoyou's at his house.

355
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,959
And they're tasting some tea together.

356
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:26,999
Actually...

357
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:31,039
It should be all right.

358
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:33,919
But I think I should tell you.

359
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,679
So that you won't blame me later.

360
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,079
Tasting tea?

361
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:42,919
They can't do that.

362
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:51,639
Hello? Xiaoyou. Where are you now?

363
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:54,319
-<i>Shancai</i>.
-Are you at Ximen's house?

364
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:56,959
<i>Yes. I just arrived at their gate.</i>

365
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,279
Listen to me. Don't go in--

366
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,399
<i>Xiaoyou, what's the matter?</i>

367
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,919
<i>-Come in first.
-Okay.</i>

368
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:06,759
<i>Shancai, I'll talk to you later.</i>

369
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,479
Hey, I...

370
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:12,759
Take me to Ximen's house.

371
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:26,959
Success!

372
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,679
Why did you trick Shancai
into going to your house?

373
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,519
It's a surprise.

374
00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:45,519
It's not something weird, right?

375
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,159
Xiaoyou, trust me.

376
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:54,079
You won't harm Shancai. I trust you.

377
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,439
You seem to be in a good mood.

378
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,319
Yes.

379
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:08,839
I have to keep moving forward.

380
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:13,119
All right. I'll tell you the truth.

381
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:17,559
We're trying to help Shancai
and Si take their relationship

382
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:18,519
one step further.

383
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,439
One step further?

384
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,079
I see.

385
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:27,399
However, if their relationship goes well,

386
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,319
it's not good for your family, right?

387
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:35,039
You should be worried.

388
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:37,759
No, it's not like that.

389
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,239
Shancai...

390
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:46,239
She doesn't tell me
what she thinks lately.

391
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:49,719
Maybe she's just shy.

392
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,279
No.

393
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:55,039
She'd tell me everything before.

394
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:56,999
But now,

395
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:59,559
she just handles everything alone.

396
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,279
I can't help her.

397
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,359
And I even need her to protect me.

398
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,919
I'm such a lousy friend.

399
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:14,359
But I did a lot of thinking lately.

400
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:16,679
I hope Shancai can be happy.

401
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:20,919
Since she likes Daoming Si
and Daoming Si likes her too,

402
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,799
then I'll raise both hands in support.

403
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:31,359
However, your family might get affected.

404
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:33,359
Doesn't that matter to you?

405
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,639
I'm already an adult.
I can help with our family's expenses.

406
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,599
And didn't you see it too?

407
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,079
Shancai was not at the milk tea shop.
But I could handle it by myself.

408
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:48,839
I believe our family can work together
and overcome any challenge.

409
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:51,919
Didn't Shancai do the same?

410
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:53,799
If she can do it, so can I.

411
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:55,759
There's nothing I can't do.

412
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,359
You're not the Xiaoyou
who used to cry on the street anymore.

413
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,559
You've grown up and become stronger.

414
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:13,239
The one who made me strong

415
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:15,399
was you.

416
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,359
After what happened,

417
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,959
I told myself I should change.

418
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:27,639
You told me I should never
look down on myself.

419
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:32,999
Is that so? What an honor.

420
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:36,359
You have to find a nice guy
to be your boyfriend in the future.

421
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:37,959
Keep it up.

422
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,359
Ximen.

423
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,399
Why are you here?

424
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:53,399
I walked past and thought
it was just someone who looked like you.

425
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:54,759
Turns out it's really you.

426
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,279
Are you on a date?

427
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:02,159
Am I interrupting?

428
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,559
No.

429
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:06,199
You're not.

430
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:10,359
By the way,
thanks for agreeing about Shancai.

431
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,759
Also, we'll do our best
to help your family.

432
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,359
You don't have to worry.

433
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:19,399
Does she want to have a drink with us?

434
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:22,559
No. She's not coming.

435
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,119
-Let's go.
-Bye.

436
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,079
Where's Xiaoyou?

437
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,879
Wait! Why are you so impatient?

438
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:45,679
I might be too late!

439
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,679
You're going to break my hand.

440
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,399
Tell me where Ximen and Xiaoyou are.

441
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:51,999
Master bedroom. Second door on the left.

442
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,959
Does she think she's Xiaoyou's guardian?

443
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:00,959
She's so easily tricked.

444
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,479
Xiaoyou.

445
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:07,839
Xiaoyou.

446
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,639
Are you inside?

447
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:17,639
Xiaoyou.

448
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:55,759
Hey.

449
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,639
<i>Are they trying to destroy my house?</i>

450
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,639
You're at a bar?

451
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:07,559
<i>Didn't we agree to meet at your house
with Xiaoyou afterward?</i>

452
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:10,719
Si and Shancai will be
locked in all night.

453
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,919
What's the point of being there?

454
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:16,639
<i>We'll suffer if we wait
by their door all night.</i>

455
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:17,999
Makes sense.

456
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:19,799
Then I'll join you.

457
00:34:20,799 --> 00:34:22,839
Come over.
You're the only one missing here.

458
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,399
Okay. I'll head there now.

459
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,999
Daoming Si?

460
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,479
What's going on?

461
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:55,719
Ximen and Meizuo kidnapped me.

462
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:56,959
Did you see Xiaoyou?

463
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:58,519
No.

464
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:01,799
Did I go into the wrong room?

465
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:04,239
Those guys.

466
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:10,399
Hey!

467
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,599
Open up! Ximen, Meizuo.

468
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:15,439
Where did you take Xiaoyou?

469
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,599
Hey!

470
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,279
-Stop screaming.
-Open the door!

471
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,359
You've been tricked.

472
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:24,519
What do you mean?

473
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,359
I received a call from Xiaoyou.

474
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,919
-She said she's here--
-So you've been tricked.

475
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:37,479
You mean...

476
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:41,199
Xiaoyou worked with Ximen
and Meizuo to trick me?

477
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:43,079
They planned this?

478
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:52,039
No. I have to find a way out.

479
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,839
That door's the only way out.

480
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:57,679
-But it's locked.
-So we can't go out.

481
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:58,799
So what do we do?

482
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,479
I don't care. I'm with you anyway.

483
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,879
Be serious. Think of something, okay?

484
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:07,839
Even if I can think of something,
I'm not going out.

485
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:13,679
Those guys. They should've just told me.

486
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:15,439
No need to tie me up like that.

487
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:18,759
In that case,

488
00:36:20,999 --> 00:36:23,119
sorry, I'll tie you back up.

489
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:25,119
Are you crazy?

490
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:34,279
I'm not ready yet.

491
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:38,479
If I give you time to get ready,
you'll surely run away again.

492
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,839
<i>He saw through me.</i>

493
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:58,999
You might not know yet,

494
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:01,079
but this expression of yours

495
00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:02,999
fascinates me the most.

496
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:56,199
Shancai.

497
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,239
You're so short.

498
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:00,199
My neck's about to break.

499
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,839
Who told you to be tall like a giraffe?

500
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:09,399
Make yourself taller for me, okay?

501
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:12,719
I'm so nervous already.

502
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,599
How can I do that?

503
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,039
What's there to be nervous about?

504
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,919
Your face is so red.

505
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:21,239
It might be contagious.

506
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,519
<i>It looks like things might not go smoothly</i>

507
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:38,279
<i>even if we're together already.</i>

508
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:43,639
<i>Especially since our situation
is not ordinary at all.</i>

509
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:01,039
Do you think this room
is like that wooden mansion in Canada?

510
00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:09,959
Yes. Canada.

511
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:12,599
At the time,

512
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,439
I thought Xiaoyou went out
to see the night view in the snowstorm.

513
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,279
So I went out to find her.
Then I got lost.

514
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:27,719
I almost got eaten by wolves.

515
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:31,839
It was so scary.

516
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:53,159
-Then you...
-Then what did I do?

517
00:39:58,279 --> 00:39:59,839
I became your savior.

518
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,519
Right?

519
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,479
You always got yourself involved
and saved me.

520
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:13,439
What do you mean I got myself involved?

521
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:19,359
What I'm trying to say is

522
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,519
I've always been grateful.

523
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,799
No matter how many times it is,
I'd go and save you.

524
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:38,599
Because I really love you.

525
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:40,479
I can't live without you.

526
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:51,999
Why do you have that expression again?

527
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,239
I might...

528
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:58,919
<i>Happiness like this is like standing</i>

529
00:40:59,399 --> 00:41:01,199
<i>on a piece of floating ice in the sea.</i>

530
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,919
<i>It might melt anytime.</i>

531
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,599
Ma'am, the investigative report
from Shanghai is here.

532
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:24,799
Let me see it.
