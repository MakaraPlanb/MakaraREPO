METEOR GARDEN

00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,007
EPISODE 45

4
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:36,287
Then what happened?

5
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:39,967
I think she also realized

6
00:01:42,087 --> 00:01:43,447
she doesn't like me.

7
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:48,127
I'm afraid to get hurt. I'm not brave.

8
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:51,767
I hide from the person I like.

9
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:54,607
Such a person doesn't deserve

10
00:01:55,847 --> 00:01:56,847
to be liked.

11
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,967
Who said so? I like you the way you are.

12
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,287
Xiaoyou, you were fooled.

13
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:11,127
The person standing here
is not the real Ximen.

14
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:12,727
No.

15
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:15,327
Nobody's perfect.

16
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:17,607
I have a lot of faults too.

17
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:20,807
I trust people easily.
I lack good judgment.

18
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:23,367
So my friends always have
to clean up my mess.

19
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:27,527
Most of the time,
I'm self-centered and strong-willed.

20
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:32,487
However, I don't think
I don't deserve to be liked

21
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:34,447
because of these faults.

22
00:02:38,647 --> 00:02:39,527
Xiaoyou.

23
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:43,007
You always impress me.

24
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:50,127
Ximen.

25
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:54,367
Missing your "Once in a Lifetime"
is your problem.

26
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:57,967
But now it's our "Once in a Lifetime."

27
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:00,207
I don't want to miss it.

28
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:40,767
I'm so sleepy. I'm completely drained.

29
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:42,487
I can't keep my eyes open.

30
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:46,847
All I can think about is my bed.

31
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:50,727
How about we go to my room
and sleep together?

32
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:53,687
Jerk. Don't say these creepy things.

33
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:56,407
What are you thinking?
I don't mean anything by it.

34
00:03:56,727 --> 00:03:57,607
Hit me again.

35
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:59,887
-Hit me again.
-So what if I hit you again?

36
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,527
So what if I hit you again?

37
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,367
Xiaoyou, Yifen wanted me
to give you this gift.

38
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:28,967
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

39
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:32,487
-What can it be?
-Open it.

40
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:43,847
It's a doll Xiaogeng made herself.

41
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,487
It's so cute.

42
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:48,767
It looks like you.

43
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:55,567
Is that so? It's quite cute.

44
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:01,727
There's a letter too.

45
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:11,327
<i>Xiaoyou.</i>

46
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:14,167
<i>Sorry for not giving you this gift myself.</i>

47
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:16,527
<i>I'm graduating soon.</i>

48
00:05:16,727 --> 00:05:19,367
<i>I've already started
my post-graduation work.</i>

49
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:23,447
<i>Because of you,</i> <i>I met Ximen again.</i>

50
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:27,007
<i>It made me clearly realize what I want</i>.

51
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,967
<i>To me, that's the best
graduation present from you.</i>

52
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,327
<i>A long time ago,
I made this doll to look like Ximen.</i>

53
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:40,687
<i>I think it should belong to you now.</i>

54
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:42,607
<i>I hope you like it.</i>

55
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:50,167
<i>I used to think that "Once in a Lifetime"
is a romantic feeling.</i>

56
00:05:50,487 --> 00:05:52,687
<i>Something to treasure, to take hold of,</i>

57
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,247
<i>and not let it slip away.</i>

58
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:01,847
Xiaogeng...

59
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:05,607
<i>But in this moment,</i>

60
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:09,367
<i>I think that it's also
an attitude towards life.</i>

61
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:12,527
<i>When you meet each other, treasure it.</i>

62
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:14,167
<i>When you missed each other,</i>

63
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,247
<i>be thankful for having it once.</i>

64
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:20,487
<i>This doll is more suitable for you now.</i>

65
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:28,047
<i>My "Once in a Lifetime"
was in another stage of my life.</i>

66
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:30,247
<i>That's enough.</i>

67
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:37,687
Welcome. What are you having?

68
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:41,167
Do you want some tea?
We have a special recommendation today.

69
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:42,087
No.

70
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:43,767
I don't want to drink tea.

71
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:47,327
-Give me some coffee.
-Okay.

72
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:56,447
SAN LIANGCHUN, TASTE OF OLD SHANGHAI

73
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:04,007
I'm not sure what happened to Xiaoyou
after that morning.

74
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:06,327
I want to ask but I'm embarrassed.

75
00:07:06,887 --> 00:07:09,127
What has it got to do with you?
You're meddling too much.

76
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:12,687
If your good friend didn't go

77
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:15,727
and mess up Xiaoyou's life,
she'd be just fine.

78
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:21,807
Just like I messed up yours?

79
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:27,207
Aren't you quite happy now?

80
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:30,567
<i>Who would've thought?</i>

81
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,647
<i>This person in front of me
stirred up my peaceful life,</i>

82
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:38,287
<i>gave me the courage to overcome
so many obstacles,</i>

83
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:41,487
<i>and let me step closer and closer
to him until today.</i>

84
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:47,287
What?

85
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:50,727
Seeing my handsome face
made you forget to eat?

86
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:56,687
That's what you call a feast for the eyes.

87
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:00,327
Stop being so narcissistic.
Eat your wantons.

88
00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:05,607
Shancai.

89
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:12,687
Let's eat all three meals together
for the rest of our lives.

90
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:14,007
What do you think?

91
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:18,447
Shancai.

92
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:20,047
Let's get married.

93
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,727
Get married?

94
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:28,927
I have it all planned out.

95
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:32,007
Even though your looks are mediocre,
your IQ's mediocre,

96
00:08:32,407 --> 00:08:33,767
your temper is very bad,

97
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,967
and there's a possibility of domestic
violence in our marriage...

98
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:37,887
Hey.

99
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:42,287
Okay. It's not just a possibility.
There will be violence for sure.

100
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:45,127
I don't mind. Shancai, let's get married.

101
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:47,887
-Is he proposing to her?
-What?

102
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,767
-What are they talking about?
-Really?

103
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:51,967
-It's so romantic.
-No way.

104
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:53,767
That girl is so lucky.

105
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:56,567
Why aren't you answering me?

106
00:08:56,647 --> 00:08:58,607
-He's kidding, right?
-I'm so envious.

107
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:02,967
Who proposes at this time and place
while eating wantons?

108
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,447
I just said what's on my mind.

109
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:07,287
And it's almost Chinese New Year.

110
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:10,167
I plan to visit your parents
at the fishing village.

111
00:09:11,447 --> 00:09:12,767
Your mom likes me so much.

112
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:14,847
She must be happy to marry you off to me.

113
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:17,927
This fast?

114
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:19,927
I haven't agreed yet.

115
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:21,607
I don't care.

116
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,807
I won't give you any reason to refuse.

117
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:30,207
Hey. Everyone.

118
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:32,847
This girl in front of me, Dong Shancai,
has agreed to marry me.

119
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,847
I hope you all can be the witnesses.
And wish us well, too.

120
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:38,447
Sure.

121
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:40,047
-All right. Sit down.
-Thanks, everyone.

122
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:41,527
It's my treat today.

123
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:04,567
<i>Let's eat all three meals together</i>

124
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,047
<i>for the rest of our lives.</i>

125
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,047
<i>What do you think?</i>

126
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:09,687
<i>Shancai.</i>

127
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:11,847
<i>Let's get married.</i>

128
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:20,847
<i>Am I dreaming?</i>

129
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:22,727
<i>Just now,</i>

130
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,207
<i>did Daoming Si really propose to me?</i>

131
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,047
Coming.

132
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,007
Miss Dong Shancai.

133
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:56,367
These are the 520 flowers
Mr. Daoming Si prepared for you.

134
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,447
It represents his feelings for you.

135
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,207
Please place them inside.

136
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:04,847
-All right.
-Over there.

137
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:16,327
-Thank you.
-There you go.

138
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,367
What a stupid boy.

139
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:31,287
He gave me something that's a waste
of money and cannot be kept.

140
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:36,207
But it smells quite nice.

141
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:40,687
Are there really 520 flowers?

142
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:42,887
Let me count them.

143
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:45,047
335, 336

144
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:48,407
337, 338, 339, 340

145
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:51,367
341, 342, 343, 344...

146
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:02,967
364, 365...

147
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:06,207
370, 371, 372

148
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:08,287
373, 374, 375

149
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:10,927
376, 377, 378

150
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:13,127
379. 380...

151
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,007
380, 381, 382, 383...

152
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:22,687
390, 391, 392, 393...

153
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:26,527
514, 515

154
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,047
516, 517, 518, 519.

155
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,527
Why is it still 519?

156
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,567
<i>So what do you think?
Do you like the roses?</i>

157
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:44,567
<i>You don't need to call and thank me.</i>

158
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:47,927
Daoming Si, you were supposed
to give me 520 flowers.

159
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:50,727
It's just 519. Where's the other one?

160
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:52,407
<i>No way.</i>

161
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:54,127
<i>Did you miscount since you're too stupid?</i>

162
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,167
How's that possible?
I counted 800 times. It's still 519.

163
00:12:57,247 --> 00:12:58,367
<i>Eight hundred times?</i>

164
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:01,007
<i>Who would be so lame to count it
that many times?</i>

165
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:03,047
You're the lame one. I don't care.

166
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,487
I want 520 flowers.
It can't be missing one.

167
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:11,247
All right. Somebody's here.
I'll deal with you later.

168
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:39,847
Because there's another one here.

169
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:54,127
Why are you so lame?

170
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:55,327
You even hid one flower.

171
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:57,527
You dare say I'm lame?

172
00:13:57,807 --> 00:13:58,887
See how I'll deal with you.

173
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:00,527
No.

174
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:03,687
-Don't.
-Come here.

175
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:05,727
I'm not going over there.

176
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:07,567
Come here.

177
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:23,607
Turns out 520 flowers are a lot.
I've never seen it with my own eyes.

178
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:25,807
I haven't seen it before either.

179
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:28,647
Daoming Si is so romantic.

180
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:32,127
If somebody gave me this many flowers,
I'd marry him right away.

181
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:35,727
You're talking about Ximen, right?

182
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,807
How are things between you two lately?

183
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:47,847
What does that shy look on your face mean?

184
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:52,327
Shancai. We're together now.

185
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,047
Together?

186
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:56,087
You and Ximen?

187
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:58,087
Yes.

188
00:14:58,607 --> 00:14:59,607
Wait.

189
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:01,407
What do you mean?

190
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:06,127
Do you mean that you're in a relationship?

191
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:07,527
Yes.

192
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,127
Does Ximen feel the same way?

193
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:11,487
Yes, I'm sure.

194
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:15,607
We're officially together.
It happened that day I went to see him.

195
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:16,807
Xiaoyou.

196
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:19,087
I have so many questions right now.

197
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:22,527
But seeing that you're so happy,
I won't ask you anything.

198
00:15:23,327 --> 00:15:25,287
As long as you're happy,
everything's fine.

199
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:29,727
No wonder.

200
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:32,127
After you went to see Ximen,

201
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:34,927
you changed your new QZone profile picture
to one with a bright smile.

202
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:41,167
Turns out you've succeeded in love.

203
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:44,367
That's right. It was taken that day.

204
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,607
<i>It sounded so nice.</i>

205
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:53,807
When I heard the music
from outside earlier,

206
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:57,887
I was thinking who could play
such a nice tune in school aside from you.

207
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:00,687
Turns out it was you.

208
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,687
Why are you back in school today?

209
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:09,127
I suddenly wanted to come back
and play here.

210
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:11,927
I feel like I won't be back
for a long time.

211
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:17,367
Before I leave the country, I want to
reminisce about playing music here.

212
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:24,047
You left a lot of memories
in this music room.

213
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,207
It would surely miss you when you're gone.

214
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:35,927
Did you say yes to Si's proposal?

215
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:39,967
Yes.

216
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:44,287
Why does it feel like you're worried?

217
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:49,487
I'm not sure either.

218
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:52,567
I feel like

219
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,807
so many things happened between us.

220
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:58,727
Maybe there's more yet to come.

221
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:03,367
Don't worry.

222
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:06,247
The two of you overcame so many trials.

223
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:08,447
Nothing can bring you down.

224
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:16,967
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Dong.</i>

225
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:18,527
<i>-Please let Shancai marry me.
-No.</i>

226
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:20,447
I strongly object to this.

227
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,487
Daoming Si is so thoughtful.

228
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:27,807
He even brought a skin care package.

229
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,927
But this is too sudden.

230
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:32,567
Shancai hasn't even graduated yet.

231
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:35,647
Since I've decided to work
at the Daoming Group,

232
00:18:35,887 --> 00:18:37,287
I might be traveling around a lot.

233
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:40,887
I'm afraid I'll be too busy
and have less time to spend with Shancai.

234
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:48,487
Are you not confident about Shancai
or is Shancai not confident about you?

235
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:51,967
No.

236
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,647
Shancai and I are both very confident.

237
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:56,687
However...

238
00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:58,927
However,

239
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:02,847
you don't want your mom
to interfere with your relationship.

240
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:06,367
So you're ignoring how she feels
and want to get married right away?

241
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:13,007
How can youngsters like you
be so impulsive?

242
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:14,407
Mom.

243
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,007
Sorry.

244
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:20,367
We didn't mean to make you and Dad mad.

245
00:19:22,487 --> 00:19:25,007
We just don't want to face
the problem with his mom.

246
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:38,487
Daoming Si, you know
that we really like you.

247
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:41,887
You're very respectful and well-mannered.

248
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:46,167
You're an outstanding person
inside and out.

249
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:50,927
And we know how nice you treat Shancai.

250
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:52,967
But have you ever thought
about her position?

251
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:58,607
If you get married just like that,
how would she face your mom afterward?

252
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:09,207
Shancai.

253
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:13,367
Your mom is very traditional
and she values family and harmony.

254
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:22,367
Yes. Mrs. Dong is right.

255
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:25,567
I'll ask my mom to allow me
to marry Shancai now.

256
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:30,247
Now?

257
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:34,327
Isn't your mom overseas?

258
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:38,487
She should be awake by this time.

259
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:41,007
I'll make a video call
and tell her about this.

260
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:42,447
No.

261
00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:44,087
Don't.

262
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,007
Shancai.

263
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:48,607
Your mom is right.

264
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,687
We need to do this sooner or later.

265
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:53,647
Let's not evade it.
Let's face it together.

266
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:14,047
CALLING MOM

267
00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:16,207
SI CALLING

268
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:25,647
<i>Hello?</i>

269
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:27,727
Mom.

270
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:31,527
I'm at Shancai's house with her parents.

271
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:33,927
-Hi, Mrs. Daoming.
-Let's say hi too.

272
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,447
Hello.

273
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:37,567
Hi.

274
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:39,927
Mom.

275
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:43,807
I'm here today to ask her parents
and you to allow Shancai and I

276
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,127
to get married.

277
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:46,967
Si.

278
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:49,607
Do you know what you're doing now?

279
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:51,527
Yes, I do.

280
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:53,727
I want to marry Shancai
as soon as possible.

281
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:55,327
There's no other woman for me.

282
00:21:56,407 --> 00:21:57,367
Let me say something.

283
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,447
To me, marriage is not child's play.

284
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,927
<i>It's between two families.
We can't deal with it lightly.</i>

285
00:22:03,047 --> 00:22:05,127
<i>Both sides' parents must agree
and acknowledge it.</i>

286
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:06,887
<i>We can't do this rashly.</i>

287
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:07,927
That's right.

288
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:11,047
I agree with Mrs. Dong on this.

289
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:16,807
Mom, I really hope you can allow
Shancai and I to get married.

290
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:21,807
Si.

291
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:24,047
Marriage is not child's play.

292
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:26,807
<i>Even more so for the Daoming family.</i>

293
00:22:27,487 --> 00:22:29,847
We have to plan it carefully.

294
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:35,047
Plan it carefully?

295
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:36,527
Mom.

296
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,167
-So you're agreeing.
-You...

297
00:22:39,447 --> 00:22:41,767
I'm busy now. I don't have time to talk.

298
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:43,567
When you're back home,

299
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:46,007
<i>we can discuss
the marriage-related matters.</i>

300
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:48,287
She agreed.

301
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:53,487
It seems your mom is not
that firmly opposed to this marriage.

302
00:22:54,527 --> 00:22:55,847
My mom knows me well.

303
00:22:55,927 --> 00:22:58,807
Once I've made my decision, it won't
change no matter how she opposes it.

304
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:00,007
And this is

305
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,687
my marriage we're talking about.

306
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:06,327
-I was so scared I couldn't even breathe.
-Here.

307
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:08,567
Yes.

308
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:09,607
Daoming Si.

309
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:12,927
Your mom's aura is so strong.

310
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:15,887
Just looking at her through the screen
made my hands all sweaty.

311
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,807
Look. They're still wet.

312
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:20,447
So what if you've sweat a lot?
Look at me pretending to be calm.

313
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:22,967
Actually, I was really scared.
My heart was beating so fast.

314
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:24,287
It's still out of rhythm now.

315
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:27,127
If Mrs. Dong was not firm
on getting my mom's permission,

316
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,647
I want to marry Shancai now.

317
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,327
These kids.

318
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:35,167
If you really love each other,
does it matter if you wait a bit longer?

319
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,567
All right. Your dad and I
will go to Shanghai next week

320
00:23:38,727 --> 00:23:40,847
and wait for your mom to discuss
your marriage, okay?

321
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:43,287
Okay.

322
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:55,247
Come on.

323
00:24:00,327 --> 00:24:02,607
SQUID KING

324
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:06,647
"Squid King's signature
Eight Treasure Spicy Sauce."

325
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,047
Shancai.

326
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:10,527
Your Eight Treasure Spicy Sauce
is so popular.

327
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:11,967
That's right.

328
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:15,527
Shancai came up with a lot of flavors
for our neighbors and friends.

329
00:24:15,607 --> 00:24:18,927
Lots of people are selling squid here now.
It's becoming a squid street.

330
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:24,087
Eight Treasure Spicy Sauce
with fresh squid.

331
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:25,607
What a nice idea.

332
00:24:26,727 --> 00:24:27,727
That's right.

333
00:24:27,927 --> 00:24:29,367
Do you know? Two days ago,

334
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:32,127
somebody came to discuss
franchising with us.

335
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:34,967
I didn't really understand it,

336
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:37,807
but I have my future son-in-law.
I don't need to worry.

337
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:40,047
Of course. I'll handle it.

338
00:24:42,487 --> 00:24:45,367
-Mom, I'll go and make preparations.
-Okay.

339
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:47,367
Me too.

340
00:24:48,847 --> 00:24:50,687
You don't have to go. You're our guest.

341
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:52,327
Let us do it.

342
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:55,087
Mother, I won't be a guest any longer.

343
00:24:57,807 --> 00:24:58,847
We'll be family.

344
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:09,287
Calling me Mother feels so good.
I'm so overwhelmed.

345
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,607
Call me again.

346
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:15,127
Mother.

347
00:25:16,287 --> 00:25:17,527
Go and help.

348
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:33,407
He called me mother.

349
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:58,207
<i>I can't believe I'm seeing
Daoming Si in an apron.</i>

350
00:25:58,887 --> 00:26:00,607
<i>This really goes against his image.</i>

351
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:47,287
Daoming Si.

352
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:50,087
My room is very small.

353
00:26:50,887 --> 00:26:52,327
Are you sure you want to sleep here?

354
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:53,647
Don't worry.

355
00:26:53,727 --> 00:26:56,687
It's not my first time sleeping
in a so-called small room, okay?

356
00:26:57,487 --> 00:26:59,887
But you're sleeping with my dad this time.

357
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:01,407
So what?

358
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:08,847
I'm not sure if he snores.

359
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:14,207
Even if there's thunder,
I'll still be able to sleep.

360
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:44,327
Here. A small fishing village
has no nice hotels.

361
00:27:44,407 --> 00:27:45,647
-Thank you, Mr. Dong.
-It's fine.

362
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:49,247
You're so tall. It must be hard for you
to sleep in a small room.

363
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:51,127
Well, it'll have to do for tonight.

364
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:52,687
-Okay.
-Let's share the room.

365
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:53,727
Okay.

366
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:56,407
Let's sleep.

367
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:58,807
By the way...

368
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:05,287
By the way, I heard you helped out
at the store today.

369
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:06,927
You must be tired.

370
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,247
It's fine. I'm not tired.

371
00:28:11,887 --> 00:28:14,927
Please take care of Shancai from now on.

372
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,647
Don't worry. I will.

373
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:24,687
Shancai looks like her mom
and their tempers are the same too.

374
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:25,887
They could be fierce.

375
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:29,007
Actually, they're very gentle
and kind deep inside.

376
00:28:29,927 --> 00:28:31,927
You have to be more patient with her.

377
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:34,807
Yes, I know.

378
00:28:35,607 --> 00:28:37,647
Also, you're so handsome.

379
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:41,807
If a girl throws herself at you
in the future,

380
00:28:42,247 --> 00:28:44,727
you must refuse her.

381
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:47,207
So that you won't hurt Shancai.

382
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:52,887
Don't worry.
I won't be interested in other girls.

383
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:55,527
All right.

384
00:28:56,287 --> 00:29:00,007
And also, some bad habits
cannot be tolerated, such as gambling.

385
00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:01,847
Everything is over once a man gambles.

386
00:29:01,927 --> 00:29:03,247
Mr. Dong, don't worry.

387
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:05,567
-I won't gamble.
-Okay.

388
00:29:05,807 --> 00:29:06,847
You don't.

389
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:11,167
But sometimes, a man has to do things
for his image or to make friends, then...

390
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:14,127
They'll say they had no choice.

391
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,927
I was bad when I was
in senior high school.

392
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:20,167
But my good friends helped change me.

393
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:21,967
They're very good people.

394
00:29:22,447 --> 00:29:23,407
Don't worry.

395
00:29:25,207 --> 00:29:26,927
Yes. I...

396
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:29,327
Am I nagging at you?

397
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:32,047
I know.

398
00:29:32,447 --> 00:29:34,247
You all come from well-known families.

399
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:36,607
I'm the unsuccessful one.

400
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:39,247
What right do I have to educate you?

401
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:42,127
To put it bluntly,

402
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,047
I'm just an ordinary dad
who's worried about her daughter.

403
00:29:45,647 --> 00:29:46,567
Mr. Dong.

404
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:48,327
Please don't say that.

405
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:51,687
I was attracted to Shancai
because of her personality.

406
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:53,967
Her world view, her values.

407
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:57,087
You taught her so well.

408
00:29:57,607 --> 00:30:00,927
You gave her so much love.
That's very incredible.

409
00:30:02,887 --> 00:30:05,607
Really? You really think so?

410
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:06,967
That's great.

411
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:09,887
I don't need to worry about
entrusting Shancai to you.

412
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:12,607
It's true.

413
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:15,607
Shancai is really a very nice kid.

414
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:18,927
All right. I'll stop.

415
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:20,927
If I go on, I'll...

416
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,847
I'll regret marrying Shancai off so early.

417
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:26,927
I'll stop. Let's sleep.

418
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:28,167
Mr. Dong.

419
00:30:29,087 --> 00:30:30,647
Let me take care of Shancai.

420
00:30:31,047 --> 00:30:32,167
I won't let her down.

421
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:46,767
Let's sleep.
Do you want to sleep on the bed?

422
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:49,127
No. You go ahead.

423
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:50,647
Good night.

424
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:14,007
That's great, Shancai.
I'm so happy for you.

425
00:31:14,727 --> 00:31:17,207
So am I the first friend to know
about your marriage?

426
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:18,207
Of course.

427
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:20,047
Goodness.

428
00:31:20,127 --> 00:31:22,727
You're the first one to get married
in our senior high school class.

429
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:25,767
I can imagine the whole class
attending your wedding.

430
00:31:25,847 --> 00:31:27,327
It would be so much fun.

431
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,847
Do you remember when Daoming Si
hit Yan Zhibu at our reunion?

432
00:31:32,247 --> 00:31:33,647
On your wedding day,

433
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:37,087
those guys who wanted to pursue you
would surely get Daoming Si drunk

434
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:39,567
so that he won't be able
to sleep with you.

435
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:42,287
All right, Xiaoyou.
Aren't you getting too excited?

436
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:43,887
Of course I'm excited.

437
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,967
I've seen your journey with Daoming Si.

438
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:50,047
From initially hating each other

439
00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:52,167
until he pursued you so relentlessly.

440
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:54,607
He likes you, but you didn't like him.

441
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:58,167
After you already liked each other,
his mom created trouble.

442
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:02,567
Then you two
experienced life and death together.

443
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,007
I know what happened
better than anyone else.

444
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:06,847
And I can relate to it better than anyone.

445
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:10,087
Now that I think about it,

446
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:12,567
if you didn't keep on advising me

447
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,767
and encouraging me

448
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:17,687
and served as my friend and love analyst,

449
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:21,047
Daoming Si and I
might have already broken up.

450
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,247
Thanks to you,

451
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:25,167
we're still together.

452
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:28,527
So it's all because of me?

453
00:32:28,727 --> 00:32:29,767
Yes.

454
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,727
Then I'll ask for a big red envelope
from Daoming Si.

455
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:36,887
Sure. I'll ask him to give you a big one.

456
00:32:37,327 --> 00:32:39,207
-Don't lie to me.
-Why would I do that?

457
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,087
Perfect timing.

458
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:44,967
Tomorrow, F4 will make a speech
in Mingde as outstanding graduates.

459
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:47,447
I'll tell him if I see him.

460
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:49,127
Tomorrow?

461
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:52,247
Why? Do you have a date?

462
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:54,647
I have a date with Ximen.

463
00:32:57,567 --> 00:32:59,967
-You won't get a red envelope then.
-No way.

464
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:01,487
On your wedding day,

465
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:04,607
I'd surely ask Daoming Si
to give me a big red envelope.

466
00:33:04,687 --> 00:33:07,487
You should be the one giving us
the red envelope then.

467
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:10,007
What do you mean "us"?

468
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:13,007
Is your heart is already one
with your husband

469
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:14,207
to ask me for a red envelope?

470
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:15,607
That's so sweet.

471
00:33:16,407 --> 00:33:19,127
Yes. We are sweet.

472
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:24,527
Xiaoyou.

473
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:31,447
Beloved students.

474
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:34,447
Mingde is a university full of elites.

475
00:33:34,727 --> 00:33:37,767
This university helped develop
many outstanding talents.

476
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:42,407
Among them are Mingde's
legendary students.

477
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:45,287
F4.

478
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:48,087
F4.

479
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:49,087
-F4
-Yes.

480
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:51,487
Everyone knows who I'm talking about.

481
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:55,327
Now, may we please invite Ximen
to come up on stage on F4's behalf

482
00:33:55,527 --> 00:33:57,767
and say a few words.

483
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:09,287
Beloved teachers

484
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:11,167
and students,

485
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:12,407
good morning.

486
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:14,247
I'm Ximen Yan.

487
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:19,247
Today, I return to Mingde with great joy.

488
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:21,487
And hope to bring you some inspiration.

489
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:25,487
Mingde University
has the most professional courses

490
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:27,447
and the best teachers.

491
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:31,127
But friendship is the most
important lesson

492
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,047
that's not taught in books.

493
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:37,327
I have three important friends in my life.

494
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:39,207
At Mingde University,

495
00:34:39,487 --> 00:34:41,927
we studied together and grew together.

496
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:44,847
Let me share our story with you.

497
00:34:48,007 --> 00:34:49,207
This auditorium

498
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:53,487
is where F4 won many awards,

499
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:55,927
especially for the bridge competition.

500
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:58,007
Because of the many awards we received,

501
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:01,447
a lot of students came forth
to challenge us.

502
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:05,847
That's right. Everybody knows
and has heard rumors

503
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:07,567
about the bets.

504
00:35:08,327 --> 00:35:09,607
The most ridiculous one

505
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:12,967
was eating slippers upon losing.

506
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:16,967
So, what do you want from me?

507
00:35:24,967 --> 00:35:25,847
What do you want?

508
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:27,447
Treat me to dinner.

509
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:30,287
What did you say?

510
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:32,927
Yes, we all know that.

511
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:34,887
But we still don't know
if it's true or not.

512
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:36,607
All right.

513
00:35:37,087 --> 00:35:39,487
I'll tell you the story
about eating slippers.

514
00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:43,247
There was a student
who confidently challenged us.

515
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:46,407
He was sure he's going to win.

516
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:48,687
At the bridge table, he declared

517
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,127
that the loser would eat his own slippers.

518
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:54,847
He lost in the end.

519
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,167
When he stood up, we just realized

520
00:35:58,527 --> 00:36:00,327
he was wearing slippers.

521
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:01,967
Of course.

522
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:04,607
We didn't really let him eat his slippers.

523
00:36:06,127 --> 00:36:09,927
Later on, when we saw that student again,
we forgot his name

524
00:36:11,207 --> 00:36:13,887
-and called him, "Eat slippers."
-I already forgot his name.

525
00:36:14,127 --> 00:36:15,247
-Me too.
-That's how

526
00:36:15,327 --> 00:36:18,007
the story of F4
making someone eat slippers

527
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:19,727
spread like wildfire.

528
00:36:21,487 --> 00:36:24,167
This story then became
one of the legends in school.

529
00:36:24,727 --> 00:36:26,887
In Mingde, we laughed,

530
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:31,287
enjoyed, cried, and suffered.

531
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:35,887
In life, there are always ups and downs.

532
00:36:37,527 --> 00:36:38,767
But I'm very lucky

533
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:41,527
because I was not alone.

534
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:45,047
There were always three friends
who were with me.

535
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,407
And never left my side.

536
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:51,327
We're not real brothers,
but our ties are even stronger.

537
00:36:52,487 --> 00:36:53,767
We know each other

538
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:55,727
more than we know ourselves.

539
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,847
The famous British philosopher
Francis Bacon once said,

540
00:37:01,207 --> 00:37:04,447
"Friendship not only lets people overcome
feelings of resentment and depression

541
00:37:04,647 --> 00:37:06,167
and walk towards a cloudless sky,

542
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:09,887
it can also rid them of dark thoughts

543
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:14,327
and always make them think
with light and reason."

544
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:17,247
That's the best way to describe F4.

545
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:20,567
Beloved students.

546
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:23,847
Mingde can be considered
a new beginning in your lives.

547
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:27,887
In the future,
you'll fulfill countless dreams.

548
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:46,167
Daoming Si.

549
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:48,087
Come and visit us after you graduate.

550
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:49,207
-Don't worry.
-Yes.

551
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:52,247
After I graduate, I'll come and visit.

552
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:53,247
He's so handsome.

553
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:54,807
-Really?
-You all have to miss me.

554
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:56,727
-You have to honor your word.
-No problem.

555
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:00,127
-Please sign this for me.
-Okay.

556
00:38:00,207 --> 00:38:01,767
Can I take a picture with you?

557
00:38:03,327 --> 00:38:04,247
Me too.

558
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:05,847
Here. Please sign this for me.

559
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:08,087
Look here.

560
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,407
He's so handsome.

561
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:13,087
-I want it too.
-Daoming Si.

562
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,367
Please sign this for me.

563
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:16,007
-Let's take a picture.
-Please sign this.

564
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,127
Please sign here.

565
00:38:17,887 --> 00:38:19,407
-Look here.
-He's so handsome.

566
00:38:19,487 --> 00:38:20,647
I'm so happy.

567
00:38:27,927 --> 00:38:28,767
Hey.

568
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:30,407
Green shoe guy.

569
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:34,007
What do you want?

570
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:37,087
What's this?

571
00:38:37,727 --> 00:38:38,567
A broken phone.

572
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,047
<i>Hey! I'm not done yet!</i>

573
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:45,727
That's enough.

574
00:38:47,447 --> 00:38:48,567
Ximen.

575
00:38:48,647 --> 00:38:50,527
-Can we take a picture with you?
-Just one.

576
00:38:50,607 --> 00:38:53,047
-Look at the camera.
-Look here.

577
00:38:53,127 --> 00:38:54,567
Huaze Lei too.

578
00:38:55,287 --> 00:38:57,247
-He's so handsome.
-Thank you.

579
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:00,367
Let's take another one, okay?

580
00:39:01,127 --> 00:39:01,967
Let's go.

581
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:06,407
-Bye.
-Come and visit often.

582
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:17,367
Green shoe guy.

583
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:18,687
Why did you wear that?

584
00:39:21,287 --> 00:39:25,647
To bring back embarrassing memories
and infuriate me?

585
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:41,087
There are so many people here
and you're so silly.

586
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:43,607
I was afraid you won't be able
to find me. So I wore this.

587
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:48,727
Why should I go find you?
Can't you come find me?

588
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:53,367
Is this how a boyfriend should be?

589
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:54,367
You...

590
00:39:54,447 --> 00:39:56,247
You two are really a strange couple.

591
00:39:57,247 --> 00:39:59,087
Must fighting be your way
of communicating?

592
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:01,687
That's right. Isn't it good
to talk about how you really feel?

593
00:40:06,847 --> 00:40:08,727
Shancai. Do you know?

594
00:40:09,327 --> 00:40:11,487
When you called me "Green Shoe Guy,"

595
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:13,247
you've already captured my heart.

596
00:40:15,727 --> 00:40:17,927
It hasn't changed since.

597
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:20,487
Si.

598
00:40:21,407 --> 00:40:23,647
Did you know?
We'll talk about our marriage tomorrow.

599
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:25,567
Don't forget about me.

600
00:40:26,567 --> 00:40:28,487
Don't let me wait all alone.

601
00:40:30,807 --> 00:40:31,767
Ximen.

602
00:40:32,727 --> 00:40:34,087
Just say yes to Meizuo.

603
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:36,847
I'll surely give you two
a big red envelope.

604
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:41,607
Shancai.

605
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:45,287
After discussing your marriage with Si,
you're already considered as Mrs. Daoming.

606
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:48,767
Before that happens,
we want to throw Si a bachelor party.

607
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:56,847
I didn't even know about that party.

608
00:40:57,047 --> 00:40:59,647
Isn't the party organizer very rude?

609
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:02,567
You're too sensitive.
Aren't we telling you now?

610
00:41:02,647 --> 00:41:03,887
We'll do it tomorrow night.

611
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:05,287
That's right.

612
00:41:05,487 --> 00:41:08,567
Shancai. Tomorrow night, Si is ours.

613
00:41:08,887 --> 00:41:10,327
Stay away.

614
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:13,407
All right.

615
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,367
He's all yours.

616
00:41:15,447 --> 00:41:17,327
You can have him for tonight.

617
00:41:17,407 --> 00:41:18,567
Don't be shy.

618
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:20,847
-You don't have to be shy.
-All right.

619
00:41:20,927 --> 00:41:21,847
Let's go.

620
00:41:26,847 --> 00:41:28,927
Honestly, I'm quite envious.

621
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:31,527
I'm fine.

622
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:34,647
There will still be trouble
whether you're in love or not.

623
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,087
I'm fine too.

624
00:41:38,847 --> 00:41:41,727
You're just fine?
Don't you have a date tonight?

625
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:43,727
You're fine?
Are you purposely infuriating me?

626
00:41:48,447 --> 00:41:50,447
Do you two have time tonight?

627
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:54,407
I smell something fishy.

628
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:55,767
What's up?

629
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:57,887
What else?

630
00:41:57,967 --> 00:41:59,407
The usual antics.

631
00:42:00,527 --> 00:42:01,927
It's been a while, okay?

632
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:03,687
We helped you set it up last time.

633
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:05,967
Tell me, are you helping out or not?

634
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:12,807
I'm attending
a music professor's gathering tonight.

635
00:42:13,127 --> 00:42:14,047
Bye.

636
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:19,807
I have to go to an activity
for the occasion tonight.

637
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:21,927
Bye.

638
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:23,407
Hey.

639
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,287
I'll do it alone then.

640
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:28,367
Ximen.

641
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:30,127
Why are you here all alone?

642
00:42:30,207 --> 00:42:32,367
-Your speech was great today.
-Yes.

643
00:42:32,527 --> 00:42:34,567
I feel proud of being part of F4 too.

644
00:42:35,287 --> 00:42:39,247
By the way, can I have the bridge room?

645
00:42:44,807 --> 00:42:46,487
Chen Qinghe.

646
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,527
Present.

647
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:49,687
Are you free tonight?

648
00:42:50,327 --> 00:42:51,207
Me?

649
00:42:51,927 --> 00:42:52,807
Yes.
