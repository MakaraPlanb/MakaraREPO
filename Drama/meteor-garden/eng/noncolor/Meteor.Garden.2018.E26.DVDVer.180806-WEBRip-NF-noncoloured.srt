EPISODE 26

4
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,240
So is Shancai safe?

5
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Did my mom meet her?

6
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,880
Should I go over there?

7
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,360
Stay put for now.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,040
You're going to make things worse
if you come back.

9
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,840
Shancai is in my room now.

10
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,480
Don't worry.

11
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,200
<i>We'll talk again tomorrow.</i>

12
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,920
<i>Enough for now.</i>

13
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,920
-<i>I'm hanging up.</i>
-Hey.

14
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,520
This damn old woman.

15
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,560
She hung up without saying anything.

16
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,560
She said enough.

17
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,160
At least she should let me
talk to Shancai.

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,040
What's up with hanging up like that?

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,680
Don't worry.

20
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,240
Ms. Yu won't lie to you.

21
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,040
That's right.

22
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,880
If something was wrong,

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,680
Shancai would've called you.

24
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,720
You think so?

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,680
Trust me.

26
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,320
Go to sleep. Worry about it tomorrow.

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,200
All right.

28
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,200
Can you turn around?

29
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,400
Why can't you turn the other way?

30
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,400
I'll say "three" and we both turn.

31
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
Three.

32
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,800
What now?

33
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,080
Sleeping butt to butt feels too awkward.

34
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,600
What do you want then?

35
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,320
Upside down.

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,280
Feet to head.

37
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,280
I can't be sleeping facing your feet.

38
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,200
Wait.

39
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,200
You don't want to see my head or my face

40
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,600
You don't like sleeping back to back
and even head to toe!

41
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,280
What do you want then?

42
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,560
What did Ms. Yu mean?

43
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,360
What was on Ms. Yu's mind?

44
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,960
The secret trick

45
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,520
is to sprinkle rose petals

46
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,280
on Si's bed.

47
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,880
Then light a candle.

48
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,280
Play Chou Jie Lun's "Confession Balloon."

49
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,160
And then,

50
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,080
the baby comes.

51
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,800
-You won't have to leave the house.
-That's...

52
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,520
That's too fast.

53
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,160
Of course.

54
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,080
I've been waiting anxiously.

55
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,000
Si's a grown man.

56
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,760
I really hope to see
the family's fourth generation.

57
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,040
Do you think we are cell phones
that could be updated that quickly?

58
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,560
Do you have any idea how to have a baby?

59
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,600
What kind of stupid trick is that?

60
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,760
Shancai.

61
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,160
Hi.

62
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,920
Good morning.

63
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,280
What's up with you?

64
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,480
Nothing.

65
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,920
Shancai.

66
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,880
I think you've been unhappy
since you started dating Daoming Si.

67
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,080
-Tell me if you have any problems.
-Stop being nosy.

68
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,520
She's busy being in love,
she has no time to sleep, okay?

69
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,520
Why can't she sleep if she's in love?

70
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,200
Do you want them to sleep together?

71
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,200
Of course not.

72
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,320
Stop talking nonsense, you two.

73
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,960
Okay, tell me then.

74
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,840
Have you been well lately?

75
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Why does it concern you
whether she is well or not?

76
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,960
Step aside.

77
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,400
Shancai, you met my mom again.

78
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,720
Did anything happen?

79
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,000
Ms. Yu is staying with us.
Of course nothing has happened.

80
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Why are you staring at me?

81
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,040
Come.

82
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,880
-Where to?
-Shancai.

83
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,080
Shancai!

84
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,320
Hey.

85
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,120
Hey.

86
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,120
Where are you taking me?

87
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,280
Rabbit Hole.

88
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,240
Rabbit Hole?

89
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,720
Your favorite shop.
You've been wanting to go, right?

90
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,280
This looks nice.

91
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,480
Try this.

92
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,920
Shancai, what's so nice about this place?

93
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,880
Thanks for waiting.
Here are the Pink Bubble cakes.

94
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,320
-So cute!
-Enjoy.

95
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,720
I've been craving these.

96
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,040
Delicious.

97
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,760
Why are you just drinking coffee?
Order some cakes.

98
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,880
No, thanks.

99
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,280
Order a different flavor

100
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,640
so we can share.

101
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,320
Do you want a taste?

102
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,560
Just try it.
How do you know it's not good?

103
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,480
Hurry up. My arm is aching.

104
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,080
You're so pushy.

105
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,360
So sweet.

106
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,880
How do you eat these things?

107
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,040
Cakes are supposed to be sweet.
If not, why eat cake?

108
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,400
Do girls like to eat these things?

109
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,680
Yes.

110
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,200
Eating sweet stuff makes us happy.

111
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,120
Can you tell me now?

112
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,640
About what?

113
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,880
Tell me what really happened last night.

114
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,400
It wasn't a big deal.

115
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,560
Have you ever been to Ms. Yu's room?

116
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,200
She invited me to her room
for tea yesterday.

117
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,320
<i>Whether it be the shaming from his mom</i>

118
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,080
<i>or Ms. Yu's secret plan,</i>

119
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,560
<i>I can't let Daoming Si know.</i>

120
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,040
<i>Telling him will only cause more problems.</i>

121
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,200
By the way, Ms. Yu told me about your dad.

122
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,360
I think your dad is incredible.

123
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,760
Do you look like him?

124
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,120
Why are you asking?

125
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,040
I'm curious.

126
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,200
Did you get your fighting skills
from your dad?

127
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,560
No.

128
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,320
I know. You must have gotten it
from your mom.

129
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,720
Yes, I can tell from your mom's physique

130
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,920
that she's a formidable fighter.

131
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,560
-Shancai.
-Yes?

132
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,680
I want to move out.

133
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,840
What?

134
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,400
You want to move out?

135
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,800
What does that mean?

136
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,880
Do you know what moving out means?

137
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,560
It means staying on my own.

138
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,280
How do you plan on staying on your own?

139
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,960
What is there to plan?

140
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,680
It will just be a slightly smaller place
than the current house.

141
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,480
Hey, sir.

142
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,000
Let me ask you.

143
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,320
Do you know if

144
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,440
the electric heater in your house
is switched on before or after you shower?

145
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,840
I know.

146
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,880
Do you know what's the right voltage
for the induction cooker?

147
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,200
Yes.

148
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,480
No maids.

149
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,960
You need to cook.

150
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,200
You'll need to settle
the utility bills every month.

151
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,160
Do you know all that?

152
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,280
You're nagging.

153
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,080
I know how tough it is

154
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,440
-so I want you to know before...
-If I don't move out,

155
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,920
how will I protect you?

156
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,160
<i>Because of me,</i>

157
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,440
<i>many things are unravelling.</i>

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,920
<i>I can't put into words
the gratitude I feel for Daoming Si.</i>

159
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,080
<i>But I know in my heart
that he's not doing the right thing.</i>

160
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,680
Let's go.

161
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,440
-Where to?
-To a housing agency.

162
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,960
-Stop fooling around.
-Nobody is fooling around.

163
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,560
-Everything I said was true.
-That's why I'm scared.

164
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,760
I really don't get you.
You always drive me up the wall.

165
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
All right.

166
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,720
I won't nag.

167
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,320
Let's go.

168
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,400
Where to?

169
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,840
You're pulling my arm off.

170
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,960
Why do you walk so slow
with those long legs?

171
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,280
Hold on.

172
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,080
Is this the fun place you said?

173
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,160
These are for kids.

174
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,120
You said you didn't like
pink places, right?

175
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
Come on. Let's have some fun.

176
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,680
Over there.

177
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,000
-Faster! Hurry.
-I'll destroy you!

178
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,320
You're dead!

179
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,080
I'll kill all of you!

180
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,240
SUCCESS!

181
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm amazing, right?

182
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,920
Si.

183
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,360
Is she your friend?

184
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,080
Yes.

185
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,840
Then please escort her out.

186
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,600
If you dare to walk out this door,
be prepared for the consequences.

187
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,760
If a stumbling block appears in your life,

188
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,120
you'd remove it too, right?

189
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,960
I will never allow such an unrefined girl

190
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,800
to be in my house.

191
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,600
Hey.

192
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,720
You must have kept it all inside.

193
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,160
No.

194
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,360
Something must have happened yesterday.
Am I right?

195
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,440
I told you nothing happened.

196
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,800
I knew it.

197
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,000
You must have the gene
of a mutant beast in your body.

198
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,160
I didn't even give it my all.
Who knew that thing would break so easily?

199
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,320
-Barbaric.
-You're the same too.

200
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,360
Nobody would want to marry
such a strong girl.

201
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,800
Whatever.

202
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,600
I deal with my everyday life
using this exact strength.

203
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,720
Got a problem?

204
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,160
You're always showing off
how strong you are.

205
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,200
Not feminine at all.

206
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,480
You can always look for a delicate,
weak girl to be your girlfriend.

207
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,160
Are you crazy?
You're picking a fight, aren't you?

208
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,800
That's the truth.

209
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,400
You're weird yourself.

210
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,800
Most guys prefer that kind of girl.

211
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,360
Who said so?

212
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,560
It doesn't concern me. I'm not like that.

213
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,120
So what about you?

214
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,320
Which type are you?

215
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,080
Which type are you? Tell me.

216
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,920
Which type are you?

217
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,840
Which one?

218
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,080
What I mean is

219
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,320
I only like you.

220
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,200
Why are you saying that so suddenly?

221
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,560
You made me.

222
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,880
Didn't you see the stairs?

223
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,560
You need to watch where you're going.

224
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,480
I'm not a three-year-old, you know.

225
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,240
In my eyes, you're just like a kid
who needs to be protected.

226
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,440
You're exaggerating.

227
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,320
Since when do I make people worry?

228
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,760
All the time.

229
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,320
I worry about you all the time.

230
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,040
Yeah, right.

231
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,880
My parents are back at the village,
but I'm doing fine by myself in Shanghai.

232
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,720
I work and earn money for my own expenses.
I have multiple jobs.

233
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,120
I'm a cleaner at your house,
and nobody talked about it.

234
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,080
I'm fine all by myself.

235
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,080
So how long are you going
to get by on your own?

236
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,080
In your eyes, am I really that unreliable?

237
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,080
That's not it.

238
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,280
Then why won't you tell me?

239
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,440
Do you think I can't tell
that you're unhappy?

240
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,320
Sorry.

241
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,520
I just feel that

242
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,160
they're my own problems.

243
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,520
They don't concern you.

244
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,960
Right.

245
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,160
Whatever happens to you
is unrelated to me.

246
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,880
Just like you don't need me.

247
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,200
Daoming Si.

248
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,400
I didn't mean it that way.

249
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,800
Are you still not getting it?

250
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,920
You don't get me either.

251
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,240
I'm worried about you.

252
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,800
It has nothing to do with you
being a superwoman or not.

253
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,040
I don't want you to leave the house.

254
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,080
This woman...

255
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,400
Can't you see I'm doing it for you?

256
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,200
I know.

257
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,440
Then why?

258
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,160
We're a couple.

259
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,520
The effort we put in the relationship
should be balanced.

260
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,440
If I'm overly reliant on you,

261
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,200
we'll lose this balance.

262
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,280
I know this doesn't make me cute at all.

263
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,560
I'm stubborn and unreasonable.

264
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,240
But I hope you can accept the way I am.

265
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,800
One more thing.

266
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,560
Knowing that you're willing to leave
the house for me,

267
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,440
I'm touched.

268
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,200
I'm so happy.

269
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
So...

270
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,440
I'm going home.

271
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,440
<i>I, Dong Shancai,
am not a weak girl who can't live</i>

272
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,160
<i>without a man's protection.</i>

273
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,320
<i>But I do appreciate your concern.
Thank you, Daoming Si.</i>

274
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,400
What's up with him?

275
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
No idea.

276
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,880
The one behind you is weird too.

277
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,280
Hey, give it back!

278
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,360
What is that?

279
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,520
Did a woman take weird photos of you

280
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,880
and you're being threatened?

281
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,360
Not that kind of photos.

282
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,600
Why are you so nervous then?

283
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,400
I'm not interested in any woman.

284
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,880
Lei.

285
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,160
I'm sure he's hiding something.

286
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
Let me see.

287
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,840
Hey!

288
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,080
Just let me see.

289
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,440
-Stop it.
-Show it to me.

290
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,080
-Hey.
-No, I won't.

291
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,240
-Stop it.
-Let me see.

292
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,480
-Stop it.
-Just a glimpse.

293
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,000
Hey, you guys.

294
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,120
Grow up, will you?

295
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,240
I'm saying,
you should stop fooling around.

296
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,680
Having a serious relationship
trumps everything else.

297
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,840
What did I just hear?

298
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,000
Our Si actually said
the word "relationship."

299
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,440
People that don't feel it
with their heart won't understand.

300
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,480
Looks like something good happened.

301
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,080
Not just good.

302
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,480
Today is the happiest day

303
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,480
of my life.

304
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,240
What happened?

305
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
I'm not telling you.

306
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,360
Hey.

307
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Telling you guys will spoil the happiness.

308
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,520
I'm also starting

309
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,120
a very serious relationship.

310
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,560
Si's love story has ended.
Now you're starting your act?

311
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,440
What do you mean "a serious relationship"?

312
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,440
No.

313
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,080
Don't be too quick to jump the gun.

314
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,160
First, we need to see this girl.

315
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,440
Zhou Caina?

316
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,320
The champion of Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition.

317
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,280
That person?

318
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,200
I ran into her a few times.

319
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,280
She seems like an interesting girl.

320
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,120
So?

321
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,080
Even if it's Zhou Caina,

322
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,280
you're the outstanding Meizuo of F4.

323
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,280
-She'd be an easy catch.
-I didn't say I couldn't get her.

324
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,480
Then why are you so anxious?

325
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,000
The one in the photo just now
is her, right?

326
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,840
Going after girls isn't that hard.
But this is Caina we're talking about.

327
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,880
The problem is

328
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,040
I need to first get rid

329
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,080
of Mr. Obstacle.

330
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,920
What kind of crazy photo is this?

331
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,440
Did something happen
between Zhou Caina and this man?

332
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,080
How did you know?

333
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,760
-Everyone would've guessed.
-How?

334
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,560
It's not printed on their foreheads.

335
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,080
Does Zhou Caina still like him?

336
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
To put it simply,

337
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,520
they didn't end their relationship
on a good note.

338
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,280
I'm not anxious or anything.

339
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,480
I just want Mr. Obstacle
out of the picture

340
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,120
without hurting Caina too much.

341
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,920
I want him to willingly disappear.

342
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,240
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

343
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,440
What?

344
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,560
All you need to do is beat him up.

345
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,000
Please. We don't support violence.

346
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,680
He only knows how to fight.

347
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,120
Hey.

348
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,080
What's wrong with fighting?

349
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,840
-Don't.
-Don't.

350
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,320
When you meet the man again,

351
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,040
give him a compliment.

352
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,040
Give a compliment?

353
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,160
Yes.

354
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,200
Make sure you do it in front of Caina.

355
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,160
You mean,

356
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,920
the ultimate strategy
in adult love philosophy?

357
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,480
Mr. Lu, this spanner doesn't work.

358
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,880
-Give me the pliers.
-Okay.

359
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,200
Can you do it? Let me.

360
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,400
It's okay. I'll do it.

361
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,240
Your phone.

362
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,800
Hello?

363
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,240
Hi, Caina.

364
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,000
Do you want to go
to a violin recital tonight?

365
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,000
I can't. Something happened at home.

366
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,960
What's wrong?

367
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,280
It's nothing. Just a leak.

368
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,840
I'll talk to you later.

369
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,520
I told you, there's a leak at my house.

370
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,480
I can't go.

371
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,200
<i>A leak in the house?</i>

372
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,400
<i>Why?</i>

373
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,120
<i>Is something wrong with the house?</i>

374
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
It's you.

375
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,400
Can you do it?

376
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,160
Maybe I should just call the plumber.

377
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,000
Thanks.

378
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,240
You must check all the pipes in the house.

379
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,920
Okay. I'll get a plumber to come.

380
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,000
That day, you--

381
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,960
I wanted to ask you...

382
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,440
Why exactly did you call me just now?

383
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,040
Mr. Lu, I did a quick check.

384
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,720
The pipes in the kitchen and bathroom
are in bad condition.

385
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,280
Get a plumber to fix them.

386
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,520
Okay, thanks.

387
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,240
Can you also check her bedroom
while you're here?

388
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,200
I think the ceiling is broken.
It leaks when it rains.

389
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,760
Okay.

390
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,000
Where's the room?

391
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,480
It's upstairs.

392
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,880
Wait!

393
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,480
Wait a minute.

394
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,080
<i>I guess he doesn't remember after all.</i>

395
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,640
<i>It's fine if he doesn't.</i>

396
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,840
I've checked your bedroom.

397
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,200
It's not a big problem.

398
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,080
Just ask the plumber to fix it up.

399
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,200
Thank you.

400
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,480
I'll be going then.

401
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,120
Wait.

402
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,440
Did you see anything in my room just now?

403
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,520
-No.
-Nothing at all?

404
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,560
Was there anything I was supposed to see?

405
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,320
If you didn't see anything,

406
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,960
you can go then.

407
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,560
What a coincidence.

408
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,120
My boyfriend is here to take me out.

409
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,040
What is Terence doing here?

410
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,080
He came to fix the leak.

411
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,560
Don't bother yourself
with Caina's problems in the future.

412
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,560
I'll be here to help her.

413
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,360
You came too late.

414
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,240
I've already fixed the pipes.

415
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,040
Did you come here quicker than me
because you're a professional plumber?

416
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,320
Caina and I are old friends.

417
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,800
It's only right to help her
with simple things.

418
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,920
As Caina's boyfriend,

419
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,640
I should properly thank you then.

420
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,760
It's okay.

421
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,600
We should thank this guy
who fixed the pipes.

422
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,080
Or else he might come back
to ask for repayment.

423
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,280
You're welcome.

424
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,840
Bye.

425
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,640
That Terence can't seem
to stay away from you.

426
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,880
It's not what you think.

427
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,520
He just came here to help fix the pipes.

428
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,440
Are you pretending to be naive?

429
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,280
That's what I think.

430
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,480
Only a guy can see through another guy.

431
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,640
I can see it.

432
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,760
Just now and the time at the bar,

433
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,600
he expected something more from you.

434
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,960
He wouldn't expect anything from me.

435
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,040
If he does, what will you do?

436
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,280
So what if he does?

437
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,320
A one-night-stand is the worst.

438
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,480
A genuine and lasting relationship

439
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,360
must be based on understanding and growth.

440
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,160
Such a relationship takes time.

441
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,360
Both parties must get to know each other.

442
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,160
That's how a relationship can be strong

443
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,400
and everlasting.

444
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,520
Remember what you said?

445
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,040
Did you mean it when you called me
your boyfriend?

446
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,760
-I was just--
-It's okay.

447
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,480
You might not be serious,

448
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,200
but I am.

449
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,760
Besides, I'm confident

450
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,880
that I'll make you fall for me.

451
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,440
Meizuo.

452
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,040
-Where do you get your confidence from?
-Because I want to see you smile

453
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,360
every moment of my life.

454
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,560
Dong Shancai.

455
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,320
What have you done?

456
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,200
Jeez.

457
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,880
It didn't kill you anyway.

458
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,120
In some countries,

459
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,920
that's how people greet each other.

460
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,720
It's fine for a girl like me
to kiss him first.

461
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,000
It doesn't have to mean anything.

462
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,480
What were you saying?

463
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,920
It's fine for a girl to...

464
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
Huaze Lei.

465
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,200
When did you get here?

466
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,600
"It didn't kill you anyway."

467
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,240
"In some countries,
that's how people greet each other."

468
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,560
Did you and Si...

469
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,800
kiss?

470
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,560
Why were you eavesdropping?

471
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,480
Shancai,

472
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,960
you didn't mumble. I could hear you.

473
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,120
So you kissed him first?

474
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,360
It must be nice, right?

475
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,640
I didn't kiss him first. Stop speculating.

476
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,200
Doing that wasn't...

477
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,520
that different from a Christmas wish.

478
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,120
Okay.

479
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,720
Then give me a kiss too.

480
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,240
Wish me a Merry Christmas.

481
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,400
Hurry up.

482
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,960
Come on.

483
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,800
See?

484
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,400
You can't do it, can you?

485
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,840
That "Christmas wish"
isn't for just anybody.

486
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,320
Shancai.

487
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,760
Yes?

488
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,440
How are things with Si's mom?

489
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
What do you mean?

490
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,840
Did she kick you out?

491
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
No.

492
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,360
She almost kicked me out.

493
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,600
But Ms. Yu stopped her.

494
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,080
And?

495
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
That's all.

496
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,760
Did anything weird happen to you?

497
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,960
Anything weird?

498
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,520
I don't think so.

499
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,040
You have a friend
who went to Canada with us, right?

500
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,440
Xiaoyou?

501
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,520
Yes. What about her?

502
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,280
You need to go check on her.

503
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,720
Maybe something has happened.

504
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,120
Why?

505
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,960
Si's mom probably already
did something to her.

506
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,000
That's impossible.

507
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,560
This has nothing to do with Xiaoyou.

508
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,920
Besides, it's way too soon.

509
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,520
Do you know who you're dealing with?

510
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,160
Si's mom is a powerful figure
of the food chain business.

511
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,040
Most people must spend

512
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,160
half their lives to accomplish something.

513
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,520
Si's mom can do so only in 15 minutes.

514
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,160
Also, don't forget.

515
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,840
You'll never know
where she will strike next.

516
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,160
She's Si's mom.

517
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,880
She knows Si inside out.

518
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,760
Stopping him will only make him
rebel even more.

519
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,160
So she's targeting you instead.

520
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,800
But she didn't expect

521
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,440
that her constant pressure on you
didn't yield any results.

522
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,360
She can no longer target your family.

523
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,320
If she wants to topple you

524
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,800
or attack you more efficiently,

525
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,400
she'll have to start with your friends.

526
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,880
What is she going to do? What can she do?

527
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,080
People make mistakes.

528
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,560
But Si's mom...

529
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,320
To be at the top in a cutthroat
business industry means...

530
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,360
Hi, your drinks are ready.
Please come again.

531
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,320
Thanks.

532
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,760
TRANSFER OF 2,800 YUAN INTO YOUR SAVINGS.
BALANCE, 21,600 YUAN.

533
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,000
MOM CALLING

534
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,920
Mom, what's up?

535
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,880
What?

536
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,320
You're moving now?

537
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,560
So boring.

538
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,840
Shancai disappeared right after class.

539
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,800
I bet Daoming Si kidnapped her.

540
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,400
If you want, you can kidnap Shancai too.

541
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,400
Mr. Single.

542
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,240
Who are you calling Mr. Single?

543
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,920
I'm so busy picking up calls every day.

544
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,840
DAD CALLING

545
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,480
If you don't pick up soon,

546
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,680
your dad's hanging up.

547
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,760
Hey, Dad.

548
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
I'm at school.

549
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,920
What?

550
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,280
The company what?

551
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,880
She won't attack without any reason.

552
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,760
But if the other party trips

553
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,520
and shows any signs of weakness,

554
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,840
then you can't blame her
for making the move.

555
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,040
Shancai, I'm not trying to scare you.

556
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,280
When you decided to go out with Si,

557
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,000
you should be ready to make sacrifices.

558
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,080
Even if

559
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,360
they're important to you.

560
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,400
<i>Your friend's parents</i>

561
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,880
<i>have business deals with Daoming Group.</i>

562
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,800
<i>It's a piece of cake</i>

563
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,760
<i>for her to control them.</i>

564
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,880
<i>Huaze Lei is overreacting.</i>

565
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,200
<i>Why?</i>

566
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,080
<i>Why are my friends dragged into this?</i>

567
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,200
Li Zhen, where's Qinghe?

568
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,480
He just left.

569
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,160
There's an emergency at home.

570
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,920
Hey!

571
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,200
<i>The dominating aura of that woman</i>

572
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,480
<i>has seeped into every corner of my life.</i>

573
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,600
<i>She's going to do whatever it takes</i>

574
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,160
<i>to make me leave Daoming Si.</i>

575
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,600
Xiaoyou?

576
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,560
-Are you...
-<i>Shancai.</i>

577
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,120
<i>I don't think I'll see you again.</i>

578
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,040
Where are you right now?

579
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,240
<i>At home.</i>

580
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
Wait for me.

581
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,000
Shancai.

582
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,800
Qinghe.

583
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,200
Where are you going?

584
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,560
Something happened at home.

585
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,120
What happened?

586
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,920
Something's wrong my dad's contract
and it has resulted in some loss.

587
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,880
He's being sued.

588
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,560
No way.

589
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,440
My dad is talking with his lawyer.

590
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,200
I need to get home and see my mom.

591
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,560
Qinghe, I'm sorry.

592
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,200
It's my fault.

593
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,560
It's all my fault. Sorry.

594
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,520
Why are you apologizing
for my family's problem?

595
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,440
I...

596
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,960
I'll explain later.

597
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,920
Shancai.

598
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,120
Xiaoyou.

599
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,120
Shancai.

600
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,960
My dad has been transferred to Qinghai.

601
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,640
He's probably not coming back to Shanghai.

602
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,600
Ma'am, I know why Mr. Jiang
is being transferred.

603
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,120
Don't pack up just yet.

604
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,280
Wait for a while.

605
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,360
I promise.

606
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,600
I promise Mr. Jiang will be able to stay.

607
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,360
Shancai, where are you going?

608
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,520
Is everything taken care of?

609
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,360
It's been carried out
according to your orders.

610
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,760
All good?

611
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,680
Presumably.

612
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,760
It's a little slow.

613
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,480
That's on me. It won't happen again.

614
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,600
Don't worry.

615
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,080
I've always been fair in my judgment.

616
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,120
Prepare the afternoon tea
to greet our guest.

617
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,200
Yes.

618
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,240
<i>I finally gathered my courage
and confessed my feelings.</i>

619
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,920
<i>Daoming Si and I can finally move
a step closer.</i>

620
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,240
<i>But why is this happening?</i>

621
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,480
<i>Instead of going down that path,</i>

622
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,000
<i>am I running the opposite way?</i>
