EPISODE 21

4
00:01:30,617 --> 00:01:32,337
Daoming Si agreed to date me.

5
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:41,657
I'm not sure how it happened so fast.

6
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:45,337
I originally wanted to come
and ask you. Then...

7
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:48,337
Hey.

8
00:01:49,897 --> 00:01:51,057
Monkey.

9
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:55,057
Who are you calling Monkey?

10
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:58,337
Xiaozi. I want to tell you something.

11
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,817
I'm not listening to you.
I know what you're going to say.

12
00:02:01,897 --> 00:02:03,697
You want to say
that you don't like me, right?

13
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,857
You also sent your friends
to date me today, right?

14
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:09,457
Do you think that would make me back out?

15
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:11,497
You're wrong.

16
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:13,897
-My strongest point is perseverance.
-Let's date.

17
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:22,617
Hey.

18
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:23,937
Is that okay?

19
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:27,337
What did you say?

20
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,137
All right.

21
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:34,257
Yes.

22
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:35,737
Yes.

23
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,977
He said he'd try to like me.

24
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:41,457
I'm really touched.

25
00:02:43,017 --> 00:02:45,817
I'm not sure why I'm so happy.

26
00:02:46,817 --> 00:02:47,977
I just realized

27
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:51,777
that I really like him.

28
00:02:59,017 --> 00:02:59,937
Shancai.

29
00:03:00,777 --> 00:03:02,017
Are you happy for me?

30
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:08,817
I knew you'd succeed.

31
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:12,977
You're not mad, right?

32
00:03:13,857 --> 00:03:14,817
No.

33
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:34,417
Nutrition refers to the calories
contained in the food

34
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:36,537
as well as other components
good for our health.

35
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:39,817
Humans consume food
to obtain enough nutrients.

36
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:41,737
After food consumption

37
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:44,337
and going through digestion,
absorption, and metabolism,

38
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:48,577
the body utilizes the substances it needs
to maintain life-sustaining activities.

39
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:52,897
Through proper nutrition,
a lot of diseases can be prevented.

40
00:03:52,977 --> 00:03:55,017
<i>I brought my Grandma's banana rice balls.</i>

41
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:56,097
<i>See you later.</i>

42
00:03:56,297 --> 00:03:59,417
Those are the human's six basic elements
for sustaining life.

43
00:03:59,497 --> 00:04:01,577
Do you know what the six elements are?

44
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:03,457
They are carbohydrates,

45
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:07,737
protein, fats, minerals,

46
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:08,977
vitamins.

47
00:04:13,257 --> 00:04:15,297
I heard that Si asked
that monkey to date him.

48
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:17,417
Si and Monkey.

49
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:19,217
I can't imagine it.

50
00:04:21,617 --> 00:04:22,817
Her name is Xiaozi.

51
00:04:23,377 --> 00:04:27,377
As his friend, you guys should be happy
that he's starting to become mature.

52
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:30,897
Shancai.

53
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:32,977
Why do you seem unaffected by this?

54
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:35,097
Don't you feel upset?

55
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:37,697
Shancai!

56
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,057
I finally found you.

57
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:41,657
I brought you lunch today.

58
00:04:41,737 --> 00:04:42,577
Let's eat together.

59
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:44,937
Didn't you say you especially like

60
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:46,337
-my Grandma's rice balls?
-Shut up.

61
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:48,617
Eat your rice balls.

62
00:04:52,497 --> 00:04:54,457
Do you want some? It's really good.

63
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:56,257
No.

64
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,977
My grandma made this for you.

65
00:04:58,057 --> 00:04:59,257
You can't share it with others.

66
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:05,457
How does it taste?

67
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:07,097
Will we get an upset stomach from this?

68
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:08,657
It's sticky.

69
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:09,897
It's delicious.

70
00:05:15,697 --> 00:05:16,897
Where did Daoming Si go?

71
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,297
Where's Meizuo?

72
00:05:18,897 --> 00:05:20,257
Meizuo was just here earlier.

73
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:21,497
I'm not sure where he went.

74
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:24,897
Si should be on a date
with his girlfriend.

75
00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:26,857
What?

76
00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:28,617
Daoming Si has a girlfriend?

77
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:38,457
Your smile looks so ugly.

78
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:45,497
I wonder how Si and that monkey is doing.

79
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:54,337
Si, why are you walking so fast?

80
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:57,297
-Are we having a race?
-You're so noisy.

81
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,297
I hate walking slowly.

82
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:01,857
Is this even a date?

83
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:04,737
What's the difference from before?

84
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:06,537
I was so looking forward to today's date.

85
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,617
But you won't even look at me.
And you're not saying anything.

86
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:12,497
Why are we even together?

87
00:06:13,177 --> 00:06:14,377
What do you want me to do?

88
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:21,457
First of all, you have to match my pace.

89
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:23,817
Then you have to smile.

90
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:26,657
Lastly, you have to talk to me.

91
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:29,937
Why is it so hard?

92
00:06:41,137 --> 00:06:42,977
-Hey, what are you doing?
-What?

93
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:45,097
So what?

94
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:46,137
You're my boyfriend.

95
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:48,537
Si.

96
00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:52,977
I'm so happy because you said
you'd try to like me.

97
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:54,697
Is that true?

98
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:58,737
I told you I'll try.

99
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:00,577
Then when will you try?

100
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:04,457
It's not something that can
be done quickly.

101
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,217
Give me an estimate.

102
00:07:06,297 --> 00:07:07,617
-Around--
-How would I know?

103
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:16,777
One day, it will happen.

104
00:07:26,857 --> 00:07:30,017
As of now, even though Xiaozi's
the one initiating it,

105
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:34,057
but she and Si would meet
two or three times a week.

106
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:37,817
It seems Si is a bit enlightened.

107
00:07:38,777 --> 00:07:39,857
What about Shancai?

108
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:41,857
Does she still bother Si?

109
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:44,297
The situation is,

110
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:48,457
aside from school, Si and Shancai
don't have much contact.

111
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:51,617
Though, Xiaozi often talks to Shancai.

112
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:55,777
You mean Xiaozi initiates it?

113
00:07:58,657 --> 00:08:00,097
What are they up to?

114
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:04,817
Xiaozi seems quite naive.

115
00:08:05,057 --> 00:08:07,777
It seems she'll tell Shancai details
about her relationship

116
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:09,617
with Si.

117
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,897
This girl Shancai
has too many tricks up her sleeve.

118
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,617
I think she hasn't given up on Si yet.

119
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:25,017
This is quite good too.

120
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,137
Try it.

121
00:08:30,057 --> 00:08:30,977
Open the door.

122
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:37,257
Shancai.

123
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:39,217
Xiaozi?

124
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,097
Why are you here?

125
00:08:41,177 --> 00:08:42,617
What's up?

126
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:44,457
Who is it?

127
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:46,697
It smells so good. Are you having dinner?

128
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:51,217
Hi, good evening.

129
00:08:53,497 --> 00:08:54,657
Shancai, is she your friend?

130
00:08:54,857 --> 00:08:56,257
Come, have a seat and eat with us.

131
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:57,177
Can I?

132
00:08:57,257 --> 00:08:58,937
-Sure.
-Sit down. I'll get you a bowl.

133
00:08:59,537 --> 00:09:00,457
Thank you, Mrs. Dong.

134
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:03,177
This is great.

135
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:04,697
I haven't had dinner here before.

136
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:05,937
Here.

137
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:09,337
These are just simple dishes.

138
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:11,497
Can I try them?

139
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:13,497
Of course.

140
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,377
These are delicious.

141
00:09:15,457 --> 00:09:16,497
Come on. Try it.

142
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:18,057
-Thank you, Mr. Dong.
-You're welcome.

143
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:22,537
-It's delicious.
-Really?

144
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:24,417
Then have some more. Try the others.

145
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:26,577
-Here.
-Okay, thanks.

146
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:29,777
Shancai, why are you standing there?

147
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:31,177
Come here.

148
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,657
Okay.

149
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:34,097
I'll try this one.

150
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:37,737
Have some more.

151
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:38,977
Get some more of this.

152
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:42,897
Mrs. Dong, you cook so well.

153
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:46,937
You know,

154
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:50,417
I woke up so early in the morning
to do my makeup and get dressed.

155
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:54,017
I even took out all my clothes
from my closet.

156
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:55,417
That's right.

157
00:09:55,657 --> 00:09:57,257
I also used a new lipstick color.

158
00:09:57,577 --> 00:09:59,937
I think he never even looked
at my lipstick.

159
00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:02,457
I'm not sure if he noticed it.

160
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:03,497
Shancai.

161
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:05,617
Are you listening?

162
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:07,697
Yes.

163
00:10:09,137 --> 00:10:12,417
By the way,
I took him to the park for a walk today.

164
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:16,177
That park is so romantic, you know?

165
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:20,297
I think men should make a move
at those moments.

166
00:10:20,857 --> 00:10:21,897
But,

167
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:25,017
you know, he didn't even kiss me.

168
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:29,697
Aside from that,
we just sat there silently.

169
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,497
We're not like lovers at all, right?

170
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:37,457
<i>Do I really need to hear her rants?</i>

171
00:10:45,297 --> 00:10:46,417
Shancai.

172
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:50,337
Have you and Daoming Si ever kissed?

173
00:10:53,457 --> 00:10:54,537
You have.

174
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:56,417
You have, right?

175
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:57,937
Tell me honestly.

176
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:02,417
I...

177
00:11:05,377 --> 00:11:06,337
Tell me.

178
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:08,137
Does he still like you?

179
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:10,617
Don't think like that.

180
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:11,657
It's not like that.

181
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:15,057
Sorry, Shancai.

182
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:17,937
Maybe I'm too impatient.

183
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:21,417
And I've been so sheltered
since I was little.

184
00:11:22,177 --> 00:11:24,057
I've never experienced these things.

185
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:25,297
I don't know how to handle it.

186
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:30,217
I just think that this love is so painful.

187
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:33,817
I'm not sure if Daoming Si likes me.

188
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:42,937
Si's fiancée rants to you every night?

189
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:47,177
She must have ulterior motives.

190
00:11:47,897 --> 00:11:48,857
No.

191
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:51,017
I think she's really worried.

192
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,617
Huaze Lei, talk to Daoming Si.

193
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:59,297
Tell him to treat Xiaozi better
or else she'd rant to me every day.

194
00:12:02,777 --> 00:12:04,177
Do you think he'll listen to me?

195
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:06,457
We shouldn't interfere.

196
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:09,537
It's either they get along or they don't.

197
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,097
We can't do anything about it.

198
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:13,297
That's true.

199
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:14,937
-But--
-Stop it.

200
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:18,017
Si can handle his own problems.

201
00:12:19,017 --> 00:12:21,457
I don't intend to know
what happens between them.

202
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:24,497
But Xiaozi tells me about her
and Daoming Si daily.

203
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:25,697
I don't want to know.

204
00:12:26,257 --> 00:12:27,097
Shancai.

205
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,617
Aren't you the last person
who should be involved in this?

206
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:32,857
In the same way,

207
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:36,177
I also shouldn't suggest
or encourage Si to be nicer to Xiaozi.

208
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,177
If I did that,

209
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,137
people would think I have
ulterior motives.

210
00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:43,377
Do you understand that?

211
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:47,657
-Huaze Lei--
-Let's go to class.

212
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:50,577
Si.

213
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:53,497
What?

214
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:57,817
Didn't I tell you not to come here?

215
00:12:57,897 --> 00:12:59,977
I'm really going to be mad
if you're so unreasonable.

216
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:04,377
Why can't I come here?
I'm your girlfriend.

217
00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:06,857
Can't you be nicer to me?

218
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:09,617
She doesn't seem like Si's girlfriend.

219
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:12,257
I think they're having an argument.

220
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:13,937
Let's not stay here.

221
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:15,577
What do you want me to do?

222
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:17,497
I want you to kiss me.

223
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,297
Kiss me now.

224
00:13:21,857 --> 00:13:22,737
What?

225
00:13:23,857 --> 00:13:24,897
Do you still like Shancai?

226
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:28,457
You're always deep in thought
when you're with me.

227
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:30,617
I'm not sure what you're thinking about.

228
00:13:30,697 --> 00:13:33,057
But it's irresponsible
to let your girlfriend...

229
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:35,297
feel insecure.

230
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:46,097
I want proof.

231
00:13:46,737 --> 00:13:49,657
If you don't like Shancai, then kiss me.

232
00:13:57,697 --> 00:13:58,657
Close your eyes.

233
00:14:52,577 --> 00:14:54,537
Didn't you want Si to be nicer to Xiaozi?

234
00:14:54,617 --> 00:14:56,097
You don't need to be worried now.

235
00:14:58,937 --> 00:15:00,137
Why are you so quiet?

236
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:03,577
Do you feel upset?

237
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:07,097
Upset? Who's upset?

238
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:10,457
I think this is good.
That's what I hoped would happen.

239
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:12,977
I feel like I'm having

240
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:15,977
vacations for New Year, summer,
and winter all together.

241
00:15:16,337 --> 00:15:17,297
No.

242
00:15:17,577 --> 00:15:19,497
That's not enough to describe
my excitement.

243
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,257
I should say I'm as ecstatic

244
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:25,017
as when my mom sold a year's worth
of bento boxes in one day.

245
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:27,497
I'm so happy I'm crying.

246
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:30,857
-Really?
-Why?

247
00:15:31,937 --> 00:15:35,097
You blab nonstop whenever someone
guesses what you're thinking.

248
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:37,377
I don't.

249
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:40,577
Don't act like
you're a psychologist, okay?

250
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:44,657
It'd be great if you're that focused
in class.

251
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:45,937
Hey.

252
00:15:47,017 --> 00:15:47,897
Your bag.

253
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,617
<i>You kissed her when she asked you to.
What a happy ending.</i>

254
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:01,697
<i>All right. Great.</i>

255
00:16:01,937 --> 00:16:03,217
<i>Don't ever bother me again.</i>

256
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,097
<i>Just be with Xiaozi.</i>

257
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:07,297
<i>I wish you'd be together forever.</i>

258
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:27,377
Hey, Shancai.

259
00:16:28,457 --> 00:16:29,417
What's the matter?

260
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:31,217
Why is your face all wrinkled?

261
00:16:32,097 --> 00:16:33,017
Is it?

262
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:34,937
What happened?

263
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,537
I'm so stupid.

264
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:40,777
I believe anything anyone says.

265
00:16:41,257 --> 00:16:42,937
I'm too self-righteous.

266
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:44,897
I ended up being played.

267
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:47,337
How funny.

268
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:49,457
I'm really a fool.

269
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:51,177
How can you say that?

270
00:16:51,497 --> 00:16:53,257
That's because you believe
everyone is nice.

271
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:55,537
After what Li Zhen
and Shunping did to you,

272
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:56,937
you still forgave them.

273
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:58,617
You're that nice.

274
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:00,057
Is that so?

275
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,897
Of course. I like you...

276
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:05,537
because of that.

277
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:07,497
Really?

278
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:10,817
Yes. I like you because of that.

279
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:14,817
It's not too late as long as I find out

280
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:16,977
at the right time.

281
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:21,817
Hey.

282
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:23,257
Shancai.

283
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,217
I need to get back on my feet.

284
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:28,337
If I think about it,
I'm just going back to being alone.

285
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:30,897
Let bygones be bygones.

286
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:35,217
You're not alone.

287
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:36,297
You have me.

288
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:41,897
Qinghe.

289
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:45,817
Thank you.

290
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,377
Shancai...

291
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:50,017
It's a good thing you're by my side.

292
00:17:50,577 --> 00:17:52,177
You're like a brother to me.

293
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:54,137
I'll get going.

294
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:55,097
Bye.

295
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:57,177
Bye.

296
00:17:58,217 --> 00:17:59,777
What?

297
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:03,217
Why am I like her brother?

298
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:08,737
We heard it through the grapevine.

299
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:10,937
Fang added more yesterday too.

300
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,617
Yes, one hundred thousand yuan.

301
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:15,977
And I've decided to add more this time.

302
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:18,737
Absolutely.

303
00:18:19,577 --> 00:18:22,257
Members and employees
get the same information.

304
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:25,137
Trust me.

305
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:27,097
Okay.

306
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:30,857
It seems Dad's investment consulting
work is going smoothly.

307
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:32,297
I think so.

308
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,897
The investment return is big.

309
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:36,657
So your dad put all our savings into it.

310
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:41,097
-Does it really earn a lot?
-It's a sure win.

311
00:18:42,017 --> 00:18:44,297
Many members earned a lot

312
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:46,177
and asked me to re-invest
their money again.

313
00:18:46,737 --> 00:18:48,057
It's that good?

314
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:59,017
What are you doing?

315
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:06,417
How are things going between you
and Daoming Si?

316
00:19:07,577 --> 00:19:08,697
Nothing's going on.

317
00:19:09,137 --> 00:19:10,497
He already has a girlfriend.

318
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:13,697
He has a girlfriend? Who?

319
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:17,257
The one who always visits us, Xiaozi.

320
00:19:17,337 --> 00:19:18,497
Xiaozi?

321
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:21,737
Daoming Si is so strange.

322
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:23,897
He's dating a girl
that came out of nowhere.

323
00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:25,617
It's so infuriating.

324
00:19:26,017 --> 00:19:26,977
Mom.

325
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,257
She came from a well-known family.

326
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:31,537
I'm the one who came out of nowhere.

327
00:19:32,617 --> 00:19:34,097
That's not true.

328
00:19:34,777 --> 00:19:36,297
You came from us.

329
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:37,817
Just look at yourself.

330
00:19:38,497 --> 00:19:40,097
-That's right.
-Look at your sharp nose.

331
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:41,977
A straight nose and a wide mouth.

332
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:55,417
What a coincidence.

333
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:57,137
Can we have tea together?

334
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:03,177
Are you still mad?

335
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:06,937
No, I'm not mad anymore.

336
00:20:07,257 --> 00:20:08,417
But I'm warning you.

337
00:20:08,937 --> 00:20:10,577
Don't judge me again.

338
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:18,977
It's cold. You should wear
something warmer.

339
00:20:20,377 --> 00:20:21,657
Do you still have class later?

340
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:23,657
No. I'm done for the day.

341
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,257
This is for you.

342
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:40,697
What's the matter?

343
00:20:41,977 --> 00:20:42,937
Nothing.

344
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:46,257
I just feel that it's so cold outside.

345
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:50,017
But it's warmer to have coffee
with a friend.

346
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:54,697
It would be better
if we can soak in hot springs.

347
00:20:55,017 --> 00:20:56,257
Do you like hot springs?

348
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:58,137
You've never mentioned that before.

349
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:04,337
Shancai is over there.

350
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:12,497
Let's go.

351
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:13,577
Come on.

352
00:21:17,137 --> 00:21:19,537
Shancai, can we join you?

353
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:21,657
We're not interrupting your date, right?

354
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:23,377
No, we're not...

355
00:21:23,777 --> 00:21:25,017
This is Huaze Lei.

356
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:26,217
We just met coincidentally.

357
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:27,897
He's Huaze Lei?

358
00:21:28,617 --> 00:21:29,577
Come here.

359
00:21:31,697 --> 00:21:32,817
Hi.

360
00:21:32,897 --> 00:21:35,057
I'm Si's fiancée.

361
00:21:35,137 --> 00:21:36,577
My name is He Yuanzi.

362
00:21:36,657 --> 00:21:37,897
Just call me Xiaozi.

363
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:50,177
This feels so nice.

364
00:21:50,297 --> 00:21:52,537
It's like we're on a double date.

365
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:55,057
You're talking too much nonsense.

366
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,257
Why are you so angry?

367
00:21:58,257 --> 00:21:59,857
Sorry. He's just shy.

368
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:03,577
It's fine. We're used to it.

369
00:22:04,137 --> 00:22:06,857
Earlier, he said he's bored

370
00:22:06,937 --> 00:22:08,017
and wants to go home.

371
00:22:08,097 --> 00:22:09,577
I told him we can just go to a hotel.

372
00:22:10,257 --> 00:22:11,897
He ran away afterward.

373
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,657
I was just teasing him.

374
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:17,817
But we kissed already.

375
00:22:18,377 --> 00:22:19,657
We can go further now.

376
00:22:20,177 --> 00:22:21,097
Monkey.

377
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:23,177
Stop your nonsense.

378
00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:24,977
What's the problem?

379
00:22:25,537 --> 00:22:27,337
She likes you so much.

380
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:28,577
You should be glad.

381
00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:31,257
That's right.

382
00:22:31,337 --> 00:22:32,777
Shancai thinks so too.

383
00:22:35,257 --> 00:22:38,817
By the way, we have a nice resort hotel
in the mountains.

384
00:22:38,897 --> 00:22:40,177
You don't have class tomorrow.

385
00:22:40,257 --> 00:22:41,257
Do you want to go there?

386
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:44,857
No thanks.

387
00:22:45,057 --> 00:22:46,457
You two can go alone.

388
00:22:47,057 --> 00:22:49,377
Huaze Lei, we shouldn't be
third-wheeling here.

389
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,657
-Do you have hot springs?
-Yes.

390
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:54,657
Our hot springs are the best.

391
00:22:54,737 --> 00:22:56,017
I'm going then.

392
00:22:56,257 --> 00:22:57,977
All right. It's set then.

393
00:22:58,217 --> 00:22:59,457
Let's go now.

394
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:15,817
Ma'am.

395
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:17,377
Any new developments?

396
00:23:18,817 --> 00:23:22,777
Si and Xiaozi will go to the He Group's
Hot Springs Hotel tonight.

397
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:25,217
Xiaozi is so smart.

398
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:26,617
She's a fast learner.

399
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:28,857
But Huaze Lei and Shancai went with them.

400
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:31,177
How did that happen?

401
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,417
They met at a coffee shop.

402
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,257
Then went to the hot springs
hotel together.

403
00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:38,417
Shancai always lingers around them.

404
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:39,697
What is she planning to do?

405
00:23:40,857 --> 00:23:44,017
You said Shancai was with Huaze Lei.

406
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:46,137
Then they all went to the hotel, right?

407
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:47,377
Yes.

408
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:49,857
Maybe she thinks

409
00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:54,457
that there's no more hope with Si
so she's now working on Huaze Lei.

410
00:23:55,377 --> 00:23:58,817
She might give up when she sees how good

411
00:23:59,937 --> 00:24:01,817
Si and Xiaozi are doing.

412
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:20,337
Why aren't you eating?

413
00:24:20,737 --> 00:24:22,217
This restaurant is really good.

414
00:24:24,857 --> 00:24:25,737
Look.

415
00:24:25,937 --> 00:24:29,257
I think you two really look good together.

416
00:24:35,217 --> 00:24:37,497
Si, why are you drinking so much?

417
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:39,697
Lei.

418
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:42,297
Say something.

419
00:24:42,817 --> 00:24:44,737
-What should I say?
-Anything you want.

420
00:24:46,657 --> 00:24:48,097
Can I soak in the hot springs?

421
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,657
Of course.

422
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:51,537
Turn right to go to the pool for men.

423
00:24:59,657 --> 00:25:01,537
Shancai, do you want to go too?

424
00:25:01,897 --> 00:25:03,457
They have a lover's pool here.

425
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:08,737
There's no need.

426
00:25:11,817 --> 00:25:14,897
By the way, the guy you mentioned

427
00:25:15,177 --> 00:25:18,897
that's quiet and looks dull

428
00:25:19,377 --> 00:25:20,697
is him, right?

429
00:25:24,737 --> 00:25:25,777
Yes.

430
00:25:26,697 --> 00:25:28,377
She likes him a lot.

431
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:31,457
I guessed right.

432
00:25:37,377 --> 00:25:38,297
Si.

433
00:25:38,697 --> 00:25:40,057
Let's soak in the hot springs too.

434
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:41,457
I'm not going.

435
00:25:44,457 --> 00:25:45,577
Never mind.

436
00:25:45,657 --> 00:25:46,777
I'll go with Shancai.

437
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:48,337
Let's go.

438
00:26:06,337 --> 00:26:07,457
It feels so nice.

439
00:26:15,937 --> 00:26:16,937
Shancai.

440
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:18,897
What's the matter?

441
00:26:21,777 --> 00:26:22,697
Nothing.

442
00:26:22,897 --> 00:26:24,097
I was just thinking

443
00:26:24,857 --> 00:26:26,497
that your hot spring is great.

444
00:26:27,097 --> 00:26:27,977
Thank you.

445
00:26:28,977 --> 00:26:32,537
I think we're living our dreams now.

446
00:26:33,097 --> 00:26:37,817
Going to a sauna with a close friend,
having a meal and chatting together.

447
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:40,617
I'm so happy now.

448
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:45,697
I haven't done this for a while either.

449
00:26:47,297 --> 00:26:48,257
Shancai.

450
00:26:49,177 --> 00:26:51,097
It's so good to know you.

451
00:26:53,657 --> 00:26:57,497
By the way, you have to be
a bridesmaid at our wedding.

452
00:27:00,777 --> 00:27:02,137
Me?

453
00:27:04,097 --> 00:27:05,097
There's no need.

454
00:27:05,297 --> 00:27:06,457
Just enjoy yourselves.

455
00:27:07,097 --> 00:27:08,097
Why not?

456
00:27:08,177 --> 00:27:09,577
No. You have to be the bridesmaid.

457
00:27:11,937 --> 00:27:12,977
You know,

458
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:15,617
when I'm with Si,

459
00:27:16,697 --> 00:27:18,257
I tell myself

460
00:27:18,897 --> 00:27:21,577
that I can't expect him to be
an ordinary boyfriend.

461
00:27:22,737 --> 00:27:25,417
Or else, I'd be so disappointed.

462
00:27:26,537 --> 00:27:28,497
But he's actually quite nice sometimes.

463
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:31,737
He'd be with me if I ask him to.

464
00:27:35,177 --> 00:27:36,217
Shancai.

465
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:38,377
I know I'm annoying.

466
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:40,657
If you want to run away,

467
00:27:40,737 --> 00:27:42,217
I'll chase after you.

468
00:27:43,177 --> 00:27:44,617
If you run to Mars,

469
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:46,537
I'll go there too.

470
00:27:52,497 --> 00:27:53,977
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

471
00:27:54,537 --> 00:27:55,617
<i>I feel so heavy.</i>

472
00:27:56,297 --> 00:27:58,497
<i>I thought I could really
find closure this time</i>

473
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:00,697
<i>and run away from Daoming Si.</i>

474
00:28:01,697 --> 00:28:05,777
<i>But why does it feel
like I'm getting more involved?</i>

475
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,817
Shancai.

476
00:28:14,297 --> 00:28:15,537
Shancai, what's the matter?

477
00:28:24,777 --> 00:28:25,617
Shancai.

478
00:28:25,697 --> 00:28:27,177
Shancai fainted in the sauna.

479
00:29:22,017 --> 00:29:23,017
I feel so miserable.

480
00:29:29,257 --> 00:29:30,417
So miserable.

481
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:33,937
Drink some water.

482
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:37,857
I have a bad headache.
What happened to me?

483
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:40,097
You fainted in the sauna.

484
00:29:40,817 --> 00:29:42,897
Get some rest. You'll be fine.

485
00:29:48,897 --> 00:29:50,377
You were the one who brought me here?

486
00:29:53,817 --> 00:29:55,297
You saw everything?

487
00:29:55,497 --> 00:29:56,937
I helped you get dressed, didn't I?

488
00:29:57,857 --> 00:29:59,017
You helped me get dressed...

489
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:02,017
Then you saw everything
while helping me...

490
00:30:04,457 --> 00:30:06,217
What else can I do?

491
00:30:07,577 --> 00:30:09,337
Can't you ask a girl to help me?

492
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:10,417
Where's Xiaozi?

493
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:12,977
-I want to talk to her.
-Never mind.

494
00:30:14,537 --> 00:30:16,177
Don't interrupt them.

495
00:30:20,297 --> 00:30:21,417
You're right.

496
00:30:23,937 --> 00:30:25,457
You can stop them if you want.

497
00:30:26,177 --> 00:30:28,137
I can help you break down the door.

498
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:29,897
Why should I stop them?

499
00:30:31,137 --> 00:30:34,537
Because you look like you're going
to cry all the time.

500
00:30:51,737 --> 00:30:53,297
Why did you agree to come here?

501
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:56,577
You made things so complicated.

502
00:30:59,177 --> 00:31:00,817
Why should we be here?

503
00:31:05,737 --> 00:31:07,457
Since we already saw them,

504
00:31:08,257 --> 00:31:09,937
should we just pretend we didn't?

505
00:31:16,937 --> 00:31:17,817
Si.

506
00:31:25,577 --> 00:31:27,417
Si, did you hear me?

507
00:31:28,497 --> 00:31:29,857
What is it? You're no noisy.

508
00:31:39,617 --> 00:31:42,977
My mom told me to move
to your house next semester.

509
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:46,057
We can get to know
each other better this way.

510
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,297
It's fine if you want to get
your Master's degree

511
00:32:02,377 --> 00:32:03,337
before we get married.

512
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:07,497
You're just going to follow
your parents' plan?

513
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:10,777
Don't you feel such a life
would be so boring?

514
00:32:16,337 --> 00:32:17,897
What do you mean?

515
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,177
Haven't you already decided to like me?

516
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:29,617
All right.

517
00:32:30,057 --> 00:32:32,257
I won't ask if you don't want to tell me.

518
00:32:34,897 --> 00:32:35,937
But now...

519
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:52,697
Thank you, Lei.

520
00:32:55,297 --> 00:32:56,337
For what?

521
00:32:57,497 --> 00:33:01,057
Thanks for saving me in the sauna today.

522
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:05,977
I just finished soaking
in the hot springs.

523
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,377
Xiaozi screamed saying that you fainted.

524
00:33:09,777 --> 00:33:11,137
What an impatient person.

525
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:13,977
And very intense.

526
00:33:15,217 --> 00:33:18,457
In some ways,
she's very similar to Daoming Si.

527
00:33:19,177 --> 00:33:21,817
If you think about it,
they're not that similar.

528
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:25,537
No one can beat Si's personality.

529
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:27,297
You're right.

530
00:33:29,977 --> 00:33:31,057
You finally smiled.

531
00:33:35,537 --> 00:33:36,977
What do you mean, "finally"?

532
00:33:38,097 --> 00:33:40,457
You were frowning the whole day.

533
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:46,297
I've been this way since my first day
in Mingde University.

534
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:48,137
Not just today.

535
00:33:52,137 --> 00:33:53,337
Is your fighting spirit back?

536
00:33:53,737 --> 00:33:54,617
That's good.

537
00:33:54,697 --> 00:33:56,057
That's the Shancai I know.

538
00:33:57,057 --> 00:33:58,697
You were so sad earlier.

539
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:00,777
Stop it.

540
00:34:01,897 --> 00:34:02,817
Hit me.

541
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:06,497
Take it out on me
if that would make you happy.

542
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:10,977
Who says I'm not happy?

543
00:34:13,657 --> 00:34:14,617
Don't deny it.

544
00:34:21,577 --> 00:34:23,097
<i>Just like on the rooftop before,</i>

545
00:34:23,777 --> 00:34:28,297
<i>Huaze Lei can always calm me down
when I'm most tired and confused.</i>

546
00:34:44,337 --> 00:34:45,177
Daoming Si.

547
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,217
I'm telling you.

548
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,257
Even though I tease you a lot,

549
00:34:50,817 --> 00:34:53,817
I'm serious about this.

550
00:34:56,217 --> 00:34:59,137
Don't you feel anything?

551
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:00,577
No.

552
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,137
Is that so?

553
00:35:08,457 --> 00:35:09,417
Or do you want me

554
00:35:10,217 --> 00:35:12,097
-to wear see-through stuff?
-Xiaozi.

555
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:15,017
I know! You must not like bathrobes.

556
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:17,137
-Do you like other styles?
-Listen to me.

557
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:19,457
-I'm not listening!
-Shancai is all I think about.

558
00:35:19,537 --> 00:35:22,257
I told you that I'd try to like you.

559
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:23,737
But I'm really sorry.

560
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:26,057
-I'm not listening!
-I can't be with you!

561
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,537
What's that sound?

562
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:31,857
I think it's from Si's room.

563
00:35:34,177 --> 00:35:37,377
You think Daoming Si
is forcing himself on her?

564
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,337
I think it's the opposite.

565
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:44,617
I still want to take a look to be sure.

566
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:50,297
Xiaozi.

567
00:36:03,937 --> 00:36:05,057
Sorry to disturb you.

568
00:36:35,697 --> 00:36:37,497
You saw something you shouldn't have?

569
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:57,857
Do whatever you want.

570
00:36:59,257 --> 00:37:00,817
Beat me up until you're satisfied.

571
00:37:07,457 --> 00:37:08,497
Do you know

572
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:13,937
how much I want to really beat you up?

573
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:18,577
I want to beat you up until you remember
the pain every time you think of me.

574
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:22,657
Until you can't ever forget me.

575
00:37:26,937 --> 00:37:28,217
But Daoming Si,

576
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:32,897
I couldn't bear to hit you.

577
00:37:42,657 --> 00:37:45,177
I don't feel like myself anymore,
you know?

578
00:38:05,337 --> 00:38:06,337
I'm really sorry.

579
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:38,057
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

580
00:38:38,377 --> 00:38:39,977
<i>I was awake the whole night.</i>

581
00:38:41,097 --> 00:38:43,257
<i>I had the worst timing.</i>

582
00:38:43,777 --> 00:38:45,737
<i>I shouldn't have seen that.</i>

583
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,137
<i>I didn't want to interfere with them.</i>

584
00:38:50,057 --> 00:38:51,457
<i>I feel so miserable.</i>

585
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:05,337
Good morning.

586
00:39:10,497 --> 00:39:11,377
Good morning.

587
00:39:15,297 --> 00:39:17,897
<i>I'm becoming more and more clumsy
in front of Daoming Si.</i>

588
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:20,897
<i>Our boisterous fighting days are gone.</i>

589
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:23,057
<i>It might be</i>

590
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:26,897
<i>because our relationship has changed.</i>

591
00:39:27,777 --> 00:39:30,457
<i>I don't feel awkward with Huaze Lei now.</i>

592
00:39:31,017 --> 00:39:32,657
<i>But if it's Daoming Si,</i>

593
00:39:33,697 --> 00:39:36,657
<i>I wouldn't be able to sleep
while holding hands with him.</i>

594
00:39:38,217 --> 00:39:39,417
What's the matter?

595
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:41,457
I'm going home.

596
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:42,857
Tell Lei.

597
00:40:15,857 --> 00:40:16,897
Xiaozi.

598
00:40:34,537 --> 00:40:35,777
I should get going.

599
00:40:40,497 --> 00:40:41,417
Is that so?

600
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:44,137
I want to stay here longer.

601
00:40:45,657 --> 00:40:47,137
I'll ask the driver to take you back.

602
00:40:48,137 --> 00:40:49,257
There's no need. Thanks.

603
00:40:50,497 --> 00:40:52,057
I met Daoming Si earlier.

604
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,217
He said he was going home.

605
00:40:58,817 --> 00:41:00,497
Oh, yes.

606
00:41:01,657 --> 00:41:03,337
Maybe he's feeling shy.

607
00:41:04,137 --> 00:41:05,097
Since...

608
00:41:06,017 --> 00:41:07,417
Last night, we...

609
00:41:08,497 --> 00:41:09,897
He might be feeling shy.

610
00:41:12,057 --> 00:41:12,977
I'll get going then.

611
00:41:13,497 --> 00:41:14,377
Thank you.

612
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,657
Don't you feel anything?

613
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:26,057
No.

614
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:32,657
Is that so?

615
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:35,177
Or do you want me

616
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:37,737
-to wear see-through stuff?
-Xiaozi.

617
00:41:37,817 --> 00:41:39,137
-I shouldn't be so direct.
-Listen to me.

618
00:41:39,217 --> 00:41:41,457
-I'm not listening!
-Shancai is all I think about.

619
00:41:41,537 --> 00:41:44,257
I told you that I'd try to like you.

620
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:45,737
But I'm really sorry.

621
00:41:45,817 --> 00:41:48,137
-I'm not listening!
-I can't be with you!
