EPISODE 34

4
00:01:31,248 --> 00:01:32,928
<i>I shouldn't keep it from Daoming Si.</i>

5
00:01:33,488 --> 00:01:35,688
<i>I should tell him.</i>

6
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:40,128
Daoming Si.

7
00:01:42,128 --> 00:01:44,768
-There's something I want to tell you.
-Wait.

8
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:46,928
I don't want to hear it.

9
00:01:47,288 --> 00:01:50,328
Every time you talk to me seriously,
it's never good.

10
00:01:51,408 --> 00:01:53,208
It's very important.

11
00:01:54,088 --> 00:01:55,768
-It's--
-I don't care. I'm not listening.

12
00:01:55,888 --> 00:01:57,008
-No. I'm not listening.
-Hey.

13
00:01:57,088 --> 00:01:57,928
I'm not listening.

14
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:01,208
You graduated kindergarten 20 years ago.
Why are you acting like a three-year-old?

15
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:02,968
And you're acting like an old lady.

16
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:06,648
We're alone here.
But you just keep frowning.

17
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,208
There you go again.

18
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,448
Always making me nervous with those words.

19
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:12,888
Who?

20
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:16,408
There's only the two of us here.

21
00:02:26,088 --> 00:02:26,968
Hey.

22
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:31,848
How did you become a good kisser?

23
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,488
Didn't you say
you haven't dated anyone before?

24
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:44,488
All right.

25
00:02:45,968 --> 00:02:47,008
Let me be honest with you.

26
00:02:47,888 --> 00:02:48,968
Back then,

27
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:51,808
I used to go out partying with Ximen.

28
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:54,728
But it was a long time ago.

29
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:59,888
Going out with Ximen and Meizuo
always involves lots of girls.

30
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,968
Those girls made a move on me.

31
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:04,488
I didn't mind.

32
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:07,648
Of course.

33
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:11,608
Those were the things I did in the past.

34
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:13,688
I've stopped doing them now.

35
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:17,928
Really?

36
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:20,088
What's wrong?

37
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,008
That was a long time ago.

38
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,288
Are you jealous?

39
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:33,328
Don't be so full of yourself.

40
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:35,688
I don't care how many girls
you've flirted with.

41
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:37,488
You're jealous.

42
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:40,008
-Yes!
-I told you I'm not.

43
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:44,808
It's good to be jealous.
What's wrong with that? Go ahead.

44
00:03:45,928 --> 00:03:46,808
You're so childish.

45
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,608
You don't know what happened today.

46
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:56,008
I was followed by your bodyguards.

47
00:03:57,688 --> 00:03:58,888
I was forced to hide,

48
00:03:59,528 --> 00:04:00,848
and I couldn't go home.

49
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:04,248
Good thing Meizuo helped me.

50
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:07,128
I was terrified.

51
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:09,608
You wouldn't even listen to me.

52
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:12,728
-My bodyguards?
-Yes.

53
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:15,968
-Why didn't you immediately tell me?
-What's the point of telling you?

54
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:18,608
This is something we should face together.

55
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,448
Who would you tell if not me?

56
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,288
It would only complicate things
if I told you.

57
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:27,168
Your mom would find out even earlier.

58
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,528
Even Meizuo felt that you'd make it worse.

59
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:36,928
I didn't want to tell you.

60
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:38,888
But I don't want to keep it from you.

61
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:46,368
That's why I don't want to date in secret.

62
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:51,968
Because I'm not aware of the decisions
you make without me.

63
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:00,648
Hello?

64
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:01,688
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

65
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:04,528
<i>Your bodyguards are looking for you.
I let them in.</i>

66
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:06,608
Why did you turn off--

67
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:21,728
Nobody knows me better than my mom.
So I'm the only one who can protect you.

68
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:26,208
-But--
-Stop hesitating. Go to London with me.

69
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,288
How can we go to London now?

70
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:32,648
Maybe Qinghe and Xiaoyou's families
are already in trouble

71
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:34,248
before I could even leave.

72
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:36,928
I can't just leave them and run away.

73
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:43,008
This is the only door that's locked.
He should be in there.

74
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:44,688
What should we do?

75
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:48,288
We'll be exposed.
They'll get in here soon.

76
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:51,368
Are there any other exits?

77
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:54,208
If I'm not mistaken,
there's a window in the bathroom.

78
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,288
Let's go.

79
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:09,088
Hurry up!

80
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:16,928
Move faster.

81
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,648
The president said we're inefficient.
We can't even find Si.

82
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:22,248
Break down the door.

83
00:06:31,688 --> 00:06:33,048
May I ask what you're doing?

84
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:36,608
Washing my hair.

85
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:38,448
Can't you see?

86
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:40,528
But why are you wearing your clothes?

87
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,328
I do it my way.

88
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:45,368
Do I need to explain to you
how I wash my hair?

89
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:49,328
You bunch of idiots.

90
00:06:49,568 --> 00:06:51,168
How dare you interfere with my plans.

91
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:53,048
If this happens again,

92
00:06:53,128 --> 00:06:55,208
I'll beat you up until you cry
to your mothers!

93
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:36,448
What happened?

94
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:40,328
Why are you so pissed?

95
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:42,608
Who made you angry?

96
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:46,488
She always treats her son like a criminal.

97
00:07:46,568 --> 00:07:48,968
And I had to force Shancai
to run away without her shoes.

98
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:56,568
Were you doing naughty things?

99
00:07:57,688 --> 00:07:58,648
Of course not.

100
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:00,368
What are you thinking, old woman?

101
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:03,328
As if my mom is not bad enough,
now you sound just like her.

102
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:18,688
My mom asked them to follow me.

103
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:20,768
They're on to Shancai too.

104
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:23,608
We almost got caught.

105
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:25,888
It seems

106
00:08:26,648 --> 00:08:28,408
your mom is getting anxious.

107
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,968
She did the same things to Zhuang before.

108
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:37,808
I know.

109
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:40,048
But Mrs. Yu,

110
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:44,448
what happened to my sister's boyfriend?

111
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:53,208
He couldn't take your mom's threats
and ran away.

112
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,328
After that happened,

113
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:01,208
your mom locked Zhuang inside the house.

114
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:03,288
She refused to eat.

115
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:08,728
So I secretly let her go.

116
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:12,528
I hoped she could be happy from then on.

117
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,568
<i>I never thought...</i>

118
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:43,648
ONE MESSAGE RECEIVED

119
00:09:43,728 --> 00:09:46,128
<i>Sorry. I won't see you again.</i>

120
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:47,568
<i>Let's break up.</i>

121
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:55,528
<i>That person wasn't
where they agreed to meet up.</i>

122
00:09:57,688 --> 00:09:59,328
<i>Instead, he contacted your mom</i>

123
00:10:00,328 --> 00:10:02,328
<i>to take Zhuang home.</i>

124
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:04,848
Ms. Zhuang, let's go home.

125
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:12,472
Where's that scum right now?

126
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:14,072
What a useless coward.

127
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:15,592
He doesn't deserve her!

128
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,592
What worries me the most

129
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:24,312
was that Zhuang acted normal
during the day,

130
00:10:25,072 --> 00:10:27,592
but always cried herself to sleep.

131
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:31,392
She faked her smiles

132
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:33,472
and prepared for a wedding
that she didn't wish for.

133
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:37,512
She got married soon afterward.

134
00:10:40,872 --> 00:10:42,192
And you already know

135
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,112
what happened next.

136
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:51,352
Yes.

137
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,152
Who could take

138
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:56,152
my mom's methods?

139
00:10:57,712 --> 00:11:00,512
Good thing it's all over now.

140
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:05,272
Don't you think Zhuang is doing well now?

141
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,712
Is she?

142
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:15,032
Is it good to feel helpless?

143
00:11:16,912 --> 00:11:17,992
Is it good to be

144
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:20,112
at the mercy of others?

145
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:25,992
If that's the definition of good,
isn't that really sad?

146
00:11:31,752 --> 00:11:34,632
At that time, my sister
lost the reason to hold on.

147
00:11:35,432 --> 00:11:37,112
She was betrayed by the man she loved.

148
00:11:40,272 --> 00:11:41,112
Si.

149
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:43,232
Your sister

150
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:45,672
doesn't blame that person.

151
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:50,232
So if someday

152
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:55,072
Shancai gives up on me too,

153
00:11:57,472 --> 00:11:58,792
should I also just accept it?

154
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:03,232
There were many times

155
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:06,432
when I thought I'd really lose her.

156
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:12,952
What are you doing?

157
00:12:13,752 --> 00:12:15,032
How irresponsible.

158
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:17,512
If Shancai leaves you,

159
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:19,672
it's definitely not because of your mom.

160
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:23,672
It's because you gave up so easily.

161
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:24,712
Stop talking nonsense.

162
00:12:25,152 --> 00:12:27,752
Facing so much restriction and misery
is not easy, you know?

163
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:30,472
Then you should hold on even more.

164
00:12:30,552 --> 00:12:31,832
I did.

165
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:37,992
But...

166
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:40,912
what if I'm the only one holding on?

167
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:44,552
No matter how much I care for her

168
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:46,752
and love her,

169
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:49,392
does she feel the same?

170
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:52,952
What if Shancai...

171
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,472
What if Shancai gives up on me?

172
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:04,072
Are you scared?

173
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:10,072
But this time,

174
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:12,432
I was really worried that you were scared.

175
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:24,672
Shancai's not confident

176
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:27,392
because you're not confident.

177
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:32,912
Shancai's not at peace because she feels
that you're not at peace.

178
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:38,072
People's feelings

179
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,832
influence each other.

180
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,072
Nobody knows

181
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:48,992
what would happen in the future.

182
00:13:50,752 --> 00:13:52,432
But the harder it gets,

183
00:13:53,512 --> 00:13:55,952
the more you should support Shancai.

184
00:13:58,232 --> 00:14:00,912
As long as your hearts
are closely connected,

185
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:05,032
you'd surely be able
to overcome this together.

186
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:10,312
I hope the both of you

187
00:14:12,432 --> 00:14:13,992
can be happy.

188
00:15:02,592 --> 00:15:03,592

00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:16,352
YES

191
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:26,832
<i>Did you get hurt?</i>

192
00:15:27,032 --> 00:15:29,392
<i>Use voice message.
I want to hear your voice.</i>

193
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:39,112
I'm not hurt.

194
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:41,032
I'm fine.

195
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:42,352
How about you?

196
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:46,472
Daoming Si.

197
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:48,792
Sorry.

198
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:51,512
I should've told you earlier.

199
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:33,992
If you don't reply, I'll come see you now.

200
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,512
<i>If you don't reply, I'll come see you now.</i>

201
00:16:54,592 --> 00:16:56,472
<i>I'm home. I didn't get hurt.</i>

202
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:04,352
<i>What are you doing?</i>

203
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:21,832
<i>I took care of what happened today.</i>

204
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:23,832
<i>Don't think about it anymore.</i>

205
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:33,552
Is my shoe with you?

206
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:40,272
<i>Yes.</i>

207
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:45,672
Then remember to bring it tomorrow.

208
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:48,472
And...

209
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:50,872
<i>Thank you.</i>

211
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:40,672
-Shancai.
-Yes?

212
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,352
I really can't do it without you.

213
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,752
I'm Wonder Woman. I'm strong.

214
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:02,792
Shancai.

215
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:04,392
Sorry.

216
00:19:06,832 --> 00:19:08,112
I almost forgot.

217
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:11,272
You, Ximen and Meizuo
planned to trick me yesterday.

218
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:12,792
It was all my fault.

219
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:15,232
I didn't know you'd care about me
so much that...

220
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:16,832
Sorry.

221
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:19,992
It's all right.

222
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:23,112
That's just how they are.

223
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:26,032
I couldn't say no to Ximen.

224
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:27,832
I told you it's all right.

225
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:29,112
Don't worry about it.

226
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:35,232
What's the matter?

227
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:41,472
Did something happen with Ximen yesterday?

228
00:19:42,392 --> 00:19:43,792
What did he do to you?

229
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:47,232
Nothing. We just had some coffee.

230
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:49,992
-Just coffee?
-Yes.

231
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:52,072
All right.

232
00:19:52,912 --> 00:19:55,832
But stay away from Ximen.
Don't let your guard down.

233
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:58,032
Why? I don't want to.

234
00:19:58,592 --> 00:20:01,832
I want to get closer to him
and understand him better.

235
00:20:04,632 --> 00:20:05,472
Wait.

236
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:07,952
Wait, Xiaoyou. Are you serious?

237
00:20:08,512 --> 00:20:09,952
You really like Ximen?

238
00:20:10,032 --> 00:20:13,112
He's a dangerous, frivolous,
and flirtatious guy.

239
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:14,312
Don't say that about him.

240
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:16,072
Sorry.

241
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:19,112
But are you serious?

242
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:21,352
Yes.

243
00:20:22,832 --> 00:20:25,712
I never thought I'd have feelings for him.

244
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:28,592
But what can I do?

245
00:20:28,712 --> 00:20:31,872
I feel like I'm liking him more and more.

246
00:20:33,112 --> 00:20:35,112
<i>I'm so shocked.</i>

247
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:37,792
<i>This is the first time
I'm seeing Xiaoyou with that expression.</i>

248
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:40,832
<i>While I'm busy worrying about my problems,</i>

249
00:20:40,912 --> 00:20:43,032
<i>my best friend has fallen
for other F4 members.</i>

250
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:45,072
<i>I didn't even notice it.</i>

251
00:20:47,472 --> 00:20:48,472
Xiaoyou.

252
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:51,632
I'm happy that you like someone.

253
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:54,112
But it's Ximen.

254
00:20:54,512 --> 00:20:55,792
You'll get hurt because of him.

255
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:59,152
I see him with different girls
every single day.

256
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:01,312
He's a playboy, you know?

257
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:03,752
-I know.
-You know...

258
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:05,632
You know, yet...

259
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:07,432
I'm not his type.

260
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:11,952
But I just happen to like him
and I can't even explain it.

261
00:21:13,712 --> 00:21:15,152
I know I'll get hurt,

262
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,232
but I like being around him.

<i>Hello?</i>

-Well...
<i>-What?</i>

00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:11,712
I...

272
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:17,632
Did you bring my shoe?

273
00:22:17,912 --> 00:22:18,752
<i>I did.</i>

274
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,152
Okay. Thank you.

275
00:22:25,992 --> 00:22:27,992
-That's it. Bye.
<i>-Hold on.</i>

276
00:22:28,832 --> 00:22:30,272
<i>How do I give it to you?</i>

277
00:22:30,952 --> 00:22:33,432
Right. How would you give it to me?

278
00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:35,072
Look on your right side.

279
00:22:36,712 --> 00:22:37,992
<i>Right side, stupid girl!</i>

280
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:50,832
The next time you call me,
can you not dance first?

281
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,032
Because you look so funny.

282
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:57,232
Why are you here?

283
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:00,792
To return your shoe.

284
00:23:02,992 --> 00:23:05,352
That's just an excuse.
Actually, I want to see you.

285
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:12,392
<i>I can't stop Xiaoyou.</i>

286
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:15,112
<i>Because I know better than anyone</i>

287
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,912
<i>that you can't control your feelings.</i>

288
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:20,952
<i>This is the power of love.</i>

289
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:27,632
Thank you.

290
00:23:28,312 --> 00:23:30,712
Hey, can you put your phone down now?

291
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:40,432
So you're off work already?

292
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:42,512
Yes. Xiaoyou just left.

293
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:44,272
Wait.

294
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:47,512
What if they found you here?

295
00:23:48,632 --> 00:23:49,472
Don't worry.

296
00:23:51,272 --> 00:23:52,472
I'm in disguise.

297
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:55,592
You call that a disguise?

298
00:23:57,432 --> 00:23:59,912
Didn't you notice how much attention
you've attracted?

299
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:03,592
Stop talking nonsense. Where are we going?

300
00:24:25,312 --> 00:24:27,312
So this is the place you said

301
00:24:28,272 --> 00:24:29,392
we can talk quietly?

302
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:32,272
How would I know it'd turn out this way?

303
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,352
Or are you

304
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:38,872
hinting something?

305
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:41,792
Yeah, right! You think too much.

306
00:24:42,952 --> 00:24:43,792
All right.

307
00:24:44,712 --> 00:24:46,192
What a shame.

308
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,152
Let's go somewhere else.

309
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:03,792
Why? Do you have something to tell me?

310
00:25:07,152 --> 00:25:08,472
I want to tell you

311
00:25:11,072 --> 00:25:13,192
that I didn't keep anything
from you on purpose.

312
00:25:14,592 --> 00:25:16,232
Initially, I didn't want to mention

313
00:25:16,752 --> 00:25:19,592
that I was followed by your bodyguards
because I meant well.

314
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:21,592
You did? I'm not sure about that.

315
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,992
-You don't believe me?
-That's not the issue.

316
00:25:25,432 --> 00:25:26,592
Then what's the issue?

317
00:25:30,152 --> 00:25:31,072
I love you.

318
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:37,552
Why did you suddenly say that?

319
00:25:38,672 --> 00:25:41,352
How about you?
I want to know how you really feel.

320
00:25:42,232 --> 00:25:44,712
-I told you I want to be with you.
-That's not enough.

321
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:47,552
How is it not enough?

322
00:25:48,752 --> 00:25:49,832
I want it to be clearer.

323
00:25:50,512 --> 00:25:52,392
I don't want vague answers.

324
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:56,752
I want to clearly confirm
that you really want to be with me.

325
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:02,072
Why is it still vague to you?

326
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:03,952
Which part of it do you not understand?

327
00:26:04,752 --> 00:26:06,632
I'm not sure what the fuss is about.

328
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:08,672
You never told me that you love me.

329
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:14,872
I feel very uncertain.

330
00:26:15,712 --> 00:26:17,552
Like you'd leave me anytime.

331
00:26:18,672 --> 00:26:20,232
I've been waiting all this time.

332
00:26:21,912 --> 00:26:23,752
But it seems like
you don't plan to say it.

333
00:26:29,032 --> 00:26:31,112
Do you really have to force me
to tell you this?

334
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:32,472
How stupid can you get?

335
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:37,792
<i>Turns out Daoming Si wants me
to tell him clearly.</i>

336
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:39,592
<i>He thinks my answers are vague.</i>

337
00:26:40,152 --> 00:26:42,272
<i>He wants everything to be clear.</i>

338
00:26:44,752 --> 00:26:45,832
That's really nice.

339
00:26:46,352 --> 00:26:47,232
I admire you.

340
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:48,312
There you go again.

341
00:26:48,752 --> 00:26:51,312
You get on my nerves
every time you speak nonsense.

342
00:26:58,832 --> 00:26:59,912
Hello? What is it?

343
00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:02,312
<i>It's just a simple line.</i>

344
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:03,472
<i>"I love you."</i>

345
00:27:03,912 --> 00:27:06,312
<i>Why do I always mess it up
when the timing is right?</i>

346
00:27:07,872 --> 00:27:08,872
Okay, no problem.

347
00:27:10,192 --> 00:27:11,152
Shancai?

348
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:15,912
All right. Cut the crap.

349
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:16,912
Bye.

350
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:19,952
Who was it? Why did you mention my name?

351
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,912
Ximen said he'll throw
a National Tea Tasting Party

352
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:24,912
at his house.

353
00:27:25,272 --> 00:27:26,232
You're invited.

354
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:28,032
National Tea Tasting Party?

355
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:30,872
Your friend is invited as well.

356
00:27:31,512 --> 00:27:32,392
Xiaoyou?

357
00:27:32,872 --> 00:27:35,232
Will Ximen be there?

358
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:40,032
The party is at his house.
What do you expect?

359
00:27:43,992 --> 00:27:45,552
So? Are you going or not?

360
00:27:46,112 --> 00:27:47,192
Of course!

361
00:27:49,112 --> 00:27:50,112
But...

362
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:51,992
let's go separately.

363
00:27:54,112 --> 00:27:55,512
Haven't we already agreed?

364
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:12,312
When did you two become familiar
with the Way of Tea?

365
00:28:12,432 --> 00:28:14,672
We were exposed to it
since we were little.

366
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:15,792
I see.

367
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:18,952
What do you think about the tea culture?

368
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,392
Because of my good friend, Ximen,

369
00:28:20,472 --> 00:28:22,912
I can call myself a tea expert.

370
00:28:23,672 --> 00:28:27,272
Whether it's green tea, black tea,
semi-fermented tea, or dark tea,

371
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:29,112
I know them well.

372
00:28:29,192 --> 00:28:30,832
What kind of tea do you personally like?

373
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:33,912
Assam black tea because it's quite unique.

374
00:28:34,032 --> 00:28:37,232
It has a rich and strong taste.
Its aroma is very pure.

375
00:28:37,312 --> 00:28:38,712
You can enjoy it with milk.

376
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:39,832
So I think

377
00:28:40,312 --> 00:28:42,192
it's quite special to drink that at home.

378
00:28:43,192 --> 00:28:46,072
-I think everyone should try it.
-Any other recommendations?

379
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,752
Shancai, you're here.

380
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:52,592
You're so late. We're all waiting for you.

381
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:54,992
Where are the others?

382
00:28:55,072 --> 00:28:57,472
They changed into cheongsams.
Aren't you going to change too?

383
00:28:57,712 --> 00:28:58,672
Cheongsam?

384
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:01,072
Is that necessary?
I've never worn one before.

385
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:04,672
Maybe because green tea is lighter?

386
00:29:05,712 --> 00:29:07,512
The lightness is not the problem. It's...

387
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:09,992
If you don't know how to wear it,
ask the expert.

388
00:29:10,552 --> 00:29:11,432
Expert?

389
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:13,312
He's inside.

390
00:29:21,912 --> 00:29:23,792
I don't think I can do it.

391
00:29:24,272 --> 00:29:26,952
It's all right. Leave it to me.

392
00:29:30,632 --> 00:29:32,872
Don't move! Ximen, stop!

393
00:29:38,072 --> 00:29:39,112
You're here.

394
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:41,352
What are you doing?

395
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
I was helping her put it on.

396
00:29:44,192 --> 00:29:46,432
Did it look like
I'm unbuttoning her dress?

397
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:47,832
What do you think?

398
00:29:48,112 --> 00:29:49,952
Anyone who sees this will think you're...

399
00:29:52,152 --> 00:29:54,352
Shancai, you're really funny.

400
00:29:54,912 --> 00:29:55,992
I'm serious.

401
00:29:56,312 --> 00:29:58,032
Why did she need your help
to button her up?

402
00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:01,552
The cheongsam requires a pair
of patient and skillful hands.

403
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:04,632
In tea ceremonies,
I'd help ladies in their preparations,

404
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:06,512
so that they'll look their best.

405
00:30:09,752 --> 00:30:10,672
Shancai.

406
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:13,272
I don't look good
in this cheongsam, right?

407
00:30:14,032 --> 00:30:14,872
Nonsense.

408
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:17,272
I prepared this cheongsam just for you.

409
00:30:17,472 --> 00:30:18,712
It fits you well.

410
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:24,152
But isn't cheongsam usually worn
by women with very good figures?

411
00:30:24,752 --> 00:30:27,632
My figure doesn't compliment
this cheongsam.

412
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:30,872
The only problem is your confidence.

413
00:30:31,152 --> 00:30:32,752
Lack of confidence decreases your charm.

414
00:30:36,672 --> 00:30:38,672
The cheongsam is not for just
one type of woman.

415
00:30:39,232 --> 00:30:41,472
Every woman who wears it
has their own charms.

416
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:44,752
So you're the cheongsam expert
they were referring to?

417
00:30:45,712 --> 00:30:47,712
Of course. Don't I look like it?

418
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:01,952
What?

419
00:31:03,432 --> 00:31:04,672
You should go change too.

420
00:31:05,392 --> 00:31:07,512
But experts can also make mistakes

421
00:31:08,392 --> 00:31:09,232
since the cheongsam

422
00:31:10,312 --> 00:31:11,472
cannot be worn by frogs.

423
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:12,912
You...

424
00:31:36,552 --> 00:31:37,392
Ximen.

425
00:31:39,312 --> 00:31:41,272
Do you usually hold such gatherings?

426
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:44,872
After graduation,
I rarely hold it like I used to.

427
00:31:51,272 --> 00:31:53,712
However, your waist is really big.

428
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,192
What do you want me to do?
I'm a frog with a big waist. So what?

429
00:31:59,112 --> 00:32:01,272
Don't worry. Si likes you no matter what.

430
00:32:05,072 --> 00:32:06,072
Ximen.

431
00:32:07,512 --> 00:32:09,112
Can you promise me one thing?

432
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:11,952
What is it?

433
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:15,832
I want to talk

434
00:32:16,672 --> 00:32:18,872
-about you and Xiaoyou--
-If we're alone too long,

435
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:20,992
Si won't be happy about it.

436
00:32:21,832 --> 00:32:23,432
Why would he be unhappy?

437
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:25,112
Hey.

438
00:32:36,152 --> 00:32:37,432
Don't I look handsome?

439
00:32:37,552 --> 00:32:39,912
You look like a waiter in Hengdian.

440
00:32:41,512 --> 00:32:43,512
How could you say that?

441
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:45,632
You look like you sell pork buns
in tea houses.

442
00:33:09,912 --> 00:33:12,272
Si, aren't you getting Shancai a drink?

443
00:33:13,712 --> 00:33:15,072
Can't she get it herself?

444
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:34,792
Fine feathers make you look fine.

445
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:38,952
Fine feathers make fine birds.

446
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:41,152
Did you purposely say it wrong?

447
00:33:41,832 --> 00:33:43,392
I was complimenting you.

448
00:33:43,472 --> 00:33:44,832
Stupid girl. Don't you get it?

449
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:47,432
I look hideous in cheongsam.
That's not funny at all.

450
00:33:47,512 --> 00:33:49,272
Then you don't have a sense of humor.

451
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:01,792
Stop staring, or I'll kill you.

452
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:05,912
You two are so sweet.

453
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:07,832
I'm so jealous.

454
00:34:09,992 --> 00:34:11,952
What? We're not.

455
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:13,592
Gotcha.

456
00:34:14,312 --> 00:34:15,632
Hey, Li Zhen, you too...

457
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,312
Fight some more.

458
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:19,592
Don't be ridiculous.

459
00:34:21,152 --> 00:34:23,232
It's fun to see Si and Shancai argue.

460
00:34:23,752 --> 00:34:26,472
That's right. It's not any fun otherwise.

461
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,792
All right. We're all here.
Let's start the party!

462
00:34:33,352 --> 00:34:34,592
Yes!

463
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,192
Yes!

464
00:34:47,872 --> 00:34:49,752
Come on. Two, three.

465
00:34:50,312 --> 00:34:51,152
Come on.

466
00:34:51,232 --> 00:34:55,152
Drink.

467
00:34:56,632 --> 00:34:57,992
All right.

468
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:00,472
-Okay. Again.
-Okay. Again.

469
00:35:00,552 --> 00:35:03,192
Drink.

470
00:35:03,272 --> 00:35:04,392
-Drink.
-No. Another round.

471
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:06,272
-Why do I always lose?
-Drink.

472
00:35:06,352 --> 00:35:07,672
-You drank all these.
-Yes.

473
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:09,152
-You're not drinking?
-That's enough.

474
00:35:22,952 --> 00:35:24,072
You drank too much.

475
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:27,952
Daoming Si.

476
00:35:29,512 --> 00:35:31,792
-What should we do?
-About what?

477
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:37,832
Everyone's worried about us.

478
00:35:38,872 --> 00:35:40,152
They're so sincere.

479
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,672
Yet I've been keeping things from them.

480
00:35:44,752 --> 00:35:45,632
Sorry.

481
00:35:47,752 --> 00:35:49,232
I'm too weak.

482
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,192
<i>Daoming Si should know
that this relationship needs commitment.</i>

483
00:35:57,712 --> 00:36:00,632
<i>I should have made it clear to him
long ago, but I never had the chance.</i>

484
00:36:00,912 --> 00:36:03,392
<i>Should I do it now?</i>

485
00:36:05,752 --> 00:36:06,712
I...

486
00:36:11,432 --> 00:36:12,672
All this time,

487
00:36:13,712 --> 00:36:14,632
I...

488
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,032
I love you.

489
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:20,312
I didn't say that, right?

490
00:36:20,672 --> 00:36:22,112
I know.

491
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,912
Ximen.

492
00:36:29,472 --> 00:36:30,592
I love you.

493
00:36:31,192 --> 00:36:32,072
Thank you.

494
00:36:33,552 --> 00:36:34,472
I love you too.

495
00:36:37,352 --> 00:36:39,952
Ximen is going to break Xiaoyou's heart.

496
00:36:41,552 --> 00:36:42,592
I'm serious.

497
00:36:43,152 --> 00:36:44,032
I know.

498
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:47,632
Girls who make serious confessions
are beautiful.

499
00:36:48,552 --> 00:36:49,872
You were quite beautiful earlier.

500
00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:55,312
What is he talking about?

501
00:36:55,952 --> 00:36:56,792
Shut up.

502
00:36:59,232 --> 00:37:00,072
But why

503
00:37:00,712 --> 00:37:01,752
are you saying this?

504
00:37:02,832 --> 00:37:03,912
What do you want?

505
00:37:05,232 --> 00:37:06,272
To go out on a date,

506
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,552
hug, or kiss?

507
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:11,992
Xiaoyou.

508
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:15,352
I think you've misunderstood.

509
00:37:16,992 --> 00:37:17,912
I'm a good person,

510
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:20,272
but not a good man.

511
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:23,792
You should find a good man to protect you.

512
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:25,352
All right?

513
00:37:25,432 --> 00:37:28,792
Why do you always pretend to act
like a bad guy in front of me?

514
00:37:29,152 --> 00:37:31,632
-Why do you live this way?
-Xiaoyou.

515
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:34,872
Self-righteous girls

516
00:37:36,632 --> 00:37:38,352
are a turn-off.

517
00:37:46,152 --> 00:37:47,992
That guy is really crazy this time.

518
00:37:54,912 --> 00:37:56,432
Xiaoyou.

519
00:37:57,312 --> 00:37:58,272
Sorry.

520
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,432
I overheard you earlier.

521
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:04,712
It's so embarrassing.
You saw what happened.

522
00:38:08,272 --> 00:38:10,152
I slapped Ximen earlier.

523
00:38:11,112 --> 00:38:12,312
Turns out hitting someone

524
00:38:13,872 --> 00:38:15,272
also hurts your own hand.

525
00:38:21,512 --> 00:38:22,592
I have to do better.

526
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:26,112
What are you trying to say?

527
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:29,832
I think I understand Ximen more now.

528
00:38:31,072 --> 00:38:33,312
I'll do better next time.

529
00:38:33,392 --> 00:38:36,912
But didn't you get rejected earlier?

530
00:38:37,512 --> 00:38:38,392
Shancai.

531
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:41,472
I hope you'll cheer for me.

532
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:47,152
Please.

533
00:38:55,352 --> 00:38:56,232
You can do it.

534
00:39:03,152 --> 00:39:05,512
It's a good thing.
I think Ximen's very honest.

535
00:39:06,472 --> 00:39:07,472
Says who?

536
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:11,632
I usually can't tell
whether he's telling the truth or not.

537
00:39:11,992 --> 00:39:15,632
He can reject her all he wants,
but why say such outrageous things?

538
00:39:16,392 --> 00:39:19,792
He didn't flirt or date that girl first.

539
00:39:20,112 --> 00:39:21,232
He rejected her directly.

540
00:39:21,752 --> 00:39:24,232
If I didn't see it for myself,
I wouldn't believe it.

541
00:39:24,832 --> 00:39:26,752
So you mean I should even thank him?

542
00:39:28,352 --> 00:39:30,152
Tell your friend to give up.

543
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:33,032
-Or else, she'll get hurt.
-Don't jinx it.

544
00:39:33,992 --> 00:39:35,192
It's true.

545
00:39:35,432 --> 00:39:37,432
It's not possible for her and Ximen.

546
00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:39,952
She's going to be more upset.

547
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:43,872
Aren't you worried for the same reason?

548
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,352
Hey.

549
00:39:50,912 --> 00:39:53,032
Don't just think about other people.

550
00:39:53,672 --> 00:39:55,872
Think about us too.

551
00:39:57,152 --> 00:39:58,632
How long will we go on like this?

552
00:39:59,512 --> 00:40:00,912
How long do I have to wait

553
00:40:01,712 --> 00:40:03,552
for you to tell me what you truly feel?

554
00:40:06,392 --> 00:40:07,712
Just...

555
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,752
wait a bit more.

556
00:40:12,152 --> 00:40:13,352
Are you still the same person?

557
00:40:17,272 --> 00:40:18,552
Lately, I feel

558
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:23,792
that you're not the Shancai
I've always liked anymore.

559
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:27,112
-It's not that easy.
-It is!

560
00:40:27,752 --> 00:40:28,672
No.

561
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,552
If we tell everyone
about our relationship,

562
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:34,112
the lives of people around us
would change.

563
00:40:34,672 --> 00:40:35,872
You won't understand.

564
00:40:36,152 --> 00:40:37,032
There you go again.

565
00:40:37,832 --> 00:40:38,912
You're always like this.

566
00:40:40,752 --> 00:40:41,792
I don't understand.

567
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:45,912
So you do?

568
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,672
Then protect them on your own.

569
00:40:57,912 --> 00:40:59,112
<i>He's right.</i>

570
00:40:59,552 --> 00:41:01,192
<i>This is not like me at all.</i>

571
00:41:02,232 --> 00:41:03,712
<i>I know that better than anyone.</i>

572
00:41:04,912 --> 00:41:05,872
<i>But...</i>

573
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:15,912
Si, where are you going?

574
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,312
-Home.
-Home?

575
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,672
What?

576
00:41:20,632 --> 00:41:22,712
Home? Who's going home?

577
00:41:22,792 --> 00:41:25,312
It's late. I should get going too.

578
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:28,032
It's too late. It might be dangerous.

579
00:41:28,912 --> 00:41:29,872
Just stay here.

580
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:33,872
Yes, just stay here.

581
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,432
We can have a sleepover tonight.

582
00:41:37,112 --> 00:41:38,232
A sleepover.

583
00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:41,632
-Si, stay here tonight too.
-No.

584
00:41:42,192 --> 00:41:43,392
What happened?

585
00:41:43,512 --> 00:41:45,192
Why do you suddenly want to go home?

586
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:47,272
-Nothing happened.
-I'm sure something did.

587
00:41:53,112 --> 00:41:55,352
Shancai, what's going on with you two?

588
00:41:55,672 --> 00:41:57,432
Why are you two so confused?

589
00:41:59,272 --> 00:42:00,232
Daoming Si.

590
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:02,392
I love you.

591
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:21,792
Listen, everyone.

592
00:42:23,232 --> 00:42:24,472
Daoming Si and I

593
00:42:25,152 --> 00:42:26,432
have been dating for a while now.

594
00:42:29,472 --> 00:42:31,672
Sorry that we kept it from you.

595
00:42:34,392 --> 00:42:35,992
It's not strange that you're dating,

596
00:42:36,632 --> 00:42:39,112
but did you just confess your feelings?

597
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:40,272
Yes.

598
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:44,792
Si, why are you still standing there?
Shancai confessed her feelings.

599
00:42:45,352 --> 00:42:46,632
Aren't you going to do anything?

600
00:42:53,312 --> 00:42:55,152
<i>I want to live like myself.</i>

601
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,352
<i>I finally said it.</i>

602
00:43:03,432 --> 00:43:05,072
<i>Around the arms tightly holding me,</i>

603
00:43:05,672 --> 00:43:07,592
<i>I can hear everyone's cheers.</i>

604
00:43:08,512 --> 00:43:09,712
<i>This moment</i>

605
00:43:10,352 --> 00:43:11,672
<i>is mine.</i>

606
00:43:12,392 --> 00:43:13,592
<i>I cannot explain</i>

607
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:16,072
<i>how amazing it feels right now.</i>
