00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:01,924
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:27,020
METEOR GARDEN

3
00:01:27,164 --> 00:01:30,084
EPISODE 10

4
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,324
Among these cards,
which has the highest value?

5
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,684
Ace of Diamonds.

6
00:01:58,764 --> 00:01:59,604
Are you sure?

7
00:02:00,244 --> 00:02:01,164
I'm sure.

8
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:04,004
Hearts...

9
00:02:05,364 --> 00:02:06,724
Jack of Hearts.

10
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:11,404
Clubs...

11
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:15,004
King of Clubs.

12
00:02:21,444 --> 00:02:22,564
Diamonds.

13
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:25,804
Spades...

14
00:02:26,724 --> 00:02:27,964
Queen of Spades.

15
00:02:47,004 --> 00:02:47,884
Am I wrong again?

16
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:50,484
No, but you're too slow.

17
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:53,564
Hey, it's quite amazing
that I didn't make a mistake, okay?

18
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:01,284
I'll do better.

19
00:03:01,924 --> 00:03:03,724
Since you already know the basics,

20
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:05,364
the biggest problem now

21
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:07,644
is that you always expose
the cards you have.

22
00:03:08,844 --> 00:03:09,684
No way.

23
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:11,604
You have a lot of spades.

24
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:14,644
Am I right?

25
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:17,764
You're insanely good at this.

26
00:03:17,924 --> 00:03:19,524
Try to bluff and see if you can fool me.

27
00:03:19,804 --> 00:03:21,444
If you can do that,
then we stand a chance.

28
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:24,764
All right.

29
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:28,564
Do you like studying at Mingde University?

30
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:30,044
Yes.

31
00:03:30,484 --> 00:03:32,284
The people here are really amazing.

32
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:33,884
You don't like it here.

33
00:03:34,604 --> 00:03:36,604
That doesn't count. You already know that.

34
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:38,404
Do you like Si?

35
00:03:39,324 --> 00:03:40,444
Of course not.

36
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:42,244
I asked you to fool me.

37
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:44,724
If you don't like him,
you should have said that you do.

38
00:03:45,284 --> 00:03:46,644
I couldn't make myself say that.

39
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:48,044
Then do you like me?

40
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:54,324
No.

41
00:03:55,964 --> 00:03:57,684
That seems like the truth.

42
00:03:57,764 --> 00:03:59,084
That's not true.

43
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:00,924
I was just kidding.

44
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:10,244
Who asks questions like that?

45
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:11,244
How can I answer that?

46
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:13,764
Only you can't.

47
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:16,804
Then do you like Jing?

48
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:23,644
Sorry.

49
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:25,564
I shouldn't have asked that question.

50
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:29,564
If I say I'm already over her,
would you believe me?

51
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:36,684
Do you want me to stay here?

52
00:04:37,684 --> 00:04:38,684
Yes.

53
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:41,204
Then I'll do my best to stay,

54
00:04:41,844 --> 00:04:43,964
so that I can do everything
to protect you.

55
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:21,844
If Shancai leaves Mingde,

56
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:23,444
I'll leave F4.

57
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:27,684
Do you know what you're saying?

58
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:34,564
Although it's cool to be a part of F4,

59
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:38,244
if you bully Shancai, you're my enemy.

60
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:42,324
Qinghe, you're not that important.

61
00:05:43,484 --> 00:05:45,644
And Shancai doesn't even like you.

62
00:05:46,644 --> 00:05:48,404
That doesn't matter.

63
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:49,884
I like Shancai.

64
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:53,204
If I expect the person I like
to like me as well,

65
00:05:53,764 --> 00:05:54,964
that's not manly at all.

66
00:05:58,204 --> 00:05:59,084
Daoming Si.

67
00:05:59,604 --> 00:06:02,364
If you like Shancai,
you have to treat her nicely.

68
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:04,964
Even if Shancai doesn't like you,

69
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:07,964
it should be enough for you
to see her happy,

70
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:09,204
isn't it?

71
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:14,124
Qinghe, I suddenly realized
that you have the potential to join F4.

72
00:06:15,364 --> 00:06:17,844
What you just said is very manly.

73
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:19,884
Start practicing how to play Bridge.

74
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:22,404
This way, if F4 really loses a member,

75
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:26,804
at least we can have a full team
in competitions.

76
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:38,884
<i>From the very first day
I entered Mingde University,</i>

77
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:42,084
<i>I heard about all sorts of bets made
when playing against F4.</i>

78
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:44,284
<i>I never imagined</i>

79
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,764
<i>I'd receive a joker card
to fight Daoming Si</i>

80
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:50,604
<i>with Huaze Lei on my side
during my freshman year.</i>

81
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:56,164
Who do you think will win?

82
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,004
Daoming Si, of course.

83
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:00,884
Shancai doesn't know how to play Bridge.

84
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:04,404
Even if Huaze Lei is amazing at it,
she'll be useless.

85
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:06,364
Shancai.

86
00:07:08,164 --> 00:07:09,564
Do your best. I hope you'll win.

87
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,604
Look.

88
00:07:11,684 --> 00:07:12,924
SHANCAI, YOU CAN DO IT

89
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,124
Did you sleep well last night?

90
00:07:26,204 --> 00:07:28,804
I'm so nervous.
I didn't sleep well at all.

91
00:07:29,844 --> 00:07:30,684
Don't be scared.

92
00:07:34,884 --> 00:07:37,204
Actually, I slept really well.
I fooled you, right?

93
00:07:38,164 --> 00:07:40,284
Yes, you did.
You can make it on your own now.

94
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:45,524
Then do we stand a chance now?

95
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:46,804
My gosh!

96
00:07:47,204 --> 00:07:50,204
-Why are they holding hands?
-Right?

97
00:08:05,164 --> 00:08:06,004
Shancai.

98
00:08:06,244 --> 00:08:09,684
Welcome to the Bridge Room and to
the two-on-two competition against the F4.

99
00:08:10,244 --> 00:08:11,924
Did Huaze Lei explain the rules to you?

100
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:13,924
Yes.

101
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:16,364
Do you plan to hold hands
while playing Bridge?

102
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:21,404
Si will play with Meizuo,
and Shancai with Lei.

103
00:08:21,484 --> 00:08:23,124
The two teams will take turns dealing.

104
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:24,764
Six tricks will be added
to the card they have called.

105
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:28,084
Win the number you bid or more,
and you win the game. Otherwise, you lose.

106
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:29,964
Are we clear?

107
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,684
Yes.

108
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:34,604
Please have a seat.

109
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,644
You know what's at stake, right?

110
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:49,884
Don't we all?

111
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:52,964
What's at stake here?

112
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:56,164
Shancai, tell them.

113
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:03,844
What's at stake

114
00:09:05,364 --> 00:09:06,244
is that if I win,

115
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:08,604
you have to forgive me.

116
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:16,124
Is it that important to you?

117
00:09:18,764 --> 00:09:19,604
Yes.

118
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:21,244
From what I can see,

119
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:25,044
you just want to be free from guilt
when you're in a relationship with Lei.

120
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:27,564
Maybe.

121
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:29,764
Then I definitely refuse to lose.

122
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:32,124
What if I win?

123
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:35,924
Then I won't see Shancai again.

124
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:42,764
You said that on your own accord.

125
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:45,524
Yes, I did.

126
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:47,804
But I might not lose.

127
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:49,324
Right?

128
00:09:50,564 --> 00:09:51,404
Yes.

129
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:55,564
All right. Let the competition begin.

130
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:03,044
Please check your cards.

131
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:13,004
Shancai, you can call your card first.

132
00:10:17,444 --> 00:10:18,684
One of Hearts.

133
00:10:19,524 --> 00:10:20,724
One of Spades.

134
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:23,084
Three of Hearts.

135
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,004
<i>What?</i>

136
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:27,004
<i>Huaze Lei is calling
the same Hearts suit as me?</i>

137
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,004
I don't have any Hearts cards.

138
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:31,364
I just bluffed it initially.

139
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:34,884
Four of Clubs.

140
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:37,924
<i>Daoming Si is calling four of Clubs now.</i>

141
00:10:38,724 --> 00:10:41,124
<i>If I want to continue calling,
I have to go with four too.</i>

142
00:10:41,204 --> 00:10:44,724
<i>That means I should at least
win ten tricks in order to win.</i>

143
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:46,884
<i>I only have three Clubs cards.</i>

144
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:50,204
<i>If Huaze Lei also has them...</i>

145
00:11:01,324 --> 00:11:02,484
The trump suit is Clubs.

146
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:04,524
Huaze Lei, please proceed.

147
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,804
Shancai, Lei made a mistake.

148
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:15,244
He thinks that you have the ace of Hearts.

149
00:11:15,764 --> 00:11:17,244
That's why he played the Hearts suit.

150
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:19,044
He wants you to win the first trick.

151
00:11:19,564 --> 00:11:21,644
Actually, the ace of Hearts is with me.

152
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:24,644
It looks like your plan
is not going to work.

153
00:11:38,404 --> 00:11:41,324
Shancai has no Hearts. The trump suit,
two of Clubs, wins the first trick.

154
00:11:44,364 --> 00:11:46,364
Shancai, you did great.

155
00:11:50,204 --> 00:11:53,764
I never thought the innocent Shancai
would cheat.

156
00:11:55,604 --> 00:11:57,724
Even if Shancai cheats, she's still cute.

157
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:01,644
Unlike others who tell the truth,
but always hurts people.

158
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:08,404
A liar is more despicable, of course.

159
00:12:09,684 --> 00:12:11,004
Aren't you like that?

160
00:12:12,724 --> 00:12:14,764
Please note that this is a Bridge game.

161
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:16,644
Refrain from verbal attacks.

162
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:20,484
Shancai, the winner continues playing.

163
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:38,804
Shancai's ace of Diamonds beats you all.

164
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:42,764
-She wins the second trick.
-Shancai, you're doing great.

165
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,444
Huaze Lei taught me well.

166
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:47,844
She's a quick study.

167
00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:51,164
Please continue.

168
00:12:58,564 --> 00:13:00,484
I won't let you two win again.

169
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:02,244
Says who?

170
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:04,204
We might not lose.

171
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:06,724
"We"?

172
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:08,964
Shancai.

173
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:11,324
The "we" that you and Huaze Lei refer to

174
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:13,724
will soon disappear
from Mingde University.

175
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:26,684
Why are they still not out?

176
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:29,204
We finished the Big and Small game
in ten minutes.

177
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:33,484
Qinghe, Shancai and Daoming Si
are playing an official game of Bridge.

178
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:35,524
I know how to play that too.

179
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:38,684
If I play them,
I'm sure F4 would surrender immediately.

180
00:13:38,844 --> 00:13:40,084
You silly boy.

181
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:43,244
F4 is the champion of countless
international Bridge competitions.

182
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:45,484
Whom do you think you're fooling?

183
00:13:46,004 --> 00:13:48,844
Qinghe, I know that you
and Shancai are close.

184
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:51,964
But even so, you have to face reality.

185
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:57,084
I think it would be better for you
to pray that she gets a nice set of cards.

186
00:13:57,644 --> 00:13:58,764
Xinhui, you're right.

187
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:03,844
God, please protect the innocent
and cute Shancai.

188
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:06,044
Don't let her be bullied
by the monster, Daoming Si.

189
00:14:08,124 --> 00:14:08,964
Shancai.

190
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:10,484
You're bound to lose.

191
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:13,324
No one has the trump suit now.

192
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:16,484
And I'm now going to play
the Spade suit that you don't have.

193
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:19,244
You'll surely lose this round.

194
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:37,244
You didn't have the King of Spades?

195
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:45,964
Shancai's King of Spades
beats Si's Queen of Spades.

196
00:14:46,524 --> 00:14:48,284
I thought we were bound to lose.

197
00:14:48,644 --> 00:14:50,524
Shancai, you're bound to lose, all right.

198
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:52,564
Based on the cards played earlier,

199
00:14:52,644 --> 00:14:56,284
we all should have Diamonds
left in our hands.

200
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:59,884
Si's card should be the highest among us.

201
00:15:00,444 --> 00:15:02,044
My memory can't be wrong,

202
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:04,524
so you will lose this round.

203
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:06,444
<i>Really?</i>

204
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:10,364
<i>Are we really going to lose?</i>

205
00:15:13,164 --> 00:15:15,084
<i>Yes, that's the smile.</i>

206
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:17,524
<i>That's the priceless smile.</i>

207
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:19,684
<i>It gives me courage.</i>

208
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:21,684
<i>I'm not afraid anymore.</i>

209
00:15:31,124 --> 00:15:33,084
Hey! Play your card!

210
00:15:51,244 --> 00:15:52,564
Si.

211
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:55,364
Are you sure you'll win?

212
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:56,284
We can't be too sure.

213
00:15:57,084 --> 00:15:58,764
Maybe he doesn't have any Diamonds.

214
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,564
If so, then we win.

215
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:04,084
If we win,

216
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:06,324
the one who'll leave
Mingde University is Daoming Si.

217
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:10,284
In that case,

218
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:11,964
maybe our stakes are too high.

219
00:16:12,324 --> 00:16:13,764
Because Si will surely win.

220
00:16:14,244 --> 00:16:18,724
Which means, the ones leaving
Mingde University will be Lei and Shancai.

221
00:16:18,804 --> 00:16:20,484
It's fine if we can't see Lei here.

222
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:22,004
We can go to his house.

223
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:23,804
If Shancai leaves,

224
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:25,964
there will be no Ms. Flying Kick
at Mingde.

225
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:28,044
That's fine.

226
00:16:28,124 --> 00:16:30,484
Then the school will no longer
have girls from average--

227
00:16:30,564 --> 00:16:33,044
Daoming Si. Are you playing or not?

228
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:34,644
You're not scared, are you?

229
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:39,484
Play your card.

230
00:16:41,404 --> 00:16:42,604
I'll acknowledge it if I lose.

231
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:16,124
I'm not playing anymore! You guys suck.

232
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:27,404
You won.

233
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:30,084
We won?

234
00:17:31,444 --> 00:17:33,724
Huaze Lei, we won.

235
00:17:34,924 --> 00:17:36,084
Actually, we didn't win.

236
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:38,284
Why not?

237
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,044
Si couldn't beat my card.

238
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:43,284
That's why he got mad
he mixed the cards up.

239
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:45,124
What a sore loser.

240
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:48,524
Si's card was actually higher
than all of ours.

241
00:17:49,164 --> 00:17:50,124
Meizuo.

242
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:53,924
This was Si's card.

243
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:56,364
My memory cannot be wrong.

244
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:01,844
Nobody compares to Meizuo
in remembering cards.

245
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:07,724
Then he won.

246
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:10,124
Why did he stop playing?

247
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:14,164
What do you think?

248
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:20,084
Let's go. Ms. Zhuang is still waiting
to celebrate with us.

249
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:30,684
<i>Come on.</i>

250
00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:32,844
<i>To all our good times together.</i>

251
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:33,884
Cheers.

252
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:35,324
Cheers.

253
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:42,524
I think we were able to settle
the matter today, right?

254
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:43,724
I hope so.

255
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:46,084
But Si isn't home yet.

256
00:18:46,284 --> 00:18:48,164
I'm not sure where he went
after the competition.

257
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,164
He'll be fine.

258
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:54,284
Si used to quit in the middle
of playing Bridge before too.

259
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:55,884
I know my brother very well.

260
00:18:55,964 --> 00:18:58,284
He's a self-centered, childish person.

261
00:18:59,484 --> 00:19:01,244
It's my fault.
I didn't discipline him well.

262
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:02,404
Don't mind him.

263
00:19:02,484 --> 00:19:04,244
Let's enjoy the food together.

264
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:09,164
Ms. Zhuang, we're not pigs.
We can't finish all of this.

265
00:19:11,204 --> 00:19:12,804
You eat too little.

266
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:15,204
That's why you're so tall and skinny.
It's abnormal.

267
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:16,764
Shancai, eat up.

268
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:19,444
Don't act like a cow silently grazing.

269
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:22,924
How could I have an appetite?

270
00:19:23,044 --> 00:19:24,804
I was so nervous, that my stomach hurts.

271
00:19:24,884 --> 00:19:25,844
Nervous about what?

272
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:28,404
The stakes for the bet with Daoming Si.

273
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:30,924
From the day I entered Mingde University,

274
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:34,964
I heard all sorts of rumors
about F4 and Joker cards.

275
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:37,444
And it was my first time playing Bridge.

276
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:39,284
I was under so much pressure.

277
00:19:39,964 --> 00:19:41,244
I see.

278
00:19:41,604 --> 00:19:42,604
But Shancai,

279
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:45,244
those rumors were created by people
jealous of Si and the F4.

280
00:19:45,324 --> 00:19:48,284
They challenged them but knew
they couldn't beat them,

281
00:19:48,364 --> 00:19:49,924
and were too ashamed to admit it.

282
00:19:50,644 --> 00:19:51,644
We can't help it.

283
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,644
So many people challenged us.

284
00:19:53,724 --> 00:19:55,284
It was too much to handle.

285
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:56,604
If we didn't require a bet,

286
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:58,804
we'd need to play Bridge
with people daily.

287
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:00,604
We'd die from exhaustion.

288
00:20:02,604 --> 00:20:03,884
They're all grown up.

289
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:05,244
They're not childish anymore.

290
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:07,324
That's a cause for celebration.

291
00:20:07,404 --> 00:20:08,684
Come on. Cheers.

292
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:10,364
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

293
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:20,724
Ms. Zhuang,
every time you have a few drinks,

294
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,204
you become wild and carefree.

295
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:26,284
I can't believe that the kids
who wore open-crotch pants

296
00:20:26,404 --> 00:20:28,364
and wet their beds

297
00:20:28,844 --> 00:20:31,724
have now reached the age
when they're fighting over a girl.

298
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:33,244
That's really amazing.

299
00:20:34,844 --> 00:20:37,004
The famous F4 wore open-crotch pants

300
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:38,884
and even wet their beds.

301
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:42,004
-I really can't imagine it.
-Shut up.

302
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:47,564
Ms. Zhuang, that's ancient history.

303
00:20:47,644 --> 00:20:49,564
-Let's not mention that.
-What does it matter?

304
00:20:49,644 --> 00:20:50,604
We've all been there.

305
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:56,564
Furthermore, Ximen and Meizuo would bite
each other's toes when they were young.

306
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:58,284
They were drooling
while biting each other.

307
00:20:58,564 --> 00:21:00,604
They kept clamoring for their pacifiers.

308
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:02,044
And Lei...

309
00:21:02,324 --> 00:21:05,564
When he was young, he stuck his head
in the toilet when he washed his hair.

310
00:21:05,644 --> 00:21:07,804
It got stuck there
and we couldn't get it out.

311
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:11,604
Ms. Zhuang, that's enough.

312
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:13,924
Why do you have to remember those things?

313
00:21:15,004 --> 00:21:16,844
I didn't mention the time
you guys wore my--

314
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:19,404
Cheers.

315
00:21:44,724 --> 00:21:45,644
Hey.

316
00:21:48,204 --> 00:21:49,684
Look where you're going.

317
00:21:52,724 --> 00:21:53,564
Hey.

318
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:56,164
Are you deaf?

319
00:21:58,644 --> 00:22:01,804
It's a pain talking to deaf people.
You're lucky I'm lazy.

320
00:22:07,124 --> 00:22:08,204
What did you say?

321
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:09,564
I...

322
00:22:11,724 --> 00:22:12,844
I asked what you said.

323
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:14,564
I didn't...

324
00:22:15,284 --> 00:22:16,244
You said "Lei"!

325
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:19,044
No, I said, "lazy."

326
00:22:19,124 --> 00:22:21,484
You can't let me hear the word "Lei."
Understood?

327
00:22:21,564 --> 00:22:23,404
Understood.

328
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:26,204
I'm Daoming Si.

329
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:28,884
How can I be sad because of a girl?

330
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:31,284
-Right?
-Right.

331
00:22:31,604 --> 00:22:33,644
I'm not depressed. I'm...

332
00:22:49,564 --> 00:22:51,924
33721842369.

333
00:22:52,524 --> 00:22:55,244
17718512317.

334
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:56,684
What are you doing?

335
00:22:57,284 --> 00:22:58,684
We're seeing whose memory is better.

336
00:22:59,284 --> 00:23:00,924
Who can memorize more ex's phone numbers.

337
00:23:01,844 --> 00:23:04,564
17701672125.

338
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,924
Isn't that Li's number?

339
00:23:07,564 --> 00:23:08,644
She liked me first.

340
00:23:08,724 --> 00:23:09,604
Shut up.

341
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:12,484
Hey, we shouldn't be
the only ones doing this.

342
00:23:12,804 --> 00:23:14,084
Girls should participate too.

343
00:23:14,164 --> 00:23:16,084
Shancai, tell us an ex-boyfriend's number.

344
00:23:16,204 --> 00:23:18,884
Shancai doesn't have an ex-boyfriend.
You don't need to ask her.

345
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:20,924
Si's number

346
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:24,604
is 10881217039.

347
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,164
Oh, please.

348
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:30,324
Si is not Shancai's ex-boyfriend.

349
00:23:30,804 --> 00:23:32,084
He liked her by himself.

350
00:23:32,484 --> 00:23:33,484
Right, Shancai?

351
00:23:37,244 --> 00:23:38,804
Why did you hit me again?

352
00:23:41,844 --> 00:23:42,804
Shancai.

353
00:23:43,244 --> 00:23:45,484
How far have you and Lei gone?

354
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:51,884
We went out on a date.

355
00:23:54,564 --> 00:23:56,804
Shancai may seem like a buffalo

356
00:23:57,684 --> 00:23:59,244
compared to the gorgeous Jing,

357
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,564
but Lei,

358
00:24:00,684 --> 00:24:02,364
this is not what a normal guy would do.

359
00:24:03,004 --> 00:24:03,844
Ms. Zhuang.

360
00:24:03,924 --> 00:24:06,164
The most intimate they got
was probably at the airport

361
00:24:06,724 --> 00:24:08,364
when Lei kissed Shancai's forehead.

362
00:24:09,644 --> 00:24:11,484
You two are moving too slowly.

363
00:24:11,564 --> 00:24:13,884
That's why Si had the chance
to get between you.

364
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:16,524
How about spending the night
together tonight,

365
00:24:16,604 --> 00:24:17,964
just the two of you,

366
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:20,044
so that you can have
some quality time together?

367
00:24:21,964 --> 00:24:23,444
What does that mean?

368
00:24:23,524 --> 00:24:24,844
What are you planning to do?

369
00:24:26,804 --> 00:24:27,764
Sure.

370
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,564
I wanted to speak to Shancai alone anyway.

371
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:46,724
What did you want to speak to me about?

372
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:48,364
I'm not too sure either.

373
00:24:48,924 --> 00:24:50,884
I just want to talk to you alone.

374
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:54,244
Do you want to suggest a topic
we can talk about?

375
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:00,524
How about

376
00:25:00,884 --> 00:25:02,284
we talk about

377
00:25:03,124 --> 00:25:04,484
our graduation trip?

378
00:25:06,164 --> 00:25:08,164
We went to Chongming Island

379
00:25:08,764 --> 00:25:10,164
for our graduation trip.

380
00:25:11,364 --> 00:25:14,404
At night, we had pillow fights.

381
00:25:15,084 --> 00:25:16,924
We also had a bonfire.

382
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:18,924
When I think about it now,

383
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:20,724
it's still a very special memory.

384
00:25:21,884 --> 00:25:23,804
How about you? Where did you go?

385
00:25:28,604 --> 00:25:29,884
Prague.

386
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:31,204
I've never been--

387
00:25:36,524 --> 00:25:39,644
Why are you staring at me?

388
00:25:40,804 --> 00:25:41,764
You're so ugly.

389
00:25:43,924 --> 00:25:44,844
Just kidding.

390
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:49,404
But when I look at you this way,
you're really ordinary

391
00:25:49,604 --> 00:25:50,444
and plain.

392
00:25:52,964 --> 00:25:54,764
You don't need to remind me, okay?

393
00:26:01,564 --> 00:26:03,964
However, the way you looked
so serious during our game today

394
00:26:05,084 --> 00:26:06,004
was mesmerizing.

395
00:26:08,124 --> 00:26:11,964
I never understood
why Si likes you so much before,

396
00:26:13,564 --> 00:26:15,004
but I finally understood today.

397
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:16,884
Actually...

398
00:26:20,044 --> 00:26:21,084
Actually, what?

399
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:27,644
I'm not sure how I feel about you.

400
00:26:29,164 --> 00:26:30,244
Ximen said

401
00:26:30,764 --> 00:26:32,644
it may be because I'm still hurt
about Jing,

402
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,524
and that I'm using you to forget her.

403
00:26:37,244 --> 00:26:38,084
Maybe.

404
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:40,324
However...

405
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:43,124
It's fine.

406
00:26:43,564 --> 00:26:44,684
I understand.

407
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:48,804
I know how you feel about Jing.

408
00:26:49,564 --> 00:26:53,244
I also know how special she is to you.

409
00:27:10,684 --> 00:27:12,604
Why are you alone again?

410
00:27:14,684 --> 00:27:16,964
I looked for you for so long,
my legs are tired.

411
00:27:19,364 --> 00:27:21,204
From now on, don't hide
from us again, okay?

412
00:27:24,284 --> 00:27:25,364
What are you drawing?

413
00:27:30,964 --> 00:27:32,244
Is that me?

414
00:27:34,364 --> 00:27:36,444
It really looks like me.
I like it so much.

415
00:27:39,644 --> 00:27:42,404
When I was little, everyone mocked me
and said my drawings were ugly.

416
00:27:43,324 --> 00:27:44,284
Except Jing.

417
00:27:48,404 --> 00:27:51,804
Jing is a really special person.

418
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:56,404
I'm not sure if I can love
another person again.

419
00:27:59,884 --> 00:28:01,004
Although I really like you,

420
00:28:02,324 --> 00:28:04,724
I know it's not love.

421
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:10,364
It's fine.

422
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:13,244
Sorry.

423
00:28:14,684 --> 00:28:16,004
Why are you apologizing to me?

424
00:28:17,444 --> 00:28:20,404
If I didn't come back,
you could've been with Si.

425
00:28:21,724 --> 00:28:23,324
You don't have to apologize to me.

426
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:25,804
Who would want to be with him?

427
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:28,524
And...

428
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,764
if this hadn't happened,

429
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:36,044
I wouldn't have witnessed
the new person you are now.

430
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:39,324
The new person?

431
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:40,844
How am I different?

432
00:28:45,044 --> 00:28:46,564
The old you

433
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:49,004
was very lazy.

434
00:28:50,204 --> 00:28:51,924
And the way you spoke was so cold.

435
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:54,684
You seemed

436
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:56,764
very distant.

437
00:28:57,844 --> 00:28:58,844
Like this.

438
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:04,244
"I'm not interested
in other people's problems."

439
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:10,484
You know,

440
00:29:11,604 --> 00:29:13,004
every time you said

441
00:29:13,164 --> 00:29:15,124
that other people's problems
were not your concern,

442
00:29:16,524 --> 00:29:18,244
I felt really sad.

443
00:29:21,284 --> 00:29:23,724
But you're completely different now.

444
00:29:25,324 --> 00:29:27,284
I like the new person you are now.

445
00:29:30,724 --> 00:29:31,804
I'm willing

446
00:29:33,044 --> 00:29:34,564
to be your good friend forever.

447
00:29:55,244 --> 00:29:56,844
Thank you for being so understanding.

448
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:12,324
I'm home.

449
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:15,884
Si, your sister, Shancai

450
00:30:16,004 --> 00:30:18,484
and your best friends are having
a gathering in the dining room.

451
00:30:18,804 --> 00:30:20,364
How dare they have a gathering here?

452
00:30:26,764 --> 00:30:28,004
You're so close with my brother.

453
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:30,204
Why won't you teach him
how to get along with girls?

454
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,204
Ms. Zhuang, aside from you,

455
00:30:34,284 --> 00:30:36,564
what other girls can get along with Si?

456
00:30:37,724 --> 00:30:39,484
Ms. Zhuang, it isn't just the girls.

457
00:30:40,044 --> 00:30:40,924
Even the guys.

458
00:30:41,524 --> 00:30:44,124
Aside from us,
no one wants to play with him.

459
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:45,804
You're right.

460
00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:47,844
We all inherited our mom's

461
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:51,804
bratty, difficult and
hard-to-get-along-with attitude.

462
00:30:54,444 --> 00:30:56,364
As for Lei, even though
he's unpredictable,

463
00:30:56,444 --> 00:30:58,284
he has become very patient with her

464
00:30:58,364 --> 00:30:59,844
once he liked her.

465
00:31:00,164 --> 00:31:02,004
No wonder we hear a "pow"

466
00:31:02,124 --> 00:31:03,804
whenever Shancai sees Si.

467
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,084
It's like being in love with a time bomb.

468
00:31:08,604 --> 00:31:10,164
Let my brother suffer a little.

469
00:31:10,684 --> 00:31:12,564
Sometimes, being heartbroken
is not a bad thing.

470
00:31:14,844 --> 00:31:18,404
I wonder what Shancai and Lei

471
00:31:18,804 --> 00:31:19,804
are doing right now.

472
00:31:20,204 --> 00:31:21,884
They should be doing what they need to do.

473
00:31:22,884 --> 00:31:23,724
Si.

474
00:31:24,244 --> 00:31:26,124
What does Si have to do
with what they're doing?

475
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:27,964
What?

476
00:31:46,964 --> 00:31:49,204
Si, why are you home so late?

477
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:51,204
Si, are you tired?

478
00:31:51,364 --> 00:31:52,724
Do you want to go get some rest?

479
00:31:53,804 --> 00:31:55,044
What were you talking about?

480
00:31:56,844 --> 00:31:58,684
We don't have to hide this from him.

481
00:31:59,244 --> 00:32:00,604
We have to tell him eventually.

482
00:32:05,844 --> 00:32:06,684
Si.

483
00:32:07,484 --> 00:32:09,644
Shancai and Lei
are in a bedroom right now.

484
00:32:10,124 --> 00:32:13,644
If you're a real man,
you should be happy for them.

485
00:32:17,924 --> 00:32:19,604
Why does it smell like gunpowder?

486
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:22,284
I even hear the trigger for a bomb
being engaged.

487
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:27,724
What do you think?
Is there anything you want to say?

488
00:32:39,764 --> 00:32:42,764
I never thought that Lei
had his ways with women.

489
00:32:46,684 --> 00:32:48,004
It's a good thing, isn't it?

490
00:32:51,204 --> 00:32:52,324
That's great, Si.

491
00:32:53,124 --> 00:32:55,124
-You're really over her.
-Si.

492
00:32:55,844 --> 00:32:57,164
You're doing great.

493
00:32:57,244 --> 00:32:59,764
-You'll become a good man--
-Shut it!

494
00:33:02,404 --> 00:33:03,364
I'm starving.

495
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:05,284
Get me something to eat.

496
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:16,284
<i>Lei.</i>

497
00:33:17,124 --> 00:33:19,044
<i>Thank you for telling me those things
last night.</i>

498
00:33:23,364 --> 00:33:24,324
<i>Jing.</i>

499
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,844
<i>It's true, I still can't compare to you.</i>

500
00:33:30,284 --> 00:33:31,444
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

501
00:33:32,604 --> 00:33:33,924
<i>I'm Shancai, the weed.</i>

502
00:34:14,924 --> 00:34:17,004
Si, why are you up so early?

503
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,164
Ximen.

504
00:34:22,844 --> 00:34:25,524
Do you remember when I took
Lei's favorite toy?

505
00:34:29,564 --> 00:34:30,484
When was that?

506
00:34:33,844 --> 00:34:35,364
When we first entered grade school.

507
00:34:36,044 --> 00:34:37,724
<i>I liked that autographed Spiderman</i>

508
00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:39,524
<i>with the serial number.</i>

509
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:41,964
<i>If I had asked my dad,</i>

510
00:34:42,204 --> 00:34:44,124
<i>he would've gotten it for me from the U.S.</i>

511
00:34:44,884 --> 00:34:46,124
<i>As many as I wanted.</i>

512
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:49,604
What are you holding?

513
00:34:50,244 --> 00:34:51,124
Let me see.

514
00:34:51,844 --> 00:34:52,684
Give it to me.

515
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,764
<i>The more he treasured it,
the more I wanted it.</i>

516
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:56,804
<i>I know</i>

517
00:34:57,324 --> 00:34:58,804
<i>that I made an unforgivable mistake.</i>

518
00:35:02,764 --> 00:35:04,964
You should've let go sooner!

519
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:07,124
It's all your fault.

520
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:08,364
<i>But I just wouldn't admit it.</i>

521
00:35:11,084 --> 00:35:11,924
<i>That night,</i>

522
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,684
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

523
00:35:17,644 --> 00:35:20,044
<i>I thought that Lei would be mad
at me the next morning.</i>

524
00:35:22,004 --> 00:35:23,644
So I planned to get you two

525
00:35:24,964 --> 00:35:26,044
and bully him the next day.

526
00:35:28,884 --> 00:35:30,244
That's when I realized

527
00:35:31,564 --> 00:35:33,444
that I'd never be able to beat him.

528
00:35:37,244 --> 00:35:38,884
Nobody ever mentioned it again.

529
00:35:40,244 --> 00:35:42,324
Maybe Lei had also forgotten about it.

530
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:47,244
But I still feel

531
00:35:48,204 --> 00:35:49,364
that I owe him somehow.

532
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:55,644
I think...

533
00:35:58,764 --> 00:36:00,244
it's time to make it up to him.

534
00:36:03,804 --> 00:36:05,964
Are you talking about Shancai?

535
00:36:11,204 --> 00:36:12,524
I shouldn't torment her anymore.

536
00:36:52,124 --> 00:36:53,124
Shancai, come here.

537
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:54,804
We have something to tell you.

538
00:37:01,484 --> 00:37:02,324
Dad, Mom.

539
00:37:02,644 --> 00:37:05,044
Sorry. I stayed over
at my friend's place last night.

540
00:37:05,124 --> 00:37:06,484
I wasn't able to tell you about it.

541
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:08,924
Shancai.

542
00:37:09,204 --> 00:37:10,844
You can't live here anymore.

543
00:37:13,084 --> 00:37:13,924
Why?

544
00:37:15,564 --> 00:37:17,924
Your dad's moving into
a different company housing.

545
00:37:19,044 --> 00:37:20,004
Where?

546
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,684
"Great Earnings Investment
Consulting Corporation."

547
00:37:29,564 --> 00:37:30,844
Dad, really?

548
00:37:31,404 --> 00:37:32,244
That's right.

549
00:37:33,844 --> 00:37:35,844
I had an interview a few days ago.

550
00:37:36,844 --> 00:37:39,524
The boss said that I have a lot
of potential in investment.

551
00:37:40,764 --> 00:37:43,244
Not only does this company
guarantee bonuses,

552
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:45,084
the salaries are also guaranteed.

553
00:37:45,884 --> 00:37:47,844
I'm going to be rich.

554
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:50,604
Do you know anything
about investment consulting?

555
00:37:51,204 --> 00:37:53,044
Right? I asked him the same thing.

556
00:37:53,244 --> 00:37:56,324
But he said that the company
has a complete "S" something.

557
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:00,284
Yes.

558
00:38:02,084 --> 00:38:05,364
Just follow the SOP
and you can get all the benefits

559
00:38:05,644 --> 00:38:06,844
and earn a lot of money.

560
00:38:07,404 --> 00:38:08,724
Is it that simple?

561
00:38:08,804 --> 00:38:09,924
No problem.

562
00:38:10,564 --> 00:38:12,524
I finally found a new career.

563
00:38:14,684 --> 00:38:16,324
If you found a new career,

564
00:38:16,804 --> 00:38:19,164
why do you two look so sad?

565
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:20,684
Because we have to move.

566
00:38:21,244 --> 00:38:23,044
We lived in this house for over ten years.

567
00:38:23,364 --> 00:38:25,524
Just thinking about it makes me sad.

568
00:38:27,404 --> 00:38:28,364
Furthermore,

569
00:38:28,444 --> 00:38:30,964
my money will be invested in that company,

570
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:32,804
so...

571
00:38:33,724 --> 00:38:37,164
we'll be living in a place
that is smaller.

572
00:38:37,724 --> 00:38:39,444
Then the kitchen will surely be small.

573
00:38:39,804 --> 00:38:42,404
It'll be inconvenient for me
to cook from now on.

574
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:46,284
What worries me most is...

575
00:38:49,484 --> 00:38:51,804
How do we pack all this stuff?

576
00:38:53,484 --> 00:38:55,044
Just the souvenirs your mom and I bought

577
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,004
when we traveled together
are already a lot.

578
00:38:57,164 --> 00:38:58,604
-Just throw them away.
-Throw them...

579
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:00,444
Throw them away?

580
00:39:01,244 --> 00:39:03,044
Those are souvenirs of love.

581
00:39:03,644 --> 00:39:04,484
Throw them...

582
00:39:05,204 --> 00:39:07,204
Shancai, go and pack your things.

583
00:39:07,284 --> 00:39:08,564
We're moving tomorrow.

584
00:39:09,164 --> 00:39:11,244
All right.

585
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:16,164
What should we do?

586
00:39:30,604 --> 00:39:31,564
Come inside.

587
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:32,884
We're here.

588
00:39:33,124 --> 00:39:34,244
We're here.

589
00:39:36,244 --> 00:39:37,084
Dear.

590
00:39:37,524 --> 00:39:38,724
This place might not look nice

591
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:40,084
and it might not be big,

592
00:39:40,284 --> 00:39:41,244
but dear,

593
00:39:41,324 --> 00:39:43,044
with your taste and ideas,

594
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:46,844
I know you'll turn it into
an intricate and practical place.

595
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:48,924
Leave it to me.

596
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:51,364
I'll buy our furniture from
the second-hand store online.

597
00:39:51,444 --> 00:39:52,804
It's economical and practical.

598
00:39:53,164 --> 00:39:56,444
The most important thing is that
we're closer to Shancai's school.

599
00:39:56,844 --> 00:39:59,124
She can sleep half an hour more now.

600
00:39:59,204 --> 00:40:00,164
Am I right?

601
00:40:00,244 --> 00:40:01,844
-Yes.
-Dear, you're so great.

602
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:03,884
You always think about our family.

603
00:40:04,684 --> 00:40:05,524
Marrying you

604
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:07,364
was the biggest blessing in my life.

605
00:40:08,004 --> 00:40:09,724
I'll do anything to make our family happy.

606
00:40:10,444 --> 00:40:12,524
Dear, I'll also work hard

607
00:40:12,604 --> 00:40:14,724
for you and our beloved daughter.

608
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:16,284
I believe in you.

609
00:40:16,884 --> 00:40:19,244
-I'll also work hard.
-Shancai.

610
00:40:19,324 --> 00:40:20,964
You have to study hard.

611
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:23,684
-You're our family's hope.
-Okay.

612
00:40:23,764 --> 00:40:24,604
-Yes?
-You can do it.

613
00:40:24,684 --> 00:40:26,004
-You can do it.
-I can do it.

614
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:34,204
Mom, I've already connected the water

615
00:40:34,284 --> 00:40:35,324
-and electricity--
-Hey.

616
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:36,484
Check them--

617
00:40:39,324 --> 00:40:40,484
Why didn't you say something?

618
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:42,764
I called out to you.
What were you thinking about?

619
00:40:43,684 --> 00:40:44,524
Nothing.

620
00:40:45,884 --> 00:40:47,524
You left these books at my house.

621
00:40:48,524 --> 00:40:49,764
I completely forgot about them.

622
00:40:50,444 --> 00:40:52,084
Bring your brain with you, will you?

623
00:40:52,164 --> 00:40:53,844
You're always so absent-minded.

624
00:40:55,324 --> 00:40:56,404
All right.

625
00:41:02,124 --> 00:41:03,324
Did you forget something again?

626
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,244
What?

627
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:07,884
To say thank you.
I brought it to you personally.

628
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:10,844
Thank you.

629
00:41:16,884 --> 00:41:18,044
<i>It's so strange.</i>

630
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:20,644
<i>Why is he suddenly acting so normal again?</i>

631
00:41:21,204 --> 00:41:23,444
<i>Shouldn't he be ignoring me?</i>

632
00:41:33,644 --> 00:41:36,084
Frankie Restaurant is looking
for a kitchen assistant.

633
00:41:36,644 --> 00:41:37,484
The hours...

634
00:41:37,684 --> 00:41:39,484
Six to ten at night.

635
00:41:41,164 --> 00:41:42,124
Where is it?

636
00:41:42,204 --> 00:41:43,444
It's near our school.

637
00:41:44,404 --> 00:41:45,244
That's great.

638
00:42:10,124 --> 00:42:11,084
Hi.

639
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:13,404
I'm here to apply for the kitchen
assistant position.

640
00:42:14,204 --> 00:42:15,524
The kitchen is that way.

641
00:42:16,004 --> 00:42:17,084
Thank you.

642
00:42:35,404 --> 00:42:36,444
Who are you?

643
00:42:37,084 --> 00:42:39,604
Well, I'm here to apply
for the kitchen assistant position.

644
00:42:40,244 --> 00:42:41,084
Kitchen assistant?

645
00:42:42,404 --> 00:42:44,564
We're short on staff right now.
You can start right away.

646
00:42:49,604 --> 00:42:50,844
Peel these potatoes.

647
00:43:19,324 --> 00:43:20,524
Hey, Si.

648
00:43:21,084 --> 00:43:22,684
I never thought you'd recover this fast.

649
00:43:22,764 --> 00:43:24,484
You got over Shancai in just a few days.

650
00:43:25,084 --> 00:43:26,084
Of course.

651
00:43:26,284 --> 00:43:27,364
What was I thinking?

652
00:43:28,444 --> 00:43:30,044
I'm completely over it now.

653
00:43:30,244 --> 00:43:32,084
Who wants such a cheap girl?

654
00:43:32,164 --> 00:43:35,764
If Lei likes her,
I'll tie a bow on her and give her to him.

655
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,284
Speak of the devil.

656
00:43:43,124 --> 00:43:44,244
Who told him to come here?

657
00:43:52,684 --> 00:43:54,244
Why are you suddenly shooting pool?

658
00:43:54,324 --> 00:43:55,164
It's been a while.

659
00:43:56,964 --> 00:43:58,324
It's all because of Si.

660
00:43:58,924 --> 00:44:01,164
I'm not sure what he's thinking.
He told us to come.

661
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:03,484
-Hey.
-Si.

662
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,564
Didn't you say
you're completely over it now?

663
00:44:09,924 --> 00:44:11,324
Why are you leaving after I arrived?

664
00:44:12,724 --> 00:44:13,964
I'm still mad.

665
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:15,764
Si, where are you going?

666
00:44:16,004 --> 00:44:17,924
Don't mind him. He's always been that way.

667
00:44:18,004 --> 00:44:19,484
Lei, how did it go last night?

668
00:44:20,204 --> 00:44:21,084
What do you mean?

669
00:44:21,644 --> 00:44:23,204
Don't play dumb. You and Shancai.

670
00:44:24,964 --> 00:44:26,564
You two were alone in the room together.

671
00:44:27,244 --> 00:44:28,284
Did something happen?

672
00:44:33,284 --> 00:44:35,444
Aren't we going to shoot pool? Come on.

673
00:44:36,124 --> 00:44:38,084
Hey, why aren't you answering?

674
00:44:38,164 --> 00:44:39,324
There's nothing to hide.

675
00:44:41,404 --> 00:44:42,844
Shancai is a nice girl.

676
00:44:44,004 --> 00:44:46,604
I admit. I almost fell for her.

677
00:44:48,164 --> 00:44:50,124
But how do I say this?

678
00:44:51,484 --> 00:44:52,964
I won't do anything to her.

679
00:44:55,364 --> 00:44:56,284
Why?

680
00:44:56,884 --> 00:44:59,284
Because I won't betray Si.

681
00:45:00,044 --> 00:45:01,604
He's a good friend that we grew up with.

682
00:45:02,724 --> 00:45:03,564
I see.

683
00:45:04,924 --> 00:45:07,724
If Si learns how to treasure
the person he likes

684
00:45:08,204 --> 00:45:11,244
and realizes that he can't
get everything he wants,

685
00:45:11,404 --> 00:45:14,164
then everything that happened
will have been worth it.

686
00:45:15,764 --> 00:45:16,804
Until then,

687
00:45:17,364 --> 00:45:19,004
I'll keep my distance from Shancai.

688
00:45:20,524 --> 00:45:24,044
He would be so happy to hear that.

689
00:45:25,564 --> 00:45:27,004
I don't plan to tell him.

690
00:45:28,204 --> 00:45:29,124
-Why not?
-Why not?

691
00:45:30,564 --> 00:45:33,284
Because Si did something terrible
to me before.
