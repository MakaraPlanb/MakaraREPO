METEOR GARDEN

00:01:27,164 --> 00:01:30,084
EPISODE 9

4
00:01:31,764 --> 00:01:32,684
Impossible.

5
00:01:33,284 --> 00:01:34,804
Why would Lei be with Shancai?

6
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:37,204
Si must have misunderstood
and gotten angry.

7
00:01:41,204 --> 00:01:42,164
We're buddies.

8
00:01:42,364 --> 00:01:44,124
Why don't we ask Lei about it?

9
00:01:44,884 --> 00:01:46,204
That may solve everything.

10
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:13,764
Everyone,

11
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:16,204
take out the lecture notes
for HR management.

12
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:17,404
Let's start the class.

13
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,284
Where is Daoming Si?

14
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:30,044
He isn't feeling well today,
so he's absent.

15
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:34,724
The notes last time...

16
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:36,884
Oh, sure. You can borrow it.

17
00:02:36,964 --> 00:02:38,284
-Okay, thanks.
-No worries.

18
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:39,404
Lei.

19
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:41,644
-Let's talk.
-It's Lei.

20
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:43,204
You know something?

21
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:44,524
He's seeing Shancai.

22
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:45,884
-Really?
-Yeah.

23
00:02:46,844 --> 00:02:47,684
Lei.

24
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,244
You know Si likes Shancai a lot, right?

25
00:02:57,964 --> 00:02:58,964
I know.

26
00:02:59,484 --> 00:03:01,204
What is there to talk about?

27
00:03:01,284 --> 00:03:02,124
Huaze Lei.

28
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:04,564
What is going on?

29
00:03:05,364 --> 00:03:06,604
Are you really dating Shancai?

30
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:09,564
No way, right?

31
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:12,684
You wouldn't do something
to hurt your friend.

32
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:17,484
Lei, have you lost your mind
after losing Jing?

33
00:03:18,124 --> 00:03:19,764
You could've gotten any another girl.

34
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:21,444
-You know Shancai is Si's--
-Ximen!

35
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:24,764
Si.

36
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:37,284
Lei, listen carefully.

37
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:41,444
From today onward,
you are no longer my friend!

38
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:42,444
Si.

39
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:46,044
Are you really going to kill
our friendship over a girl?

40
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:49,364
I'm not the one who killed our friendship.

41
00:03:51,844 --> 00:03:53,084
It was Huaze Lei.

42
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:58,924
Si, don't do this.

43
00:04:08,404 --> 00:04:10,604
Hey, did you have notes
from our last class?

44
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,524
Yes.

45
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:13,364
Can I take a look at it?

46
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:15,524
I was busy with work.

47
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:16,484
Sure, no problem.

48
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:26,084
What's wrong with Daoming Si?
Did you two have a fight?

49
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,524
Let's go.

50
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:50,084
-Want some?
-Sure.

51
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:56,044
Here.

52
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:02,444
Daoming Si.

53
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:05,844
It looks like him, right?

54
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:08,204
That must be how he's looking right now.

55
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:12,284
No.

56
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:15,004
I think something is missing.

57
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:18,084
His eyebrows are thicker, like earthworms.

58
00:05:18,404 --> 00:05:20,924
Not to mention,
he must be so angry right now.

59
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:23,444
We need to make him look fierce.

60
00:05:26,604 --> 00:05:27,964
That looks like him.

61
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:29,404
What can I say?

62
00:05:29,484 --> 00:05:31,564
I know his angry face all too...

63
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:50,524
Sorry.

64
00:05:50,604 --> 00:05:51,444
Why are you sorry?

65
00:05:53,364 --> 00:05:55,564
If I didn't go looking for you
on the beach,

66
00:05:55,684 --> 00:05:57,724
none of this would've happened.

67
00:05:58,684 --> 00:06:00,444
You and Daoming Si would still be friends.

68
00:06:01,364 --> 00:06:02,524
It's all my fault.

69
00:06:10,924 --> 00:06:13,204
I kissed you because I wanted to.

70
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:15,364
So, it's my fault.

71
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:21,404
Let's go on a date on Sunday.

72
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:24,484
A date?

73
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:28,884
Honey.

74
00:06:29,644 --> 00:06:31,684
I'm struggling to make a decision.

75
00:06:31,964 --> 00:06:35,084
Should I use the whitening one
or the moisturizing one?

76
00:06:35,884 --> 00:06:37,764
Is this worth struggling over?

77
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,804
Use the whitening product
during daytime for glowing skin.

78
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:44,044
Use the moisturizing product at night
to replenish moisture.

79
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:47,284
Good idea. I'll use this.

80
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:56,044
Shancai, you look nice today.
Are you going on a date?

81
00:06:56,724 --> 00:06:59,004
I'm going out with a friend.

82
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:01,364
Is it Daoming Si?

83
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:02,484
No.

84
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:03,444
Who is it then?

85
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:06,684
A guy or a girl? How old?
Are they from your school? Which year?

86
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:08,684
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

87
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:09,804
Try us.

88
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:11,244
We'll know once you tell us.

89
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:12,484
You're right.

90
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,044
Follow me.

91
00:07:18,324 --> 00:07:19,404
I'm coming.

92
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:24,884
You are...

93
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:28,844
Sir, ma'am. Nice to meet you.
I'm Huaze Lei.

94
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:30,084
Shancai's schoolmate.

95
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:35,164
This boy looks so adorable.

96
00:07:35,244 --> 00:07:37,964
He has such fair skin, big eyes,
double eyelids, and a sharp nose.

97
00:07:38,044 --> 00:07:39,724
You don't look like a typical Chinese guy.

98
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:41,524
I wonder how your parents look.

99
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:43,164
He's got such delicate features.

100
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:44,964
A lot like me when I was younger.

101
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:48,284
It's getting late. We need to go.

102
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:49,724
Bye, sir, ma'am.

103
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:50,644
Bye.

104
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:52,684
Go.

105
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:54,164
Hurry up.

106
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:05,684
Our daughter is just like me.

107
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:07,524
She's attracting all the right men.

108
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:09,764
One seems like a domineering CEO,
Daoming Si.

109
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:11,924
The other, a pretty and gentle boy,
Huaze Lei.

110
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:14,044
They're both great options.

111
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:15,004
Sure.

112
00:08:15,084 --> 00:08:16,884
You attracted all the right men.

113
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,124
That's why you got me.

114
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:22,164
You were the least among all my options.

115
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:24,604
Sorry about that.

116
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:26,324
My parents are overly friendly.

117
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:27,644
I hope they didn't scare you.

118
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:33,124
Not at all. I think they're very cute.

119
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,124
You're dressed a little differently today.

120
00:08:41,324 --> 00:08:42,284
Is it weird?

121
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:43,684
No, you look good.

122
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:48,324
I overslept today,
so I just put these on and ran out.

123
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:56,204
Where do you want to go?

124
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:57,644
Any place in mind?

125
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,684
I don't know. How about you?

126
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:02,164
I don't know either.

127
00:09:08,244 --> 00:09:09,244
How about...

128
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:11,004
this restaurant I always go to?

129
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,244
Let's go eat.

130
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:13,764
Okay. Fine with me.

131
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:15,044
Whatever you want.

132
00:09:33,404 --> 00:09:34,444
<i>Oh no.</i>

133
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:36,924
<i>This is so awkward.</i>

134
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:38,884
<i>Huaze Lei isn't saying anything.</i>

135
00:09:39,364 --> 00:09:42,324
<i>Should I think of a topic to discuss?</i>

136
00:09:57,884 --> 00:09:58,724
Huaze Lei.

137
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:01,924
Do you remember that spot?

138
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:11,084
Jing's poster was there before.

139
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:14,484
You were looking at Jing so intently.

140
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:16,404
-And then--
-Shancai.

141
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:19,124
Don't talk about Jing.

142
00:10:21,884 --> 00:10:24,484
Sorry. I shouldn't have brought her up.

143
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:27,764
It's okay. Let's go.

144
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,764
<i>Dong Shancai, you're an idiot.</i>

145
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:44,604
<i>Huaze Lei is obviously trying hard
to forget about Jing.</i>

146
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:46,644
<i>Why did you have to bring her up?</i>

147
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:47,844
Shancai.

148
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:54,324
This is the first time I'm on
a real date with a girl.

149
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:59,084
If I make you bored, I apologize.

150
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:01,004
Now that I think about it,

151
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:03,164
apart from Si and the guys,

152
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:04,844
I don't have many friends.

153
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:08,044
I guess I'm a social outcast.

154
00:11:09,204 --> 00:11:10,124
I don't think so.

155
00:11:10,924 --> 00:11:11,924
I think

156
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:15,044
you have the best personality
among the F4 guys.

157
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:17,724
Besides,

158
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:21,284
you're cool and laidback.

159
00:11:22,964 --> 00:11:24,524
So if you wanted to,

160
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,604
you'd make many new friends.

161
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:29,684
Wasn't that funny?

162
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:34,604
It was a pun.

163
00:11:35,684 --> 00:11:37,324
You know, you're "laid" back.

164
00:11:37,924 --> 00:11:40,004
Like Lei. Laid.

165
00:11:42,204 --> 00:11:44,164
Never mind. I guess it wasn't funny.

166
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:46,564
I like hearing you say my name.

167
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,004
Lei.

168
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:55,964
Lei.

169
00:11:57,524 --> 00:11:58,404
Lei.

170
00:11:59,124 --> 00:12:00,124
Lei...

171
00:12:07,364 --> 00:12:08,324
Sorry.

172
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:09,924
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

173
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:18,964
Why are you panting?

174
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:21,884
No reason.

175
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,244
No reason.

176
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:34,484
It's spicy.

177
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:37,684
This Thai restaurant is good and cheap.

178
00:12:37,764 --> 00:12:39,604
Especially this dish,
the Thai-style beef salad.

179
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:40,964
Do you want to try it?

180
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:46,444
You don't like Thai food?

181
00:12:46,604 --> 00:12:48,324
I can't really eat spicy food.

182
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:50,804
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,964
I should've been more considerate.

184
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:56,124
I should've asked you
what you like to eat.

185
00:12:56,204 --> 00:12:57,924
It's okay. As long as you like it.

186
00:12:58,924 --> 00:13:01,124
Why don't we order something less spicy?

187
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:02,964
It's okay. I'm not that hungry.

188
00:13:05,444 --> 00:13:06,524
It's really spicy.

189
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:08,724
Shancai.

190
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:10,204
That's for washing your hands.

191
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:17,004
You're so funny.

192
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:19,644
Are you still hungry?

193
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:21,124
Here, you can have mine too.

194
00:13:21,204 --> 00:13:22,324
Here you go.

195
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:33,764
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

196
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:34,724
What?

197
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:36,124
That's how the date ended?

198
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,044
Yeah.

199
00:13:39,324 --> 00:13:42,324
It was almost time for work,
so I hurried over here.

200
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:44,484
My goodness.

201
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:46,644
What kind of a date was that?

202
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:48,044
It doesn't sound romantic at all.

203
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:50,404
I know.

204
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:54,004
Weirdly enough, it was so awkward.

205
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:58,164
I get so nervous
when I'm around Huaze Lei.

206
00:13:58,764 --> 00:13:59,844
I become so self-conscious.

207
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:03,964
How about Si?

208
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,284
Him?

209
00:14:05,924 --> 00:14:08,284
You two dated before, right?

210
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,644
Do you get self-conscious around him?

211
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,364
We weren't dating.

212
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,444
But...

213
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:19,484
Now that you mention it,

214
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:24,044
I think I am more myself
when I'm with him.

215
00:14:26,444 --> 00:14:30,004
But that's because
I don't have feelings for him.

216
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:32,244
That's why we're always arguing.

217
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:35,964
He's so self-centered
and always pissing people off.

218
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:39,444
I don't have time to worry about
looking stupid or lame.

219
00:14:40,684 --> 00:14:41,964
Which means,

220
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:44,604
you feel more self-conscious
when you're with Huaze Lei.

221
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:49,924
That's because...

222
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:54,724
It's because I want to show him
the best side of me.

223
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:56,484
That's why I'm self-conscious.

224
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:58,204
The more I care, the more nervous I get.

225
00:14:58,284 --> 00:15:00,564
The more nervous I am,
the more anxious I get.

226
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:06,884
When you like someone,
is feeling attracted to them so important?

227
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:10,004
Isn't feeling at ease around them
more important?

228
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,564
Next time you give me your clothes,
at least make it an expensive one.

229
00:15:55,764 --> 00:15:57,724
It's getting cold. Put it on.

230
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:06,004
No.

231
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:07,284
Calm down.

232
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:10,764
The one I like is Lei, not Si.

233
00:16:43,124 --> 00:16:44,124
Hey!

234
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,244
-Watch out.
-Ma'am.

235
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:51,724
Watch where you're going! Are you blind?

236
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:52,724
Hey!

237
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:55,044
How unreasonable can you get?

238
00:16:56,044 --> 00:16:57,484
Watch where you're going!

239
00:16:57,564 --> 00:16:59,044
You knocked her down.

240
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:00,164
Take her to the hospital.

241
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:01,684
What the hell?

242
00:17:01,764 --> 00:17:03,604
It's not my problem that she can't see.

243
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:04,804
Stay right there!

244
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,684
-Take her to the hospital.
-Get off me!

245
00:17:07,764 --> 00:17:08,604
Hey.

246
00:17:08,684 --> 00:17:11,484
-You're asking for it.
-You don't scare me.

247
00:17:17,764 --> 00:17:19,484
How dare you pick on a girl?

248
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:21,164
You call yourself a man?

249
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,284
Go and apologize!

250
00:17:24,684 --> 00:17:27,724
-Take her to the hospital, do you hear me?
-Okay, I will.

251
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:31,524
Sorry about that. Are you okay?

252
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:34,204
We're going. Bye.

253
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:38,404
Are you okay?

254
00:17:39,044 --> 00:17:40,724
I'm fine. Thank you.

255
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:42,844
Your hand is bleeding. How is this fine?

256
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:44,644
Let's get it treated at my house.

257
00:17:45,004 --> 00:17:46,884
It's okay. I can clean the wound myself.

258
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:47,804
No.

259
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:50,044
-This is bad. Come to my house.
-It's really okay.

260
00:17:50,124 --> 00:17:51,164
Hush.

261
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,644
We'll treat it at my house.

262
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:54,644
This is bad. You can't do it yourself.

263
00:17:56,004 --> 00:17:58,404
<i>Why did this lady bring me to Si's house?</i>

264
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:00,924
<i>What's her relationship with him?</i>

265
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:03,804
<i>Oh no. If I see Daoming Si here...</i>

266
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:06,284
Miss, this is just a small wound.

267
00:18:06,364 --> 00:18:08,364
-I can treat it myself.
-No.

268
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,804
It's not fine. It's still bleeding.

269
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:12,684
Don't worry.

270
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:14,244
Make yourself comfortable.

271
00:18:14,364 --> 00:18:15,444
I'm Daoming Zhuang.

272
00:18:15,604 --> 00:18:16,764
Just call me Ms. Zhuang.

273
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:20,484
<i>She's Daoming Si's older sister?</i>

274
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:23,204
You look pale.

275
00:18:23,844 --> 00:18:25,404
We need to get this treated.

276
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:27,804
Mr. Liu, I'm back.

277
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:35,684
Ms. Zhuang, welcome back.

278
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:41,284
Ms. Shancai?

279
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:47,084
You know her?

280
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:50,284
Ms. Shancai goes to the same school as Si.

281
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:51,484
What a coincidence.

282
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:52,764
No need to be so awkward then.

283
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:54,804
Mr. Liu, bring me the first aid kit.

284
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,204
-And call Si to come greet her.
-Okay.

285
00:18:57,284 --> 00:18:58,164
Wait!

286
00:18:58,684 --> 00:18:59,924
Ms. Zhuang.

287
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:01,764
I just remembered
I've got something to do.

288
00:19:01,844 --> 00:19:02,884
-I need to--
-No.

289
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:06,644
Mr. Liu, clean her wound.

290
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,764
You don't seem to understand my orders.

291
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:17,684
This way.

292
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:35,284
<i>Maybe I should sneak out right now.</i>

293
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:25,364
Daoming Si.

294
00:20:26,404 --> 00:20:27,564
Why are you here?

295
00:20:29,404 --> 00:20:31,004
This is just a coincidence.

296
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,004
Coincidence?

297
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:36,164
Did you come to brag
about your new boyfriend?

298
00:20:37,364 --> 00:20:38,484
No, I'm not.

299
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:40,324
Don't get me wrong.

300
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,804
Stop pretending, Shancai.

301
00:20:47,524 --> 00:20:48,524
Who do you think you are?

302
00:20:48,604 --> 00:20:50,244
I'm not sad at all.

303
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,044
I'm already over you.

304
00:20:53,724 --> 00:20:54,684
You're hurting me.

305
00:21:05,124 --> 00:21:06,404
Is that how you speak to a girl?

306
00:21:07,244 --> 00:21:08,484
You're embarrassing our family.

307
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:11,364
Are you okay?

308
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:13,924
I'm fine.

309
00:21:16,244 --> 00:21:18,604
Zhuang, when did you come back?

310
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:24,204
What? Can't I come home?

311
00:21:24,364 --> 00:21:26,484
You haven't seen me in a while.
Didn't you miss me?

312
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:29,444
I did. I video call you
all the time, don't I?

313
00:21:30,444 --> 00:21:31,924
You only tell me useless stuff.

314
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:37,324
So what?

315
00:21:38,804 --> 00:21:40,444
I'm going to treat this girl's wound.

316
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:42,284
Wait...

317
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:52,724
Not bad, right?

318
00:21:56,204 --> 00:21:58,124
-Thanks, Ms. Zhuang.
-You're welcome.

319
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:00,444
Si used to get into fights
and got injured all the time,

320
00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:01,964
and I'd treat his wounds.

321
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,364
Why am I not surprised?

322
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,564
You must be hungry.

323
00:22:07,044 --> 00:22:07,964
Stay for dinner.

324
00:22:08,684 --> 00:22:09,964
No, I don't want to trouble you.

325
00:22:10,524 --> 00:22:11,964
What do you mean?

326
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:14,764
If I say we're having dinner,
that's what we'll do.

327
00:22:17,284 --> 00:22:19,324
<i>This family produces domineering children</i>

328
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:21,364
<i>like a production line.</i>

329
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:24,244
<i>They're exactly the same.</i>

330
00:22:27,924 --> 00:22:30,644
Si said he has an important report
to finish for school,

331
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:32,084
so he went out.

332
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:34,844
Did I hear correctly?

333
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:37,284
He isn't going to eat with me?

334
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,564
He's going to get a beating
when he gets home.

335
00:22:43,004 --> 00:22:44,124
You may leave.

336
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:48,604
Shancai.

337
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:49,684
Drink with me.

338
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:52,884
I...

339
00:22:57,524 --> 00:22:59,244
Okay. I'll drink a little bit.

340
00:22:59,804 --> 00:23:01,284
Just this glass. Come on.

341
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:30,644
Ms. Zhuang.

342
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:33,604
There's something

343
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:37,124
-I want to tell you.
-Go ahead.

344
00:23:38,644 --> 00:23:39,564
Actually,

345
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:42,484
not long ago,

346
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:45,164
Daoming Si asked me out.

347
00:23:48,124 --> 00:23:49,484
I did something

348
00:23:50,484 --> 00:23:52,364
very terrible.

349
00:23:54,844 --> 00:23:56,444
I hurt him.

350
00:23:57,964 --> 00:24:00,604
I caused him to turn against Huaze Lei.

351
00:24:01,444 --> 00:24:05,084
It's fine that he's angry with me.

352
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,524
It's my own fault.

353
00:24:09,244 --> 00:24:11,004
I'm the one to blame.

354
00:24:14,164 --> 00:24:15,364
That's why

355
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:17,844
I feel really terrible

356
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,124
that I'm sitting here.

357
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:25,204
Huaze Lei?

358
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:27,204
Yes.

359
00:24:28,924 --> 00:24:31,684
-I really--
-Hey. Speak up. I can't hear you.

360
00:24:34,604 --> 00:24:39,924
I really don't want to see
Daoming Si sad and hurt.

361
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:49,404
A person like me...

362
00:24:51,444 --> 00:24:53,164
is no good to begin with.

363
00:25:11,044 --> 00:25:12,164
That stupid girl.

364
00:25:13,204 --> 00:25:15,804
She didn't learn her lesson
after getting drunk last time.

365
00:25:17,524 --> 00:25:18,404
Si.

366
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,004
Is she your girlfriend?

367
00:25:22,244 --> 00:25:23,124
A schoolmate.

368
00:25:25,244 --> 00:25:27,604
This schoolmate of yours
is pretty special.

369
00:25:27,764 --> 00:25:29,684
She's got a sense of justice like I do.

370
00:25:30,044 --> 00:25:32,124
An old lady was being bullied.

371
00:25:33,044 --> 00:25:35,684
She and I stood up to the man
that was bullying her.

372
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:40,084
She's a loser herself,

373
00:25:40,764 --> 00:25:41,844
but she fights for others.

374
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:46,324
Who?

375
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:48,164
Her, of course.

376
00:25:48,324 --> 00:25:50,404
Zhuang, your kicks hurt, okay?

377
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:53,204
Do you miss the days
when I used to beat you up?

378
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:54,764
Why would I?

379
00:26:00,804 --> 00:26:01,644
By the way,

380
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:03,284
how's her hand?

381
00:26:04,884 --> 00:26:06,444
Why? Are you concerned?

382
00:26:07,324 --> 00:26:08,524
Of course not.

383
00:26:10,284 --> 00:26:11,484
I don't care at all.

384
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:14,244
Si.

385
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,924
Carry her to the guest room.

386
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:19,724
No! Why should I carry her?

387
00:26:19,804 --> 00:26:21,204
You brought her here.

388
00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:23,884
Just do as I say.

389
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:25,684
You can't expect me to carry her.

390
00:26:26,924 --> 00:26:27,844
This is an order.

391
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:33,284
Zhuang.

392
00:26:55,604 --> 00:26:56,764
<i>She's as heavy as a pig.</i>

393
00:27:04,764 --> 00:27:05,644
<i>What a pain.</i>

394
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:08,844
<i>How can she fall asleep right now?</i>

395
00:27:28,884 --> 00:27:31,444
That's what happened with Shancai.

396
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,124
I see.

397
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:37,444
So she's the reason
Si looks like a zombie.

398
00:27:39,964 --> 00:27:42,524
Why does he always make people worry?

399
00:27:46,844 --> 00:27:47,724
Here.

400
00:27:48,004 --> 00:27:49,804
The honey water will help your hangover.

401
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:51,044
Thanks, Ms. Zhuang.

402
00:27:51,244 --> 00:27:53,844
Sorry. I always fall asleep
when I'm drunk.

403
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:56,444
-It's okay. You can sleep if you want.
-No.

404
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:57,364
Shancai.

405
00:27:58,324 --> 00:28:00,244
I hope you'll reconsider Si.

406
00:28:05,524 --> 00:28:07,764
-Ms. Zhuang. You must be mistaken.
-I know.

407
00:28:09,084 --> 00:28:10,964
-You know?
-Yes.

408
00:28:11,884 --> 00:28:13,204
Mr. Liu told me.

409
00:28:13,764 --> 00:28:15,244
I could guess your relationship.

410
00:28:18,724 --> 00:28:19,764
You know what?

411
00:28:20,164 --> 00:28:22,444
You're the first girl Si brought home.

412
00:28:26,884 --> 00:28:28,644
You must think that Si's a playboy,

413
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:31,884
but he's actually clueless about love.

414
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,804
I know he's a snob.

415
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:40,284
That's because our parents
were always busy running the business.

416
00:28:41,004 --> 00:28:42,924
They had no time to teach Si and me.

417
00:28:44,164 --> 00:28:45,924
We got to do whatever we wanted.

418
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,884
When we're mad, we vent at other people.

419
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:52,164
That's why the two of us are so obnoxious.

420
00:28:57,924 --> 00:29:00,124
Other than Ximen,

421
00:29:00,524 --> 00:29:03,364
Meizuo, Huaze Lei,

422
00:29:04,564 --> 00:29:06,524
Si has never made other friends.

423
00:29:07,084 --> 00:29:08,884
I'll give you these if you play with me.

424
00:29:12,444 --> 00:29:15,164
I'll give you these if you play with me.

425
00:29:23,204 --> 00:29:25,724
Play with me and each of you gets a ball.

426
00:29:25,804 --> 00:29:27,204
For free.

427
00:29:27,404 --> 00:29:29,644
You must be dumb, Daoming Si.

428
00:29:30,484 --> 00:29:33,604
<i>To be frank, he didn't know
how to interact with people.</i>

429
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:37,924
<i>The more people avoided him,
the more he acted out in anger.</i>

430
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:44,244
I was much too young then.

431
00:29:46,644 --> 00:29:49,484
I didn't know how to teach him
apart from scolding and hitting him.

432
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:52,924
Shancai.

433
00:29:53,564 --> 00:29:55,804
Si is actually a kind person.

434
00:29:56,604 --> 00:29:58,004
He's not mean at all.

435
00:29:59,404 --> 00:30:01,844
He just doesn't know
how to express himself.

436
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:07,204
Actually, he's just a big kid
that wants to be loved.

437
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:21,164
<i>I'm not trying to force you two together.</i>

438
00:30:21,244 --> 00:30:22,804
<i>But I can tell</i>

439
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:26,204
<i>that you do care about him.</i>

440
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:28,284
<i>So I hope</i>

441
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:30,684
<i>you'd think about it some more.</i>

442
00:30:52,244 --> 00:30:53,204
Lei.

443
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:03,484
Who said you could talk to him?

444
00:31:04,244 --> 00:31:05,084
Si.

445
00:31:05,404 --> 00:31:07,004
How long are you going to keep this up?

446
00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:09,124
Yeah, Si. Stop with the grudge.

447
00:31:09,204 --> 00:31:11,204
We can't just disband F4 like this.

448
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,164
Shancai!

449
00:31:14,004 --> 00:31:15,044
Shancai.

450
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:19,404
Shancai, I brought some bananas from home.

451
00:31:25,124 --> 00:31:26,084
What's wrong?

452
00:31:27,524 --> 00:31:29,364
I didn't bring extra for you guys.

453
00:31:31,444 --> 00:31:32,804
Who said the F4 is disbanding?

454
00:31:37,324 --> 00:31:38,804
He'll be the new F4 member.

455
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:43,964
What?

456
00:31:48,004 --> 00:31:50,124
Shancai.

457
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:52,804
Did you hear what Si just said?

458
00:31:53,764 --> 00:31:55,404
I'm going to be part of F4.

459
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:57,004
Also,

460
00:31:57,364 --> 00:31:59,284
you're forbidden to talk to them.

461
00:32:00,484 --> 00:32:01,364
That's impossible.

462
00:32:01,924 --> 00:32:03,044
Shancai is my best friend.

463
00:32:03,764 --> 00:32:05,404
She's a friend of F4 too, right?

464
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:26,284
Si.

465
00:32:26,364 --> 00:32:27,764
How could you be so heartless?

466
00:32:28,324 --> 00:32:29,324
What?

467
00:32:29,684 --> 00:32:32,124
I'm going to do everything I can
to make them suffer.

468
00:32:33,004 --> 00:32:34,444
That's what they get for hurting me.

469
00:32:35,004 --> 00:32:38,644
Si, if you go on like this,
our friendship will go up in smoke.

470
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:42,924
I couldn't care less.

471
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,444
What kind of friendship is this?

472
00:32:46,004 --> 00:32:48,404
Since no one cares, let's just disband.

473
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:49,844
Si.

474
00:32:50,564 --> 00:32:51,524
Are you done?

475
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:53,924
I'm disappointed in you.

476
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:55,844
You people have made me more disappointed.

477
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:57,724
Stop it, you guys.

478
00:32:58,164 --> 00:33:01,044
The friendship between the four of us
should outweigh everything.

479
00:33:01,524 --> 00:33:02,764
Why has it come to this?

480
00:33:02,844 --> 00:33:04,044
Why?

481
00:33:04,644 --> 00:33:05,724
Is it my fault?

482
00:33:12,644 --> 00:33:14,084
It's your fault, Lei.

483
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:17,204
Si.

484
00:33:17,684 --> 00:33:19,884
Just deal with me alone.

485
00:33:23,804 --> 00:33:24,764
Very well.

486
00:33:25,364 --> 00:33:26,404
I will.

487
00:33:29,164 --> 00:33:30,244
Wait.

488
00:33:35,684 --> 00:33:37,004
I'll say two things.

489
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:38,724
And then I'll go.

490
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:40,244
You have one left.

491
00:33:44,404 --> 00:33:46,164
What happened is my fault.

492
00:33:47,004 --> 00:33:48,364
It's fine if you won't forgive me,

493
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:50,724
but I will still apologize.

494
00:34:02,444 --> 00:34:03,924
I'll take responsibility.

495
00:34:05,804 --> 00:34:08,724
But you and Lei
have been friends since childhood.

496
00:34:10,844 --> 00:34:13,724
I hope you won't give up
on your friendship because of me.

497
00:34:14,404 --> 00:34:15,924
You were bullied many times,

498
00:34:16,684 --> 00:34:17,924
but you never backed down.

499
00:34:19,164 --> 00:34:21,364
Yet you're apologizing to me
because of him.

500
00:34:23,084 --> 00:34:24,764
Do you care that much about him?

501
00:34:30,204 --> 00:34:31,124
Fine.

502
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:33,204
You want to take responsibility?

503
00:34:34,044 --> 00:34:34,884
Yes.

504
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:37,764
As long as you let Lei go.

505
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:39,284
Daoming Si.

506
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:41,164
If you want to punish someone,

507
00:34:41,804 --> 00:34:43,244
punish me.

508
00:34:46,364 --> 00:34:47,244
Lei.

509
00:34:56,284 --> 00:34:57,124
If you say so.

510
00:34:58,404 --> 00:34:59,604
I'll give you what you want.

511
00:35:00,804 --> 00:35:02,724
Let's play for it.

512
00:35:47,004 --> 00:35:48,244
Don't sit there.

513
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,404
It's okay. Sit.

514
00:35:51,444 --> 00:35:52,484
That's Lei's spot.

515
00:35:53,724 --> 00:35:55,404
Lei is no longer a part of the F4.

516
00:35:56,124 --> 00:35:57,804
That seat belongs to you now.

517
00:35:57,884 --> 00:35:58,724
Sit.

518
00:36:00,044 --> 00:36:01,924
Si, can you stop fooling around?

519
00:36:02,724 --> 00:36:03,724
Grow up, will you?

520
00:36:03,804 --> 00:36:05,164
Can't we just talk this out?

521
00:36:05,244 --> 00:36:06,524
What?

522
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:10,924
Why are you so angry with Lei?

523
00:36:12,364 --> 00:36:13,524
Aren't you all friends?

524
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:15,604
It's because he's my friend

525
00:36:16,084 --> 00:36:17,604
that I can't forgive him.

526
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,804
Do you guys really think
Huaze Lei likes Shancai?

527
00:36:23,804 --> 00:36:26,564
The only girl he likes is Jing.

528
00:36:27,044 --> 00:36:30,524
But Jing is getting married
so he's using Shancai to get over her.

529
00:36:31,164 --> 00:36:33,364
That stupid girl can't see that.

530
00:36:34,164 --> 00:36:35,004
So,

531
00:36:35,324 --> 00:36:37,284
are you still going to defend
that selfish bastard?

532
00:37:00,604 --> 00:37:03,564
Are you saying that Lei
is playing with Shancai?

533
00:37:04,404 --> 00:37:05,564
Is that it?

534
00:37:07,004 --> 00:37:07,844
Is it?

535
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:20,564
You know what?

536
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:22,924
-That Shancai is so annoying.
-She should hide somewhere.

537
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,324
Every day, she's...

538
00:37:24,404 --> 00:37:26,244
She's right there. Did you see her?

539
00:37:26,324 --> 00:37:28,164
HUAZE LEI AND DAOMING SI
ARE NO LONGER FRIENDS.

540
00:37:28,244 --> 00:37:29,124
IT'S SHANCAI'S FAULT.

541
00:37:29,204 --> 00:37:30,284
EVEN HER NAME ANNOYS ME.

542
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:38,924
Shancai!

543
00:37:42,684 --> 00:37:45,324
Shancai, what happened
to you and Daoming Si?

544
00:37:48,884 --> 00:37:49,884
It's my fault.

545
00:37:50,524 --> 00:37:53,684
To be fair, they aren't wrong.

546
00:37:55,804 --> 00:37:58,804
Daoming Si and Huaze Lei
are fighting because of me.

547
00:38:00,524 --> 00:38:01,484
Shancai.

548
00:38:01,564 --> 00:38:03,084
I really don't get it.

549
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:05,884
Daoming Si treats you so nicely.
Why did you choose Huaze Lei?

550
00:38:10,044 --> 00:38:11,604
I'm not sure.

551
00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:16,964
So if you and Huaze Lei win,
what are you going to ask for?

552
00:38:17,444 --> 00:38:18,324
Me?

553
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:25,404
I will just ask Daoming Si and Huaze Lei
to rekindle their friendship.

554
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:29,844
But friendship isn't something
you can salvage like that.

555
00:38:33,684 --> 00:38:34,884
Then I hope...

556
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,644
that Daoming Si will forgive me.

557
00:39:01,324 --> 00:39:02,924
<i>Everyone was having fun together</i>

558
00:39:03,564 --> 00:39:05,724
<i>during the break.</i>

559
00:39:07,444 --> 00:39:09,204
<i>Why did it suddenly</i>

560
00:39:10,044 --> 00:39:11,684
<i>become like this?</i>

561
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:20,044
Ms. Shancai, Si is not back yet.

562
00:39:22,604 --> 00:39:24,324
-Is Ms. Zhuang in?
-Yes.

563
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:38,284
Ms. Zhuang,
you have to think of something.

564
00:39:38,364 --> 00:39:40,244
This is the Red Robe tea.

565
00:39:40,324 --> 00:39:41,724
It's famous in Mount Wuyi.

566
00:39:42,284 --> 00:39:43,964
I bought it specially from Ximen's family.

567
00:39:44,524 --> 00:39:46,924
I'll get Mr. Liu to pack some
for you if you like it.

568
00:39:47,444 --> 00:39:48,724
Try those snacks too.

569
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:50,324
I can't finish them alone.

570
00:39:51,164 --> 00:39:54,684
Ms. Zhuang,
are you listening to me at all?

571
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,004
I heard you.

572
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,084
Si sent you a Joker card.

573
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,444
Huaze Lei received it too.

574
00:40:03,004 --> 00:40:06,164
So, you have to help me talk to Si.

575
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:09,444
How did Si and Lei end up like this?

576
00:40:13,924 --> 00:40:15,204
It was me.

577
00:40:15,284 --> 00:40:16,804
Then what good will I do?

578
00:40:16,884 --> 00:40:18,924
You're his sister.
I'm sure he'll listen to you.

579
00:40:19,004 --> 00:40:21,764
If you're the cause,
you should be the one to solve it.

580
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:24,884
So you mean

581
00:40:25,644 --> 00:40:28,324
I should leave,
and Huaze Lei will be okay?

582
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:33,244
I thought you're a smart girl.
Why don't you figure it out?

583
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:37,484
I'm saying only you can change Si's mind.

584
00:40:37,844 --> 00:40:39,604
Only you can end this cold war.

585
00:40:43,084 --> 00:40:45,124
Only I can change his mind?

586
00:40:47,324 --> 00:40:50,084
So you want me to challenge
Daoming Si in poker and win?

587
00:40:50,444 --> 00:40:52,044
That's impossible.

588
00:40:52,124 --> 00:40:53,124
No!

589
00:40:56,964 --> 00:40:59,124
You must use this.

590
00:41:02,604 --> 00:41:03,484
The heart?

591
00:41:22,964 --> 00:41:23,964
Huaze Lei.

592
00:41:24,364 --> 00:41:25,804
Teach me poker.

593
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,604
I'll do my best to learn.

594
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:03,284
Listen up, Daoming Si.

595
00:42:03,364 --> 00:42:04,844
Don't assume that I'm scared.

596
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:07,724
I didn't come here to surrender.

597
00:42:09,204 --> 00:42:10,244
I've made up my mind.

598
00:42:10,324 --> 00:42:13,244
I'll team up with Huaze Lei
and play poker with you.

599
00:42:14,204 --> 00:42:15,884
I might not know how to play now,

600
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:17,684
but...

601
00:42:18,364 --> 00:42:22,204
Maybe after some lessons,
I'll turn into a dark horse in poker.

602
00:42:23,284 --> 00:42:24,804
Ms. Zhuang also agreed

603
00:42:25,484 --> 00:42:26,964
that I might succeed

604
00:42:27,804 --> 00:42:29,284
as long as I do my best.

605
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:37,204
Why aren't you saying anything?

606
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,084
I hope you're not...

607
00:42:43,364 --> 00:42:45,284
Just say you like me

608
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,924
and I'll cancel the bet with Huaze Lei.

609
00:42:48,684 --> 00:42:50,524
Just say it, okay?

610
00:42:50,844 --> 00:42:51,924
Say it.

611
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,844
Let me go. You're hurting me.

612
00:42:54,924 --> 00:42:57,044
Say it. Say you like me!

613
00:42:57,604 --> 00:42:58,804
Stop it.

614
00:43:04,644 --> 00:43:06,044
Do you hate me that much?

615
00:43:08,644 --> 00:43:12,124
<i>Why are you asking a question
I have no answer to?</i>

616
00:43:13,644 --> 00:43:15,564
Why must it be Lei?

617
00:43:17,204 --> 00:43:19,004
Why did it have to be my friend?

618
00:43:29,804 --> 00:43:31,204
I must be stupid.

619
00:43:32,124 --> 00:43:33,764
Why do I have to like you?

620
00:43:33,964 --> 00:43:35,324
You're so old-fashioned and ugly.

621
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:38,164
You have a huge face,
no figure, and no brain.

622
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:45,764
Are you sure you and Lei
want to challenge me?

623
00:43:48,004 --> 00:43:48,924
Yes.

624
00:43:49,884 --> 00:43:52,524
-I'm willing to accept the consequences.
-What if you lose?

625
00:43:53,004 --> 00:43:54,804
I will do my best to beat you.

626
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:56,564
You'd better not regret it later.

627
00:43:57,484 --> 00:43:58,364
And...

628
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:01,124
I'm not going to go easy on you.

629
00:44:02,124 --> 00:44:03,324
Just so you know.

630
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:11,604
Daoming Si!

631
00:44:14,484 --> 00:44:15,684
I'm not going to back down.

632
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:18,684
I won't regret it either.

633
00:44:27,484 --> 00:44:29,204
That's the Shancai I know.

634
00:44:36,284 --> 00:44:38,164
<i>There may come a time</i>

635
00:44:38,484 --> 00:44:40,884
<i>when I will regret what I did today.</i>

636
00:44:41,604 --> 00:44:42,724
<i>But right now,</i>

637
00:44:43,444 --> 00:44:47,084
<i>I don't want Huaze Lei to face this alone.</i>
