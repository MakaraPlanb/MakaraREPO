EPISODE 41

4
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:45,031
<i>Shancai, are you with Si?</i>

5
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:47,551
No.

6
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:50,631
Why do you look so sad?

7
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:52,271
What happened?

8
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,431
Daoming Si wants to break up with me.

9
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:02,111
Dao...

10
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:05,991
Daoming Si?

11
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:08,951
That's impossible. He wouldn't do that.

12
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:11,471
He told me himself.

13
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:15,711
I know.

14
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:18,831
It must be related with Daoming Si's mom
and my dad's businesses.

15
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:23,631
I've never seen that look
on his face before.

16
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:27,391
Shancai, don't worry.

17
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:30,671
I'll think of something
once you return to Shanghai, okay?

18
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:32,311
Keep in touch.

19
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:34,671
Bye.

20
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,391
I was just wondering
why is my dad going to London tomorrow.

21
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:48,711
Si's mom must be getting impatient.

22
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:51,231
She wants Si to rush
into the arranged marriage

23
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:54,551
This is so unlike Si.

24
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:58,711
And Shancai even traveled
thousands of miles to London for him.

25
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:01,031
How can he have the heart
to turn down Shancai?

26
00:03:01,591 --> 00:03:04,551
This makes no sense.

27
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:08,151
Something serious must have happened.

28
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,631
Or else it's impossible for Si
to compromise.

29
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:12,871
Compromise?

30
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:15,631
Since he already compromised,

31
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:17,431
that means

32
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:22,071
he's going to do what his mom says
and marry He Group's daughter.

33
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:26,271
Wait.

34
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,151
He Group's daughter?

35
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:29,911
You mean me?

36
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:31,511
I'm marrying Daoming Si?

37
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:34,111
What happens to Shancai then?

38
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:37,591
Since you're involved in this,

39
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,631
shouldn't you go
and find out what's going on?

40
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:45,471
Or you can think of a way
to stop Daoming Feng.

41
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:56,711
Are you tired?

42
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:58,831
I didn't do anything.

43
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:02,351
I only ate, drank and listened to music.

44
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:05,791
You should be the one who's tired.

45
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:08,991
I am tired because I'm Lei.

46
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:19,991
We only have one pound left
after paying for the meal earlier.

47
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:24,351
This is the first money I earned
from playing music.

48
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:25,591
It's so interesting.

49
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:30,351
It's a very memorable first pound.

50
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,231
You have to keep it safe.

51
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:39,391
I kept the first 100 yuan I earned
in my diary.

52
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:40,631
I can't bear to spend it.

53
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:44,831
I have to commemorate
the first money I earn in a special way.

54
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:45,951
Wait a moment.

55
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:08,311
Here.

56
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,951
This is the only thing
that can be bought with one pound.

57
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,271
Didn't you say you want
to commemorate it in a special way?

58
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:23,271
Giving you a flower in this city
is special to me.

59
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:38,111
<i>How are things progressing?</i>

60
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:40,351
Xiaozi will arrive in a couple of days.

61
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,271
Mr. He will also be coming
from the States.

62
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:46,631
Also, the reception is confirmed
at the St. James' Court Hotel.

63
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:48,591
I've already sent you the details.

64
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,271
Ma'am, is there anything else
I can do for you?

65
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:58,031
Regarding Si...

66
00:05:58,471 --> 00:05:59,471
Go ahead.

67
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,191
Watch him. Make sure
he doesn't cause any more trouble.

68
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:05,511
Okay.

69
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:18,991
Si.

70
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:21,391
Miss Xiaozi is on the line.

71
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,231
Didn't I tell you I won't take her call?

72
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,711
She said you have to take the call.

73
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:29,231
Maybe it's something urgent.
Just take the call.

74
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,711
How are you, my ex-fiancé?

75
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:45,871
I called you so many times,
but you refused to answer.

76
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:47,831
<i>What is it?</i>

77
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:52,671
I heard Shancai traveled
thousands of miles to see you in London

78
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:53,871
and you sent her away.

79
00:06:55,991 --> 00:06:57,671
<i>It's just a family enterprise crisis.</i>

80
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,151
<i>Is that a big deal?</i>

81
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:00,871
<i>Do you have to give up on love?</i>

82
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:03,551
<i>And it has something to do
with my parents, right?</i>

83
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:05,271
<i>I'll just take care of it for you.</i>

84
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:06,991
Xiaozi.

85
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,071
It's not as simple as you think.

86
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:13,951
How is it not that simple?
If I say I can take care of it, I will.

87
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:16,351
This is between me and Shancai.

88
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:17,711
It's none of your business.

89
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:19,991
<i>None of my business?</i>

90
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,471
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

91
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:25,511
<i>I finally decided
to support your relationship.</i>

92
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:27,191
<i>Now you're just giving up.</i>

93
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:28,671
<i>How can you do this?</i>

94
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:31,791
Fine.

95
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:35,071
<i>Even if I can't take care of it
or none of us can help you take care of it</i>

96
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:37,231
<i>and you have to break up with Shancai,</i>

97
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:40,151
<i>shouldn't you at least apologize to her
and explain it properly?</i>

98
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:43,071
<i>What does your family enterprise
crisis have to do with her?</i>

99
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:44,791
It's not Shancai's fault.

100
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,111
You can't let her leave just like that.

101
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:49,071
Gosh.

102
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,071
<i>Don't come here again.</i>

103
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,711
Shancai.

104
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:14,671
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:17,791
Something happened in my family.

106
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:20,431
I have to focus entirely

107
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:24,471
on helping the Daoming Group
get through this rough patch.

108
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:28,591
I can't be selfish

109
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,271
and pretend like my family is fine.

110
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:37,551
But we agreed to face everything together.

111
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:40,191
We can all help you.

112
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,311
Our thoughts were too simple and immature.

113
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:45,471
I thought I could do that.

114
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:49,431
But I'm sorry,

115
00:08:52,151 --> 00:08:52,991
I can't.

116
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:03,071
I can't be selfish like you.

117
00:09:10,871 --> 00:09:11,711
Fine.

118
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:14,671
I understand.

119
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:18,191
I apologize for the inconvenience.

120
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:39,111
Si.

121
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:42,071
You haven't eaten anything.

122
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:44,631
Eat something.

123
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,471
What do you want?

124
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:49,551
I'll buy it for you.

125
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:54,231
Tell me.

126
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:55,311
Is that so?

127
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:57,111
Of course.

128
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:58,231
However,

129
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,151
don't give this old woman a hard time.

130
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:03,551
Even though you're old,

131
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:06,431
you should still be able
to run a marathon.

132
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:10,071
You're making jokes again.

133
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:13,071
What exactly do you want to have?

134
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:15,471
Is there anything
you can think of? Tell me.

135
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:21,591
There is.

136
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:23,751
What is it?

137
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,591
Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles.

138
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:31,711
All right.

139
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:33,751
I'll go buy it for you now.

140
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:35,231
No.

141
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:37,311
I'll go and have it there myself.

142
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:02,111
Are you sure you want to leave?

143
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,751
Yes.

144
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,431
Don't you want to see Si
for the last time before you go?

145
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:14,551
He won't return to Shanghai for a while.

146
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,671
If you want to see him, now is the time.

147
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:22,871
I've already seen him once.

148
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:25,631
Will seeing him again...

149
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:28,471
make any difference?

150
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:35,431
I'm not sure either.

151
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:39,031
I just don't want to see you
being so miserable.

152
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:52,631
Lei.

153
00:13:54,151 --> 00:13:55,111
Thank you

154
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:57,551
for always staying by my side.

155
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,671
My feelings for you are beyond love.

156
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:49,951
You're like a friend and also a pet.

157
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:52,151
You're really special to me.

158
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:05,911
We should go.

159
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,791
I'm bringing Shancai back to Shanghai.

160
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:42,151
What do you mean?

161
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:46,551
You don't deserve her love.

162
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:58,671
She's here by herself
because you abandoned her.

163
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:00,991
How can you call yourself her boyfriend?

164
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:08,311
If this is how you treat your girlfriend,

165
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:10,191
then I was wrong about you.

166
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,031
Shancai, let's go.

167
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:36,791
Shancai!

168
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:46,351
Do you still remember
what you promised me?

169
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:56,991
If you can't promise her anything,

170
00:17:57,471 --> 00:17:58,911
don't give her any more expectations.

171
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:02,591
Didn't you promise

172
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:05,111
we'll have hot pot together?

173
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:51,311
Lei.

174
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:53,951
I want to fulfill my last promise to him.

175
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:02,031
This should be our last date.

176
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:05,671
Let's spend a nice day in London
and promise not to argue.

177
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:07,511
Okay.

178
00:21:36,471 --> 00:21:37,711
It's the London Eye.

179
00:21:38,391 --> 00:21:40,951
Now I can brag to Xiaoyou
that I've been to London when I get back.

180
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:43,471
Haven't you taken a look around
since you got here?

181
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,551
I'm not here for a vacation.

182
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,631
It's a good thing
my first time here is with you.

183
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:56,631
Do you want to ride it? The view is great.

184
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,711
I'll just look at it from here.

185
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:04,111
This is how I envisioned London.

186
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,631
It's snowing.

187
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:40,951
Daoming Si.

188
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:44,791
There's something I need
to apologize to you for.

189
00:23:47,671 --> 00:23:49,391
A thief stole the bracelet you gave me

190
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:53,591
on my first day in London.

191
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:56,271
That's okay.

192
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,271
Why does it matter?

193
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:01,271
I lost something you gave me.
Of course it matters.

194
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:06,631
What if I also

195
00:24:08,591 --> 00:24:10,871
-return the meteor necklace to you?
-You can't do that.

196
00:24:12,271 --> 00:24:13,111
Shancai.

197
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:17,551
Everything I gave you
since we got to know each other

198
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:18,991
is yours.

199
00:24:19,511 --> 00:24:20,711
You can't give them back to me.

200
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:21,711
Okay?

201
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,431
Okay.

202
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:38,311
Give me your phone.

203
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:40,991
Why?

204
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:42,311
Just give it to me.

205
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:53,391
That guy, "I Call the Shots,"

206
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:56,631
has prepared to give you this gift
since a long time ago.

207
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:02,151
"Meteor Garden"?

208
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:05,391
No. I want to place it here.

209
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:10,111
Your taste is really different
from normal people.

210
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:12,671
Don't you know that already?

211
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:18,311
I want to place it here.

212
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:21,151
Isn't it nice to place it over there?

213
00:25:22,431 --> 00:25:24,631
This is my Meteor Garden.
I can put it wherever I want.

214
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:27,151
I think it's better here.

215
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:29,431
No, place it here.

216
00:25:30,271 --> 00:25:31,871
-Give it to me. I'll move it.
-No.

217
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:51,231
Shancai.

218
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,111
Si.

219
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:58,031
Ms. Yue.

220
00:25:58,471 --> 00:25:59,591
You know Shancai?

221
00:26:01,871 --> 00:26:04,391
She came to eat Eight Treasure
Spicy Noodles before.

222
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:06,711
Hi, Ms. Yue.

223
00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:12,551
Turns out the boy
you're looking for is Si.

224
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:17,311
Shancai, you found Si.

225
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:19,831
Si, do you know?

226
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,991
That day, when Shancai walked in,

227
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:26,511
she looked so tired and helpless.

228
00:26:27,511 --> 00:26:29,231
But when she talked about

229
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:31,911
coming to London
to look for her boyfriend,

230
00:26:32,111 --> 00:26:35,351
her eyes were full of love.

231
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,311
I'm still so moved about it now.

232
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,951
Then are you here today to celebrate?

233
00:26:42,031 --> 00:26:44,151
Celebrate your reunion in London?

234
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:47,671
Yes.

235
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:51,271
We're celebrating the best day
we've ever had together.

236
00:26:51,551 --> 00:26:52,511
Ms. Yue.

237
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:54,511
Please give us the most sumptuous hot pot.

238
00:26:55,271 --> 00:26:56,511
No problem.

239
00:26:57,071 --> 00:26:58,831
Go and have a seat.

240
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:08,511
Here.

241
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:12,551
I made this sauce from my secret recipe.

242
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,831
It's not sold anywhere else.

243
00:27:13,911 --> 00:27:16,111
Try it. I'm sure you'll like it.

244
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,231
It's really good.

245
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:26,431
It's really good.

246
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,511
I'm glad you like it.

247
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:31,311
I'm so happy right now.

248
00:27:31,471 --> 00:27:33,151
Si has a girlfriend already.

249
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:40,311
It's my treat today.

250
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:41,471
-Ms. Yue.
-Yes.

251
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:42,751
You can't treat us.

252
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:45,351
I asked Shancai to eat hot pot with me.

253
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:46,511
It's my treat.

254
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:49,671
Then I'll treat you next time.

255
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:51,791
There's no next time.

256
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:57,591
You're leaving London so soon?

257
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:00,311
I'm going back to Shanghai tomorrow.

258
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:04,551
Gosh. That's such a shame.

259
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:08,111
I won't treat you then.
His family is rich anyway.

260
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:11,191
Enjoy your quality time together.

261
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:14,271
Take your time and enjoy yourselves.

262
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:29,871
There are so many delicious foods.

263
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:32,591
Which one should I try first?

264
00:28:33,151 --> 00:28:34,511
I'll have some meat first.

265
00:28:38,631 --> 00:28:41,511
This steak is so delicious.
How can it be this good?

266
00:28:41,711 --> 00:28:42,991
I'm so happy today.

267
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:47,551
Every time I see you eat,
I feel like the food tastes even better.

268
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:50,151
They really taste good.

269
00:28:57,511 --> 00:28:58,511
It's so delicious.

270
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:02,551
I really like watching you eat.

271
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:05,391
It feels like everything
is especially delicious

272
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:06,871
when you're eating it.

273
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:11,391
Because it's so nice to eat good food.

274
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:12,791
Is that so?

275
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:15,391
Yes.

276
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:17,071
Try it yourself.

277
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:19,191
Okay.

278
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:32,511
Is it good?

279
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:35,511
It's really good.

280
00:29:37,431 --> 00:29:39,871
Why didn't I notice how good
these tasted before?

281
00:29:41,671 --> 00:29:44,791
Because you didn't care
about these things before.

282
00:29:48,951 --> 00:29:49,791
You're right.

283
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:53,391
I didn't care
about a lot of things before.

284
00:29:54,111 --> 00:29:55,671
I didn't care about what tastes good,

285
00:29:57,071 --> 00:29:58,871
which type of weather is best for a date,

286
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:02,191
whether that person likes me,

287
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,991
whether the person who likes me is happy.

288
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:11,031
Or whether someone is thinking of me
and missing me.

289
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:16,151
Until I met that girl called Shancai.

290
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,351
Daoming Si!

291
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:32,591
That's when I realized
I care about so many things.

292
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:42,871
What about now?

293
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:46,511
Do you still care about her?

294
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:53,511
I care about her so much.

295
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:00,991
But I don't know
how to protect her anymore.

296
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:05,511
All right.

297
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:09,991
Stop it.

298
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:16,511
This is so unlike you.

299
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:29,151
Daoming Si.

300
00:31:31,551 --> 00:31:32,711
Please...

301
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:40,231
Can you give me a bad boy expression?

302
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:46,951
Let's go back to when I first met you.

303
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:50,591
<i>That self-centered,</i>

304
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:52,911
God's gift to mankind,

305
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:56,151
most arrogant

306
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:00,031
and the coolest Daoming Si.

307
00:32:03,951 --> 00:32:04,791
All right.

308
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:07,391
So that's what you like.

309
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:09,231
You asked for it.

310
00:32:10,191 --> 00:32:11,631
Yes, I did.

311
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:14,311
Dong Shancai. You're a stupid girl.

312
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,031
I command you
to finish everything in this hot pot.

313
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:19,271
Serve me some food and a bowl of soup too.

314
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:21,911
You're so annoying.

315
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:25,031
Why should I listen to you?

316
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,391
Nonsense. Do whatever I say.

317
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,191
I can't do it.

318
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:30,711
You can't do it?

319
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,151
Do you want to die?

320
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:34,231
Sorry.

321
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:35,511
"Sorry"?

322
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:36,551
Are you apologizing?

323
00:32:38,511 --> 00:32:39,711
You can make that assumption.

324
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:42,671
-If apologies work,
-If apologies work,

325
00:32:42,751 --> 00:32:44,511
-why do we need the police?
-why do we need the police?

326
00:32:47,671 --> 00:32:48,831
It's so funny.

327
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:52,631
I've got tears in my eyes
from laughing so hard.

328
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:11,311
-Ms. Yue.
-Yes?

329
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:14,271
Yes?

330
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:20,591
I want to have
an Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles.

331
00:33:21,391 --> 00:33:23,591
Sure. I'll make some now.

332
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:25,071
Ms. Yue.

333
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:29,191
The creator of Eight Treasure
Spicy Noodles is right in front of me.

334
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:33,391
So she is the one.

335
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:42,311
I want to eat the noodles

336
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,351
she makes for the last time.

337
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:47,551
For the last time?

338
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:16,071
Ms. Yue.

339
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:17,551
Try it.

340
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:19,911
This is Shancai's Eight Treasure
Spicy Noodles.

341
00:34:20,071 --> 00:34:21,871
This kind of flavor is her specialty.

342
00:34:24,191 --> 00:34:25,231
Okay.

343
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:39,871
The taste is so unique.

344
00:34:40,231 --> 00:34:42,791
It should be sweet and spicy.

345
00:34:42,871 --> 00:34:44,031
How come it also

346
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:47,391
tastes sour and a little bitter?

347
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:53,071
Did you add pineapples?

348
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:54,071
Yes.

349
00:34:54,631 --> 00:34:55,671
How did you think of that?

350
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:02,511
I...

351
00:35:05,911 --> 00:35:07,511
Based on my personal experiences.

352
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:12,151
Maybe that's the kind of memory
I gave Shancai.

353
00:35:16,111 --> 00:35:17,071
Ms. Yue.

354
00:35:18,071 --> 00:35:20,391
Can you stop selling
Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles?

355
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:23,631
I can't handle

356
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:26,191
just hearing the name.

357
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:32,591
Why?

358
00:35:38,111 --> 00:35:39,511
Because starting tomorrow,

359
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:42,911
I'll be leaving this girl.

360
00:35:49,151 --> 00:35:50,671
That's such a shame.

361
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:54,631
Let's eat.

362
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:36,311
Are you cold?

363
00:36:55,831 --> 00:36:56,831
I feel like

364
00:36:58,151 --> 00:37:00,231
this day went by too fast.

365
00:37:04,191 --> 00:37:05,511
As fast as the blink of an eye.

366
00:37:07,031 --> 00:37:08,231
As slow as a lifetime.

367
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:15,271
It would be nice

368
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:18,151
if we can spend our lifetime like this.

369
00:37:21,111 --> 00:37:22,271
Then let's make a deal.

370
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,231
We'll spend each day like this
in our next lifetime, okay?

371
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:37,111
It's almost dawn.

372
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:41,151
You should head home.

373
00:37:45,311 --> 00:37:46,391
I'll walk with you.

374
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:50,911
Okay.

375
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:45,071
<i>London bridge is falling down</i>

376
00:38:45,151 --> 00:38:46,711
<i>Falling down</i>

377
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:48,151
<i>Falling down</i>

378
00:38:48,231 --> 00:38:51,911
<i>London bridge is falling down</i>

379
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:53,791
<i>Falling down</i>

380
00:38:53,871 --> 00:38:55,471
<i>Falling down</i>

381
00:38:55,551 --> 00:38:58,231
If you continue singing,
London Bridge will really fall down.

382
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:00,991
Then let it fall.

383
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:04,311
I don't care even if it does.

384
00:39:15,151 --> 00:39:16,071
Well...

385
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:19,391
Let's go our separate ways here.

386
00:39:23,991 --> 00:39:24,911
Okay.

387
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:29,071
You...

388
00:39:31,551 --> 00:39:33,671
Take a good care of yourself.

389
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:39,511
Shouldn't I be the one telling you that?

390
00:39:44,631 --> 00:39:45,551
Go.

391
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:54,071
You go first.

392
00:40:00,391 --> 00:40:01,791
I want to see you leaving first.

393
00:40:02,631 --> 00:40:03,631
You go first.

394
00:40:06,351 --> 00:40:07,231
All right.

395
00:40:11,311 --> 00:40:12,591
Then I'll go first.

396
00:41:17,871 --> 00:41:18,951
Daoming Si!

397
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:28,191
Daoming Si!

398
00:43:21,911 --> 00:43:23,151
Why are you here?

399
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:27,031
Didn't you promise not to see Si anymore?

400
00:43:27,751 --> 00:43:29,391
And that I won't be seeing you again.

401
00:43:32,951 --> 00:43:35,031
Can you let me see Daoming Si again?

402
00:43:36,151 --> 00:43:37,511
I really miss him.
