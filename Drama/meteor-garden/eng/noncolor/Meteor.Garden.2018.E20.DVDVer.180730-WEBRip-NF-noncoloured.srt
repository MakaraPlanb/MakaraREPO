00:01:27,258 --> 00:01:30,178
EPISODE 20

4
00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:34,778
All right. Done. Take a look.

5
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,858
This one won't do. I look so ugly here.

6
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,378
The cookie looks so ugly in this one.

7
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:46,618
This one won't do either.

8
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:49,418
Both the cookie and I look so ugly.

9
00:01:49,498 --> 00:01:51,258
Help me take more photos later.

10
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:53,818
What's so good about this cookie?

11
00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:54,898
Has it been blessed?

12
00:01:56,178 --> 00:01:57,178
Shancai gave it to him.

13
00:01:59,098 --> 00:02:01,578
The most precious happy face
was eaten by you, you jerk.

14
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:03,418
Damn it.

15
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:10,938
Look at this. Does it look like me?

16
00:02:11,018 --> 00:02:11,978
Look at this one.

17
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,298
And this one.

18
00:02:23,498 --> 00:02:24,738
I like this one the most.

19
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:29,898
Look. Does it look like me?

20
00:02:32,538 --> 00:02:33,818
Yes, it does.

21
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:36,898
I think Shancai is following
the flow of abstract consciousness.

22
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:38,618
She pursues a close resemblance,

23
00:02:38,698 --> 00:02:40,258
not an accurate representation.

24
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:45,418
How were things with you two yesterday?

25
00:02:46,538 --> 00:02:48,258
Did anything groundbreaking happen?

26
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:54,658
We just broke thin ground.

27
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:57,578
How thin?

28
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,418
We watched the stars together.

29
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:01,498
And we even kissed.

30
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:02,898
-What?
-What?

31
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:08,058
It's really thin.

32
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,418
Si, are you really a man?

33
00:03:10,498 --> 00:03:11,538
Hey.

34
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:13,498
I like it. So what?

35
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:15,458
I didn't ask you to do the same.

36
00:03:42,898 --> 00:03:44,298
Ma'am, what can I do for you?

37
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,418
I thought it was still too early
to implement that plan.

38
00:03:50,218 --> 00:03:51,458
But I think it's time.

39
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,818
Do it.

40
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:56,898
All right. Si's graduating soon anyway.

41
00:03:57,058 --> 00:03:58,738
It's good for him
to choose his path sooner.

42
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:00,538
Yes. Contact them immediately.

43
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:01,658
All right.

44
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:11,978
Five million dollars?

45
00:04:12,138 --> 00:04:14,178
Daoming Si's mom wants to give
you five million yuan?

46
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:15,458
That's a big dowry.

47
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:20,178
What are you talking about?

48
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,018
She gave me five million yuan

49
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:23,978
to stay away from Daoming Si.

50
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:26,858
She's gone too far.

51
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:29,378
-Who gave her the right to do that?
-That's right.

52
00:04:29,498 --> 00:04:31,098
I'm not her employee.

53
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:34,098
So refusing this money

54
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:36,258
means you're refusing to break up
with Daoming Si?

55
00:04:36,578 --> 00:04:37,418
Yes.

56
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,538
No.

57
00:04:41,178 --> 00:04:42,458
I don't know.

58
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,058
Shancai.

59
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:46,938
Actually, regardless of who you choose,

60
00:04:47,258 --> 00:04:48,378
I just hope you're happy.

61
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:53,538
You have no idea how infuriating
Daoming Si's mom was.

62
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:57,778
There are really people who you'd want
to kick when they open their mouths.

63
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:00,818
Welcome to our store.

64
00:05:13,018 --> 00:05:13,858
Hi, Shancai.

65
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:17,138
The president asked me
to give this to you.

66
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:36,298
"Miss Shancai, you're cordially invited

67
00:05:36,578 --> 00:05:38,098
to Maple Hotel

68
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:40,658
Jingan Temple Main Branch,
VIP Room at 2:00 p.m.

69
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:42,658
From Daoming Feng."

70
00:05:44,898 --> 00:05:46,018
What does she want this time?

71
00:05:46,778 --> 00:05:48,618
If she wants to see Shancai,
she can come here.

72
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:51,938
She would like to discuss
yours and Si's future there.

73
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:53,418
The car is waiting outside.

74
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:17,058
Shancai.

75
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:21,898
You can do it.

76
00:06:51,298 --> 00:06:52,218
This way, please.

77
00:07:05,378 --> 00:07:07,218
<i>Dong Shancai, don't embarrass yourself.</i>

78
00:07:07,618 --> 00:07:08,938
<i>There's nothing to be afraid of.</i>

79
00:07:13,618 --> 00:07:14,498
Let go of me!

80
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:16,618
Why did you bastards bring me here?

81
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:21,618
You told me my sister's back

82
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:23,578
for a blind date with this annoying girl?

83
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:26,218
Hey, who's annoying?

84
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:29,538
You think I want to be here? I was brought
here and I didn't even bring my phone.

85
00:07:29,898 --> 00:07:30,778
For your information,

86
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:33,858
Mr. Tony from the salon downstairs
is more handsome than you.

87
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:37,698
Well, young people nowadays
are very outspoken.

88
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:39,978
They're impatient. That's understandable.

89
00:07:40,138 --> 00:07:44,058
I asked them both to come here today
to introduce them

90
00:07:44,378 --> 00:07:46,178
so that they can slowly
get to know each other.

91
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,378
Then we can prepare for the wedding.

92
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:50,618
Who's marrying her?

93
00:07:51,298 --> 00:07:53,498
That's what I wanted to say.
Who wants to marry you?

94
00:07:54,618 --> 00:07:55,458
Excuse me.

95
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:00,258
Please come in.

96
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:20,578
Shancai, why are you here?

97
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:22,738
I asked Miss Shancai to join us.

98
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:27,538
Miss Shancai is Si's good friend.

99
00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:30,178
I want her to be a witness
to Si's future marriage.

100
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:31,578
Shancai.

101
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:33,418
Look at Xiaozi.

102
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:35,058
She's beautiful

103
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:36,138
and talented.

104
00:08:37,258 --> 00:08:40,138
Isn't she and Si a perfect match?

105
00:08:41,098 --> 00:08:43,458
You should be happy for Si, right?

106
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:53,898
I am.

107
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:56,578
I'm happy that Daoming Si

108
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,778
can marry such a nice girl.

109
00:09:00,818 --> 00:09:02,418
Shancai, what are you talking about?

110
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:05,258
I won't marry this girl
no matter what happens.

111
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,658
What are you saying?
You want me to marry him?

112
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:10,898
You guys have fun. I'm leaving.

113
00:09:10,978 --> 00:09:11,898
-Wait.
-Bye.

114
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:12,858
Nobody can leave.

115
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:19,018
Look at yourselves.

116
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:21,538
Do you look like future successors?

117
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:23,458
Let me tell you.

118
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,298
Your lives aren't all about
following your instinct.

119
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:34,698
Let's go.

120
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:39,578
This kid.

121
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:54,258
Don't say anything. Don't look back.

122
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:56,018
-We're dead if they catch us.
-Who?

123
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,338
Hey, stop.

124
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,778
Are you crazy? Are you running a marathon?

125
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:03,898
Why is it you?

126
00:10:04,498 --> 00:10:06,538
What do you mean? You dragged me here.

127
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:07,578
Where's Shancai?

128
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:09,058
Who's "Suancai"?

129
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:17,618
Hey, stop right there.

130
00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:19,698
The weather is so cold.

131
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:20,698
I lost my shoes.

132
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:22,778
-Stop.
-Let go.

133
00:10:23,538 --> 00:10:24,458
Let me tell you.

134
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:26,938
Wearing these prison clothes
already irritates me.

135
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:28,538
You even dragged me here this way.

136
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:30,178
I don't have my phone and money with me.

137
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:31,738
I'm even barefoot.

138
00:10:31,818 --> 00:10:32,818
Are you crazy?

139
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,538
If I had any money,
I would've taken a cab.

140
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:37,138
How can my mom fix me
with someone like you?

141
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:39,458
My mom's the crazy one
to let me marry you.

142
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:40,778
You...

143
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:42,378
You can't leave.

144
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:44,658
Leave your money or take me home.

145
00:10:44,738 --> 00:10:47,378
Are you a thief?
Or do you think I'm a cab driver?

146
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:48,738
Don't think you can leave.

147
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:50,538
Hey, what are you doing?

148
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:52,458
-I...
-Get off me.

149
00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:54,538
-No.
-Did you grow up with monkeys?

150
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:56,778
If you don't get off me,
I'll throw you down.

151
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:58,698
Hey.

152
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:21,418
Shancai, get out a pineapple for me.

153
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:24,898
-"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles" again?
-That's right.

154
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:26,018
Don't you know?

155
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,698
Your signature dish
is quite famous online.

156
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:35,258
DAOMING SI CALLING FROM QQ

157
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:36,218
Why is he calling me?

158
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:38,298
Does he want me to be a witness
to his wedding again?

159
00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:49,018
DAOMING SI

160
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:05,618
Si.

161
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,818
Why did you leave by yourself after class?
You didn't call us.

162
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:19,418
By the way,

163
00:12:20,058 --> 00:12:22,418
how's the financial report
that Professor Luo asked us to do?

164
00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:23,338
No problem, right?

165
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:25,218
Yes.

166
00:12:25,498 --> 00:12:26,818
It's very easy for me.

167
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:28,738
Then why are you in a bad mood?

168
00:12:29,978 --> 00:12:32,138
It looks like you and Shancai
had a fight again.

169
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,418
It's a long story.

170
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:41,458
It doesn't matter.

171
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:45,058
We have the whole lunch period anyway.

172
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:46,498
You can take your time to tell us.

173
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:01,258
Ximen, my brother.

174
00:13:04,978 --> 00:13:06,138
Shancai, let's go over there.

175
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:14,898
Sure.

176
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:17,458
I can congratulate Daoming Si too.

177
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:25,578
Daoming Si.

178
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,458
Congratulations
on your upcoming engagement.

179
00:13:30,698 --> 00:13:31,698
Engagement?

180
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:34,098
This is your long story?

181
00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:40,978
Hey, I didn't know about it either.
My mom decided on her own.

182
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:42,698
Is that so?

183
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:44,618
Weren't you passionately holding hands

184
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,178
-while running to elope?
-Am I crazy?

185
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,898
-Why would I elope with that crazy woman?
-I'm the one who's crazy.

186
00:13:49,018 --> 00:13:50,738
I was dragged by your mom

187
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:53,218
to witness your romantic moment
with Miss Xiaozi.

188
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:55,858
I can't explain it to you.

189
00:13:55,938 --> 00:13:57,738
Then don't.

190
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,658
Just talk to your perfect match, Xiaozi.

191
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:02,058
You ran off together anyway.

192
00:14:02,138 --> 00:14:03,418
That's what you should do.

193
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:04,618
I'm telling you again.

194
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:06,778
I made a mistake. I thought it was you.

195
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:11,258
Our height, hairstyle, and clothes
are completely different.

196
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:12,418
Are you blind?

197
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:13,898
Why are you so unreasonable?

198
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,818
I called you all night yesterday.
You didn't give me a chance to explain.

199
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,138
What's there to explain?

200
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:20,778
You're the perfect pair.
Why drag me into this?

201
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:22,178
You even played me like a fool.

202
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,178
Who's the unreasonable one?

203
00:14:24,258 --> 00:14:26,338
If you like tall, slim,
sexy and beautiful girls,

204
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:27,658
why don't you just tell me?

205
00:14:30,498 --> 00:14:33,258
Hey! Shancai, where are you going?

206
00:14:40,098 --> 00:14:41,218
What were they talking about?

207
00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:50,098
I'm so furious.

208
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:51,858
It was so obvious.
He even tried to deny it.

209
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:53,858
Dong Shancai. Look at yourself.

210
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:55,658
You know they're the perfect pair.

211
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:57,258
Yet you're still not avoiding him.

212
00:14:57,778 --> 00:14:59,658
Now, look what happened.
You're a laughingstock.

213
00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:04,418
What's there to be sad about?

214
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:06,658
She's tall and slim, just like a model.

215
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:10,258
That's what Daoming Si's mom
wants for her son.

216
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:13,818
Wait...

217
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:15,018
You're...

218
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:16,778
He Yuanzi?

219
00:15:17,378 --> 00:15:19,218
Isn't that the daughter
of He Group's president?

220
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:22,738
The one who's in oil and mining business?

221
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:25,738
The only business lacking

222
00:15:25,898 --> 00:15:27,218
in our family is oil.

223
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:30,618
A commercial marriage to expand territory.

224
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:32,618
That's something she would do.

225
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:35,818
By the way,

226
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:37,338
how's Xiaozi?

227
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:38,338
What's she like?

228
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,498
Si likes the hot-headed type,
like Shancai.

229
00:15:42,138 --> 00:15:43,738
This kind of spoiled heiress

230
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:45,818
should be sweet and silly.

231
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:47,418
Sweet and silly?

232
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:49,738
She's a monkey.

233
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:50,898
A monkey?

234
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,578
She climbs anything that resembles a tree.
And she even bites people's ears.

235
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:02,218
Bites people's ears?

236
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:05,738
What kind of interesting games
were you playing?

237
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:06,938
Cut it out.

238
00:16:07,418 --> 00:16:08,378
I'll go first.

239
00:16:10,338 --> 00:16:12,418
Si's face is even redder
than a monkey's butt.

240
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:21,498
Aren't you that...

241
00:16:22,258 --> 00:16:24,138
We met at Maple Hotel yesterday, right?

242
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,378
What's your name? I'm Xiaozi.

243
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:30,698
<i>Why is she here?</i>

244
00:16:31,138 --> 00:16:32,378
<i>Is she here to find Daoming Si?</i>

245
00:16:32,818 --> 00:16:33,818
I'm Shancai.

246
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,378
Shancai.

247
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:37,538
All right. I'll remember that.

248
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:39,138
Are you looking for Daoming Si?

249
00:16:39,978 --> 00:16:40,978
Yes.

250
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:43,378
He's in the cafeteria. Just go over there.

251
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:44,898
Cafeteria?

252
00:16:45,258 --> 00:16:46,098
Okay.

253
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:48,058
I happened to drive past
Mingde University.

254
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:49,098
So I came to visit.

255
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:52,018
Exactly what kind of school
can produce such a weirdo?

256
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:53,738
Weirdo?

257
00:16:53,898 --> 00:16:56,018
Yes. Don't you think he's strange?

258
00:16:56,258 --> 00:16:57,298
I think

259
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,378
he might be from Mars.

260
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,338
Yesterday,

261
00:17:02,658 --> 00:17:03,818
I didn't have any money.

262
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,098
I lost my shoes due to running.

263
00:17:06,178 --> 00:17:07,018
I was barefoot.

264
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:10,578
Tell me. What kind of guy
would leave a girl

265
00:17:10,658 --> 00:17:12,538
all alone on the street?

266
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,578
You mean he left you all alone
on the street yesterday?

267
00:17:17,778 --> 00:17:20,258
Yes, I was so furious.
I walked an hour to get home.

268
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,338
Shancai.

269
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:27,738
Tell me.

270
00:17:28,538 --> 00:17:29,858
-Does he like...
-Si.

271
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:31,538
-Shancai's over there.
-men?

272
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:32,978
I don't think so.

273
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:34,178
No?

274
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:36,858
Hey, Monkey. Why are you here?

275
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:44,578
Speaking so rudely would reduce
your lifespan, you know?

276
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:47,658
-My name is Xiaozi.
-I don't care what your name is.

277
00:17:47,938 --> 00:17:48,898
What are you doing here?

278
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:52,618
Thanks to you,
I was in pain all day yesterday.

279
00:17:53,178 --> 00:17:54,498
Don't you care about me at all?

280
00:17:56,378 --> 00:17:57,458
In pain all day?

281
00:17:57,778 --> 00:17:59,778
You were that intense
the first time you met?

282
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:02,898
What does that have to do with me?

283
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,978
Listen, my mom can't decide who I'd marry.

284
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:09,138
Then you listen.
My mom can't decide who I'd marry too.

285
00:18:09,658 --> 00:18:12,098
But I like you.

286
00:18:15,418 --> 00:18:17,338
Monkey, what are you talking about?

287
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:19,458
Okay.

288
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:20,898
You can't fool me.

289
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:22,538
Your ears got all red

290
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:24,258
after I bit them, right?

291
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:27,138
-Now he's still putting on an act now.
-Bit his ear?

292
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,378
I'll beat you up if you don't shut up.

293
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:32,058
Daoming Si, from now on,

294
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:33,978
I'll train you properly

295
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:35,538
as your fiancée.

296
00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:37,698
We'll get married anyway.

297
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:40,218
Let's date first.

298
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:42,578
Si, how can you hit a girl?

299
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:44,458
Why would I hit a girl? Let me go.

300
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:46,418
Nonsense. You already did before.

301
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:48,338
I'm not hitting a girl.
I'm hitting a monkey.

302
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,778
Why can't you be nice?

303
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:52,658
But the more naughty you are,

304
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:55,938
the more I want to be with you.

305
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:03,938
Let go of me.

306
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:09,778
I'm not playing along anymore.

307
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,778
Whatever you do has nothing to do with me.

308
00:19:12,338 --> 00:19:13,178
Shancai.

309
00:19:14,018 --> 00:19:15,098
Wait for me.

310
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,058
Why did you run away so fast?

311
00:19:18,378 --> 00:19:19,338
What is it?

312
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,538
What are you doing later?

313
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:21,938
Why?

314
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:23,938
Hey, what are you doing?

315
00:19:24,338 --> 00:19:26,218
Let's have coffee if you're free.

316
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,538
I didn't say that I'm free.

317
00:19:27,898 --> 00:19:29,698
Let's go. My treat.

318
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:32,378
Why are you guys all so unreasonable?

319
00:19:36,618 --> 00:19:37,618
I remember now.

320
00:19:37,938 --> 00:19:39,498
You seem so familiar.

321
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,058
Do you know me?

322
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:45,018
Aren't you the special prize winner of
Chinese Cuisine Culinary Competition?

323
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:47,298
I remember Caina told me

324
00:19:47,418 --> 00:19:49,458
so many nice things about you
after the competition.

325
00:19:50,498 --> 00:19:51,378
I just got lucky.

326
00:19:51,978 --> 00:19:54,018
Even though I didn't expect you to win,

327
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:55,698
congratulations anyway.

328
00:19:58,178 --> 00:19:59,418
Seriously,

329
00:19:59,978 --> 00:20:01,258
what do you think

330
00:20:02,098 --> 00:20:03,298
of Si?

331
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:06,778
How would I know?
I have nothing to do with him.

332
00:20:07,178 --> 00:20:08,338
I'm not talking about that.

333
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:09,698
I mean,

334
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:11,818
his face got all red after I bit his ear.

335
00:20:12,098 --> 00:20:13,418
Is he a virgin?

336
00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:16,418
Excuse me, miss.

337
00:20:16,938 --> 00:20:19,858
What are you thinking asking me
such a question in public?

338
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:22,138
It's very important.

339
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:23,938
We'll get married in the future.

340
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,058
I have to know.

341
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:27,498
Since you'll be married to him,

342
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:30,218
then just ask him. Why are you asking me?

343
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:32,618
I'm leaving after I finish my coffee.

344
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,778
Actually, I've never actually
dated anyone before.

345
00:20:38,258 --> 00:20:41,298
The guys I know
are either too stupid for me to like

346
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:44,258
or they feel that my temper is bad
and won't dare to approach me.

347
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:46,858
I know my parents
would surely find someone for me.

348
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:51,538
I thought they would find someone ugly,
spoiled and full of shit.

349
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:54,538
But after seeing Daoming Si,

350
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:56,378
I think he's quite nice.

351
00:20:58,178 --> 00:20:59,618
Even though he has a bad temper,

352
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:01,538
but he's very cute.

353
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:04,378
So I've decided to officially date him.

354
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:07,018
That's good.

355
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:09,538
You can do whatever you want.
What does that have to do with me?

356
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:13,938
Sorry.

357
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:17,218
Maybe because I'm an only child,

358
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:21,098
I've been too sheltered
and self-righteous.

359
00:21:21,178 --> 00:21:22,858
That's why I couldn't
make any good friends.

360
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:23,978
Sorry.

361
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:28,898
No, sorry about that.

362
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:30,378
I was too emotional.

363
00:21:30,978 --> 00:21:32,178
You're very nice.

364
00:21:32,698 --> 00:21:34,018
You're lively, cute, and generous.

365
00:21:35,098 --> 00:21:35,938
Is that so?

366
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:38,538
Let's be good friends.

367
00:21:40,698 --> 00:21:42,258
As friends,

368
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:44,538
we have to be honest
with each other, right?

369
00:21:46,818 --> 00:21:47,778
Let me ask you.

370
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:49,618
Have you ever...

371
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:51,938
liked anyone before?

372
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,418
Not now.

373
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:57,338
Not now?

374
00:21:57,538 --> 00:21:59,538
That means you did like someone.
Tell me about him.

375
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:03,538
Well...

376
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:04,778
Previously...

377
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:08,098
There was someone who seems dull,

378
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:10,858
doesn't talk much

379
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:12,458
and likes to sleep a lot.

380
00:22:13,138 --> 00:22:15,458
What? Your taste is that poor?

381
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:17,978
Your taste is not that good either, okay?

382
00:22:20,818 --> 00:22:22,298
Then let me ask you another question.

383
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,618
Has Daoming Si ever liked you before?

384
00:22:30,338 --> 00:22:32,818
Shouldn't you ask him that yourself?

385
00:22:36,218 --> 00:22:38,138
I think he must have liked you before.

386
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,418
Even though he told you he liked you,

387
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:44,578
but has he ever told you
that he only liked you?

388
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,258
No.

389
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:48,658
No, right?

390
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:50,618
Then what if he likes someone else too?

391
00:22:52,858 --> 00:22:53,938
Is that so?

392
00:22:54,018 --> 00:22:55,138
Yes.

393
00:22:55,258 --> 00:22:56,658
Help me pursue him.

394
00:22:56,778 --> 00:22:59,258
If he's unmoved,
then that means he really likes you.

395
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:01,218
If he falls in love with me,
then he's a playboy.

396
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:03,018
Let's dump him together. Okay?

397
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:05,538
You have a point.

398
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:06,578
Of course.

399
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:08,258
Then you'll help me, right?

400
00:23:09,418 --> 00:23:11,218
It's a deal then.

401
00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:15,098
Here. Try this.

402
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:16,578
It seems really good.

403
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:20,578
No, you can have it.

404
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:36,778
<i>This is the only place</i>

405
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:38,578
<i>I can be at peace.</i>

406
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:41,938
<i>But why do I feel so sad?</i>

407
00:23:42,778 --> 00:23:43,698
<i>When I close my eyes,</i>

408
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:46,138
<i>all I see if Daoming Feng's arrogant face</i>

409
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,658
<i>and Xiaozi's excited face.</i>

410
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:51,858
<i>It's so annoying.</i>

411
00:23:52,618 --> 00:23:54,378
It's getting more and more annoying!

412
00:24:01,418 --> 00:24:02,538
Why do you find me annoying?

413
00:24:06,338 --> 00:24:07,458
No.

414
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:08,498
I don't.

415
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:10,218
I'm happy to see you every day.

416
00:24:10,298 --> 00:24:11,298
Is that so?

417
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:14,418
I don't mean it that way.

418
00:24:15,418 --> 00:24:17,058
Why are you spouting nonsense?

419
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:18,338
Your face is so red.

420
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,778
-Do you have a fever?
-Hey.

421
00:24:22,058 --> 00:24:24,698
Because the sun is too strong.

422
00:24:26,938 --> 00:24:27,938
Shancai.

423
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:30,338
Instead of chatting with me,

424
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:32,218
shouldn't you resolve
your problem with Si?

425
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:37,378
I'm not sure what to do either.

426
00:24:38,258 --> 00:24:40,218
His mom feels that I'm a stumbling block

427
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:43,618
and she introduced
a perfect girlfriend to him.

428
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:46,258
That girl likes him too.

429
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:49,018
I feel that I'm the odd one out.

430
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:53,018
You're not the Shancai I know at all.

431
00:24:53,978 --> 00:24:55,298
After everything that happened,

432
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:57,938
don't you know how strong
Si's feelings are for you?

433
00:24:59,138 --> 00:25:00,898
You should be confident with yourself

434
00:25:00,978 --> 00:25:02,778
and your feelings for each other.

435
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:08,778
Really think about it.

436
00:25:17,538 --> 00:25:19,738
You don't know how much pressure I feel.

437
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,018
<i>I want to be confident
with our feelings for each other.</i>

438
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:28,858
<i>But what should I do?</i>

439
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,578
<i>We're all powerless</i>

440
00:25:32,138 --> 00:25:33,538
<i>in front of Daoming Feng.</i>

441
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:42,218
Daoming Si.

442
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:57,018
Why did you come
to my house to look for me?

443
00:25:57,418 --> 00:25:59,178
How dare you ask me that.

444
00:25:59,378 --> 00:26:01,578
Where did you go this afternoon?

445
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:04,738
You won't answer your phone.
Do you know how long I've waited for you?

446
00:26:04,818 --> 00:26:07,298
What did you do?
Is it fun to pretend to be missing?

447
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,098
You came here because of that?

448
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:16,058
Do my whereabouts have
anything to do with you?

449
00:26:22,138 --> 00:26:23,298
Then let me tell you.

450
00:26:24,858 --> 00:26:27,458
I had tea with your fiancée
in the afternoon.

451
00:26:28,218 --> 00:26:29,298
That's it.

452
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:32,298
That crazy, overbearing girl?
Why did you go out with her?

453
00:26:32,378 --> 00:26:33,698
What did she want?

454
00:26:36,858 --> 00:26:37,858
Initially,

455
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:41,378
I thought

456
00:26:41,738 --> 00:26:42,898
she's a spoiled

457
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:46,178
and an arrogant heiress.

458
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,058
I realized...

459
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:52,698
that she's actually quite nice

460
00:26:53,618 --> 00:26:54,778
and straightforward.

461
00:26:56,578 --> 00:26:58,938
She's a thoughtful girl.

462
00:27:01,058 --> 00:27:02,058
She has a good figure too.

463
00:27:02,858 --> 00:27:04,738
-Her upbringing--
-Why are you telling me this?

464
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:11,738
I wanted to tell you

465
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:18,778
that I think you're quite a match.

466
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:23,618
It would be good

467
00:27:24,258 --> 00:27:25,778
if you two end up together.

468
00:27:27,418 --> 00:27:29,058
How about following your mom's advice

469
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:32,338
and staying by her side?

470
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:33,698
This way, everybody is happy.

471
00:27:34,858 --> 00:27:36,018
Do you understand?

472
00:27:39,898 --> 00:27:41,098
I was wrong about you.

473
00:28:03,338 --> 00:28:04,338
<i>Dong Shancai.</i>

474
00:28:05,138 --> 00:28:06,738
<i>You idiot.</i>

475
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:09,338
<i>You hurt Daoming Si again.</i>

476
00:28:10,978 --> 00:28:12,978
<i>You know you'd hurt him this way.</i>

477
00:28:14,138 --> 00:28:15,498
<i>And you've made it even worse.</i>

478
00:29:28,658 --> 00:29:31,378
Lei, I'm so envious
that you're studying music.

479
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:33,218
Unlike Ximen and I,

480
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,938
who has a lot of reports to turn in.

481
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:38,218
I have to practice the piano daily.
My hands have a lot of callouses.

482
00:29:38,938 --> 00:29:42,138
It would be easier if I'm incredibly
business-minded like Si.

483
00:29:43,018 --> 00:29:45,338
The stumbling block in Si's life is love.

484
00:29:45,698 --> 00:29:47,498
He has to do better in that subject.

485
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:51,218
Or else his life would be a mess.

486
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:00,618
Si.

487
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:05,018
Why are you drenched?

488
00:30:11,218 --> 00:30:12,378
What happened to Si?

489
00:30:13,218 --> 00:30:14,698
Why do you look so pale?

490
00:30:15,818 --> 00:30:18,298
It seems like he's struggling
in the love subject again.

491
00:30:33,418 --> 00:30:35,458
I think you're quite a match.

492
00:31:05,058 --> 00:31:08,178
Si's situation seems
even worse than before.

493
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:10,938
Should we try to understand it more?

494
00:31:11,498 --> 00:31:12,378
Understand what?

495
00:31:12,818 --> 00:31:13,698
Isn't He Yuanzi

496
00:31:13,778 --> 00:31:15,978
the fiancée Si's mom found

497
00:31:16,938 --> 00:31:20,538
to make Shancai stay away from Si
after she met her?

498
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,538
What kind of girl

499
00:31:23,138 --> 00:31:24,738
is He Yuanzi?

500
00:31:25,978 --> 00:31:26,858
This is what we'll do.

501
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,178
After submitting our reports tomorrow,

502
00:31:29,738 --> 00:31:31,058
let's deal with He Yuanzi.

503
00:31:31,378 --> 00:31:33,458
Then she wouldn't bother Si.

504
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:34,938
Then Si and Shancai

505
00:31:35,138 --> 00:31:36,738
won't have anything to worry about.

506
00:31:37,338 --> 00:31:38,698
Lei, what do you think?

507
00:31:38,778 --> 00:31:39,818
What do you mean?

508
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:41,538
You have to participate too.

509
00:31:43,338 --> 00:31:44,578
This is Si's business.

510
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:46,138
We'd only complicate things

511
00:31:46,218 --> 00:31:48,018
if we get ourselves involved.

512
00:31:50,178 --> 00:31:51,378
Complicating things

513
00:31:52,418 --> 00:31:54,018
is precisely what we want to do.

514
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:02,658
Sir, you spent a huge amount today.

515
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:04,698
We can give you a VIP card.

516
00:32:04,778 --> 00:32:06,538
Can you please fill out your information?

517
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:08,978
No, thanks.

518
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:19,378
I, Ximen,

519
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:20,818
ended up fighting...

520
00:32:21,938 --> 00:32:24,138
over dolls from claw toy-grabber machines
with some brats.

521
00:32:24,618 --> 00:32:25,698
It's the same for me.

522
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:28,178
I ended up becoming an assistant.

523
00:32:29,018 --> 00:32:29,858
Hey.

524
00:32:34,858 --> 00:32:36,218
Why is there no Durian King doll?

525
00:32:36,378 --> 00:32:37,858
Go and get me one.

526
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:39,418
Hey, aren't these enough?

527
00:32:40,498 --> 00:32:43,418
You asked me to come out
when I was so comfortable at home.

528
00:32:43,698 --> 00:32:45,338
And now I'm not enjoying myself.

529
00:32:45,658 --> 00:32:46,938
Why are you doing this?

530
00:32:47,018 --> 00:32:48,938
I'll buy all of them for you, okay?

531
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:50,778
No. You have to get it
from the claw machine.

532
00:32:50,858 --> 00:32:51,698
It's more meaningful.

533
00:32:54,658 --> 00:32:56,338
All right. I'll do it now.

534
00:32:59,738 --> 00:33:01,018
Have you completed your mission?

535
00:33:01,098 --> 00:33:03,938
Miss, all their C cup bras are here.

536
00:33:04,578 --> 00:33:06,058
Don't ask me to exchange them anymore.

537
00:33:11,058 --> 00:33:12,218
No limited edition style?

538
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:13,498
Then I don't want them.

539
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:15,018
Are you kidding me?

540
00:33:15,098 --> 00:33:16,618
Let's get things clear, okay?

541
00:33:16,698 --> 00:33:18,018
You guys asked me to come out.

542
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:19,818
If you can't fulfill my expectations,

543
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,938
then I'll go to Daoming Si.

544
00:33:22,018 --> 00:33:23,218
Don't.

545
00:33:23,618 --> 00:33:25,298
Which style do you want? I'll buy it.

546
00:33:25,978 --> 00:33:26,818
Really?

547
00:33:27,618 --> 00:33:30,298
Then wear it for me.

548
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,538
Quit playing around.

549
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:37,578
I'm not asking you to strip.

550
00:33:37,658 --> 00:33:39,298
Just try wearing it.

551
00:33:40,578 --> 00:33:42,218
Is this enough?

552
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:46,738
Why is there no smiling Durian King doll?

553
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:48,298
I remember there was one in there.

554
00:33:48,578 --> 00:33:49,498
Smile.

555
00:33:53,538 --> 00:33:55,098
Is there such a thing?

556
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:57,738
You two are so boring.

557
00:33:58,178 --> 00:33:59,298
I'm going to find Daoming Si.

558
00:34:04,898 --> 00:34:06,298
Hi, this is your White Jasmine Dew.

559
00:34:07,098 --> 00:34:08,538
This isn't White Jasmine Dew, is it?

560
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:10,978
Sorry.

561
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:14,738
Sorry about that.

562
00:34:17,618 --> 00:34:19,538
Shancai, what's the matter?

563
00:34:19,978 --> 00:34:21,418
You look so pale.

564
00:34:21,498 --> 00:34:23,138
And you're so absent-minded.

565
00:34:25,698 --> 00:34:26,658
It's nothing.

566
00:34:26,938 --> 00:34:28,898
I stayed up late
doing homework last night.

567
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:42,178
<i>Xiaozi suits Si better than me.</i>

568
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:44,658
<i>His mom would be all quiet now.</i>

569
00:34:45,218 --> 00:34:46,298
<i>This is a good thing.</i>

570
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:47,298
<i>Dong Shancai.</i>

571
00:34:47,538 --> 00:34:49,418
<i>You should be happy for them.</i>

572
00:34:51,178 --> 00:34:52,138
Shancai.

573
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:54,978
Xiaozi.

574
00:34:55,538 --> 00:34:57,578
I brought my two assistants along
to see you.

575
00:35:02,138 --> 00:35:04,338
-Ximen.
-Shancai, Xiaoyou.

576
00:35:05,218 --> 00:35:07,298
Finally, there's a cute girl.

577
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:12,178
What are you three doing?

578
00:35:12,258 --> 00:35:14,538
What else? Dating.

579
00:35:15,578 --> 00:35:16,858
Dating?

580
00:35:16,938 --> 00:35:18,578
I don't know why they asked me
to come out.

581
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:24,098
This is a bad decision.

582
00:35:24,658 --> 00:35:26,258
We stayed at the arcade all afternoon.

583
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:27,738
Then we watched a movie.

584
00:35:28,618 --> 00:35:30,578
Then we went around Nanjing West Road.

585
00:35:30,738 --> 00:35:31,818
She hasn't had enough.

586
00:35:35,618 --> 00:35:36,818
She asked me to buy her bras.

587
00:35:40,498 --> 00:35:42,618
Shancai, do you want them?

588
00:35:42,698 --> 00:35:44,218
There are many styles to choose from.

589
00:35:45,098 --> 00:35:46,058
There's no need.

590
00:35:46,698 --> 00:35:48,458
I would rather shop
with Xiaoyou for a year

591
00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:50,898
than see this terrible girl again.

592
00:35:53,578 --> 00:35:56,538
Then when do you plan to date me?

593
00:35:58,538 --> 00:36:01,618
But why are you doing this?

594
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:03,498
Listen.

595
00:36:03,978 --> 00:36:07,658
At first, I thought I was too charming,
they couldn't help themselves.

596
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:08,938
Then I realized

597
00:36:09,658 --> 00:36:11,578
they wanted me to give up on Si.

598
00:36:12,138 --> 00:36:13,458
How did you know?

599
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:17,498
Actually, you did well.

600
00:36:17,818 --> 00:36:19,098
But I don't like you.

601
00:36:19,298 --> 00:36:20,418
No matter what you do,

602
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:21,978
I won't like you.

603
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:24,618
Let me tell you.

604
00:36:25,778 --> 00:36:27,698
He gets tired easily.

605
00:36:27,778 --> 00:36:29,658
He doesn't know how to enjoy himself.

606
00:36:30,378 --> 00:36:31,618
But both of them

607
00:36:31,978 --> 00:36:33,498
are especially great to hang out with.

608
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:34,978
How boring.

609
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:37,218
I don't think it's fun at all.

610
00:36:42,298 --> 00:36:44,378
Never mind. I'll go ahead.

611
00:36:44,938 --> 00:36:47,018
I'll leave the best supporting actors
to you.

612
00:36:48,098 --> 00:36:49,338
See you next time. Bye.

613
00:36:51,698 --> 00:36:53,498
Hey, who's a supporting actor?

614
00:36:54,058 --> 00:36:55,858
In my world, I'm always the main actor.

615
00:37:02,898 --> 00:37:05,178
Why do you all look so sad?

616
00:37:07,738 --> 00:37:09,218
What can I get you?

617
00:37:09,818 --> 00:37:11,578
-Alcohol.
-Sure. Please wait.

618
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:13,658
Shancai, you can't drink.

619
00:37:20,058 --> 00:37:21,418
Hey, we can't act this way.

620
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,098
Our plan just failed.

621
00:37:23,498 --> 00:37:25,338
Why are we so down?

622
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:29,018
What's the matter?
Is it because of that pretty girl?

623
00:37:29,098 --> 00:37:30,178
Pretty?

624
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:31,778
She looks like E.T.

625
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:35,578
Didn't you see how Monkey

626
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:37,338
played us today?

627
00:37:37,978 --> 00:37:38,938
But...

628
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:42,218
why are you doing something
you don't like for Daoming Si?

629
00:37:42,778 --> 00:37:43,618
Because of you.

630
00:37:43,898 --> 00:37:45,338
Are you stupid?

631
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,738
You know how Si is.

632
00:37:49,218 --> 00:37:52,218
He might even back out of his marriage.
We're doing everything to help you,

633
00:37:52,298 --> 00:37:55,138
yet you just want to give up.
Do you know how sad Si is?

634
00:37:56,378 --> 00:37:57,258
By the way,

635
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:58,858
on that rainy night,

636
00:37:58,938 --> 00:38:00,898
why did Si come home all drenched?

637
00:38:01,618 --> 00:38:02,618
What happened?

638
00:38:04,898 --> 00:38:06,098
I told him

639
00:38:06,178 --> 00:38:07,898
to date Xiaozi

640
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:09,738
and said that they're a good match.

641
00:38:10,378 --> 00:38:11,618
How can you say that?

642
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:13,618
Have you ever considered
how Si would feel?

643
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:17,418
Have you ever considered how I feel?

644
00:38:17,898 --> 00:38:20,058
I can't change their family.

645
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:22,578
His mom even went to my house
with five million yuan

646
00:38:22,698 --> 00:38:24,578
so that I'll break up with him.

647
00:38:25,378 --> 00:38:27,338
Have you ever been insulted that way?

648
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:28,898
Five million yuan?

649
00:38:29,018 --> 00:38:29,978
Did you take it?

650
00:38:31,418 --> 00:38:32,538
Of course not.

651
00:38:32,618 --> 00:38:34,058
You should tell Si.

652
00:38:34,218 --> 00:38:35,658
How else would he know?

653
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:40,218
Stop it.

654
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:41,898
Daoming Feng is his mom.

655
00:38:41,978 --> 00:38:43,378
What else can I do?

656
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,098
What can I do to satisfy all of you?

657
00:38:49,138 --> 00:38:50,458
All right.

658
00:38:51,018 --> 00:38:52,618
We'll stop, okay?

659
00:38:53,658 --> 00:38:54,538
All right.

660
00:38:55,018 --> 00:38:56,498
I know you have your reasons.

661
00:38:57,698 --> 00:38:59,218
Come on. Let's toast

662
00:38:59,298 --> 00:39:01,338
to the invincible Dong Shancai.

663
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:02,978
-Here.
-Hey.

664
00:39:03,058 --> 00:39:04,698
-Cheers.
-Meizuo can drink.

665
00:39:04,778 --> 00:39:05,738
But why are you toasting

666
00:39:05,858 --> 00:39:07,938
-when you can't drink?
-Cut the crap. Here.

667
00:39:08,018 --> 00:39:09,458
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

668
00:39:27,018 --> 00:39:28,298
The president is waiting for you.

669
00:39:31,658 --> 00:39:32,618
Lei.

670
00:39:33,218 --> 00:39:36,338
Some unfortunate things
happened on Si's birthday.

671
00:39:37,018 --> 00:39:39,738
I wasn't able to contact you afterward.

672
00:39:40,418 --> 00:39:42,218
-Well--
-That's fine, Mrs. Daoming.

673
00:39:43,618 --> 00:39:45,778
Why did you ask me to come here?

674
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:49,778
I watched you and Si grow up together.

675
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:53,418
I contacted Jing's family earlier.

676
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:55,178
They said

677
00:39:55,298 --> 00:39:57,218
that Jing would not
come back anymore, right?

678
00:39:58,498 --> 00:40:00,138
Why are you asking me this?

679
00:40:01,138 --> 00:40:02,378
Actually,

680
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:05,578
I heard about you and Shancai.

681
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:07,898
Shancai used to like you.

682
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,058
Because she couldn't get your affections,

683
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:12,778
she accepted Si.

684
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:14,458
Is that what happened?

685
00:40:15,018 --> 00:40:17,018
Mrs. Daoming,
I think you've misunderstood.

686
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:19,978
Si is the one Shancai likes.

687
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:23,858
Don't you understand Si's personality?

688
00:40:24,778 --> 00:40:27,258
He likes to take other people's things.

689
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:30,258
Do you remember that Spiderman toy
when you were young?

690
00:40:30,658 --> 00:40:33,538
He got tired of it
after he stole it from you.

691
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:35,178
I'm worried

692
00:40:35,898 --> 00:40:38,778
that Shancai is just like your toy.

693
00:40:39,058 --> 00:40:40,658
After Si gets her,

694
00:40:41,058 --> 00:40:42,458
he'll dump her.

695
00:40:42,778 --> 00:40:43,658
If that happens,

696
00:40:44,298 --> 00:40:46,138
Shancai would end up getting hurt.

697
00:40:48,058 --> 00:40:49,618
Si was naughty before.

698
00:40:49,978 --> 00:40:51,018
But he's all grown up now.

699
00:40:51,098 --> 00:40:52,058
He wouldn't do that.

700
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:55,578
Si has been fickle-minded
ever since he was little.

701
00:40:56,018 --> 00:40:59,418
I'm worried that Shancai will get hurt.

702
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:02,498
By the way,

703
00:41:02,778 --> 00:41:04,138
I heard that your dad's company

704
00:41:04,218 --> 00:41:07,098
is having some financial trouble lately.

705
00:41:09,658 --> 00:41:12,178
I'm not sure about that.

706
00:41:13,658 --> 00:41:14,778
I really don't want

707
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:16,738
to see your family business
get into trouble.

708
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:19,258
I'm thinking that maybe

709
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:21,338
I can help you.

710
00:41:22,138 --> 00:41:23,498
As long as you and Shancai

711
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:25,418
can start over again.

712
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:28,338
Mrs. Daoming.

713
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:31,458
Don't you think
what you're doing is not right?

714
00:41:34,178 --> 00:41:37,498
You're still young.
You'll understand better in the future.

715
00:41:38,018 --> 00:41:38,858
There are some things

716
00:41:38,938 --> 00:41:41,658
that the end is more important
than the means.

717
00:41:42,658 --> 00:41:45,338
My dad would handle our business matters.

718
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:47,338
Then aren't you worried

719
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:50,338
that Si would dump Shancai one day?

720
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:55,778
For that, I trust your son more than you.

721
00:41:56,538 --> 00:41:58,298
Toys and lovers are different.

722
00:41:58,978 --> 00:41:59,938
Regarding Shancai,

723
00:42:00,578 --> 00:42:02,658
I'd protect her as a friend
for the rest of my life.

724
00:42:04,178 --> 00:42:05,858
I'll tell you something else.

725
00:42:07,418 --> 00:42:09,458
We all know Si's personality.

726
00:42:09,898 --> 00:42:11,298
The more you want to break them up,

727
00:42:11,658 --> 00:42:12,898
the stronger their bond will be.

728
00:42:14,018 --> 00:42:15,978
I hope you won't outsmart yourself

729
00:42:16,178 --> 00:42:17,858
and hurt your relationship with Si.

730
00:42:21,938 --> 00:42:23,018
That's all.

731
00:42:23,298 --> 00:42:24,138
I'll get going.

732
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:33,898
Mrs. Daoming,

733
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:35,858
let me say again.

734
00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:38,058
Regarding Shancai,

735
00:42:38,418 --> 00:42:41,218
I'd protect her as a friend
for the rest of my life.

736
00:42:42,498 --> 00:42:44,018
I won't let her get hurt.

737
00:42:59,698 --> 00:43:01,298
Miss Heiress.

738
00:43:03,018 --> 00:43:04,138
Why are you here?

739
00:43:06,138 --> 00:43:07,098
What happened?

740
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:12,458
You...

741
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:14,938
You're crying.

742
00:43:16,098 --> 00:43:17,938
You're crying.

743
00:43:24,258 --> 00:43:25,218
Sorry.

744
00:43:25,378 --> 00:43:26,538
I'm too emotional.

745
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:29,298
I'm not sure what to say.

746
00:43:30,258 --> 00:43:31,378
Si...

747
00:43:32,938 --> 00:43:34,058
Did he bully you?

748
00:43:34,618 --> 00:43:36,298
I know him.

749
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:38,778
You don't have to worry about him. Listen.

750
00:43:39,018 --> 00:43:40,098
I'll help you beat him up.

751
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:43,658
-I once beat him until--
-Daoming Si agreed to date me.
