EPISODE 46

4
00:01:30,783 --> 00:01:31,983
-Where are we going?
-Up to you.

5
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:33,383
Can we go see a movie?

6
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:36,543
Or have afternoon tea?

7
00:01:36,703 --> 00:01:38,583
Or we can just keep
walking around like this.

8
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:50,703
Was anyone around?

9
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:51,823
No.

10
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:53,543
That's good.

11
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:56,223
Daoming Si from F4 can be seen
tripping on the street like this.

12
00:01:56,303 --> 00:01:57,583
It would be too humiliating.

13
00:01:57,943 --> 00:01:58,823
Of course it would be.

14
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:00,183
You're not elegant enough.

15
00:02:00,783 --> 00:02:01,943
I didn't mean to do it.

16
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:10,823
Of course you'd trip in those shoes.

17
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:16,303
How did you survive until today
if you're this clumsy?

18
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:20,143
Let's go.

19
00:02:20,303 --> 00:02:22,143
-Where are we going?
-Where else?

20
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:23,743
A movie? Afternoon tea?

21
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:28,063
Let's buy some shoes first.

22
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:32,423
What?

23
00:02:32,623 --> 00:02:34,023
Jump on. What else?

24
00:02:34,183 --> 00:02:35,343
Do you want to trip again?

25
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:39,343
You're too heavy. I can't catch you.

26
00:02:49,663 --> 00:02:50,503
Hold this.

27
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,343
I guess I'll have to take care of you
for a lifetime.

28
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:12,463
Don't...

29
00:03:14,023 --> 00:03:16,583
LEFT FOOT, RIGHT FOOT

30
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:18,303
Shancai?

31
00:03:18,383 --> 00:03:20,583
Gosh, I haven't seen you for so long.

32
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:22,343
Come. Let me see you.

33
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:24,583
Gosh, you're so pretty now.

34
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:30,743
You buy shoes from this shop?

35
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:32,383
Of course.

36
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,383
She's been coming here
since she started school.

37
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:37,743
She's like our brand spokesperson, right?

38
00:03:38,263 --> 00:03:39,463
No wonder--

39
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:41,383
Shancai.

40
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:44,143
Those shoes on that shelf
have all the discounts.

41
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:47,103
New arrivals are over here.
Please have a look.

42
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:49,783
Choose the best shoes for her.

43
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:52,143
Goodness.

44
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:53,863
Is he your boyfriend?

45
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:55,303
He's so nice to you.

46
00:03:56,463 --> 00:03:57,863
I'll get a pair for you to try on.

47
00:03:58,063 --> 00:03:59,023
Okay.

48
00:03:59,103 --> 00:04:00,623
TRENDING RIGHT NOW, 199 YUAN

49
00:04:02,903 --> 00:04:04,143
They look great.

50
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:06,223
It's like they were made for you.

51
00:04:06,943 --> 00:04:07,783
What do you think?

52
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:09,863
Surprisingly good.

53
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,503
Stop giggling. Come home with me now.

54
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:17,183
What are we doing?

55
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:20,463
Don't think you can get your way
just because we're getting married.

56
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:23,983
Mrs. Yu will take
measurements for your dress.

57
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,583
What were you thinking?

58
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:27,223
Look at your figure.

59
00:04:27,463 --> 00:04:29,263
No normal person would be interested.

60
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:30,383
Shut up.

61
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:38,943
<i>Shancai, you're here.</i>

62
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:52,343
You've been eating well, haven't you?

63
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:54,743
You're gaining weight
in all the right spots.

64
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:59,063
Mrs. Yu, you're saying
that I've gained weight.

65
00:04:59,143 --> 00:05:00,263
No.

66
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:02,383
You look great like this.

67
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:03,943
You seem to have a lot of energy.

68
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:08,183
I'll make you the best dress ever.

69
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:09,903
So that you can be

70
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:12,463
the center of attention

71
00:05:13,143 --> 00:05:16,063
at your engagement and wedding.

72
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:17,703
Thank you, Mrs. Yu.

73
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,303
I know I can trust you.

74
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:20,543
You know,

75
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:23,543
I've been waiting for you to come.

76
00:05:24,543 --> 00:05:27,823
I like it when you are here in this house.

77
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:29,583
Thank you.

78
00:05:30,223 --> 00:05:33,303
I'll have to learn about everything
in this household.

79
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:35,343
You'll have to help me with that.

80
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:38,823
I'm actually grateful to you.

81
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:42,143
Only you can control Si.

82
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:47,583
By the way, it's getting late now.

83
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:50,743
You should just stay here after dinner.

84
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:54,503
You can stay in Si's room.

85
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:56,743
Mrs. Yu.

86
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:58,423
How can a nice old lady like you

87
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:01,143
say something like that?

88
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:04,783
This is totally natural, isn't it?

89
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:06,223
Why are you so shy?

90
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:11,223
Also, don't call me an old lady.

91
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:13,743
You silly child.

92
00:06:18,263 --> 00:06:19,503
Are you guys done yet?

93
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,823
We are.

94
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:22,623
Si.

95
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:26,463
You can take her away now.

96
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:29,303
Come on.

97
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:31,183
What?

98
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,103
Hey!

99
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:39,223
No questions asked.

100
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:41,063
-Come on.
-You...

101
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:43,743
Did you set this up together? Hey!

102
00:06:52,743 --> 00:06:55,383
Ximen, I have a gift for you.

103
00:06:57,863 --> 00:06:58,863
A special gift?

104
00:07:01,703 --> 00:07:03,583
Not really.

105
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:06,703
I just wanted to have it with you.

106
00:07:23,983 --> 00:07:24,823
A cake?

107
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:28,623
Yes, it's really good.

108
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,183
You girls love to have things like this.

109
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:35,543
Us girls?

110
00:07:37,143 --> 00:07:38,263
Xiaogeng likes cakes too.

111
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:44,183
What? Are you mad?

112
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:48,103
No.

113
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:50,223
It's silly to be jealous of exes.

114
00:07:50,863 --> 00:07:52,543
Right now, it's about us.

115
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:55,263
We're having cake together now.

116
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:00,303
I don't really like sweet things.

117
00:08:00,703 --> 00:08:01,783
But I like you,

118
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:03,303
so I'll try it.

119
00:08:29,263 --> 00:08:30,983
This cake is like us.

120
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:32,983
It's not too sweet.

121
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:48,583
What about you?

122
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:50,623
Do you have a gift for me?

123
00:08:54,143 --> 00:08:54,983
No.

124
00:09:00,303 --> 00:09:02,063
Well, I didn't want anything.

125
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:05,623
That's not what I meant.

126
00:09:06,663 --> 00:09:08,623
I'm happy just to be here with you.

127
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:09,903
Really happy.

128
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:12,743
Okay.

129
00:09:47,823 --> 00:09:49,303
-Xiaoyou?
-Yes?

130
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:53,183
This is our first date.

131
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:55,343
I want it to be a special memory.

132
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:56,823
It was special.

133
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:59,943
I'll never forget tonight
because I was with you.

134
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:15,503
Ximen, what's going on?

135
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:17,343
You seem flustered.

136
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:22,143
My dad texted me. I need to call him.

137
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:25,623
Wait for me right here.

138
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:27,303
I'll be right back, okay?

139
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:50,143
<i>-Hello?
</i>-Qinghe.

140
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,863
Why didn't it light up?

141
00:10:52,343 --> 00:10:53,303
<i>Did it not?</i>

142
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:55,983
<i>It's probably not connected.</i>

143
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:58,263
<i>Or the wire might be broken.</i>

144
00:10:58,663 --> 00:11:00,103
The wire is broken?

145
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:02,263
<i>No.</i>

146
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:03,943
<i>I was wrong. Nothing's wrong.</i>

147
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:07,863
Install the controller onto the switch.

148
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:10,663
Turn on three from the 36th to 16th floor.

149
00:11:10,743 --> 00:11:12,583
Turn on four above the 26th floor.

150
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:15,663
Turn on everything apart from the far
left and far right above the 40th floor.

151
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:17,983
Set the time and go. Is it that hard?

152
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,343
If you can't even do this,
how can you be a part of F4?

153
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:24,623
Chen Qinghe, I'm telling you,

154
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:26,663
I, Ximen Yan,

155
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:28,303
am the perfect boyfriend.

156
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,983
But you ruined my date tonight.

157
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:31,063
You're an idiot!

158
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:53,383
Ximen, you seem distracted.

159
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,583
Are you okay?

160
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:56,503
I'm fine. They took care of it.

161
00:11:57,223 --> 00:11:58,383
That's good.

162
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:01,063
I can't even do this small task.

163
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,143
What's wrong with me?

164
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,503
I knew it.

165
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,263
Perhaps God didn't want Ximen to succeed.

166
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:16,783
They're a couple. What's wrong with that?

167
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,343
They have flowers over there.
I'll buy some for you.

168
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:21,263
Ximen.

169
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:22,783
No need.

170
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:24,503
Tonight was wonderful

171
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,623
because I'm happy just to be with you.

172
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:29,383
I never thought I would be so happy.

173
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:32,143
To be able to hold your hand tonight

174
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,183
is everything I want.

175
00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:36,063
Xiaoyou.

176
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:37,663
Wow!

177
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:43,023
Ximen, look! It's so beautiful!

178
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:50,903
It must be a surprise for a girl
from her awesome boyfriend.

179
00:12:51,743 --> 00:12:54,063
That's so creative and sweet.

180
00:13:09,543 --> 00:13:11,343
It's amazing.

181
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:12,783
Wow.

182
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:14,703
That's so romantic.

183
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:16,663
Nice job, Ximen.

184
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,023
Yeah.

185
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:28,743
Ximen.

186
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:29,983
It's okay.

187
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,823
Even though you didn't get me a gift,

188
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:33,823
we saw such a beautiful sight

189
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:35,343
thanks to somebody else.

190
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:36,903
How lucky!

191
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:42,263
Somebody else?

192
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:43,783
Yeah.

193
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:49,223
Let's take a photo.

194
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,263
Don't open your eyes.

195
00:15:13,383 --> 00:15:14,223
Okay.

196
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:15,663
Three,

197
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,063
two,

198
00:15:17,943 --> 00:15:18,783
one.

199
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:40,383
It's so beautiful.

200
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:41,823
How's that?

201
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:44,783
Do you remember when
we were watching meteors together?

202
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:50,223
I found it. Come and see it.

203
00:15:50,303 --> 00:15:51,783
-See what?
-Come and take a look.

204
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:54,023
Do you see it?

205
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:57,023
Yes. It's so beautiful.

206
00:15:58,263 --> 00:15:59,983
It'd be nice if I can see it every day.

207
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:03,743
Then close your eyes and make a wish.

208
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:05,223
Maybe it'll come true.

209
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:09,383
How would you know if you don't try?

210
00:16:11,343 --> 00:16:12,263
All right.

211
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:32,263
This gift has a special meaning.

212
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:37,543
Because you're the only one I'm willing
to trade all the meteors in the sky for.

213
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:54,543
Before we get married,
I want to give you some special memories.

214
00:16:58,103 --> 00:16:59,303
You're so bad.

215
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,023
Why?

216
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:03,783
I won't be able to forget this.

217
00:17:05,543 --> 00:17:07,343
So I guess I'll have
to follow you forever.

218
00:17:08,063 --> 00:17:09,343
Where else would you go?

219
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:10,983
You can only be with me.

220
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:13,103
I survived with all my strength.

221
00:17:13,343 --> 00:17:15,143
We can't let ourselves down.

222
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:17,823
Don't forget.

223
00:17:18,143 --> 00:17:19,143
I'll be a good guy to you.

224
00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:20,783
I'll listen to you.

225
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,143
Really?

226
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:26,223
Of course.

227
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:28,143
But I also want you
to do something for me.

228
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:30,583
Of course, there's a catch.

229
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,903
I knew it.

230
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:34,623
What's the catch?

231
00:17:38,463 --> 00:17:39,543
The catch is that

232
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:41,663
you have to be with me

233
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,503
for the rest of your life.

234
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:53,303
Guess what?

235
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:58,383
This is the happiest
I've been in this lifetime.

236
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,743
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

237
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:11,423
<i>Your Peach Red Royale.</i>

238
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:13,863
-Thank you. Come again.
-Okay, thanks.

239
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:21,223
Xiaoyou, Talent's Tea Shop
is doing better and better.

240
00:19:21,783 --> 00:19:23,823
We're going to open more chain stores.

241
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:26,703
-That's great.
-You've been a hard worker.

242
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:28,663
I want you to take care of this store.

243
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:30,823
You'll be the manager. Would that be okay?

244
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:32,903
Really?

245
00:19:33,543 --> 00:19:35,583
Thank you so much. You can count on me!

246
00:19:36,823 --> 00:19:37,823
Good luck.

247
00:19:41,503 --> 00:19:43,343
PLEASE TAKE A LOOK, FRIENDS

248
00:19:43,423 --> 00:19:45,343
WE'RE HIRING, BENEFITS INCLUDED

249
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:48,583
Your drinks are ready. Come again.

250
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:49,663
Thank you.

251
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:55,703
All of you are here.

252
00:19:57,703 --> 00:19:58,623
Ximen, you're here.

253
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:01,183
This is Xiaoyou's first day
as the manager.

254
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,423
Ximen wanted us all to come support you.

255
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,103
He also said

256
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:08,943
we have to break the sales record today.

257
00:20:12,263 --> 00:20:13,783
Thank you, guys. Thanks, Ximen.

258
00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:16,943
We're about to order now.

259
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,543
Remember Talent's Tea Shop's
signature drink?

260
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:24,623
-White Jasmine Dew.
-Peach Red Royale.

261
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,943
Talent's Tea Shop

262
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:28,103
-is the best tea in town!
-Is the best tea in town!

263
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:37,263
Ximen reminded us countless times.

264
00:20:37,823 --> 00:20:38,783
All right.

265
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:43,543
Let's find a seat then.

266
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,983
Xiaoyou was awesome.

267
00:20:58,263 --> 00:21:01,143
It was her first day
and sales reached more than 20,000 yuan.

268
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,143
Applause, please.

269
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:06,903
Thank you, guys.

270
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:09,343
This is my treat.

271
00:21:09,823 --> 00:21:11,383
-For Meizuo.
-Thanks.

272
00:21:11,463 --> 00:21:12,543
Daoming Si.

273
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:18,543
Here.

274
00:21:18,663 --> 00:21:21,303
To Xiaoyou's first
successful day as a manager.

275
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:22,263
Cheers.

276
00:21:22,343 --> 00:21:23,863
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

277
00:21:29,383 --> 00:21:32,823
I invented this new milk tea
using the best tea leaves.

278
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:36,623
Can you guys guess
what kind of tea leaves I used?

279
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:37,983
Lei, you first.

280
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:40,383
Mine is Moqi. It's really good.

281
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:41,503
Yes.

282
00:21:45,223 --> 00:21:46,103
Meizuo.

283
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:50,383
This is Tungting Kiwi.

284
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:52,543
You're right.

285
00:22:03,783 --> 00:22:06,223
This is probably Four Seasons Green Tea.

286
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:08,423
No.

287
00:22:10,023 --> 00:22:11,183
Shancai, try it for me.

288
00:22:19,343 --> 00:22:20,743
It's green tea with Yakult.

289
00:22:21,303 --> 00:22:22,623
Shancai got it.

290
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:25,303
Shancai is an expert.

291
00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:27,303
She managed to win Si's heart over.

292
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:29,503
Who would've thought that

293
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:34,303
the big-eyed, stubby girl with no grace

294
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:38,143
would look so pretty and cute now?

295
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:41,943
I wish I could kiss her.

296
00:22:48,423 --> 00:22:51,743
I won't be able to see
Shancai anymore abroad.

297
00:22:56,343 --> 00:22:57,343
Are you jealous?

298
00:22:58,063 --> 00:22:58,943
Yes.

299
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:00,783
I am jealous.

300
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,383
Especially of you.

301
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:04,863
Then I have to kiss her.

302
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:12,143
Hey! Watch it!

303
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:13,223
-Lei!
-Calm down.

304
00:23:13,303 --> 00:23:15,423
-What's your problem?
-It was just a kiss.

305
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:16,623
It's fine.

306
00:23:17,183 --> 00:23:18,903
Then I'll kiss Xiaoyou then!

307
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:20,543
Come here, Xiaoyou.

308
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:21,663
Calm down.

309
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:22,743
Stop it!

310
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:24,863
-Come here, Xiaoyou!
-That's enough! Cut it out!

311
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,663
-Come here!
-Daoming Si!

312
00:23:34,103 --> 00:23:35,543
Look at that.

313
00:23:50,103 --> 00:23:53,623
What are you doing, dear? You're so slow.

314
00:23:53,903 --> 00:23:56,063
I haven't worn a suit in so long.

315
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,543
I can't get this tie right.

316
00:23:57,623 --> 00:23:59,063
It's either too long or too short.

317
00:23:59,143 --> 00:24:00,423
-Come here.
-It's crooked.

318
00:24:00,503 --> 00:24:01,423
Let me help you.

319
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:04,463
-The food is ready.
-That's good.

320
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:06,943
It smells amazing.

321
00:24:13,423 --> 00:24:14,983
-We have a lot of food.
-That's a lot.

322
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,703
-Nice.
-Mom, I made your signature dish,

323
00:24:17,783 --> 00:24:18,903
sweet and sour pork ribs.

324
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:21,543
When Daoming Si gets here,
he'll start drooling.

325
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:25,703
Dear, our Shancai is wonderful.

326
00:24:25,783 --> 00:24:28,503
She's pretty, obedient, has good grades

327
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:30,983
and is really good at cooking.

328
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:32,743
How lucky are we?

329
00:24:34,903 --> 00:24:35,903
How lucky are we?

330
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,583
I think the Daoming family is lucky.

331
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:43,183
What's wrong?

332
00:24:45,063 --> 00:24:47,103
My precious daughter is getting married.

333
00:24:47,343 --> 00:24:48,903
She won't be at home anymore.

334
00:24:49,223 --> 00:24:50,503
I won't see her anymore.

335
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:52,663
I feel sad whenever I think of that.

336
00:24:53,263 --> 00:24:54,463
There, there.

337
00:24:55,423 --> 00:24:57,543
Mom, you'll see me all the time.

338
00:24:58,183 --> 00:24:59,383
Even if I get married,

339
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:02,583
I'll always be by your side,
forever and ever.

340
00:25:04,023 --> 00:25:05,303
You're my dearest mom.

341
00:25:06,183 --> 00:25:09,103
Aren't you moving to London
after you get married?

342
00:25:10,103 --> 00:25:11,423
I haven't graduated yet.

343
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,663
Before I do, I'll be in Shanghai.

344
00:25:14,983 --> 00:25:16,623
Even if I do go to London,

345
00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:19,143
I'll tell Daoming Si
that we shouldn't live there.

346
00:25:19,223 --> 00:25:20,903
We should live here with you.

347
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,423
-Okay.
-Don't be silly.

348
00:25:22,983 --> 00:25:25,383
When you're married,
you can't live wherever you want.

349
00:25:26,143 --> 00:25:27,383
Of course I can.

350
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:30,223
Daoming Si told me that
he would do whatever I want him to do.

351
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,583
I can get him to do whatever I want.

352
00:25:32,983 --> 00:25:34,143
Even if he picks on me,

353
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:36,743
I'll do what I did when I first met him.

354
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:38,103
I'll knock him down.

355
00:25:38,823 --> 00:25:39,663
That's nice.

356
00:25:40,303 --> 00:25:43,583
See our daughter? She's just like you.

357
00:25:45,383 --> 00:25:47,703
Well, I'm not surprised that she is.

358
00:25:51,263 --> 00:25:54,383
-You're the best mom ever.
-You're the best wife ever.

359
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:55,583
That's more like it.

360
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,823
It's already 12:30 p.m.

361
00:26:00,383 --> 00:26:02,063
Why aren't Daoming Si
and his mom here yet?

362
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:04,983
It's hard to park in front of our house.

363
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,743
We should've told our neighbors

364
00:26:09,023 --> 00:26:10,823
and just had them park
in front of their house.

365
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:13,263
This is my fault.

366
00:26:13,383 --> 00:26:14,463
-All my fault.
-It's not.

367
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:17,103
They have a driver.
They don't drive themselves.

368
00:26:17,183 --> 00:26:19,503
That's true. I totally forgot.

369
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:23,183
Did they forget
the directions to our house?

370
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:24,783
That's impossible.

371
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:26,983
-His mom came last time.
-Yeah.

372
00:26:28,063 --> 00:26:29,983
It's fine. I'll call him now.

373
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:31,543
-Just ask him.
-Okay.

374
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:38,743
Hey, don't eat just yet.

375
00:26:40,103 --> 00:26:41,103
We won't.

376
00:26:41,543 --> 00:26:42,743
We're just checking them out.

377
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:44,343
So much food.

378
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:49,503
Hello? Daoming Si?

379
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:52,183
<i>It's not Daoming Si. It's me.</i>

380
00:26:53,663 --> 00:26:54,823
Mrs. Daoming.

381
00:26:55,703 --> 00:26:57,503
-Mrs. Daoming?
-I just wanted to know

382
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:58,903
if you're almost here.

383
00:26:59,263 --> 00:27:01,183
My parents and I are waiting for you.

384
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:04,183
I'm busy today. I won't be going.

385
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,183
But we agreed to it.

386
00:27:09,543 --> 00:27:11,983
You and Daoming Si were coming today.

387
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:13,463
<i>I just said that</i>

388
00:27:13,983 --> 00:27:15,703
because Si was with you.

389
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:17,863
I was worried he would be tricked

390
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:20,463
into having a wedding
and doing something he would regret.

391
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:25,423
<i>Now, Si is back with me.</i>

392
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,423
<i>I've talked some sense into him.</i>

393
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:30,023
<i>He won't be so impulsive anymore.</i>

394
00:27:31,223 --> 00:27:32,703
<i>After listening to me,</i>

395
00:27:33,423 --> 00:27:35,143
<i>he decided to go back to London with me.</i>

396
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,983
<i>He'll never come back to Shanghai again.</i>

397
00:27:40,023 --> 00:27:41,023
<i>Dong Shancai,</i>

398
00:27:42,223 --> 00:27:43,863
<i>you should give up on Si.</i>

399
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:45,663
<i>It'll never happen.</i>

400
00:27:58,103 --> 00:28:00,103
What is it, Shancai? What happened?

401
00:28:02,903 --> 00:28:03,983
Mom.

402
00:28:06,783 --> 00:28:07,983
Mrs. Daoming said

403
00:28:09,543 --> 00:28:10,543
she won't be coming today.

404
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:17,823
That day,

405
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:20,703
she tricked us.

406
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:22,343
What?

407
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:24,263
She lied to us?

408
00:28:25,063 --> 00:28:26,143
She won't be coming?

409
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:30,343
That's so rude. What is that witch doing?

410
00:28:30,423 --> 00:28:33,423
Shancai cooked so much food for them.

411
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,783
And they're not coming?

412
00:28:35,503 --> 00:28:36,623
I'm just furious.

413
00:28:37,343 --> 00:28:38,383
What is she thinking?

414
00:28:38,463 --> 00:28:40,783
Does she think we're stupid?
That our daughter is stupid?

415
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:44,743
I have to go talk to her.
I have to set things straight.

416
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,183
Shancai, let's go to their house.

417
00:28:46,263 --> 00:28:47,103
-Come on.
-Let's go.

418
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,423
Dad, Mom.

419
00:28:53,063 --> 00:28:54,223
I'm sorry.

420
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,263
Why are you sorry?

421
00:28:57,543 --> 00:29:00,143
They're the ones at fault.
What are you sorry for?

422
00:29:03,503 --> 00:29:05,103
Because of our relationship,

423
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:08,743
you've been worried and angry.

424
00:29:14,623 --> 00:29:16,223
But it's not your fault, right?

425
00:29:21,103 --> 00:29:21,943
Dad, Mom.

426
00:29:23,663 --> 00:29:25,423
Promise me one thing.

427
00:29:27,103 --> 00:29:28,303
From now on,

428
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:31,143
let me deal with problems

429
00:29:32,343 --> 00:29:33,863
concerning Daoming Si and I alone.

430
00:29:39,463 --> 00:29:42,263
No matter what happens between us,

431
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,943
I never want you
to be insulted like this again.

432
00:29:49,463 --> 00:29:52,983
No matter what Mrs. Daoming
does to separate us,

433
00:29:55,263 --> 00:29:56,823
I'll be brave and deal with it.

434
00:30:30,343 --> 00:30:32,743
Who came up with this stupid idea?

435
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:34,583
It was Meizuo.

436
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:36,703
He said that it was a hat party

437
00:30:36,783 --> 00:30:38,823
and we should wear hats
to give Si our blessing.

438
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,903
But these dog hats are hideous.

439
00:30:43,543 --> 00:30:46,583
This is a bachelor party hat, okay?

440
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:49,743
I think I'm so creative.

441
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:55,543
Who would know that

442
00:30:55,943 --> 00:30:59,183
Si would be the first to get married?

443
00:31:01,023 --> 00:31:03,143
If you're jealous, cheer up a bit.

444
00:31:03,503 --> 00:31:05,903
Stop being sad about your breakup, okay?

445
00:31:11,943 --> 00:31:14,503
Is Meizuo really sad?

446
00:31:16,423 --> 00:31:19,263
This is called putting on a brave face

447
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:21,503
and crying at home when I'm alone.

448
00:31:21,783 --> 00:31:24,063
Breakups are really sad.

449
00:31:27,063 --> 00:31:29,103
You should save your tears.

450
00:31:29,543 --> 00:31:31,143
Cry when Si gets here.

451
00:31:32,903 --> 00:31:33,783
All right.

452
00:31:36,983 --> 00:31:38,783
But why isn't Si here yet?

453
00:31:57,863 --> 00:31:58,823
Shancai?

454
00:32:04,703 --> 00:32:06,743
Shancai, what's wrong?

455
00:32:08,983 --> 00:32:10,023
Daoming Si...

456
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:12,183
He won't be coming.

457
00:32:15,823 --> 00:32:16,943
You mean,

458
00:32:17,663 --> 00:32:20,223
Si and his mom didn't go to your house
to talk about your marriage?

459
00:32:22,703 --> 00:32:23,543
No.

460
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:27,263
They said they would come this noon.

461
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:29,703
We prepared lunch.

462
00:32:33,263 --> 00:32:34,783
But they didn't come at all.

463
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:43,103
I called Daoming Si and his mom picked up.

464
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:46,983
She said that...

465
00:32:51,423 --> 00:32:53,663
she never wanted us to get married.

466
00:32:55,423 --> 00:32:57,063
She's sending Daoming Si to London.

467
00:32:57,783 --> 00:32:58,943
He's never coming back.

468
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:07,103
I'll call him.

469
00:33:17,423 --> 00:33:19,383
Did Si already go to London?

470
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:22,863
No.

471
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:25,303
<i>Hello?</i>

472
00:33:25,863 --> 00:33:27,703
Mrs. Yu? It's me, Ximen.

473
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,463
Why is it you who picked up the phone?

474
00:33:35,503 --> 00:33:37,783
Si is too busy to pick up.

475
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:40,863
Mrs. Yu, what are you talking about?

476
00:33:41,263 --> 00:33:44,503
We're holding him a bachelor party
and waiting for him to come.

477
00:33:48,623 --> 00:33:51,183
I'm telling you one more time.

478
00:33:51,783 --> 00:33:53,223
We're busy.

479
00:33:53,703 --> 00:33:55,103
Si is busy.

480
00:33:55,223 --> 00:33:56,903
<i>He can't pick up.</i>

481
00:33:58,223 --> 00:33:59,863
Stop calling us.

482
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:05,503
Hello? Mrs. Yu?

483
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:06,823
Hello?

484
00:34:27,063 --> 00:34:28,263
Starting today,

485
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:30,943
if anyone asks about Si,
don't say anything.

486
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:35,743
Don't pick up any phone calls.

487
00:34:35,983 --> 00:34:37,863
Let the secretary do it.

488
00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:40,263
Yes, ma'am.

489
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:43,463
Mrs. Daoming.

490
00:34:45,303 --> 00:34:47,303
Aren't you worried about Si?

491
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,783
Mrs. Yu sounded weird.

492
00:34:58,143 --> 00:35:00,383
She didn't go to Shancai's house today.

493
00:35:05,223 --> 00:35:06,703
That's her way of stalling.

494
00:35:07,183 --> 00:35:08,543
She's stalling for time.

495
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:10,943
Stalling for time?

496
00:35:11,463 --> 00:35:12,583
What is she trying to do?

497
00:35:13,223 --> 00:35:16,143
Regardless, the most important thing is

498
00:35:16,703 --> 00:35:18,223
to find Si.

499
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:19,903
How do we do that?

500
00:35:22,263 --> 00:35:23,503
Mrs. Yu gave us a hint.

501
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:25,423
Si is at home.

502
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:29,823
What should we do?

503
00:35:31,223 --> 00:35:32,783
We should go there to check it out.

504
00:35:33,343 --> 00:35:34,423
I'll go with you.

505
00:35:35,823 --> 00:35:37,143
We have to sneak in.

506
00:35:37,543 --> 00:35:38,743
You shouldn't come.

507
00:35:40,463 --> 00:35:42,743
When we find him, we'll let you know.

508
00:36:08,463 --> 00:36:09,383
What should we do?

509
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:15,543
Same as usual. Go in from the back door.

510
00:36:53,623 --> 00:36:54,463
Who is it?

511
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,143
What took you so long?

512
00:37:01,383 --> 00:37:02,783
I knew it was Mrs. Yu.

513
00:37:03,663 --> 00:37:05,703
We bumped right into her.

514
00:37:08,503 --> 00:37:10,743
I distracted the security guards with tea.

515
00:37:11,783 --> 00:37:13,663
I've been waiting for hours.

516
00:37:14,263 --> 00:37:15,423
Come with me.

517
00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:17,503
What happened to Si?

518
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:23,543
She locked him up.

519
00:37:28,823 --> 00:37:29,663
Come on.

520
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:00,023
I thought that
since you have all graduated,

521
00:38:00,783 --> 00:38:02,303
you wouldn't be so stupid.

522
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:05,903
Yet, you're sneaking into our house again.

523
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:09,303
Why does Si have
terrible friends like you?

524
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:11,863
Mrs. Daoming,

525
00:38:11,983 --> 00:38:13,263
even if we're terrible,

526
00:38:13,343 --> 00:38:15,063
we would never hurt our family members.

527
00:38:16,823 --> 00:38:18,023
You're saying

528
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:20,543
that I'm hurting Si?

529
00:38:21,103 --> 00:38:23,783
What are you doing right now then?
Are you pretending to be a nurse?

530
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:27,583
When can you finally grow up
and think like adults?

531
00:38:28,663 --> 00:38:30,543
If you see us as adults,

532
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:33,423
you should respect Si and accept Shancai.

533
00:38:34,023 --> 00:38:36,423
Do you respect me?

534
00:38:37,623 --> 00:38:39,983
I couldn't let Si

535
00:38:40,623 --> 00:38:43,703
be with someone whose background,
intelligence, and appearance

536
00:38:43,783 --> 00:38:45,023
are so clearly beneath him.

537
00:38:54,103 --> 00:38:57,383
I think Xiaozi is the best match for him.

538
00:39:26,023 --> 00:39:28,863
Xiaozi, this one looks nice.
Do you want to try it?

539
00:39:29,823 --> 00:39:30,743
Mom.

540
00:39:31,183 --> 00:39:33,263
Why are we still trying on dresses?

541
00:39:33,823 --> 00:39:34,823
I told you.

542
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:37,063
He doesn't like me.

543
00:39:37,903 --> 00:39:39,023
It's Shancai that he likes.

544
00:39:40,663 --> 00:39:41,983
There's no love between us.

545
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:43,583
How would we get married?

546
00:39:45,223 --> 00:39:47,663
Xiaozi, you're both young.

547
00:39:47,943 --> 00:39:49,703
But you can't be too impulsive.

548
00:39:50,343 --> 00:39:51,943
The situation right now

549
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,663
is that you're both the successors
of huge business empires.

550
00:39:54,823 --> 00:39:56,343
If you two get married,

551
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:59,103
it'll bring benefits to our families.

552
00:40:04,103 --> 00:40:05,623
Is that all your care about?

553
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:09,423
Don't you like Si?

554
00:40:09,983 --> 00:40:11,143
I do like him.

555
00:40:12,303 --> 00:40:13,703
But he doesn't like me.

556
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:18,103
Xiaozi.

557
00:40:18,663 --> 00:40:20,103
If you like Si,

558
00:40:20,663 --> 00:40:22,303
this is your best chance.

559
00:40:23,503 --> 00:40:24,703
What do you mean?

560
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:28,503
If this happened a few years earlier,

561
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:31,343
Daoming Feng wouldn't even
consider our family.

562
00:40:32,103 --> 00:40:33,263
But now it's different.

563
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:37,023
For the past two years,
her hotel hasn't been doing well.

564
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:39,343
She needs your dad to save her business.

565
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:42,223
Your dad also needs this opportunity

566
00:40:42,303 --> 00:40:44,783
to get more resources from Daoming Feng.

567
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:48,343
But what if I said

568
00:40:49,343 --> 00:40:51,103
I don't like Si anymore?

569
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:52,743
Xiaozi.

570
00:40:53,143 --> 00:40:55,663
-Don't lie.
-I'm not lying.

571
00:40:56,343 --> 00:40:57,583
I just don't understand.

572
00:40:57,943 --> 00:41:01,423
If working together benefits both parties,

573
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:03,183
why is marriage the only solution?

574
00:41:03,263 --> 00:41:04,983
Why can't we just work together?

575
00:41:08,143 --> 00:41:10,503
Because we can't trust Daoming Feng.

576
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:13,903
We can't trust her?

577
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:19,583
Daoming Feng has a very aggressive style.
She has many enemies in the market.

578
00:41:19,823 --> 00:41:22,103
Why should we help her
without getting anything in return?

579
00:41:22,703 --> 00:41:25,863
But if Si is part of our family,

580
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:27,623
it would be a different story.

581
00:41:37,263 --> 00:41:38,143
Xiaozi.

582
00:41:38,823 --> 00:41:40,263
if you don't want to marry him,

583
00:41:40,703 --> 00:41:42,503
I won't force you to.

584
00:41:44,263 --> 00:41:46,023
If Daoming Group goes out of business,

585
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:47,583
to our family,

586
00:41:47,663 --> 00:41:49,743
it would just be a small hit.

587
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:53,583
Your dad has been doing
very well these years.

588
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:56,903
He can find other business partners
to work with.

589
00:41:57,863 --> 00:42:01,423
But if Daoming Group crumbles,

590
00:42:01,503 --> 00:42:04,263
Daoming Si will have nothing left.

591
00:42:04,343 --> 00:42:05,583
He'll be just another guy.

592
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:08,023
Could you let that happen to him?
