EPISODE 30

3
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:47,791
Miss Caina.

4
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:50,471
How are you doing?

5
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:53,551
I'm doing fine.

6
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:58,151
Actually...

7
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:00,791
Stop if you're not fine.

8
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:07,151
Here.

9
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,111
I'll order a cocktail for you today.

10
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:10,951
Wei Xun.

11
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:14,191
I want to order

12
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:17,631
"Goodbye Old Place."

13
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:20,431
I want it sour, sweet, bitter and spicy.

14
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:21,951
Everything in it.

15
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:23,911
One for each of us.

16
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:24,831
All right.

17
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:26,871
"Goodbye Old Place"?

18
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:29,791
What does that mean?

19
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,351
Are we not coming here again?

20
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:33,991
No, we're not.

21
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:35,631
Caina.

22
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:38,591
Do you remember what I told you?

23
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:40,311
Meeting me

24
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:42,311
is the beginning of your happiness.

25
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:44,311
Today,

26
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:48,351
I want to officially start this happiness.

27
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:50,391
If you're not coming back,

28
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:53,591
it'd be

29
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:55,351
my treat today.

30
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:57,151
All right. Cheers.

31
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:58,751
Here.

32
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:11,831
The taste is horrible.

33
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:15,551
If we had this the first time,

34
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,911
maybe we wouldn't have met
the second time.

35
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:21,751
Sometimes,

36
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,871
we cannot tell the outcome beforehand.

37
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:27,751
Because if we did,

38
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:30,591
then we'd have no courage to do it.

39
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,431
But if we don't,

40
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:39,311
how would we know the outcome?

41
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:56,791
Since we got to know each other,

42
00:03:57,351 --> 00:03:58,231
this is the first time

43
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:01,231
you didn't get drunk
after having one glass.

44
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,271
Because you said

45
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:06,951
we won't go to that old place again.

46
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:10,151
I don't want to face you
in a confused state.

47
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:13,271
Love is confusing.

48
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:15,831
I don't want to be too sober today.

49
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:17,911
Or else, I won't be able

50
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:19,951
to tell you what I want.

51
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:24,471
You have something to tell me?

52
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,351
-What a coincidence. I--
-Don't say it yet.

53
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:29,311
Follow me.

54
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:35,551
Today will also be

55
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:37,031
a very,

56
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:37,951
very good day.

57
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,071
Why are we in my backyard?

58
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:55,391
I have a gift for you.

59
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:56,751
What?

60
00:04:57,191 --> 00:04:58,831
A gift for me again?

61
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:00,751
Let's keep walking. You'll see it.

62
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:04,031
Meizuo, wait.

63
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,191
Why are you so nice to me?

64
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:08,551
Because you're worth it.

65
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:12,631
I'm not as perfect as you think.

66
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:17,111
I never thought that you are.

67
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:18,711
Because you're you,

68
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:20,551
you deserve to be loved.

69
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:22,871
Just keep walking

70
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:24,591
and you'll see

71
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:26,071
where your happiness lies.

72
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:30,111
No, Meizuo.

73
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:31,791
I really can't.

74
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:34,551
I'm moved by everything you do.

75
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,111
But if I go forward,

76
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:39,591
I'd really hurt you.

77
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:42,271
You won't.

78
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:45,431
Every single day will be precious.

79
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:47,471
Every single day,

80
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:49,071
I'd make you smile.

81
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,231
This is my promise to you.

82
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:53,871
Trust me.

83
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:55,271
Follow me.

84
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:30,111
This is...

85
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,711
This is Ye Mingchuan's gift for you.

86
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,671
He said

87
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:37,431
what you wanted

88
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,631
is not an ordinary house.

89
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:43,231
You wanted a dream.

90
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:48,391
He spent all his time with Ding Qi

91
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:51,111
so that he can give you this surprise

92
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:52,671
on your birthday.

93
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,311
He said this would make you really happy.

94
00:06:57,871 --> 00:06:59,191
You've always been

95
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,351
his most cherished person.

96
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:07,911
I'm really such a bad person.

97
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:10,711
Caina.

98
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:13,391
You should be honest with yourself.

99
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:16,111
Even though you've been resisting it,

100
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:17,711
but you've always loved

101
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:19,911
Ye Mingchuan.

102
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:23,951
Yes.

103
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,111
I wasn't confident.

104
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:29,751
I was insecure.

105
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:31,951
It's all my fault.

106
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:36,311
I'm a fool who doesn't know how to love.

107
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:43,431
Meizuo.

108
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,151
Why are you telling me this?

109
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:48,031
Don't you hate him?

110
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:49,911
I do.

111
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:52,631
But

112
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:55,391
I like you.

113
00:08:02,671 --> 00:08:03,991
I always thought that...

114
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:06,551
to make someone fall in love with you,

115
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,431
you have to make her smile.

116
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:16,591
But I've learned

117
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:20,391
that when you really love someone,

118
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,831
you'd unconsciously

119
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,151
cry because of her.

120
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:31,111
Meizuo.

121
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,031
You've done so much for me.

122
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:37,751
I don't want you to feel miserable.

123
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:40,431
Don't worry.

124
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:43,831
Youngsters like us fall in love

125
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:45,391
and move on.

126
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:47,831
We're honest with how we feel.

127
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:50,231
But that guy

128
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:52,751
really likes you.

129
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:55,671
He just couldn't tell you.

130
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:00,631
Stop wasting time.

131
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:02,991
When he leaves,

132
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:05,351
you might not see him anymore.

133
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:09,471
Caina.

134
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:11,191
This tree house is here.

135
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:14,231
But Mr. Coconut is leaving.

136
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:16,311
Aren't you going after him?

137
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,471
Thank you, Meizuo.

138
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:23,351
Thank you.

139
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:08,991
But before I go,

140
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:12,991
I hope you can give something to her.

141
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:21,311
TREE HOUSE DESIGN

142
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,991
I spent a lot of time preparing
this tree house for her.

143
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:31,111
It's located in her backyard.

144
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:34,471
She told me

145
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:37,831
that she doesn't like to stay
in a house like a cage.

146
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:39,991
She likes tree houses.

147
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:43,991
When I'm in the house,

148
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:45,511
I'm a like a bird

149
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:47,111
in a cage.

150
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:49,951
Is that so?

151
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,951
You feel that way too?

152
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:55,791
That's how I've always felt.

153
00:10:56,751 --> 00:11:00,031
It turns out I'm not the only one
who feels that way.

154
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:08,111
I really like the tree houses
in fairy tales.

155
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:18,751
<i>I know this is insignificant.</i>

156
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:21,591
<i>Initially,</i>

157
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:23,311
<i>I wanted to give it to her as a surprise.</i>

158
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:28,711
<i>The two must overlap.</i>

159
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,071
The living room in front,
bedroom at the back.

160
00:11:31,271 --> 00:11:32,351
-Overlap.
-Yes.

161
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:34,751
Then a French window in the middle.

162
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:36,751
The living room in front,
bedroom at the back.

163
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:38,311
This tree here...

164
00:12:17,391 --> 00:12:18,951
It has an oval shape.

165
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:21,311
It's a tree house with two eggs
overlapping together.

166
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:24,151
-Overlapping together.
-Yes.

167
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:29,431
Please give this to her on my behalf.

168
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:34,591
I hope you can always make her happy.

169
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:17,551
Where is he?

170
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:19,231
He already left.

171
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:20,151
He left?

172
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:21,231
Where did he go?

173
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:24,071
He confirmed his next project.

174
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:25,671
He went to the States.

175
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:43,151
How can you leave?

176
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:46,511
You're leaving
without finishing the renovation.

177
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:48,831
If my dad doesn't like it,

178
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:50,711
I have to go back to the States.

179
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:52,511
But I want to stay in Shanghai.

180
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,151
How can you be so irresponsible?

181
00:14:57,151 --> 00:14:58,151
I'm not leaving.

182
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,831
But why are you here at the airport?

183
00:15:05,951 --> 00:15:07,071
I'm waiting for someone

184
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:08,631
to travel with me.

185
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:25,311
How did you know I'd be here?

186
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:29,391
I don't know.

187
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:32,231
Just like before.

188
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:35,431
I thought you liked me,
but you disappeared.

189
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:38,751
I really don't know what you'll do.

190
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:42,071
I'm just doing whatever I can.

191
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:44,511
Then I can only wait.

192
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,311
How long will you keep waiting for me?

193
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:01,591
Until that one day

194
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:05,791
you'll feel that being with me

195
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:08,831
would make you happy.

196
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,391
Today is the day.

197
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,871
It has been a while.

198
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:40,551
Caina.

199
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,751
Hi, it has been a while.

200
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:48,311
Can you do it?

201
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:51,031
Maybe I should just call the plumber.

202
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:55,911
Thanks.

203
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:59,511
You must check all the pipes
in this house.

204
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:06,791
It's raining so heavily. Go inside.

205
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,951
I'll be done soon. Go back inside.

206
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:27,551
Did you make it?

207
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:01,231
Hello.

208
00:18:02,151 --> 00:18:03,151
Are you on a date?

209
00:18:03,951 --> 00:18:04,951
I have a bet with Lei.

210
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,911
I said you're at a concert.

211
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:08,831
Lei said you're at a bookstore.

212
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,391
<i>What's the matter?</i>

213
00:18:16,151 --> 00:18:17,151
<i>Is it going well?</i>

214
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:19,671
Yes.

215
00:18:24,191 --> 00:18:25,271
We...

216
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:26,951
ended it.

217
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:34,231
Are you feeling okay?

218
00:18:42,191 --> 00:18:43,151
How come?

219
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:45,591
I'm too cool

220
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:46,871
to be understood

221
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:49,191
by regular people.

222
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,311
That's great.

223
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,751
I met a lot of beautiful girls
in my group report recently.

224
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:58,191
I was worried I have no one
to share them with.

225
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:00,751
We have a group discussion tomorrow.
Don't be late.

226
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:01,831
All right.

227
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:04,551
I'll be there.

228
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:56,591
It's been a few days.
Haven't you recovered?

229
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,511
Here.

230
00:19:58,911 --> 00:19:59,911
This is for you.

231
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,311
Seven days.

232
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:04,911
In a blink of an eye,

233
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:08,111
it's been seven days
since Caina and Ye Mingchuan left.

234
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,271
And I've made a personal record.

235
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:17,511
I still couldn't move on after seven days.

236
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,191
From the perspective of psychology,

237
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:20,551
you will go through four stages

238
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:22,191
after you got dumped.

239
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:25,791
Shock, conflict, anger

240
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,271
and acceptance.

241
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:31,751
But a heartless person like you
should already be in the acceptance stage.

242
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:33,511
So much for acceptance!

243
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:35,031
I'm shocked, conflicted and pissed.

244
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:37,751
Why did I accept a heartless person
like you as my friend?

245
00:20:55,231 --> 00:20:57,431
How could you laugh at my handsome face?

246
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:58,711
That's rude.

247
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,111
Because the dark circles around your eyes

248
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:04,151
exude the beauty and sadness
of a broken heart.

249
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:09,151
Hey, Lei.

250
00:21:09,711 --> 00:21:11,511
Didn't you bring Shancai back
from the village?

251
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,471
Why didn't you bring her to see Si?

252
00:21:14,031 --> 00:21:16,031
Si should be the one to ask me
where Shancai is.

253
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:18,551
You don't need to overreact.

254
00:21:24,111 --> 00:21:25,271
Hey, Si.

255
00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:32,551
I wasn't overreacting.

256
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:39,911
Si, Shan--

257
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:44,991
Shanshan is late.

258
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:46,711
Why are you late?

259
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:49,671
I didn't have class any earlier.

260
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:54,991
All right. Let's begin.

261
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:00,391
Hey.

262
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:04,511
-I'll take the attendance.
-Tell me. When will that guy move on?

263
00:22:06,031 --> 00:22:07,951
-Feng Meizuo.
-Present.

264
00:22:08,031 --> 00:22:09,511
-Yan Qian.
-Present.

265
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:11,631
-Lian Zuo.
-Present.

266
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:13,511
-Liu Panpan.
-Present.

267
00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:15,791
-Zheng Han.
-Present.

268
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:17,831
-Cao Zhen.
-Present.

269
00:22:18,391 --> 00:22:19,791
-Liu Zhengbo.
-Present.

270
00:22:23,271 --> 00:22:25,791
<i>Shancai, you were gone for two weeks.
What did the teachers say?</i>

271
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:29,831
<i>I apologized to them and filed my leave.
They made an exception this time.</i>

272
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:31,311
But the finals are coming up.

273
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:33,911
-I'm afraid I couldn't catch up.
-It'll be all right.

274
00:22:33,991 --> 00:22:35,351
I can lend you my notes.

275
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:37,511
You're amazing.

276
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:39,511
I feel so stupid for always asking you.

277
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:43,271
You can ask me if you have any questions.

278
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:44,231
You'll be fine.

279
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,351
However,
a lot of things happened recently.

280
00:22:52,911 --> 00:22:53,871
Don't think too much.

281
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:55,311
Just move on.

282
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:56,911
You have a new future ahead of you.

283
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:06,431
Shancai.

284
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:10,871
Did I see Shancai earlier?

285
00:23:11,751 --> 00:23:12,911
If it wasn't her,

286
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:14,671
then I might be hallucinating too.

287
00:23:41,831 --> 00:23:43,831
Shancai, why are you hiding here?

288
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:47,031
It's nothing.

289
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:51,031
Is it because of Daoming Si?

290
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,431
Maybe.

291
00:23:56,951 --> 00:23:58,591
I don't want to face him yet.

292
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:00,471
Shancai,

293
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:03,191
if you want to draw the line
with Daoming Si,

294
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:05,351
then tell him directly.

295
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:08,871
You can't hide all the time.

296
00:24:14,231 --> 00:24:15,991
I have nothing to do with him anymore.

297
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:18,831
We should go to class.

298
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,111
Why did you ask me to come here?

299
00:24:34,991 --> 00:24:35,831
Si.

300
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:38,351
What do you plan to do with Shancai?

301
00:24:39,631 --> 00:24:41,031
I've nothing to do with her anymore.

302
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:43,231
Isn't that obvious?

303
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:47,191
Shancai's feelings,

304
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:48,751
her life

305
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:50,111
and her future

306
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:51,991
have nothing to do with you anymore?

307
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:54,511
How many times do I need to say it?

308
00:24:55,391 --> 00:24:56,871
It's over between us.

309
00:24:58,271 --> 00:24:59,671
Do you really believe that?

310
00:25:01,711 --> 00:25:02,551
Lei,

311
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:05,231
since when are you interested
in other people's business?

312
00:25:07,111 --> 00:25:08,031
All right.

313
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:09,831
Because it's Shancai, right?

314
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:12,231
That's why you're so interested.

315
00:25:13,271 --> 00:25:15,271
I told Ximen and Meizuo before
that I won't get

316
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:17,151
in between you and Shancai,

317
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:21,151
unless you have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

318
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:23,791
I'll ask you one last time.

319
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,591
Do you want to be with Shancai?

320
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,151
Stop talking nonsense.

321
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:31,471
I don't want to repeat
what I already said.

322
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:33,151
All right.

323
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:35,511
Then let me officially tell you.

324
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:37,711
I'm pursuing Shancai.

325
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:45,871
Do whatever you want.

326
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:48,511
Listen to me carefully.

327
00:25:49,271 --> 00:25:50,431
I love Shancai.

328
00:25:50,911 --> 00:25:52,991
I've always felt
that we're more than friends.

329
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:56,671
I backed off before

330
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:58,151
and wished you both well.

331
00:25:58,911 --> 00:26:02,031
Now I'm not sure
whether I've done the right thing.

332
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:03,631
Lei.

333
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,951
These words you're saying

334
00:26:06,391 --> 00:26:08,231
are very hard for me to take.

335
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:12,591
The words "backing off"
piss you off, right?

336
00:26:13,951 --> 00:26:15,031
Then let me say it again

337
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:18,551
This time, I want to compete
with you in pursuing Shancai.

338
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:23,671
I don't want to see her cry
because of you.

339
00:26:25,871 --> 00:26:27,351
If you've already given up on her,

340
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:29,511
then please wish me well,

341
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:33,351
just like what I did before.

342
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:37,511
Are you threatening me?

343
00:26:38,711 --> 00:26:40,271
Or are you purposely challenging me?

344
00:26:41,631 --> 00:26:43,951
You don't have to tell me what you'll do.

345
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:46,551
There's no need for that.

346
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:50,111
Si.

347
00:26:51,831 --> 00:26:55,071
Even if it's not necessary,
I still think I should tell you.

348
00:26:55,951 --> 00:26:57,831
I value F4's friendship.

349
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:01,311
So please wish me well.

350
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:07,871
Or would you rather have a fight with me?

351
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:09,911
Then let's fight.

352
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:18,551
Let me tell you again.

353
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,671
You don't have to tell me
what you want to do.

354
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:25,591
Do whatever you want.

355
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,071
Si!

356
00:27:29,391 --> 00:27:30,911
Let me take care of Shancai.

357
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:01,871
Your mom said

358
00:28:03,111 --> 00:28:04,991
that if I continue seeing you,

359
00:28:06,071 --> 00:28:08,871
she'll make Qinghe and Xiaoyou's
dads lose their jobs.

360
00:28:10,431 --> 00:28:11,391
I'll talk to her now.

361
00:28:12,351 --> 00:28:13,191
Don't!

362
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:17,791
I've already decided.

363
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:24,471
I don't want to have anything to do
with the Daoming family.

364
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:27,911
I've decided not to contact you.

365
00:28:32,631 --> 00:28:33,591
I can't accept it.

366
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:07,631
Shancai.

367
00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:11,351
Shancai.

368
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:21,671
Are you all right?

369
00:29:23,751 --> 00:29:24,791
I'm all right.

370
00:29:26,151 --> 00:29:28,951
I eat and sleep well.
I'm full of energy and my mind is clear.

371
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:31,111
Stop pretending.

372
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:33,831
Don't give up on Daoming Si.

373
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:35,431
Look at you.

374
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:36,831
You seem distracted.

375
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:38,831
I'm really worried about you.

376
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:46,231
I've really thought
things through this time.

377
00:29:47,631 --> 00:29:48,751
Why?

378
00:29:49,311 --> 00:29:52,951
Can't two people who love each other
be together against all odds?

379
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,071
It's not that easy.

380
00:30:01,911 --> 00:30:05,031
If it's because of me, don't worry.

381
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:06,511
I can take care of myself.

382
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:09,351
It's not just because of you.

383
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,111
Maybe I'm just exhausted.

384
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:17,951
When I was with him,

385
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:21,031
it felt like things always went wrong.

386
00:30:22,351 --> 00:30:23,791
Can you really forget him?

387
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:31,071
How do I put it?

388
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,151
There were many times

389
00:30:35,871 --> 00:30:37,751
when I realized I fell in love with him.

390
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:39,991
Then, get back together.

391
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,231
Falling in love is the best gift
in this world.

392
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:45,271
Many people want to, but they can't.

393
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:49,391
But when I first knew him,

394
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:52,511
I definitely, completely

395
00:30:52,591 --> 00:30:53,991
didn't like him at all.

396
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:56,911
-I even hated him.
-That was before.

397
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,631
Then I'll go back to the way it was.

398
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:15,271
I definitely, completely
don't like him at all!

399
00:31:18,951 --> 00:31:20,591
Now I'm back to square one.

400
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:24,671
As if nothing happened.

401
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:44,831
-What are you doing?
-I want to tell you something. Follow me.

402
00:31:46,711 --> 00:31:47,991
Let go of me.

403
00:32:03,151 --> 00:32:04,911
Don't you have something to tell me?

404
00:32:05,871 --> 00:32:08,471
If you have nothing to say,
then I'll leave.

405
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:11,271
Can't you stay with me for a while?

406
00:32:16,431 --> 00:32:18,311
Do you hate it when I'm around?

407
00:32:19,591 --> 00:32:20,831
That's not what I meant.

408
00:32:24,031 --> 00:32:25,431
You suddenly disappeared

409
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:28,551
and hid in the fishing village
to sell squid. What were you thinking?

410
00:32:31,071 --> 00:32:34,591
The fishing village was nice.
It was relaxing there.

411
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:36,951
I had squid and went
to the beach every day.

412
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:38,311
It was like a vacation.

413
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:39,951
-You don't know how happy--
-Shancai.

414
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:41,391
You're so disappointing.

415
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:48,511
Every time I want to have a serious talk,

416
00:32:49,591 --> 00:32:50,831
you either talk nonsense

417
00:32:51,311 --> 00:32:53,151
or hide or sleep.

418
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:54,911
Do you know how to be honest?

419
00:32:56,671 --> 00:32:57,591
Daoming Si.

420
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:02,431
-It's not that I don't know--
-If you can honestly face your feelings,

421
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:05,911
I don't need to be like a clown
getting played by you!

422
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:08,351
I can't only think about my own happiness

423
00:33:09,271 --> 00:33:10,671
and not care about others.

424
00:33:10,751 --> 00:33:13,231
If Qinghe and Xiaoyou were not in trouble,

425
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:15,711
I wouldn't have had to go
to the fishing village.

426
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:17,311
That's just an excuse.

427
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:19,471
You always have a lot of excuses!

428
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,191
I think I really am that stupid.

429
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:22,671
I've had enough!

430
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:39,471
Do you think I want

431
00:33:40,471 --> 00:33:41,471
to wander around

432
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:43,751
and struggle like this?

433
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:51,031
Daoming Si.

434
00:33:52,471 --> 00:33:54,271
-Actually, I--
-Don't cry.

435
00:33:56,471 --> 00:33:57,791
Even if you cry,

436
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:01,791
I won't do anything for you anymore.

437
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:04,751
Also,

438
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:07,631
you don't need to run away

439
00:34:08,471 --> 00:34:09,871
when you see me in school anymore.

440
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:12,831
We have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

441
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:15,671
Just like strangers.

442
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:19,911
Let's end it today.

443
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:23,551
Goodbye.

444
00:34:28,311 --> 00:34:29,471
Daoming Si!

445
00:35:03,391 --> 00:35:04,551
Since that's the case...

446
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:16,191
Here's the meteor necklace

447
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:18,791
you gave me.

448
00:37:13,271 --> 00:37:15,151
<i>Daoming Si, I like you.</i>

449
00:37:15,951 --> 00:37:17,271
<i>I really like you.</i>

450
00:37:18,591 --> 00:37:20,191
<i>There was a moment earlier</i>

451
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:23,231
<i>when I almost told you that.</i>

452
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:26,791
<i>I almost destroyed my friends' families.</i>

453
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:29,231
<i>I almost threw away my pride
and self-respect!</i>

454
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:31,311
<i>I almost threw everything away
and confessed to you.</i>

455
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:33,671
<i>I really...</i>

456
00:37:35,151 --> 00:37:36,551
<i>almost confessed my feelings.</i>

457
00:37:45,271 --> 00:37:46,431
Shancai, what are you doing?

458
00:37:49,991 --> 00:37:51,311
Shancai, come up here.

459
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,151
Lei.

460
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:56,231
I'm begging you. Help me find it.

461
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:58,951
Please come here and help me
find it, okay?

462
00:37:59,031 --> 00:38:00,031
What are you looking for?

463
00:38:19,871 --> 00:38:20,791
Stop it.

464
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:23,271
Even if it's something very meaningful,
it's gone now.

465
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:25,871
No! I want to find it!

466
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:27,831
I have to find it!

467
00:38:29,471 --> 00:38:30,711
Why can't I find it?

468
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:33,671
I want to find it!

469
00:38:35,511 --> 00:38:37,391
Where is it?

470
00:39:04,431 --> 00:39:05,351
Is this the one?

471
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:07,591
Is this what you're looking for?

472
00:39:17,871 --> 00:39:19,951
<i>Now, I know how it feels like
to love someone.</i>

473
00:39:21,631 --> 00:39:23,551
<i>Whatever you do,</i>

474
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:26,071
<i>you can't turn away from your feelings.</i>

475
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,711
<i>You can't stop yourself from loving him.</i>

476
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:34,711
Si, why are you drinking so much?

477
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:35,991
What's wrong?

478
00:40:36,271 --> 00:40:38,431
I'm happy. Can't I drink to celebrate?

479
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:39,391
Celebrate?

480
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:41,111
What are you celebrating?

481
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:44,111
To celebrate that Lei and Shancai

482
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:45,671
are officially dating.

483
00:40:47,991 --> 00:40:49,031
How is that possible?

484
00:40:49,111 --> 00:40:50,351
Are you drunk?

485
00:40:50,911 --> 00:40:51,831
No.

486
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:53,791
I'm very sober.

487
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,191
After all this time,

488
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:57,111
I'm the most sober now.

489
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:01,551
How could that happen?

490
00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:03,751
Has Lei already decided?

491
00:41:08,911 --> 00:41:09,831
What's your plan?

492
00:41:13,191 --> 00:41:14,351
What do you mean?

493
00:41:14,991 --> 00:41:16,271
I wish them well, of course.

494
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:19,271
Don't you think this is great?

495
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,111
Si, cut it out.

496
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:22,871
How can you not care at all?

497
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:26,951
Do you want to kick Lei
out of F4 like before?

498
00:41:27,631 --> 00:41:29,431
No. Why would I do that?

499
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:31,511
Lei said

500
00:41:31,911 --> 00:41:33,071
I should wish him well,

501
00:41:34,271 --> 00:41:36,071
just like he did before.

502
00:41:38,311 --> 00:41:39,671
Si, this is not you.

503
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,351
Listen carefully.

504
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:43,031
If you really give her up this time,

505
00:41:43,111 --> 00:41:45,311
you might not have a chance anymore.

506
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:47,391
And that's Lei.

507
00:41:47,911 --> 00:41:49,151
It'll be more complicated now.

508
00:41:50,431 --> 00:41:53,511
If you regret it later,
you'll lose both friendship and love.

509
00:41:54,071 --> 00:41:55,071
Have you thought it out?

510
00:41:55,951 --> 00:41:57,431
Shancai and I are done.

511
00:42:01,191 --> 00:42:03,951
Are you saying you don't care
who Shancai will be seeing?

512
00:42:04,511 --> 00:42:05,711
Of course!

513
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:09,391
Come on. Let's toast for Lei!

514
00:42:17,711 --> 00:42:18,671
Si, you...

515
00:42:28,391 --> 00:42:31,311
Even if it's not necessary,
I still think I should tell you.

516
00:42:32,351 --> 00:42:34,471
I value F4's friendship.

517
00:42:35,631 --> 00:42:38,111
So please wish me well.

518
00:42:41,911 --> 00:42:44,671
Or would you rather have a fight with me?

519
00:42:45,991 --> 00:42:46,991
Then let's fight.

520
00:42:48,911 --> 00:42:49,991
Let me tell you again.

521
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:53,231
You don't have to tell me
what you want to do.

522
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,071
Do whatever you want.

523
00:42:58,791 --> 00:42:59,631
Si.

524
00:43:00,871 --> 00:43:02,311
Let me take care of Shancai.

525
00:43:16,391 --> 00:43:19,831
Don't you think
they're actually quite a match?

526
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:22,511
A stupid girl...

527
00:43:23,111 --> 00:43:25,511
and a sleepyhead who sleeps all the time.

528
00:43:27,911 --> 00:43:28,751
Si.
