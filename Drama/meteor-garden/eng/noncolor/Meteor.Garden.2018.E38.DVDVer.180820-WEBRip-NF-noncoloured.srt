EPISODE 38

4
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:34,887
Goodbye.

5
00:01:36,047 --> 00:01:37,007
<i>To me,</i>

6
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:39,847
<i>the "Once in a Lifetime"
for me and Xiaogeng</i>

7
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:44,207
<i>was the moment she turned around and left.</i>

8
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,967
You're hurting yourself this way.

9
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:57,087
<i>Until now,</i>

10
00:01:58,207 --> 00:01:59,807
<i>I still can't resist thinking</i>

11
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:02,047
<i>that if I went over</i>

12
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:04,487
<i>and hugged Xiaogeng tightly then,</i>

13
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:07,087
<i>what would happen to us</i>

14
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:09,407
<i>right now?</i>

15
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:23,167
Xiaogeng.

16
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,687
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,207
I shouldn't have stood you up.

18
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:07,967
<i>Would I be able to find it</i>

19
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:10,007
<i>without knowing what it is?</i>

20
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:12,807
<i>Should I give up now?</i>

21
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,367
<i>I've been to almost
all the buildings in Lujiazui.</i>

22
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:18,487
<i>Only a few are left</i>

23
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:20,847
<i>with a view of the Oriental Pearl Tower</i>

24
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,127
<i>and are accessible at 5:00 a.m.</i>

25
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:07,687
<i>What did she want me to see?</i>

26
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:10,047
<i>I'm still not sure at this point.</i>

27
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,727
<i>Is that the one?</i>

28
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:23,287
<i>No way, right?</i>

29
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,407
<i>It's so unimaginable.</i>

30
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:27,447
<i>Ximen.</i>

31
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:29,527
<i>I think I found it.</i>

32
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:31,567
<i>I found it.</i>

33
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:45,087
<i>Ximen.</i>

34
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,807
<i>I have something important to tell you.</i>

35
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:50,447
<i>You have to see me today, okay?</i>

36
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:02,687
<i>I'll wait for you at the third stop
of Lujiazui Metro Station.</i>

37
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:16,167
<i>You have to be there.</i>

38
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:18,607
<i>Okay?</i>

39
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:55,767
<i>Someone's inside.</i>

40
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:57,327
<i>Is it a thief?</i>

41
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:01,567
<i>Or Daoming Si's bodyguards?</i>

42
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:03,687
<i>No.</i>

43
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,447
<i>Ms. Zhuang already took care
of the bodyguards.</i>

44
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:09,887
<i>No matter who it is,
I have to make a move first.</i>

45
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:28,927
Go away!

46
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:31,007
Get out of here!

47
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,447
What are you doing?

48
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,367
Why are you waving that around?

49
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:40,087
Mom.

50
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:43,087
Thank goodness, it's you.
I thought it was a thief. I was so scared.

51
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:45,687
It's a good thing
that I have a strong heart.

52
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:47,127
Or you'd have scared me to death.

53
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:50,247
Mom, why are you here?

54
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,607
I called you last night,
but you didn't answer.

55
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,167
I wasn't home last night.

56
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:57,567
You weren't home?

57
00:06:57,647 --> 00:06:58,727
Where did you go?

58
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:03,567
I spent the night
at Daoming Si's house last night.

59
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:06,927
Daoming Si's house?

60
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:10,487
You two were all alone

61
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:11,687
and full of passion.

62
00:07:14,287 --> 00:07:15,567
No.

63
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:16,607
Not that.

64
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:18,447
It's not what you think.

65
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:26,767
Tell me.

66
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,127
Last night, did you and Daoming Si...

67
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:32,127
I mean, did you two seal the deal?

68
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:34,607
No.

69
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:36,807
Mom.

70
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,327
Don't you trust your daughter?

71
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:48,247
Yes, I spent the night
at his house last night.

72
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,407
-But I--
-But you're still

73
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:52,767
pure and innocent, right?

74
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:56,327
Mom.

75
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,647
Actually, he and I

76
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:00,967
are dating secretly.

77
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:02,567
We can't let his mom know.

78
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,087
What?

79
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:05,967
That wench still doesn't know?

80
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:09,167
How much more does she want you to suffer?

81
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:13,007
Daoming Feng is really crazy.

82
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,847
There must be something wrong in her head.

83
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:18,367
Where is she? Tell her to come out.

84
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:19,647
I want to talk to her.

85
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:22,447
Mom, stop it. She's not in Shanghai.

86
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:23,687
That's good.

87
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:25,447
Or else, I'd give her a piece of my mind.

88
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,447
Mom, how did you find time to visit me?

89
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:32,687
You know, that idea of yours
is really great.

90
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:36,127
Our squid business is doing really well.

91
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:38,927
Business is booming. We're so busy.

92
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:42,847
Your dad and I both have
high hopes for our future.

93
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:45,407
I initially didn't have time to come here.

94
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:47,527
But I really missed you.

95
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:50,647
I was curious how you're doing all alone.

96
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:53,767
So I came here today just to see you.

97
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:57,527
-Mom, wait here.
-Okay.

98
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,007
-This is for you.
-What is it?

99
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:09,767
Mom.

100
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:11,727
I know it's hard to do business.

101
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:13,847
But skin care is also very important.

102
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,007
Look at you.

103
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:17,367
There are fine lines around your eyes.

104
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:19,527
Are you saying that I look old?

105
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,847
All right. I know
you're concerned about me.

106
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:25,847
Mom.

107
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:27,087
I'm fine here.

108
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:29,447
-Really?
-Yes.

109
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,007
Is Daoming Si being nice to you?

110
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:32,367
Did he do anything bad to you?

111
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:34,727
No. He's quite nice to me.

112
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:38,567
That's good. I don't need to worry then.

113
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:44,087
This time, you seem different from before.

114
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,567
You're all grown up. You've matured.

115
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:48,447
Come on.

116
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:51,767
This is so nice.

117
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:17,527
<i>And now for our weather report,
starting on Wednesday,</i>

118
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:19,447
<i>due to strong winds from the north,</i>

119
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:22,527
<i>most of the East China region
will experience cold waves.</i>

120
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:25,487
EAST CHINA REGION TO EXPERIENCE
COLD WAVES. PLEASE KEEP WARM.

121
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:35,247
<i>When the cold waves come,</i>

122
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:37,967
<i>and the weather continues to be this bad,</i>

123
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,927
<i>it would be impossible for him to come.</i>

124
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:43,647
<i>So...</i>

125
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:46,247
<i>today might be our only chance.</i>

126
00:11:00,847 --> 00:11:04,527
<i>Sorry,</i> <i>the number you have dialed
is not accessible at this time.</i>

127
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:06,047
<i>Please try again later.</i>

128
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:39,087
Hello, Xiaoyou?

129
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:41,407
You haven't come
to the milk tea shop lately.

130
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:42,687
Did something happen?

131
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,007
Shancai, did you see Ximen?

132
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:47,207
I need to talk to him.

133
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:50,087
It's Ximen again.

134
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:51,407
Xiaoyou, you...

135
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:56,247
I haven't seen F4 the whole day.

136
00:11:57,127 --> 00:11:58,567
Then can you ask Daoming Si

137
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:00,887
if Ximen is with him?

138
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:04,847
What's the matter?
Why do you sound so anxious?

139
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:07,127
I have to see him today.

140
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:08,167
<i>Why?</i>

141
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:11,047
Just help me look for him first.

142
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:12,407
<i>Xiaoyou.</i>

143
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:16,047
For the past few weeks, you've been
keeping a lot of things from me.

144
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:18,527
I'm really worried, you know?

145
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,087
Shancai.

146
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:24,487
I know what I'm doing.

147
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:30,647
Today

148
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:32,527
is a very important day for me.

149
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:37,607
If "Once in a Lifetime" really exists,

150
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:39,287
I don't want to miss it.

151
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:41,527
Shancai...

152
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:45,607
<i>I know you're worried.</i>

153
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,327
I won't let myself get hurt.

154
00:12:49,647 --> 00:12:50,687
Trust me.

155
00:12:58,847 --> 00:12:59,727
All right.

156
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:01,687
I'll help you look for him.

157
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:05,327
Really?

158
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,647
Where should we meet?

159
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:11,447
I heard from Daoming Si

160
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:14,327
that they're going
to an art gallery here in Shanghai

161
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:15,727
for a symposium.

162
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,607
Let's meet there.
I think we'd find them there.

163
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:23,167
Okay. See you later.

164
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,167
Bye.

165
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:02,767
Any progress?

166
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,207
Still no news from him.

167
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,207
Xiaoyou.

168
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:15,047
Do you really need to see Ximen tonight?

169
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:17,607
We're going out the day after tomorrow.

170
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:19,407
Do you want to go with us then?

171
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:26,447
If possible, I want to see him tonight.

172
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:28,807
Why must it be tonight?

173
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:35,327
Because the cold waves are coming.

174
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:41,087
Cold waves?

175
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:47,047
Do you want Ximen to keep you warm?

176
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:48,527
Meizuo.

177
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:50,767
Stop teasing Xiaoyou.

178
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:54,727
All right.

179
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,807
I just want Xiaoyou to relax.

180
00:14:57,487 --> 00:14:58,567
Look at her knitted brows.

181
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,367
Ximen is not here yet,
but you'll have gone old

182
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:03,927
from waiting like this.

183
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:08,527
Thank you, Meizuo.

184
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:09,847
I'm fine.

185
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:13,007
Actually, you can go home first.

186
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:14,967
I can wait for him by myself.

187
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:24,447
All right.

188
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:46,247
I mean all right.

189
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:48,527
We'll wait with you until Ximen arrives.

190
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,087
Xiaoyou.

191
00:15:57,527 --> 00:15:58,487
It's all right.

192
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:00,287
We'll wait with you.

193
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,487
It's only 8:00 p.m. anyway.

194
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,927
<i>This stupid girl
can't even fix her own problems.</i>

195
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:12,967
<i>Yet she's worried about other people.</i>

196
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:45,687
Hey.

197
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:47,087
You three.

198
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:48,687
It's past midnight now.

199
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:49,807
Ximen is still not here.

200
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:51,527
Call and tell him to hurry up.

201
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,287
Lei, you call him.

202
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:01,607
Meizuo, you call him.
See if he's at the bar.

203
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:05,607
I called the bar earlier. He's not there.

204
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:13,847
What are you doing?

205
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:15,767
Help me look for him.

206
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:19,207
Okay, fine. Don't be mad.

207
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:30,407
<i>Sorry, the number you have dialed
is not accessible at this time.</i>

208
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:31,887
<i>Please try again later.</i>

209
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,207
Ximen, it's past midnight.

210
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,527
You're still not here.

211
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:50,727
What's going on?

212
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,607
Listen.

213
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:54,727
We won't leave until you get here.

214
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:57,167
And if you don't arrive soon,

215
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,247
we can't be friends anymore.

216
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,847
Because Shancai will kill us all.

217
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:08,687
We will all be dead.
See you in the next life.

218
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:27,607
Is that good enough?

219
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:40,927
Xiaoyou.

220
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:42,407
It'll be all right.

221
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:18,447
Please.

222
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:34,327
Thank you for the lesson.

223
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:37,887
I'll practice it when I get home.

224
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:42,007
Ximen.

225
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:46,167
When we last saw each other,

226
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,087
you were still in high school.

227
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,047
You're all grown up now.

228
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:51,687
How have you been?

229
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,847
Thank you for your concern.

230
00:19:58,087 --> 00:19:59,127
I'm fine.

231
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:07,247
Well, despite all challenges in life.

232
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:15,087
Life is full of ups and downs indeed.

233
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:17,367
You should be happy about it.

234
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:20,967
If life only goes smoothly,

235
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:24,087
that means you'll never grow up.

236
00:20:40,647 --> 00:20:41,887
Thanks for your concern.

237
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:23,407
<i>Ximen, where have you been the whole day?</i>

238
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:31,007
<i>Ximen, if you don't come now...</i>

239
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:33,687
<i>Never mind. I'll just sleep
in the coffee shop.</i>

240
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,807
<i>I regret not bringing
my sleeping bag with me.</i>

241
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:41,207
<i>Ximen, it's past midnight.</i>

242
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:42,487
<i>You're still not here.</i>

243
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,807
<i>What's going on?</i>

244
00:21:44,207 --> 00:21:46,407
<i>We won't leave until you get here.</i>

245
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:47,687
<i>And if you don't arrive soon,</i>

246
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:49,767
<i>we can't be friends anymore.</i>

247
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:52,607
<i>Because Shancai will kill us all.</i>

248
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:57,447
<i>We will all be dead.
See you in the next life.</i>

249
00:22:03,047 --> 00:22:03,967
<i>Ximen.</i>

250
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:05,847
<i>I have something important to tell you.</i>

251
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:08,127
<i>You have to see me today, okay?</i>

252
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:55,327
Hey.

253
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:58,327
Based on our height difference,

254
00:22:58,407 --> 00:23:00,367
isn't it uncomfortable
for you to sleep like this?

255
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:01,687
It is.

256
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:03,967
But I like it.

257
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:40,247
Xiaoyou.

258
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:44,687
We'll just find Ximen tomorrow, okay?

259
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:52,447
That's right.

260
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:55,447
When we find him tomorrow,
I'll surely beat him up for you.

261
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,567
And I'll force him to call you.

262
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,327
Sorry, everyone.

263
00:24:10,647 --> 00:24:12,487
I made you wait with me until now.

264
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:14,447
Because I...

265
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:16,807
I'm too impulsive.

266
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,327
Let's go.

267
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:26,087
It's all right, Xiaoyou.

268
00:24:26,327 --> 00:24:28,207
I'll surely find Ximen with you tomorrow.

269
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:46,047
Ximen.

270
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:54,247
Who do you think you are?

271
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:56,767
We've waited for you all night.

272
00:24:56,927 --> 00:24:58,687
You were gone the whole day.
Where did you go?

273
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:03,087
We were all just waiting for you.

274
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:04,807
Do you think you're that important?

275
00:25:05,527 --> 00:25:06,407
Am I not important?

276
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:07,767
Then I'll get going.

277
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:08,967
Get back here.

278
00:25:09,047 --> 00:25:10,967
-What are you doing?
-I want to beat you up.

279
00:25:11,047 --> 00:25:12,647
-Cut it out.
-Where did you go? Tell us.

280
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:14,087
Let Xiaoyou speak to him.

281
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:45,847
Even though I told you
I won't bother you again,

282
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:48,367
I think you have a right to know.

283
00:25:51,287 --> 00:25:54,167
Even if you treat me
like a stranger starting tomorrow,

284
00:25:54,327 --> 00:25:55,887
today, you have to do what I tell you.

285
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:01,607
What do you want?

286
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:06,407
Give me a chance

287
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:09,487
to show you what Xiaogeng
wanted you to see then.

288
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:40,927
It seems like the problem is solved.

289
00:26:41,447 --> 00:26:42,487
I'm leaving.

290
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,527
I'm going with you.

291
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,367
That's great. It's still dark.
We still have a chance.

292
00:27:23,047 --> 00:27:25,127
The elevators are not working
at this hour.

293
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:26,847
We can only take the stairs
to the rooftop.

294
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:30,087
What?

295
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:32,887
There's no time to waste.

296
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:35,287
Do you want to have more regrets?

297
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:11,647
We have to hurry.
There are about ten more floors to go.

298
00:28:32,007 --> 00:28:32,887
Are you all right?

299
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:07,367
Can you still go on?

300
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,127
I'm fine.

301
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:17,647
There's no time.

302
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:20,687
Why don't you go ahead?

303
00:29:57,847 --> 00:30:00,447
I think it's almost time.

304
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:10,527
I searched all over

305
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:12,687
before I found this building.

306
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:16,127
I remember you told me

307
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:19,807
that Xiaogeng asked you to come

308
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:22,487
during this season, at this specific time.

309
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:27,647
At first, I didn't get it.

310
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:29,567
It was until yesterday morning

311
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:31,727
when I saw the news about the cold waves.

312
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:33,367
Then I knew

313
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:35,607
that if you miss the timing,

314
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:38,647
she would never have a chance to tell you

315
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:41,207
what she wanted to say.

316
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:48,047
Look over there.

317
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:16,807
XIMEN BUILDING, MY BELOVED

318
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:39,127
The words on the building in front

319
00:31:39,487 --> 00:31:41,047
will disappear temporarily

320
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:42,687
for three minutes

321
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,327
due to the sun's refraction.

322
00:31:45,327 --> 00:31:48,327
XIMEN, MY BELOVED

323
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:21,967
What an idiot.

324
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:29,367
She asked me to come so early
in the morning just for this.

325
00:32:33,007 --> 00:32:33,967
She's so silly.

326
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:38,287
She's really silly.

327
00:32:57,247 --> 00:33:02,487
XIMEN, MY BELOVED

328
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:27,207
Hey.

329
00:33:28,087 --> 00:33:30,247
After waiting for Ximen,
we're now waiting for Xiaoyou.

330
00:33:30,647 --> 00:33:32,127
We had dinner and now breakfast.

331
00:33:32,687 --> 00:33:34,007
How long do we have to wait?

332
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:42,167
Go home if you're tired.

333
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:44,207
Xiaoyou is my best friend.

334
00:33:44,727 --> 00:33:47,047
I won't leave until I hear back from her.

335
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:49,567
You only care about your best friend.

336
00:33:49,807 --> 00:33:51,887
I wish you had the same concern for us.

337
00:33:54,687 --> 00:33:56,287
What's there to be concerned about?

338
00:33:57,727 --> 00:33:58,887
You think I don't notice

339
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:00,767
how uncomfortable you are
staying at my house?

340
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:09,567
What else can I do?

341
00:34:35,127 --> 00:34:36,607
What does this mean?

342
00:34:38,447 --> 00:34:39,807
I've been wanting to tell you this.

343
00:34:40,487 --> 00:34:41,927
I don't want to sneak around anymore.

344
00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:49,967
How long do you think
my sister can help keep this a secret?

345
00:34:56,087 --> 00:34:57,007
So,

346
00:34:58,207 --> 00:35:01,327
you want me to live with you in London?

347
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:06,287
But...

348
00:35:07,447 --> 00:35:09,407
But my English is very bad.

349
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:13,047
And the only thing I know about London
is that London Bridge is falling down.

350
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:14,247
-It's dangerous--
-Shancai.

351
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:18,127
I want to make our relationship public.

352
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:20,247
I don't want to sneak around.

353
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:21,767
I'm not happy about this.

354
00:35:21,847 --> 00:35:22,807
And neither are you.

355
00:35:26,727 --> 00:35:29,007
-But your mom--
-So before anything happens,

356
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:30,527
we must convince my mom.

357
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:34,487
How is that possible?

358
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:36,047
How is that impossible?

359
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,327
Even though she's hard to convince,

360
00:35:38,687 --> 00:35:39,847
she's still my mom.

361
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:44,567
I think I just need to tell her how I feel
and she'd understand me sooner or later.

362
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:47,327
Trust me. Just follow my lead.

363
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:55,327
That's all. Give me an answer tomorrow.
I'll go and get some sleep.

364
00:36:02,647 --> 00:36:03,887
It's not that simple.

365
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:07,247
You don't know the things
your mom did to me.

366
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:10,527
Can I trust you?

367
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,847
Si and Dong Shancai are dating.

368
00:36:33,807 --> 00:36:36,367
What happened to the bodyguards I sent?

369
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:38,447
They've been paid off.

370
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:40,527
Paid off?

371
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:42,927
By Zhuang?

372
00:36:45,127 --> 00:36:48,167
And Si rented the place next door
to Dong Shancai.

373
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:49,647
They're living closely together.

374
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:03,007
Your White Jasmine Dew.

375
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:03,927
Thank you.

376
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:05,047
Please come again.

377
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:13,567
Can we resolve this

378
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:16,007
if we go to London?

379
00:37:37,407 --> 00:37:38,807
Xiaoyou?

380
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:42,767
Thank you for helping me
look for Ximen that day.

381
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:44,527
I wasn't even able to thank you then.

382
00:37:44,807 --> 00:37:45,887
Thank you very much.

383
00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:50,687
Your hair...

384
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:54,327
I just had a haircut.

385
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:56,527
Do I look like a boy?
Does it look strange?

386
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:00,047
No. It's nice.

387
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:01,767
-Really?
-Yes.

388
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:06,767
But why did you cut your hair?

389
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:08,247
Did something happen?

390
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,327
No.

391
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:12,007
I just wanted a change.

392
00:38:12,247 --> 00:38:14,927
And I've had long hair for so long.
I've grown tired of it.

393
00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:20,007
<i>Suddenly cutting her hair short,</i>

394
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:22,087
<i>suddenly wanting some changes,</i>

395
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,487
<i>those seem to be things
a broken-hearted person would do.</i>

396
00:38:26,047 --> 00:38:27,047
I'll go get changed then.

397
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:30,647
Hey, Xiaoyou.

398
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:36,407
Did you and Ximen...

399
00:38:38,327 --> 00:38:39,207
Shancai.

400
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:41,167
I want to date again.

401
00:38:46,327 --> 00:38:47,407
This time,

402
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:50,847
I really want to have
a happy relationship.

403
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,327
Sorry.

404
00:38:58,087 --> 00:38:59,367
I made you so worried

405
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:01,607
this time around.

406
00:39:03,447 --> 00:39:06,447
But I already did my best.

407
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:09,967
I feel at peace now.

408
00:39:15,047 --> 00:39:16,087
You did your best?

409
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:17,527
What does that mean?

410
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:19,287
Did something happen with Ximen again?

411
00:39:21,327 --> 00:39:22,727
Just give me a little more time.

412
00:39:23,767 --> 00:39:25,447
I'd tell you everything when I'm ready.

413
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:27,207
You'd listen to me, right?

414
00:39:28,687 --> 00:39:29,527
Yes.

415
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:36,367
<i>The gentle Xiaoyou</i>

416
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,007
<i>recklessly did everything</i>

417
00:39:38,407 --> 00:39:39,967
<i>for the person she loves.</i>

418
00:39:41,327 --> 00:39:45,207
<i>I suddenly feel like
Xiaoyou has matured a lot.</i>

419
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:48,207
<i>She looks especially brilliant
and attractive.</i>

420
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,447
<i>And I</i>

421
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:54,727
<i>haven't listened to my heart</i>

422
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:58,447
<i>like she does for such a long time.</i>

423
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:01,927
<i>Even though she's hard to convince,</i>

424
00:40:02,127 --> 00:40:03,287
<i>she's still my mom.</i>

425
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:06,447
I think I just need to tell her how I feel

426
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:08,447
and she'd understand me sooner or later.

427
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,687
Trust me. Just follow my lead.

428
00:40:12,687 --> 00:40:13,767
<i>This time,</i>

429
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:17,927
<i>I should also be ready
to fight for my future.</i>

430
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:21,447
I have to trust Daoming Si.

431
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,847
-Where are we eating?
-At a western restaurant.

432
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:32,727
We'll be there soon.

433
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:34,447
Let's go.

434
00:41:09,407 --> 00:41:11,887
This is the new smart jewelry from Italy.

435
00:41:12,447 --> 00:41:14,007
It's a hot trend right now.

436
00:41:16,647 --> 00:41:19,727
The most important thing is it lets lovers
stay connected with one another.

437
00:41:22,287 --> 00:41:23,327
What do you mean by that?

438
00:41:23,967 --> 00:41:26,287
These bracelets are connected
with the mobile app.

439
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,967
Every time you think of each other
or need each other,

440
00:41:29,047 --> 00:41:30,807
just lightly tap on it like this.

441
00:41:33,047 --> 00:41:34,727
No matter how far you are from each other,

442
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:38,287
you'll receive the thought automatically
as it lights up and vibrates.

443
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:41,087
That's amazing.

444
00:41:41,727 --> 00:41:44,887
So every time it lights up,
it means he's thinking of you.

445
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:51,887
Do you like it?

446
00:41:53,047 --> 00:41:53,967
Yes.
