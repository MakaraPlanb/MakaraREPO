EPISODE 5

4
00:02:39,252 --> 00:02:41,492
It looks like Lei is going
to confess to Jing.

5
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:43,612
Aren't they already together?

6
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:48,572
I thought when they were in Sanya,
they had...

7
00:02:50,132 --> 00:02:51,132
Had what?

8
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:52,452
Nothing.

9
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:55,852
What kind of relationship
do they have now, then?

10
00:02:57,972 --> 00:02:59,652
Jing is someone very important to Lei.

11
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:03,852
<i>Lei actually suffered
from a mild case of autism.</i>

12
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,332
<i>His mom was particularly strict too.</i>

13
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:09,252
<i>His autism got worse because of that.</i>

14
00:03:11,852 --> 00:03:13,812
<i>We didn't know how to help him.</i>

15
00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:16,812
<i>Thankfully, Jing appeared.</i>

16
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,412
<i>No matter how indifferent Lei was,
how much he avoided her,</i>

17
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:24,612
<i>Jing wouldn't stop looking for him.</i>

18
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:29,132
<i>The reason Lei is who he is today...</i>

19
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:30,372
LET'S GO PLAY, OKAY?

20
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:31,652
<i>Is because of Jing.</i>

21
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:56,812
I have something to tell you.

22
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:00,172
I--

23
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:01,972
I know.

24
00:05:17,772 --> 00:05:20,492
<i>Thanks, everyone,
for coming to the party tonight.</i>

25
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:22,092
Ladies and gentlemen,

26
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,292
please welcome the birthday girl,
Teng Tangjing,

27
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:25,692
to make her birthday wish.

28
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:44,412
Thank you for taking the time
to come to my birthday party.

29
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,332
Today, I'm turning 24.

30
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:49,532
After my graduation,

31
00:05:50,372 --> 00:05:52,212
it's time to make some
real life decisions.

32
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:55,452
There's something

33
00:05:56,892 --> 00:05:58,652
I'd like to announce here.

34
00:06:03,372 --> 00:06:04,292
I've decided

35
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:08,292
to give up my position
as the heir of Tengtang Investment Group

36
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:11,732
to join Lawyers Without Borders.

37
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:13,492
-What?
-Is she really going to?

38
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:15,172
I want to help the poor.

39
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:18,972
Jing, what are you blabbering about?

40
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:25,852
Dad, Mom.

41
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:28,532
I'm sorry.

42
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:31,012
Please forgive my stubbornness.

43
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,092
Pretend you married off your daughter.

44
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:38,772
I'll be going back to Paris in a few days.

45
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:42,532
I've no immediate plans to come back.

46
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:47,252
All this while, thanks to my family,

47
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:50,732
I've led a blessed and comfortable life.

48
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:54,132
But I know,

49
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:58,012
living a comfortable life
without a real purpose

50
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:00,372
is not what I want.

51
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,052
From now on,

52
00:07:05,052 --> 00:07:06,132
I no longer need

53
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:09,172
these beautiful clothes

54
00:07:10,372 --> 00:07:11,492
needing delicate care.

55
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,652
I want to be myself.

56
00:07:59,332 --> 00:08:00,172
Lei!

57
00:08:12,612 --> 00:08:13,452
Hey.

58
00:08:14,612 --> 00:08:15,452
You shouldn't go.

59
00:08:19,492 --> 00:08:20,332
Lei.

60
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:56,772
I'm sorry.

61
00:08:59,892 --> 00:09:02,172
I know what you had wanted to tell me.

62
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:03,932
I cannot say yes.

63
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:11,692
You only need to say a few words

64
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:15,772
in support of the partnership
between your mother and my company.

65
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:17,772
I'd be deeply grateful.

66
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:21,892
I'm sorry. I never paid much attention
to my mom's business.

67
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:23,412
I can't add much.

68
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,772
All you need to do
is put in a few good words.

69
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:28,852
I'll be happy to oblige
any requests you have.

70
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:30,532
If you insist that I say something,

71
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:32,492
I guess you'll need to wait
until I take over.

72
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:36,012
Not to mention,

73
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:38,852
only if your company
could survive until then.

74
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:41,972
If you won't help, fine. Damn you.

75
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:52,692
Hey! Why were you eavesdropping?

76
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:01,332
Why would I eavesdrop on you?

77
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:03,972
Stop getting ahead of yourself.

78
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:07,252
Who would want to listen
to all your bullshit?

79
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:09,932
As if you're so incredible.

80
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:13,172
"As if"? I am incredible.

81
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:16,132
Do you know how many people
want to see my mom, but they can't?

82
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:18,852
Anyone that can't see her
come to me instead.

83
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,252
It's a winner-take-all world.

84
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:22,852
You won't understand.

85
00:11:23,572 --> 00:11:26,372
This is exactly your problem.
You think you're all that.

86
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:29,492
That's how you managed to get
the model just now.

87
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:31,852
What a professional!

88
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:36,692
Hey, those girls are only after me
because of the Daoming name.

89
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:39,172
I would never be with a girl like that.

90
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:40,492
Why are you yelling at me?

91
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:42,812
You've brought me nothing but trouble.

92
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,332
Also,

93
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:46,732
you haven't apologized

94
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:48,852
for what happened last time.

95
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,332
Why should I apologize?

96
00:11:50,412 --> 00:11:52,972
-It was your fault!
-What did I do?

97
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:55,092
-You never said anything.
-That's why you're an idiot.

98
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,492
You don't even know what you did wrong.

99
00:11:57,052 --> 00:11:59,452
You're the idiot.

100
00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:00,932
Hey.

101
00:12:01,172 --> 00:12:02,012
Hey!

102
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:03,452
What are you doing?

103
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:06,212
You shouldn't do this in public.

104
00:12:07,212 --> 00:12:08,532
-Listen up.
-Isn't that Daoming Si?

105
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:10,492
You fell on me.

106
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:11,532
I didn't do anything.

107
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,492
It just looks like I did something to you.

108
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:17,532
Gross.

109
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,452
Gross?

110
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:21,972
Hey, are you okay?

111
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:23,132
Hey!

112
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:26,252
Hey! Stop, no!

113
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:28,452
What the hell?

114
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:11,132
Mom.

115
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:13,772
How did I get home last night?

116
00:13:14,132 --> 00:13:15,492
Are you seriously asking me?

117
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:18,252
Daoming Si brought you home.

118
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:19,612
What?

119
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,732
Daoming Si did?

120
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:22,812
Yes.

121
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,252
Daoming Si is truly a nice guy.

122
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,412
He's handsome and so thoughtful.

123
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:30,132
Not to mention, a real gentleman.

124
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:33,852
If he were my son-in-law,
I'd smile in my sleep.

125
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:37,012
I feel like my head is exploding.

126
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:39,452
Sit down and rest then.

127
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:41,092
Why are you still here?

128
00:14:00,452 --> 00:14:01,652
-Zhen is there.
-Let's go.

129
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:10,572
Zhen, what happened at home yesterday?

130
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:11,772
Is it settled?

131
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:13,212
It wasn't a big deal.

132
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,212
What's wrong? Are you sick?

133
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,932
I'm fine. I've taken medication.

134
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:23,572
Oh, Zhen.

135
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:26,892
Do you want to see the photos
we took at Jing's birthday party?

136
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:27,812
Here.

137
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:31,292
Xiaoyou and I had so many
French pastries last night.

138
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:33,812
And Jing looked amazingly beautiful.

139
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:36,412
Aren't these photos great?

140
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:38,132
They're great.

141
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,572
And you know what?

142
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,052
Jing actually announced
that she's giving up her inheritance.

143
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:45,692
She's going to study law in France.

144
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:48,932
And she cut off her hair
to show her determination.

145
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:51,692
-We were all shocked.
-Yes.

146
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,252
I heard from some seniors who were there.

147
00:14:57,372 --> 00:14:59,132
Why are you eating so little today?

148
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:02,212
Money is a little tight at home lately.

149
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:04,372
I'm not feeling well.

150
00:15:04,452 --> 00:15:05,292
I should go.

151
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:08,612
Remember to take your medication.

152
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:28,292
Dong Shancai.

153
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:32,372
Dong Shancai.

154
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:52,532
Don't you have anything to say?

155
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:56,492
What do you want?

156
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:01,772
You ruined my suit last night.

157
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:03,692
Not even a sorry from you?

158
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:09,372
You haven't apologized
for what happened last time either.

159
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:17,572
If you don't want to apologize,
shouldn't you at least thank me?

160
00:16:18,892 --> 00:16:21,292
Don't forget that I carried you home.

161
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:25,372
You want me to thank you?

162
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:27,172
Okay.

163
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,532
Listen carefully.

164
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:31,652
Thank you.

165
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:36,972
What now?

166
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:40,652
You were so drunk last night.

167
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:42,732
You said so many things.

168
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:48,772
Jing is going back to Paris.

169
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:50,532
Is that why you're happy?

170
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:53,012
Do you think

171
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:55,412
you can be with Lei now?

172
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,652
Are you all right?

173
00:17:57,652 --> 00:17:58,692
Do I look like I'm not?

174
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,892
You must be shocked
by Jing's decision too, right?

175
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:07,292
Are you going to let her go?

176
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:11,452
That isn't my decision to make.

177
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,652
Jing has always been strong-willed.

178
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:15,052
She chooses her own path.

179
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:17,292
She doesn't like being dictated to.

180
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:22,172
This is just like what she'd do.

181
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:24,972
But if she really left,

182
00:18:25,212 --> 00:18:27,692
she'll be in Paris
while you're in Shanghai.

183
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:28,612
What if...

184
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:34,812
What if she fell in love
with someone else?

185
00:18:35,372 --> 00:18:36,332
What then?

186
00:18:40,092 --> 00:18:41,252
Go and stop her.

187
00:18:42,172 --> 00:18:44,092
You want her to stay, don't you?

188
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:46,212
Maybe she'll listen to you.

189
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:48,212
No.

190
00:18:49,972 --> 00:18:51,092
Once Jing makes a decision,

191
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:55,052
nobody can do anything to change her mind.

192
00:18:56,692 --> 00:18:59,292
<i>When I heard that Jing is going to France,</i>

193
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:01,412
<i>there was a brief moment</i>

194
00:19:01,732 --> 00:19:04,092
<i>when I felt a sudden flash of happiness.</i>

195
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:07,012
<i>I thought maybe with Jing gone,</i>

196
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:10,972
<i>Huaze Lei would forget about her
and notice me, who's right here.</i>

197
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:14,132
<i>But right now,</i>

198
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:17,212
<i>all those selfish thoughts
are out the window.</i>

199
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:22,172
<i>This is the first time that I've seen
Huaze Lei so depressed.</i>

200
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:26,252
<i>Deep down, I don't feel happy either.</i>

201
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:35,252
Thanks for coming to my party.

202
00:19:37,332 --> 00:19:40,132
There were too many people.
I didn't have the chance to talk to you.

203
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:44,212
Why did you want to see me?

204
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:49,692
Jing.

205
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:53,892
Can you not go to Paris?

206
00:19:54,452 --> 00:19:56,812
There are places in Shanghai
for international studies too.

207
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:59,412
Did Lei ask you to say this?

208
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:00,972
No.

209
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:02,932
It's all me.

210
00:20:03,972 --> 00:20:05,412
I can tell that Huaze Lei

211
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:07,892
really looked forward to you
coming back from London.

212
00:20:09,012 --> 00:20:10,772
He didn't try to stop you going to Paris

213
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:13,972
because he didn't want to pressure you.

214
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:15,852
Actually,

215
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:18,772
he really wants you to stay with him.

216
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:22,212
He'd be really sad if you left.

217
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:26,132
So...

218
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:28,412
So can you please...

219
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:30,652
not go?

220
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:33,132
For Huaze Lei.

221
00:20:35,252 --> 00:20:36,172
Shancai.

222
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:38,492
I'm sorry.

223
00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:40,492
I can't do it.

224
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:43,412
Jing.

225
00:20:47,852 --> 00:20:49,812
I wouldn't want Lei to be sad too.

226
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:52,372
But...

227
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:56,212
call me stubborn or selfish.

228
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,092
I won't change my mind for anyone.

229
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:06,012
Huaze Lei told me the same thing.

230
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:09,172
But I don't get it.

231
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,412
Don't you like him?

232
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:17,772
To me,

233
00:21:18,572 --> 00:21:20,492
love isn't the most important thing
in this world.

234
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:23,372
The most important thing to me

235
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:26,572
is to go after what I dream of.

236
00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:30,732
I don't like regrets.

237
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:33,292
I'm going to push through

238
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,852
and fight for my own dream.

239
00:21:37,852 --> 00:21:38,692
Shancai.

240
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:40,692
Thanks for your concern.

241
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:43,732
I need to go now.

242
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:52,612
What are you doing?

243
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,532
What was that about?

244
00:22:06,172 --> 00:22:07,332
Who asked you to do it?

245
00:22:10,852 --> 00:22:13,012
-I thought I could--
-What?

246
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:17,052
I thought I could persuade her.

247
00:22:17,612 --> 00:22:18,692
Who do you think you are?

248
00:22:18,852 --> 00:22:20,292
Did you think you were being helpful?

249
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:22,692
Stop interfering!

250
00:22:27,332 --> 00:22:28,332
But...

251
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:31,692
you two might not meet again.

252
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,292
I don't want to see you sad.

253
00:22:34,852 --> 00:22:36,012
It's none of your business.

254
00:22:36,932 --> 00:22:37,772
Get lost!

255
00:23:09,252 --> 00:23:11,492
Do a headstand when you want to cry.

256
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:13,532
This way, the tears won't fall.

257
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:54,772
<i>Why?</i>

258
00:23:55,812 --> 00:23:58,012
<i>Why was Huaze Lei so angry?</i>

259
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:00,692
<i>What did I do wrong?</i>

260
00:24:01,132 --> 00:24:02,172
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

261
00:24:02,332 --> 00:24:03,852
<i>Did you think you were being helpful?</i>

262
00:24:09,812 --> 00:24:11,332
<i>Huaze Lei is right.</i>

263
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:15,852
<i>What right do I have
to interfere with Jing?</i>

264
00:24:18,172 --> 00:24:19,972
<i>I just made it harder for him.</i>

265
00:24:25,012 --> 00:24:31,332
INTERNATIONAL DEPARTURE

266
00:24:31,412 --> 00:24:33,092
You still can't reach Lei?

267
00:24:34,612 --> 00:24:36,132
He's been out of reach since yesterday.

268
00:24:37,772 --> 00:24:40,732
He knows very well that Jing is leaving.

269
00:24:41,572 --> 00:24:42,812
He didn't answer my call.

270
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:45,292
Maybe my phone would work.

271
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:47,012
Should I call him?

272
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:56,532
<i>Huaze Lei won't even come to say goodbye?</i>

273
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,572
Si.

274
00:25:00,812 --> 00:25:02,372
Isn't Lei with you?

275
00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:03,692
He's not here?

276
00:25:12,492 --> 00:25:13,492
What's that box?

277
00:25:14,892 --> 00:25:15,732
This?

278
00:25:16,092 --> 00:25:17,772
It's a present for Jing.

279
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:18,892
It's something special.

280
00:25:18,972 --> 00:25:20,492
I won't show it to just anyone.

281
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,092
-Let me see.
-No.

282
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:24,012
-Come on, let me.
-No.

283
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:24,932
Thanks.

284
00:25:25,012 --> 00:25:25,852
Thank you!

285
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:31,692
What is wrong with you?

286
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:33,172
-What, Qinghe?
-What?

287
00:25:33,252 --> 00:25:34,572
-It was pretty funny.
-Not at all.

288
00:25:34,652 --> 00:25:37,292
<i>If Huaze Lei could be more like this guy,</i>

289
00:25:37,532 --> 00:25:39,052
<i>he wouldn't be so miserable.</i>

290
00:25:46,332 --> 00:25:47,172
Hey.

291
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,132
Why do you look so sad?

292
00:25:49,212 --> 00:25:50,612
You're already ugly.

293
00:25:50,772 --> 00:25:52,612
Looking sad just makes it worse.

294
00:25:56,132 --> 00:25:57,012
Daoming Si.

295
00:25:57,892 --> 00:25:59,292
Do you have someone you like?

296
00:26:01,372 --> 00:26:02,492
Why the sudden question?

297
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:07,332
This is how it is when you like someone.

298
00:26:08,212 --> 00:26:09,572
As long as they're happy,

299
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:12,052
it's okay to stand

300
00:26:13,092 --> 00:26:14,492
and watch them from a distance.

301
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:18,052
How stupid must you be
to say such a thing?

302
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:21,932
If that's the case,
it's as good as nothing.

303
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:24,132
What if you died tomorrow?

304
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:25,852
A lifetime of regret?

305
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:28,172
If you won't say it,

306
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:30,572
do you expect them to drill into your head

307
00:26:30,692 --> 00:26:32,292
to see how depressed you are?

308
00:26:33,212 --> 00:26:34,212
<i>What a surprise.</i>

309
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:36,732
<i>A childish idiot like him
managed to verbalize</i>

310
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:39,932
<i>the problem that's been weighing heavily</i>

311
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:41,892
<i>on my mind and Huaze Lei's.</i>

312
00:26:49,972 --> 00:26:52,012
Hey, why are you staring
into space, idiot?

313
00:26:53,172 --> 00:26:54,212
You're the idiot.

314
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:56,372
Nobody curses themselves to die tomorrow.

315
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:01,852
Jing.

316
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:09,052
I'm leaving.

317
00:27:10,052 --> 00:27:11,332
You guys take care.

318
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:12,252
-Take care.
-Take care.

319
00:27:14,572 --> 00:27:15,652
All the best.

320
00:27:22,212 --> 00:27:24,652
I'll miss you. Stay healthy.

321
00:27:28,092 --> 00:27:30,372
Shancai, I'm sure you'll find happiness.

322
00:27:31,372 --> 00:27:32,412
You too.

323
00:27:38,332 --> 00:27:41,452
Tell Lei to take care of himself.

324
00:27:41,532 --> 00:27:43,932
Don't worry. I'll beat him up for you.

325
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,252
Also,

326
00:27:46,172 --> 00:27:47,692
stop bullying Shancai.

327
00:27:50,492 --> 00:27:52,532
No one has time for that.

328
00:27:54,852 --> 00:27:55,692
For you.

329
00:27:55,772 --> 00:27:57,252
Jing, watch out.

330
00:27:57,412 --> 00:27:58,372
You know, this box is--

331
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:01,292
Here.

332
00:28:01,372 --> 00:28:04,212
<i>-Passengers on flight</i>
-I'll cherish it

333
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:08,452
<i>-AF520 to Paris,</i>
-no matter what it is.

334
00:28:09,652 --> 00:28:12,572
-<i>please check in at the boarding gate.</i>
-Time to go. Goodbye.

335
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:15,812
-<i>Please have your passport ready...</i>
-Bye. All the best.

336
00:28:15,892 --> 00:28:16,892
Okay.

337
00:28:25,652 --> 00:28:26,732
Goodbye!

338
00:28:38,612 --> 00:28:39,812
I can't believe Jing just left.

339
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:42,412
And Lei didn't show up.

340
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:46,932
Lei.

341
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:51,372
When did you get here?

342
00:28:53,052 --> 00:28:54,132
An hour ago.

343
00:28:55,252 --> 00:28:56,252
But we didn't see you.

344
00:28:57,212 --> 00:28:58,452
I was behind the pillar.

345
00:29:00,052 --> 00:29:01,292
Why were you hiding?

346
00:29:03,372 --> 00:29:05,332
Are you satisfied
with seeing her go like that?

347
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:07,532
What kind of man are you?

348
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:10,692
People like you who have everything

349
00:29:11,412 --> 00:29:12,932
have no idea how to work for something.

350
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,932
Jing is brave enough to find her own path.

351
00:29:17,012 --> 00:29:20,252
Why can't you man up
and go after the person you like?

352
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:22,932
Go after her if you really like her.

353
00:29:23,532 --> 00:29:25,132
Follow her wherever she goes.

354
00:29:28,772 --> 00:29:30,412
I'm taking the next flight to Paris.

355
00:29:34,612 --> 00:29:36,012
-Well...
-What's this?

356
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:39,972
If you said it a minute later,
I would have punched you.

357
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:45,732
Shancai, you're right.

358
00:29:47,372 --> 00:29:48,732
I can't go on like this.

359
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:52,772
This time, I'm going to go for it.

360
00:29:59,492 --> 00:30:00,532
Thank you.

361
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:04,252
-Hey.
-Bye.

362
00:30:04,372 --> 00:30:05,532
It's fine. It was just a peck.

363
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:07,612
-Just a peck.
-A peck.

364
00:30:07,692 --> 00:30:09,132
-I won't have it.
-It was just a peck.

365
00:30:09,212 --> 00:30:10,052
-I'm--
-Hey.

366
00:30:10,132 --> 00:30:10,972
Hey!

367
00:30:12,052 --> 00:30:13,412
It was just a peck.

368
00:30:13,892 --> 00:30:15,372
-All right.
-Hey!

369
00:30:15,452 --> 00:30:16,412
It was nothing.

370
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:31,812
Lei may look timid,

371
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,172
but he can be tenacious at times.

372
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:37,212
Shancai is the one that got to him.

373
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:39,532
I didn't expect that.

374
00:30:40,412 --> 00:30:41,932
Isn't she infatuated with him?

375
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:44,212
Why did she urge him to go after Jing?

376
00:30:44,852 --> 00:30:48,172
Besides, she didn't get into an argument
while talking to Si just now.

377
00:30:48,252 --> 00:30:49,492
How odd.

378
00:30:50,452 --> 00:30:53,012
Maybe that's the power of love.

379
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:54,652
It's a mystery.

380
00:30:58,612 --> 00:31:01,692
<i>You had to take Huaze Lei to Jing</i>

381
00:31:02,412 --> 00:31:04,492
<i>and let them have a happy life together.</i>

382
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:13,612
I actually tried to preach to Huaze Lei.

383
00:31:14,652 --> 00:31:16,172
Shame on me.

384
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,812
Dong Shancai.

385
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:39,052
Let's date.

386
00:31:48,252 --> 00:31:49,412
What did you say?

387
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:51,812
Are you deaf?

388
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:55,972
It was too noisy. I couldn't hear.

389
00:31:57,012 --> 00:31:57,972
What was it?

390
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:05,372
Hey! Are you stupid?

391
00:32:05,452 --> 00:32:07,012
I can't say it again.

392
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,252
Is this your secret weapon to get girls?

393
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:30,172
"Limited edition aphrodisiac perfume
to attract the other sex."

394
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:33,412
This is the funniest joke I've ever seen.

395
00:32:33,492 --> 00:32:36,452
Si, you know what?
My friend is the one selling the perfume.

396
00:32:36,532 --> 00:32:37,932
Should I order one for you?

397
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:40,452
Si, you better stash that away properly.

398
00:32:40,532 --> 00:32:43,292
We won't have you ruin
F4's reputation if people found out.

399
00:32:43,372 --> 00:32:44,412
Go away.

400
00:32:52,172 --> 00:32:54,412
Come on, you're wasting your resources.

401
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:57,212
You've got two love experts right here.

402
00:32:57,492 --> 00:32:58,972
Why are you reading that nonsense?

403
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:00,612
First, we want to know.

404
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,252
Who's the target?

405
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:06,852
Could it be Dong Shancai?

406
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:08,892
No way.

407
00:33:08,972 --> 00:33:11,212
Shancai is infatuated with the other guy.

408
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:14,452
Right. No matter who it is,

409
00:33:14,852 --> 00:33:16,812
those ads are to trick nerds.

410
00:33:17,812 --> 00:33:20,332
But you're Daoming Si.
You're not like them.

411
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:22,372
Now,

412
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:25,732
just let us handle the dating thing.

413
00:33:29,412 --> 00:33:31,612
Tell me then, what would you guys do?

414
00:33:33,252 --> 00:33:35,892
First, you must never be late

415
00:33:36,572 --> 00:33:37,972
to a date.

416
00:33:43,612 --> 00:33:45,852
<i>You need to arrive
at least ten minutes early.</i>

417
00:33:46,852 --> 00:33:48,132
<i>So when she sees you,</i>

418
00:33:48,412 --> 00:33:50,292
<i>she'll know how important
the date is to you.</i>

419
00:34:06,132 --> 00:34:09,692
<i>Pick a restaurant with a view
and an awesome atmosphere.</i>

420
00:34:10,332 --> 00:34:11,732
<i>Present her with a rose.</i>

421
00:34:23,612 --> 00:34:27,132
<i>With it, a card
that smells like strawberries.</i>

422
00:34:27,212 --> 00:34:28,772
<i>On the card is written...</i>

423
00:34:46,732 --> 00:34:49,972
<i>More ways to have a wonderful date.</i>

424
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:54,492
<i>Remember, no matter what she says,</i>

425
00:34:54,932 --> 00:34:56,852
<i>you need to look passionately
into her eyes.</i>

426
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:00,332
<i>Pay attention to what she says.</i>

427
00:35:00,412 --> 00:35:02,132
I had hives when I was younger.

428
00:35:02,212 --> 00:35:05,452
So every time I ate seafood,
I'd get rashes.

429
00:35:06,012 --> 00:35:09,212
The subject I disliked the most
in high school was Biology

430
00:35:09,332 --> 00:35:10,652
because we had to dissect frogs.

431
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:12,252
It was so scary!

432
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:16,252
You must have had hives
because you're too cute.

433
00:35:17,092 --> 00:35:18,772
The reason you're scared
of dissecting frogs

434
00:35:19,332 --> 00:35:21,532
must be because you're full of compassion.

435
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:24,892
<i>One thing you must remember.</i>

436
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:27,892
<i>If she asks about
what your past girlfriends were like,</i>

437
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,372
<i>you must never tell her the whole story.</i>

438
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:31,292
<i>Say...</i>

439
00:35:32,452 --> 00:35:33,412
So...

440
00:35:34,492 --> 00:35:36,012
What kind of girls do you like?

441
00:35:37,252 --> 00:35:39,612
To be honest, before I met you,

442
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,852
I didn't know what kind of girls I like.

443
00:35:50,812 --> 00:35:54,932
<i>If she mentions things that make her sad
or heartbroken and cries,</i>

444
00:35:55,292 --> 00:35:57,812
<i>you need to tell her
with a sincere gaze...</i>

445
00:35:58,012 --> 00:35:59,652
He left me just like that.

446
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:02,892
What did I do wrong?

447
00:36:03,612 --> 00:36:04,692
It's okay.

448
00:36:04,772 --> 00:36:07,932
He left so I could meet you.

449
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:10,852
<i>By now, you'd have won her heart.</i>

450
00:36:11,412 --> 00:36:14,772
<i>Keep your manners until the end.
Don't be too touchy at the start.</i>

451
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:19,772
<i>With romantic music playing,</i>

452
00:36:20,332 --> 00:36:22,772
<i>gaze at her affectionally
while you dance together.</i>

453
00:36:23,372 --> 00:36:26,692
<i>That is the perfect ending to a date.</i>

454
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:40,092
A date is when the souls
of a man and woman

455
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:41,892
have an intimate conversation.

456
00:36:42,332 --> 00:36:43,692
A perfect date

457
00:36:43,772 --> 00:36:45,972
is the best compliment
you can give to a girl.

458
00:36:46,692 --> 00:36:49,612
You're going to become
the most memorable man in her life.

459
00:36:50,452 --> 00:36:51,292
Hey.

460
00:36:52,492 --> 00:36:54,092
What was all that crap?

461
00:36:54,852 --> 00:36:56,052
It sounded gross to me.

462
00:37:00,212 --> 00:37:01,052
What?

463
00:37:01,132 --> 00:37:02,652
You're so pathetic
when it comes to romance.

464
00:37:03,652 --> 00:37:05,252
Yes, that's how I am.

465
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,532
Don't you have anything simpler?

466
00:37:08,732 --> 00:37:10,772
All right. I'll tell you something easy.

467
00:37:13,812 --> 00:37:14,692
Four words.

468
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:18,532
Play hard to get.

469
00:37:19,412 --> 00:37:20,412
Who's Harriet?

470
00:37:24,132 --> 00:37:25,492
Did you get a new girlfriend?

471
00:37:36,092 --> 00:37:38,812
I know, Dad. Stop nagging.

472
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,572
I assure you
I'm not being bullied at school.

473
00:37:42,532 --> 00:37:46,612
If anyone tries to touch me,
I'll slap them and tell them to get lost.

474
00:37:50,172 --> 00:37:52,092
NOTIFICATION FROM MINGDE UNIVERSITY BOARD

475
00:37:52,172 --> 00:37:53,092
Shancai.

476
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:54,292
Look at this.

477
00:37:54,412 --> 00:37:57,092
Daoming Si mentioned us
on the school's bulletin board.

478
00:37:57,412 --> 00:37:58,412
I'm going to be famous!

479
00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:01,172
It's only been a month

480
00:38:01,692 --> 00:38:03,172
and I'm already on the bulletin board.

481
00:38:03,812 --> 00:38:04,772
What?

482
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:09,052
"To everyone.

483
00:38:09,732 --> 00:38:11,492
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.,

484
00:38:11,572 --> 00:38:15,572
F4 will be challenging Chen Qinghe
and Dong Shancai

485
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:18,932
to a game of Poker."

486
00:38:19,652 --> 00:38:20,532
Yes.

487
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,052
I got the Joker card
right after I started school.

488
00:38:23,492 --> 00:38:25,252
I didn't expect the game
to happen so soon.

489
00:38:25,932 --> 00:38:28,652
I bet it's because Daoming Si lost to me
catching squid in Sanya.

490
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:30,932
So he's eager to even up the score.

491
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:32,892
I'm going to make a post.

492
00:38:33,332 --> 00:38:34,572
The title will be,

493
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:37,172
"The Ultimate Challenge with F4."

494
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:38,532
No.

495
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:41,572
Maybe "Duel of Masters" is better.

496
00:38:42,132 --> 00:38:43,892
"The Best Challenge in Mingde's History"?

497
00:38:43,972 --> 00:38:45,572
Shancai, which one is best?

498
00:38:45,732 --> 00:38:46,892
None of them.

499
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:48,972
We're dead meat!

500
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:50,532
Why are we dead meat?

501
00:38:50,612 --> 00:38:52,812
We get to choose
what we want to bet on, right?

502
00:38:53,692 --> 00:38:55,852
Let's think how we'll get back
at them when we win.

503
00:38:56,412 --> 00:38:57,852
It's not the right time for that.

504
00:38:58,412 --> 00:38:59,372
Why not?

505
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:01,572
It'll be too late when we win.

506
00:39:03,612 --> 00:39:07,052
If I won, I'd make F4 wear tutu skirts

507
00:39:07,132 --> 00:39:08,452
and do the Black Swan dance.

508
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:11,172
Or I'd ask Daoming Si to shave his head.

509
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:12,212
What do you think?

510
00:39:12,612 --> 00:39:14,452
It doesn't matter.

511
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,492
We'll never win.

512
00:39:16,572 --> 00:39:18,612
Don't worry. I'll get you
some intense poker training.

513
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:22,092
If that worked,
we wouldn't need the police.

514
00:39:22,772 --> 00:39:23,772
What?

515
00:39:25,852 --> 00:39:26,692
Nothing.

516
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:28,692
I'm just blabbering.

517
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:37,292
-What's going on?
-Yeah.

518
00:39:41,532 --> 00:39:42,532
They're here.

519
00:39:43,932 --> 00:39:45,852
-They actually showed up.
-That's him.

520
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:48,292
They really came.

521
00:39:48,532 --> 00:39:50,212
I thought they'd run away.

522
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:52,132
The outcome won't change.

523
00:39:52,212 --> 00:39:54,572
We'll wait and see how badly they lose.

524
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:11,372
Open the door.

525
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:12,852
Why me?

526
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,212
You're a girl. Ladies first.

527
00:40:19,092 --> 00:40:20,052
Together.

528
00:40:21,892 --> 00:40:22,932
Fine, together.

529
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:25,732
Three,

530
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:27,132
two,

531
00:40:27,212 --> 00:40:28,412
one.

532
00:40:30,572 --> 00:40:31,732
Why didn't you move?

533
00:40:33,132 --> 00:40:34,532
My legs are wobbly.

534
00:40:36,612 --> 00:40:37,452
One more time.

535
00:40:38,972 --> 00:40:40,052
Three,

536
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:41,452
two,

537
00:40:42,132 --> 00:40:42,972
one.

538
00:41:03,732 --> 00:41:05,332
Welcome to the Poker Room.

539
00:41:05,532 --> 00:41:08,332
I'm the referee today. Come in.

540
00:41:17,132 --> 00:41:18,812
What an extraordinary match.

541
00:41:19,572 --> 00:41:20,412
To be honest,

542
00:41:20,492 --> 00:41:22,692
I'm feeling a bit nervous now.

543
00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:27,972
Give us all you've got, F4!

544
00:41:28,532 --> 00:41:31,012
I, Chen Qinghe, and Shancai
will do whatever it takes.

545
00:41:31,092 --> 00:41:33,372
If you guys lose today,
you'll be at my mercy.

546
00:41:33,932 --> 00:41:35,172
You'll carry my bag for the day.

547
00:41:37,772 --> 00:41:40,332
Just one day? Make it ten years.

548
00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:42,772
You won't win anyway.

549
00:41:42,852 --> 00:41:43,692
You...

550
00:41:43,812 --> 00:41:44,772
Don't underestimate us.

551
00:41:47,452 --> 00:41:48,532
What if I win?

552
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:50,412
What do you want?

553
00:41:52,532 --> 00:41:54,852
You two will do whatever I want.

554
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:56,332
-Okay.
-I...

555
00:41:56,412 --> 00:41:57,452
Agreed.

556
00:41:58,572 --> 00:42:00,292
-Qinghe.
-Don't be scared. I'm here.

557
00:42:03,412 --> 00:42:05,692
Take a seat. We'll begin the match.

558
00:42:13,612 --> 00:42:15,652
You two might as well just admit defeat.

559
00:42:16,212 --> 00:42:17,492
We'll never do that.

560
00:42:18,052 --> 00:42:19,532
No need to waste time with them.

561
00:42:19,612 --> 00:42:22,732
Taking advantage of people
who don't know Poker and winning

562
00:42:22,812 --> 00:42:24,652
should not be something
you should brag about.
