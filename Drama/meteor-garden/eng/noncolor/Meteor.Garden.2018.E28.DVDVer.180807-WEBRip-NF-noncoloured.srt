A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

METEOR GARDEN

00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:30,095
EPISODE 28

4
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,535
My goodness.

5
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,415
This gift is a little too...

6
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:16,015
Why do you need to go home so soon?

7
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:17,455
I'm meeting a designer.

8
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:18,975
What designer?

9
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:22,655
The one my dad chose
to renovate our old house.

10
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:24,855
Oh, right.

11
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:26,335
You know him too.

12
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:28,735
Who is it?

13
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:31,775
Ye Mingchuan. Terence.

14
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:35,055
-The old handyman?
-Yes.

15
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,135
So you're Mr. Ye, the designer.

16
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:45,135
It's good to see you again.

17
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:47,255
I hope you'll forgive me

18
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:48,935
if I had been rude.

19
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:52,055
No worries.

20
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:55,295
Sorry for making you wait.

21
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:57,175
Caina and I

22
00:03:57,255 --> 00:03:59,575
were having a wonderful date just now.

23
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:04,535
Really?

24
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:07,415
Was it even more wonderful
than one we had that night?

25
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:16,735
I heard that you often
travel around the world

26
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:18,655
to find inspiration for your designs.

27
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:20,695
I bet you have had many girlfriends.

28
00:04:21,255 --> 00:04:22,455
You're too humble.

29
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:25,775
F4 is a reputable group.

30
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,015
We're well known indeed,

31
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:30,895
but we never have flings
while being away on vacations.

32
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:32,735
That one fling

33
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:34,855
might just be the love of your life.

34
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:38,295
But there's also a 99 percent possibility
that it'd just be a forgettable chapter.

35
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:40,775
It's too bad that the 99 percent

36
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:42,695
isn't in my control.

37
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:50,655
Then who's controlling it?

38
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:53,215
I don't care who is controlling it.

39
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,455
What matters is you're in my hands.

40
00:04:58,975 --> 00:04:59,975
Caina.

41
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:07,055
These are some design plans
I came up with.

42
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:09,095
Which one do you prefer?

43
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,375
Okay. I'll take a look.

44
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:18,935
Why don't we post
a search notice on Weibo?

45
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:22,855
If we do that,
people will know that Shancai is missing.

46
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:25,615
Do you think Daoming Si's mom
really took her away?

47
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:28,295
I asked my dad to check on that.

48
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,375
Mrs. Daoming is away
doing business in London.

49
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,895
She's too busy to care about Shancai.

50
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:34,055
That's because she's taken care of it.

51
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:37,175
Remember,
Mrs. Daoming is a meticulous person.

52
00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:39,855
Let's calm down.

53
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:43,255
Shancai must have her own reasons.

54
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:44,815
Check your phones.

55
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,855
She'll try to contact us if she can.

56
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:51,815
I'm such a useless friend.

57
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:54,455
Shancai is always the one protecting me.

58
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:57,135
Now that she's missing,
I don't know how to help her.

59
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:58,775
Don't worry, Xiaoyou.

60
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:01,135
It's okay.

61
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,415
Shancai will be fine.

62
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:03,975
I'll protect you too.

63
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:09,095
Why do you need to protect her?
I can do that too.

64
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:16,015
If you could do that,
Shancai wouldn't be missing.

65
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:20,055
It's all Daoming Si's fault.

66
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:22,415
Don't try to stop me.
I'm going to make him pay.

67
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:33,415
Why isn't anyone stopping me?

68
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:36,095
Don't be too depressed.

69
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:37,095
I have a hunch

70
00:06:37,455 --> 00:06:38,735
that she's doing just fine.

71
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:40,375
Why?

72
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,455
Did you guys forget? She's Shancai.

73
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:57,455
I can't accept it.

74
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:00,295
You're leaving me because
of such a lousy reason.

75
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:02,055
That's nonsense!

76
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:05,615
Shancai.

77
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:08,575
Do you really think I'm a useless guy?

78
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,975
Forget about my family, my mom

79
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:13,895
and everything else.

80
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:16,735
Have you ever thought of me
as a worthy guy?

81
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:35,935
I...

82
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:37,575
am...

83
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:39,535
sorry.

84
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:43,855
I'M SORRY

85
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:49,535
So what if I feel sorry?

86
00:07:51,015 --> 00:07:52,775
It's not like he could read this.

87
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:05,335
What are you doing here alone?

88
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:10,735
Let's go home.

89
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:12,975
Your dad's coming back
with his boat tonight.

90
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:47,975
I thought Lei suddenly got a face change.

91
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:59,615
What's wrong with you lately?
Are you becoming like Daoming Si too?

92
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:01,855
Did Caina go missing too?

93
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:04,455
Shut up.

94
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:08,735
It looks like

95
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,935
you gave up fighting with that old dude.

96
00:09:14,415 --> 00:09:15,295
A few days ago,

97
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,375
Caina and I spoke on the phone
for an hour.

98
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:19,255
I could feel that

99
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:20,775
she really likes me.

100
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:23,015
So I'm hiding from her.

101
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,695
I'm playing hard to get.

102
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:29,015
I think it's Caina
who's hiding from you instead.

103
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:33,215
Are you my friend or not?

104
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:36,775
Lei, what do you think?

105
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:38,935
Can I not be your friend?

106
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:41,455
Are you kidding me?

107
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:43,375
And how about you?

108
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:44,615
That hurts.

109
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:14,495
A customized perfect carat
diamond meteor necklace?

110
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:22,335
Did Daoming Si give you this?

111
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,575
Mom, why did you go through my things?

112
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:26,215
I didn't go through your things.

113
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:28,295
I wanted to help you unpack.

114
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:32,255
Don't touch this.
I'm going to give it back.

115
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,095
Give it back?

116
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,695
Did you fight with him?

117
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:38,655
No, we didn't.

118
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:42,415
We broke up.

119
00:10:43,135 --> 00:10:44,135
Broke up?

120
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,495
Weren't you two doing well
just a few days ago?

121
00:10:50,455 --> 00:10:52,415
The two of us were totally incompatible.

122
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:54,255
We weren't going to last.

123
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:57,175
Tell me.

124
00:10:57,295 --> 00:10:59,415
Did something happen at school?

125
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,575
Nothing happened.

126
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:05,535
We ended our relationship.

127
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:06,855
Nothing else happened.

128
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:11,295
So be it.

129
00:11:13,415 --> 00:11:15,735
Did you decide to come here because of it?

130
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:19,695
I told you.

131
00:11:19,855 --> 00:11:23,175
I came here to do some field research
for my school assignment.

132
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:28,295
All right.

133
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:32,415
I've always liked that boy.

134
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:34,415
It's too bad.

135
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:35,895
I'm going to cook lunch then.

136
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:02,135
-Here, this way.
-Pass the ball.

137
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:03,655
Here.

138
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:05,535
-Go.
-Okay. Come on.

139
00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:07,095
Three-pointer.

140
00:12:08,055 --> 00:12:09,015
Pass it to me.

141
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,335
Over here.

142
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:13,255
Si's been acting weird
since Shancai went missing.

143
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:15,815
He's not answering calls and messages.

144
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,055
He doesn't even talk to anyone.

145
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:22,535
Meanwhile, Lei is busy
with his graduation performance.

146
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,255
Is this going to be the end of F4?

147
00:12:28,135 --> 00:12:31,015
Sometimes, growing up
can be problematic too.

148
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:34,295
You know how Si is.

149
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:36,215
Nobody can tell him what to do.

150
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,535
But Shancai can.

151
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:43,535
The problem with you guys
is you are all too emotional.

152
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,015
Be more reasonable.

153
00:12:47,415 --> 00:12:49,495
The problem here is that you're heartless.

154
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:51,615
You don't know the pain of being in love.

155
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:54,215
What are you trying to say?

156
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:56,975
I'm just more mature.
I'm not like you childish people.

157
00:12:58,015 --> 00:12:59,975
Sure, we're childish.

158
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:01,375
We're all immature.

159
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:03,895
Should we look for the ultimate kid, Si?

160
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:05,855
He shouldn't hide at home.

161
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:07,215
What do you think?

162
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,455
Ask him out yourself.

163
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:09,935
I'm not the instigator.

164
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:27,215
It has been a while, Ximen, Meizuo.

165
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:29,415
Xiaozi.

166
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:31,175
Wait, why are you here too?

167
00:13:31,255 --> 00:13:32,735
Why can't I be here?

168
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:33,895
Don't forget.

169
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:35,855
F4 and I have a long history.

170
00:13:36,455 --> 00:13:37,415
You see,

171
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:40,295
Daoming Si is my ex-fiancé.

172
00:13:40,815 --> 00:13:42,095
Shancai is my good friend.

173
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,655
These two guys used to be my servants.

174
00:13:44,735 --> 00:13:46,095
They bought my underwear, shopped,

175
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:47,135
-caught--
-All right.

176
00:13:47,215 --> 00:13:49,055
That's enough. Don't bring that up again.

177
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:52,375
Are you for real?

178
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:54,975
Shancai left without a word
and is still missing.

179
00:13:55,615 --> 00:13:58,375
We're supposed to look for Daoming Si
to cheer him up a little.

180
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:00,215
How could you invite his fiancée too?

181
00:14:01,095 --> 00:14:02,335
Watch your words.

182
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:04,135
I'm the ex-fiancée.

183
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:08,495
Shancai and Si
are two very important people in my life.

184
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:11,175
How can I not be a part of this?

185
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:14,135
Xiaozi is so loud.

186
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:15,615
She'll set the mood.

187
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:17,895
Anyway,

188
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:20,895
the most important agenda today
is to cheer Si up.

189
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:22,255
Remember, guys.

190
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:24,935
Don't bring up Shancai's name, ever.

191
00:14:27,815 --> 00:14:28,735
Si's here.

192
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:34,895
Daoming Si.

193
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,335
It's been a while.

194
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:39,575
You're still the same old guy,
always looking pissed off.

195
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:40,815
But check it out.

196
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,375
His pissed-off face

197
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,455
looks 100 times better
than his normal one.

198
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:47,015
You're exaggerating.

199
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:48,895
You're just buttering him up.

200
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,255
All right, I'm just kidding.

201
00:14:57,455 --> 00:14:58,455
It has been a while.

202
00:14:58,575 --> 00:15:00,815
You don't answer our calls
or reply to our messages.

203
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:02,015
What have you been up to?

204
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:06,335
There's not much you can do alone.

205
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:08,255
Probably reading a book,

206
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:10,095
listening to music and playing games.

207
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,215
Not necessarily.

208
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:12,775
Si has got all sorts of ideas.

209
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:13,735
Right?

210
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:15,495
I know.

211
00:15:16,055 --> 00:15:18,055
He's been doing embroidery with Ms. Yu

212
00:15:18,615 --> 00:15:19,895
and knitting a sweater.

213
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:22,375
That sounds like fun.

214
00:15:23,495 --> 00:15:24,455
I know.

215
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:25,775
He was mopping the floors.

216
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:27,895
Daoming Si's house is huge

217
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:29,135
so it took him a while.

218
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,255
I don't think so.

219
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,255
Si probably snuggled up under his blanket
and looked at my photos.

220
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:35,735
I know, Si.

221
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:38,255
The more you look at my photos,
the prettier I look, right?

222
00:15:40,415 --> 00:15:41,655
I'll be honest here.

223
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,095
It's been a while since we met.

224
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,615
I'm glad to see everyone here.

225
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:48,535
Si, we should hang out more.
Or maybe just the two of us sometimes.

226
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:51,295
That's right, Si. What do you say?

227
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:56,095
You know what this is?

228
00:15:56,975 --> 00:15:58,015
Lame.

229
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:05,215
What's up with the act?

230
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:06,895
Pretending to be all close to each other.

231
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:08,255
It makes me sick.

232
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:27,255
What's your problem?

233
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:28,695
What?

234
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:31,335
You overreacted.

235
00:16:31,415 --> 00:16:32,735
I overreacted?

236
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:34,575
You called, I came.

237
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:36,935
Why can't you just let me be?

238
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:39,935
There's no need to act all friendly.

239
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:44,815
You got dumped, showed up here
looking pissed, and blew your top.

240
00:16:44,895 --> 00:16:45,735
Who's being lame?

241
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:51,095
Refusing to be contacted,
taking it out on your friends.

242
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:53,175
-What kind of a man are you?
-Shut up!

243
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:56,975
It's none of your business.

244
00:16:58,535 --> 00:17:01,055
This is the reason why Shancai dumped you.

245
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:21,775
You guys should go.

246
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:24,055
The situation is out of your hands now.

247
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:26,615
Let's go.

248
00:17:45,975 --> 00:17:47,055
That crazy bastard.

249
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:49,695
It's over between us.

250
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:52,015
Don't laugh.

251
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,655
Listen up.

252
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:55,535
I'm staying out of that guy's shit.

253
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:57,415
Okay.

254
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:00,055
We'll go back for now
and deal with him tomorrow.

255
00:18:00,135 --> 00:18:01,415
Not tomorrow.

256
00:18:02,095 --> 00:18:03,215
Not ever.

257
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:06,855
All right.

258
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:08,415
But let's just go back first.

259
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:12,575
And from today onward,
there is no more F4.

260
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:19,855
This ends just like this?

261
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:24,335
You won't deal with him,
but you want F4 to stay intact.

262
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:26,615
What is it that you want?

263
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:29,855
I'll tell you when I figure it out.

264
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:27,255
Isn't Mr. Ye supposed
to handle the finances?

265
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:28,655
Why are you showing this to me?

266
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:31,455
This is our company's protocol.

267
00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:34,615
If you're okay with the contract,
please sign it.

268
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:35,895
We can then proceed.

269
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:44,295
Is there anything else?

270
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:48,215
Mr. Ye will be here later to confirm
the details of the renovation.

271
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:22,415
Ding Qi placed those there.

272
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,695
It doesn't concern me.

273
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:29,895
I was just looking.

274
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,895
Ding Qi said you're going to go over
the renovation details with me.

275
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:37,735
That's why I'm still here.

276
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:42,055
I thought you didn't like renovating.

277
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:46,855
Because I thought
you didn't like owning a house.

278
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:50,735
I don't have one.

279
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:53,335
Impossible. You...

280
00:20:53,415 --> 00:20:55,575
-Every day, you're...
-Designing houses?

281
00:20:58,415 --> 00:20:59,375
Let me put it this way.

282
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:01,495
I'm an architect.

283
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:04,015
Not an interior designer.

284
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:10,695
So you helping to renovate my house is...

285
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:14,055
It's an exception because of you.

286
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:19,375
I know how to renovate,
but I've never done it for anyone.

287
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:23,655
You never did?

288
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:27,535
Never.

289
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:33,695
How should I repay you then?

290
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:35,735
You don't have to.

291
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,335
Just don't avoid me in the future.

292
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:42,215
I...

293
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,895
I'm not avoiding you.

294
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:47,735
I'm not.

295
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:50,095
Really?

296
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:52,695
I've tried to talk to you a few times,

297
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:54,375
but you avoided me. Why?

298
00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:02,615
Because I didn't have answers
for your questions.

299
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:04,215
I didn't know what to say

300
00:22:05,335 --> 00:22:06,695
and didn't want to think about it.

301
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:15,415
All right then.

302
00:22:16,975 --> 00:22:18,055
From now on,

303
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:21,495
consider me your interior designer.

304
00:22:21,855 --> 00:22:22,815
A new friend.

305
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:24,615
No strings attached.

306
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:25,935
No extra burden.

307
00:22:26,015 --> 00:22:27,415
I won't bring up

308
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:28,895
what happened that night again.

309
00:22:29,095 --> 00:22:29,975
How about that?

310
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:32,135
Okay.

311
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:38,815
The weather is nice today.
I'll take you home.

312
00:22:47,495 --> 00:22:48,495
Hey, Meizuo.

313
00:22:50,655 --> 00:22:52,735
I'm having a meeting at Terence's office.

314
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:55,095
It's okay.

315
00:22:55,255 --> 00:22:56,415
He'll take me home.

316
00:23:05,295 --> 00:23:06,295
It'd better be a meeting.

317
00:23:13,895 --> 00:23:15,535
-What?
-Meizuo.

318
00:23:16,215 --> 00:23:19,015
You're getting too distracted by Caina.

319
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,095
You think I want to?

320
00:23:21,495 --> 00:23:22,455
It's that old dude.

321
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:23,895
He's always sticking to her.

322
00:23:24,455 --> 00:23:25,655
Like a Band-Aid.

323
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,975
Who knows
whether it's an actual meeting or not.

324
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:38,015
<i>Shancai.</i>

325
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,375
<i>Where are you?</i>

326
00:23:41,735 --> 00:23:44,695
<i>I know you won't answer calls,
but at least reply my messages.</i>

327
00:23:58,135 --> 00:23:59,095
Hey.

328
00:24:01,335 --> 00:24:03,415
Are you two my friends or not?

329
00:24:03,855 --> 00:24:06,855
I'm frustrated here.
Shouldn't I get some sort of a response?

330
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:13,375
A guy and a girl are there together.

331
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:14,655
You're here being mad.

332
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:16,735
What can we do?

333
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:21,095
If only Si is here.

334
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:24,495
No, this is bad.

335
00:24:24,575 --> 00:24:25,615
I need to throw up again.

336
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:39,455
It's been two months.

337
00:24:39,535 --> 00:24:41,175
Why does Dad still get seasick?

338
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,095
It's fine. It's nothing serious.

339
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:44,615
He'll get used to it soon.

340
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:46,575
To be honest,

341
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,335
your dad isn't that outstanding,

342
00:24:48,615 --> 00:24:50,415
but he's got a good heart.

343
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:54,335
He came here to help
as soon as he heard your uncle is sick.

344
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,935
I'm so happy that I found such a man.

345
00:24:59,055 --> 00:24:59,895
Not only that,

346
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:02,375
we get fresh seafood every day.

347
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:08,135
Mom, the food is done.

348
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:09,735
That quick?

349
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:11,095
So much beef.

350
00:25:11,535 --> 00:25:12,615
Here, have one.

351
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:18,495
-It's pretty good. Try it.
-Okay.

352
00:25:20,735 --> 00:25:23,815
Why is the squid so difficult though?

353
00:25:23,895 --> 00:25:25,975
It's already dead,
but it takes so long to cook.

354
00:25:26,055 --> 00:25:28,215
It's all sticking together.
Go get me some soy sauce.

355
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:29,135
Okay.

356
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:31,295
I'll be back.

357
00:25:51,935 --> 00:25:53,575
Mom, look what I found.

358
00:25:54,255 --> 00:25:55,175
Eight Treasure sauce?

359
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,775
Brush it on. I bet it'll taste good.

360
00:26:01,575 --> 00:26:02,495
It smells good.

361
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:03,495
Let's try it.

362
00:26:05,735 --> 00:26:06,975
-It smells good.
-It smells good.

363
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:09,735
I feel better after vomiting.

364
00:26:11,175 --> 00:26:12,135
Something smells good.

365
00:26:12,775 --> 00:26:15,175
This is our new product,
Eight Treasure Squid.

366
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:16,855
Here, try one.

367
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:18,175
Here.

368
00:26:18,255 --> 00:26:19,335
Dad, it's still hot.

369
00:26:23,775 --> 00:26:24,975
-It's good.
-Really?

370
00:26:25,055 --> 00:26:26,455
-It's delicious.
-Let me try.

371
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:27,775
-Here.
-I'll eat this.

372
00:26:33,975 --> 00:26:36,935
This Eight Treasure sauce
and squid are a perfect match!

373
00:26:37,615 --> 00:26:39,815
-It's delicious.
-Just like Romeo and Juliet.

374
00:26:39,935 --> 00:26:41,215
Like fried tomato and egg.

375
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:42,295
Me and your mom.

376
00:26:42,415 --> 00:26:44,135
A match made in heaven.

377
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:45,415
I've got an idea.

378
00:26:45,495 --> 00:26:47,175
We'll set up a stall tomorrow

379
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:48,615
to sell the Eight Treasure Squid.

380
00:26:49,255 --> 00:26:50,575
"Sell the Eight Treasure Squid."

381
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,815
Sounds good.

382
00:26:52,495 --> 00:26:54,735
-I think it's going to sell well.
-Me too.

383
00:26:55,895 --> 00:26:56,735
All right.

384
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,055
Eat the squid. I'm just kidding.

385
00:26:59,135 --> 00:27:00,295
No, we're going to do it.

386
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:02,335
Give me two more.

387
00:27:07,055 --> 00:27:09,855
Meizuo, is that old dude
still not giving up?

388
00:27:10,415 --> 00:27:12,455
You can't expect us to help you
without any plan.

389
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,455
I wouldn't be putting in so much effort

390
00:27:16,855 --> 00:27:18,335
if they didn't meet first.

391
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,255
Women.

392
00:27:20,495 --> 00:27:22,455
They're sentimental by nature.

393
00:27:25,015 --> 00:27:27,215
Anticipating the future.

394
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:30,295
Reminiscing the past.

395
00:27:32,695 --> 00:27:35,215
If that's true,
the present seems the most miserable.

396
00:27:39,055 --> 00:27:40,055
That's right.

397
00:27:41,055 --> 00:27:43,815
That's why I prefer to be
someone from the past.

398
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:52,655
Why do you think Caina likes you?

399
00:27:54,415 --> 00:27:58,135
I'm tall, handsome, funny,
and full of youthful energy.

400
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:00,735
I know.

401
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:02,815
Dating younger men is a thing nowadays.

402
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:05,695
It helps women maintain
a youthful outlook.

403
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:09,215
I remember.

404
00:28:09,695 --> 00:28:11,375
When I'm with Caina,

405
00:28:11,455 --> 00:28:12,295
she'd say,

406
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,255
"How nice it is to be young."

407
00:28:15,495 --> 00:28:16,415
She also said,

408
00:28:18,055 --> 00:28:20,015
"I wish I could be young again."

409
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:23,175
If that's the case,

410
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,135
let us go back
to when Caina is still young.

411
00:28:28,095 --> 00:28:28,935
Us?

412
00:28:30,015 --> 00:28:30,895
Yes.

413
00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:32,495
Us, F4.

414
00:28:35,695 --> 00:28:36,615
Si...

415
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:40,175
Don't you want to make up with Si?

416
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,735
DONG'S KING OF SQUID
SIGNATURE FLAVOR: EIGHT TREASURE SQUID

417
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:51,455
-Shancai, hurry up.
-Okay.

418
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:54,775
-I heard the squid is awesome.
-It's good.

419
00:28:54,855 --> 00:28:57,215
-I've been coming often.
-It's really good.

420
00:28:57,295 --> 00:28:58,135
Done.

421
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:00,575
-It smells delicious.
-It's good.

422
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,815
Hello. How many skewers?

423
00:29:01,895 --> 00:29:02,735
-Three.
-Here.

424
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:03,655
Three skewers?

425
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:04,655
Thanks for waiting.

426
00:29:06,295 --> 00:29:07,655
I want it extra spicy.

427
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:09,455
I love them spicy.

428
00:29:10,575 --> 00:29:11,895
-Here you go.
-Almost done.

429
00:29:12,135 --> 00:29:13,775
Here, please enjoy.

430
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:15,055
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

431
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:18,375
-Hi. Your three skewers.
-Thanks.

432
00:29:20,015 --> 00:29:21,815
Mom, how are you holding up?
Are you tired?

433
00:29:22,455 --> 00:29:25,415
Not at all. There's no time to be tired.

434
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:29,095
Your dad needs to work harder
to catch more squid at sea.

435
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:32,495
-Three skewers?
-Yes.

436
00:29:32,895 --> 00:29:34,535
-Okay.
-Thanks for waiting.

437
00:29:34,615 --> 00:29:35,455
No worries.

438
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:40,615
Mrs. Dong.

439
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:42,575
Your business is doing well.

440
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,295
Oh, ma'am.

441
00:29:45,095 --> 00:29:47,935
I've been so busy with the stall
that I forgot to pay the rent.

442
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:49,255
I'll give it to you right away.

443
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:51,895
Here, have some squid.

444
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:55,255
I didn't come here today to collect rent.

445
00:29:55,695 --> 00:29:56,735
I wanted to ask

446
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,215
if you'd like me
to be your business partner.

447
00:29:59,775 --> 00:30:01,095
I'll help you sell the squid.

448
00:30:04,055 --> 00:30:06,895
Well, I'd be happy to let you.

449
00:30:06,975 --> 00:30:08,255
But it's just a small village.

450
00:30:08,335 --> 00:30:11,575
If people buy from your shop,
who's going to come here?

451
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:13,495
I can lower the rent.

452
00:30:14,135 --> 00:30:15,655
And pay you commission.

453
00:30:15,735 --> 00:30:16,815
What do you say?

454
00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:20,415
That sounds pretty good.

455
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:23,615
But the Eight Treasure sauce
that Shancai created

456
00:30:23,695 --> 00:30:24,895
is a family secret.

457
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:26,535
We don't plan to sell it.

458
00:30:29,535 --> 00:30:30,535
Sorry about that.

459
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:33,815
Wait, ma'am.

460
00:30:35,815 --> 00:30:36,815
Hold on.

461
00:30:38,215 --> 00:30:39,695
I just thought of an idea.

462
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,415
I can create a few more flavors.

463
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,215
This way, we won't
get in each other's way.

464
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:48,935
Will that work?

465
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,095
That's awesome.

466
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:55,455
Very good.

467
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:15,855
How is it?

468
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:17,015
It's good.

469
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:20,215
I haven't seen you in a while.

470
00:31:21,975 --> 00:31:23,775
I've been busy
with my graduation performance.

471
00:31:24,135 --> 00:31:25,015
And also,

472
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:26,975
Si hasn't hung out with us much.

473
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:28,455
Yes.

474
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,415
Since Shancai left,

475
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,935
Si's been keeping to himself.

476
00:31:36,015 --> 00:31:37,655
I'm worried about him.

477
00:31:39,055 --> 00:31:40,695
I hope you guys

478
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:42,575
will ask him out more often

479
00:31:42,655 --> 00:31:44,095
and get him out of his shell.

480
00:32:01,135 --> 00:32:02,215
I'm not hungry!

481
00:32:19,455 --> 00:32:20,335
It's you.

482
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:22,095
I don't have any appetite.

483
00:32:24,535 --> 00:32:26,495
Are you still angry?

484
00:32:27,735 --> 00:32:28,695
I'm not.

485
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:32,335
But you seem so sad.

486
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:36,455
Isn't that obvious?

487
00:32:36,895 --> 00:32:38,015
Why are you still asking?

488
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:45,175
It's been going on for too long.
I'm used to seeing you happy and unhappy.

489
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:49,455
But right now, we need you with us.

490
00:32:51,455 --> 00:32:54,615
I should say that
Meizuo needs us with him.

491
00:32:56,495 --> 00:32:57,575
We agreed, right?

492
00:32:58,055 --> 00:32:59,895
Keeping company is a sign of friendship.

493
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:09,455
Sometimes, we need to do
things we don't like

494
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:11,335
for the sake of someone important.

495
00:33:13,095 --> 00:33:14,055
Like right now.

496
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:15,575
To make Ms. Yu happy,

497
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:17,895
you should drink this glass of soy milk.

498
00:33:33,015 --> 00:33:33,935
Lame.

499
00:34:43,855 --> 00:34:44,935
What's up with you guys?

500
00:34:45,895 --> 00:34:46,775
Good morning, miss.

501
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:48,415
Change into these

502
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:50,335
and come on a picnic with us.

503
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,800
Daoming Si.

504
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,040
Are you in a bad mood?

505
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,600
Why don't you join them?

506
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
I know we're not that close.

507
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,000
But I still remember you well.

508
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,720
During the cooking competition,

509
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,400
you cheered for Shancai
through the window.

510
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,640
And she won the special prize.

511
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,400
It was because of your support.

512
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,560
Are you two doing well?

513
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,560
We broke up.

514
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,040
Normally, girls need some time.

515
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,000
Give her some space.

516
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,200
And you?

517
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
Do you like Meizuo?

518
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,320
I need some time to think about it too.

519
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,880
She said,

520
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,520
"It's so good

521
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,080
to have you.

522
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,880
So good."

523
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,840
Right?

524
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,920
Didn't she?

525
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,440
She said I'm worth seven stars.

526
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,880
"So, so good."

527
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,760
You've said that 20 times.

528
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,920
It's actually 21 times.

529
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,240
Is that even a sentence?

530
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,440
Not a sentence.

531
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,480
Just a word.

532
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,880
Hey.

533
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,640
Can't you guys share
this happy moment with me?

534
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,320
I know Shancai is missing.

535
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,720
Si's heartbroken.

536
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,920
But I'm still here.

537
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,640
Shancai's missing.

538
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,200
Si's heartbroken.

539
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,480
Meizuo's drunk in love.

540
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,840
Lei.

541
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,480
You're the only one who's normal now.

542
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
I couldn't care less.

543
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,920
Can you guys show more concern?

544
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,680
Are you even my friends?

545
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,160
Meizuo.

546
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,720
Hello.

547
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,960
Good.

548
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,400
So good.

549
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,400
-So funny.
-Huaze Lei.

550
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,880
Okay, Meizuo.

551
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,520
You're our pride.

552
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,080
You want to talk about Caina?
We'll do that.

553
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
Then again,

554
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,520
Ye Mingchuan was going after
Caina aggressively,

555
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,440
but he suddenly stopped doing that.

556
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,920
I guess he wasn't that serious
about Caina.

557
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,520
He is serious.

558
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,960
Or else you wouldn't be so worried.

559
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,960
Even if he's serious, so what?

560
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,320
He might be serious about her,
but so am I.

561
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,520
The point is, I love her.

562
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,880
Good.

563
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,680
Make your move while you still can.

564
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,120
Just don't regret it in the future.

565
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,080
Hello, Caina.

566
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,400
<i>What are you doing?</i>

567
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,520
I'm with the guys.

568
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,080
Hello, Ms. Caina.

569
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Caina, Li Quan is having
a concert this weekend.

570
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,520
Do you want to go?

571
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,800
<i>Okay.</i>

572
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,800
<i>I'll see you there then.</i>

573
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,120
See you there.

574
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,680
A concert this weekend?

575
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,160
I want to go too.

576
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,520
I'm afraid not this time.

577
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,080
I need to prepare for our perfect date.

578
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,840
It was hard to get tickets
for the best seats.

579
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,760
I won't let them go to waste.

580
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,800
Have you finished your report?

581
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,320
I'm a top student.

582
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,240
I won't let my social life
get in the way of my studies.

583
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,840
Right now,

584
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,880
I'm the world's luckiest guy.
