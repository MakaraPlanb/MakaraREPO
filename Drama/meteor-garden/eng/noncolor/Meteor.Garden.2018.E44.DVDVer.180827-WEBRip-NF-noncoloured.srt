EPISODE 44

4
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:49,871
This is a day
that's worthy of a celebration.

5
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:52,551
Even the King of Hell hates Daoming Si,

6
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:54,271
the immortal monster.

7
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:56,551
So the monster kicked Daoming Si out
and made him return.

8
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:58,111
Let's celebrate.

9
00:01:58,391 --> 00:01:59,591
Bottoms up.

10
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:17,951
Wait a minute.

11
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:31,911
Daoming Si hasn't fully recovered yet.

12
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:34,951
Are you guys really his friends?
I think you're a bunch of scoundrels.

13
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:41,911
A shot of alcohol is nothing
to the undefeatable Daoming Si.

14
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:47,351
We need to confirm
if he has really recovered.

15
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:50,511
If he finishes this shot
and he's still completely fine,

16
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:51,831
then we don't need to worry.

17
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:55,271
I'll drink this then.

18
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,031
This is

19
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:15,271
so bitter, spicy, and salty.

20
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:17,071
How can you drink this?

21
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:17,991
You're an idiot.

22
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,551
That's not how you do it.

23
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:20,591
Watch and learn.

24
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:23,271
Hey.

25
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:31,991
Hey.

26
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,631
Don't cause us any trouble.

27
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:39,351
I think you're the troublemaker.

28
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:41,711
If you get admitted again,
I won't take care of you anymore.

29
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:42,711
Hey.

30
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:45,831
Have you forgotten
how you should treat your boyfriend?

31
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:49,991
That's enough. Can you not be
so openly affectionate here?

32
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:57,511
All right.

33
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:02,071
Thank you, everyone.

34
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:05,031
I'll live well to repay you all.

35
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,831
Even though we've already graduated,

36
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:10,071
I believe our friendship wouldn't change.

37
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,631
Let's toast to our friendship.

38
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:12,791
To friendship.

39
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:14,271
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

40
00:04:14,431 --> 00:04:16,791
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

41
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:18,111
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

42
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,911
Drink this. It's good.

43
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:29,631
Okay. Thanks.

44
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:32,311
Sorry about the last time.

45
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:34,031
You went to the Way of Tea Museum.

46
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:35,311
And I was busy.

47
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:37,631
Sorry that I couldn't go there with you.

48
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:43,551
No. I went there without notice.
I should apologize to you.

49
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:54,991
Then, we're still friends.

50
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,511
Yes. It's good to be friends.

51
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:04,911
I suddenly realized
how cute you still are.

52
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:12,711
I wonder what Ximen
is talking about with Xiaoyou.

53
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:16,111
It's none of our business.

54
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:18,031
How come?

55
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:20,591
I don't want to meddle
in other people's business.

56
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:21,551
Shancai.

57
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,671
I just want to be with you.

58
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:30,471
Let's leave.

59
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,671
Leave?

60
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:37,831
This is a party
to celebrate your recovery.

61
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:39,311
How can you leave?

62
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:44,951
Since it's my party,

63
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:47,391
I can call it a day and leave
whenever I want.

64
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,471
Are we really leaving?

65
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:51,871
Where are we going?

66
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:55,631
Somewhere where
there will just be the two of us.

67
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:25,831
This is where you belong.

68
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:27,871
An exclusive place for my girlfriend.

69
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:30,111
Dong Shancai's Love Corner.

70
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,191
From now on,

71
00:06:34,631 --> 00:06:36,511
this is where you shield yourself
from the storm.

72
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:40,311
No need to worry
and don't handle everything by yourself.

73
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,031
Hearing your heartbeat like this
is so nice.

74
00:06:56,831 --> 00:06:58,791
To know that you're alive

75
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:01,391
is so nice.

76
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:04,071
Daoming Si.

77
00:07:06,631 --> 00:07:07,631
I was really,

78
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:11,031
really scared.

79
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,111
I'm really the biggest idiot
in the whole universe.

80
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:21,911
Why did I only realize how much I love you

81
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:25,351
when you almost died?

82
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,471
I don't want to lose you anymore.

83
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:37,911
You think too highly of yourself.

84
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:42,991
I mean

85
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:47,231
I'm the only one worthy of the title,
"The Biggest Idiot

86
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:48,311
in the Whole Universe."

87
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:49,351
You are only

88
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:53,391
-in the minor category of a stupid girl.
-Stop teasing me.

89
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:55,871
What's the matter?

90
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:57,071
Are you all right?

91
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,631
Does it hurt? Did you tear your wound?

92
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:01,951
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

93
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:04,431
Are you really all right?

94
00:08:04,511 --> 00:08:06,511
It won't be all right
if you keep touching me.

95
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:09,951
Can you be more serious?

96
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:12,511
Can't you stay and let me hug you
a little longer?

97
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:22,991
I'm not sure why,

98
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:25,151
but I feel like I owe you something.

99
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:28,351
Really? You don't.

100
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:30,991
You told me before

101
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:33,751
that you've climbed more stairs
than I could imagine.

102
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:37,271
Actually, I knew
even if you didn't tell me.

103
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:39,591
You climbed

104
00:08:40,031 --> 00:08:42,431
so many flights of stairs
in the middle of the night

105
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:44,351
just to find the answer for me.

106
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,231
I'm really moved.

107
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:51,831
I wanted to know the answer myself.
Don't feel like you owe me anything.

108
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:57,031
All right then.

109
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:58,391
To show my gratitude,

110
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:00,751
tell me what I can do for you.

111
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,871
The full package?

112
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:08,951
What?

113
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:12,831
Just kidding.

114
00:09:14,831 --> 00:09:15,671
All right.

115
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:18,111
I joined my school's Way of Tea Club.

116
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:21,111
Originally, I joined
to understand you better.

117
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:24,871
But now, I realized
the world of tea is quite interesting.

118
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:29,391
So can you do me a favor?

119
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:53,751
It's great for you
to come and teach this class.

120
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:57,111
Everyone is excited
about the new instructor for the club.

121
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:59,751
By the way,
the girls in our club are very friendly.

122
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:01,351
They'll be really happy to see you.

123
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:03,311
This way.

124
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:12,511
That's strange.

125
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:15,071
Where did everybody go?

126
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:18,751
It's all right.

127
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:21,951
Even if all the girls in your club
are invisible,

128
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:24,071
I can still teach the class.

129
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:32,271
Yifen, can we finish all these junk food?

130
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:35,111
Everyone takes these junk food
all the time.

131
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:36,511
Sometimes they're not even enough.

132
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:40,471
Girls always have room
for junk food and sweets.

133
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:52,351
-Hi.
-Hi.

134
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:53,311
We're back.

135
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,231
-Hi.
-Hi.

136
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:24,111
Xiaoyou.

137
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,111
Who's this handsome guy?

138
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:31,431
He's the instructor I told you about.
He's also my friend. His name is Ximen.

139
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,791
Is he the boyfriend you said
you were going to introduce to Yifen?

140
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:04,431
-What's going on?
-I'm not sure.

141
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,711
Xiaogeng.

142
00:12:10,711 --> 00:12:11,671
It has been a while.

143
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:21,071
Xiaogeng?

144
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:27,911
Yes.

145
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:29,711
It has been a while.

146
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,551
So Yifen already knows

147
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:36,671
this handsome guy
who knows about the Way of Tea.

148
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:38,951
That's why she couldn't
fall for other guys.

149
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:55,911
Over 1,000 years ago, the Japanese
people loved the Tang Dynasty culture.

150
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:57,591
So they sent envoys to learn the culture

151
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,991
of supplying and serving tea
and bring it back to Japan.

152
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,791
<i>Turns out Yifen is Xiaogeng.</i>

153
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:10,511
Supplying and serving tea mean

154
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:13,231
providing tea leaves in pavilions
on the side of the road

155
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:15,671
for passersby to quench their thirst
and make friends.

156
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,431
It symbolizes
sharing good tea with strangers.

157
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:21,871
It can be considered a state of mind.

158
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:32,031
Okay. Now I'm going to demonstrate
how to make tea.

159
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:34,831
Who wants to be my assistant?

160
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:35,911
-Me.
-Me.

161
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:37,671
Let me do it. I'm sitting closest to you.

162
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,991
<i>She's considerate and funny.</i>

163
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:41,511
<i>And cute too.</i>

164
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,951
<i>No wonder Ximen can't forget her.</i>

165
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:46,231
Me. Pick me.

166
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:47,791
-Pick me.
-Me.

167
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,391
<i>I brought Ximen</i>

168
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:52,711
<i>back to Xiaogeng.</i>

169
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:56,151
<i>Did I already have
some sort of premonition?</i>

170
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:15,791
<i>Geng Yifen, take a deep breath.</i>

171
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:25,591
<i>Learn how to let go and turn away.</i>

172
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:28,591
<i>Don't think about someone
who doesn't love you.</i>

173
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:36,911
<i>After all these years,</i>

174
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:40,071
<i>you've already moved on.</i>

175
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:57,551
<i>After all these years...</i>

176
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:00,511
<i>Why?</i>

177
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:05,351
<i>Why do I still like you so much?</i>

178
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:22,111
The Chinese tea culture
is broad and profound.

179
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:24,831
Instead of understanding it,
just try and taste a cup of good tea.

180
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:26,071
Everyone, please enjoy.

181
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:28,871
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

182
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:39,311
What do you think? Is it good?

183
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:42,311
-So handsome.
-So handsome.

184
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:49,351
He's asking if it's good.
What do you mean "handsome"?

185
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:50,951
These three people.

186
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:54,111
-He's really handsome.
-That's right.

187
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:13,151
Yifen.

188
00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:17,151
It turns out you're Xiaogeng.

189
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,951
I heard about you from Ximen.

190
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:22,671
He must have been laughing
at my ugly past.

191
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:26,231
No, actually Ximen--

192
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:34,711
Xiaogeng, I'm really glad to see you.

193
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:37,031
Yes.

194
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:39,471
It has been a while.

195
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:42,031
Do you still have class later?

196
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:44,071
Let's go out and talk.

197
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:52,631
Xiaoyou should come with us too.

198
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:56,231
Xiaoyou too?

199
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,311
I still have class. You two go ahead.

200
00:17:02,431 --> 00:17:03,511
Are you really not coming?

201
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:07,311
Yes. I want to, but maybe next time.

202
00:17:08,551 --> 00:17:09,471
We'll go ahead then.

203
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:10,711
Okay. Bye.

204
00:17:13,071 --> 00:17:13,951
Bye.

205
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:33,311
It's been a while
since we walked together on this street.

206
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:34,951
Now, I can walk by myself.

207
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:37,551
There were no street lamps before.

208
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:40,671
Every time we finished late at school,
you'd always go home with me.

209
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:43,951
And you even told me that

210
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,231
you were trying to protect me.

211
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:46,991
You were afraid of the dark yourself.

212
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:50,151
Are we talking about our ugly past now?

213
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:55,311
I remember someone wanted
to pick fruits from the rooftop

214
00:17:55,391 --> 00:17:56,911
and fell from so high up...

215
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:58,591
But didn't even get a scratch.

216
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:05,191
Actually, I know.

217
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,911
The reason why I was miraculously safe

218
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:11,471
was because you were protecting me.

219
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:23,911
I really regretted

220
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:27,991
asking you to go to that rooftop.

221
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:30,991
And saying goodbye

222
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:33,591
to you when you didn't go.

223
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:37,991
I was such a coward,

224
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,631
but I was greedy.

225
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:43,911
I couldn't bear to hear your answer.

226
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,071
I'm the one who should apologize.

227
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:56,191
If I went there

228
00:18:56,871 --> 00:18:58,071
that day,

229
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:00,031
things between us...

230
00:19:07,191 --> 00:19:08,591
wouldn't have turned out like this.

231
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:19,991
Xiaogeng.

232
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,831
Can you give me a chance
to make up for it?

233
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:32,151
Let's go to that rooftop again.

234
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:35,911
Can we start over again?

235
00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:51,871
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

236
00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:10,751
Is something on your mind?

237
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:13,591
Yes.

238
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:20,991
I think I did something really bizarre.

239
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:26,871
I helped Ximen find his first love.

240
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:28,511
And I helped them reunite.

241
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:36,471
Does your foot hurt?

242
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:43,711
Didn't you just drop a rock
on your own feet?

243
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:47,751
I'm already miserable. Stop teasing me.

244
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:53,271
All right.

245
00:20:53,911 --> 00:20:55,031
Don't be sad.

246
00:20:55,951 --> 00:20:57,711
You'll surely find someone better,

247
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,231
more outstanding
and someone who's perfect in the future.

248
00:21:01,111 --> 00:21:01,951
No.

249
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:04,031
Ximen is the perfect one.

250
00:21:22,711 --> 00:21:23,711
Mrs. Yu.

251
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:26,271
How is Si doing?

252
00:21:27,511 --> 00:21:29,431
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

253
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:31,751
<i>Si is recovering at the hospital.</i>

254
00:21:32,151 --> 00:21:34,111
<i>But he still needs more time.</i>

255
00:21:34,671 --> 00:21:35,671
Don't worry.

256
00:21:36,351 --> 00:21:37,991
He's recovering quickly.

257
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,631
The doctor said
he'll be in good health soon.

258
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:43,951
<i>This child</i>

259
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:46,511
<i>has always been healthy
ever since he was little.</i>

260
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:47,751
Okay.

261
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:49,591
All right then.

262
00:22:08,671 --> 00:22:11,471
<i>Can you give me a chance
to make up for it?</i>

263
00:22:28,231 --> 00:22:30,591
Xiaoyou, what time
will you be working today?

264
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,391
Do you have time to meet me?

265
00:22:57,191 --> 00:22:59,591
Xiaogeng, why did you
suddenly come and see me?

266
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:06,671
Ximen asked me to go
to that rooftop with him today.

267
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,071
That's great.

268
00:23:13,671 --> 00:23:15,391
Why are you telling me this?

269
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:21,831
Because I can tell
that you like Ximen too.

270
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:33,711
So I feel that I have to tell you this.

271
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:38,751
Is that so?

272
00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:41,711
Xiaoyou.

273
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:43,551
Thank you.

274
00:23:44,431 --> 00:23:45,671
I'll work hard to make up

275
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:47,871
for what Ximen and I have missed.

276
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:12,311
Do you still have to work later?

277
00:24:18,271 --> 00:24:19,871
I won't disturb you then.

278
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:22,951
I'll get going.

279
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:24,751
-Okay.
-Bye.

280
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:43,631
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

281
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:05,951
Xiaoyou.

282
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:08,191
What's the matter?

283
00:25:08,911 --> 00:25:11,111
Why did Xiaogeng come to see you?

284
00:25:13,871 --> 00:25:14,751
Shancai.

285
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,271
Remember that time we went shopping

286
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:21,591
and the saleslady told me

287
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:23,071
my eyebrows look sad

288
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:24,951
and I should draw a different shape?

289
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:27,471
What are you talking about?

290
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:30,151
My eyebrows do make me look sad.

291
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:32,871
This eyebrow shape is not good.

292
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:35,111
Even though I'm happy,

293
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:37,791
I still look sad.

294
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:45,031
Your eyebrows don't look sad.

295
00:25:46,351 --> 00:25:47,511
What happened?

296
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:50,471
Xiaogeng told me

297
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:53,711
that she'll go with Ximen
to that building tomorrow.

298
00:25:58,711 --> 00:26:01,511
Ximen has always been the man of my dream.

299
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:04,791
A dream I don't want to wake up from.

300
00:26:07,951 --> 00:26:09,031
So Shancai,

301
00:26:10,191 --> 00:26:11,911
if I look really sad,

302
00:26:13,591 --> 00:26:15,751
it must be because of my sad eyebrows.

303
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:20,271
Please don't worry about me.

304
00:26:37,911 --> 00:26:39,071
It's fine.

305
00:27:05,831 --> 00:27:06,671
Hey.

306
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:09,271
-You scared me.
-What is it?

307
00:27:09,351 --> 00:27:11,271
You told me to come here so urgently.

308
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,391
Do you want to see my singing talent?

309
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:15,431
It's Xiaoyou.

310
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,231
She's already inside.

311
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:22,071
This is about Ximen again?

312
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:25,471
When will she ever learn?

313
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:26,551
Let's go.

314
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:28,231
So, you're joining us for real?

315
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:30,991
You're so worried about her.

316
00:27:31,071 --> 00:27:32,831
That means she's not doing very well.

317
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:35,111
So I should support you and stay with her.

318
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:47,871
What are you doing?

319
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:49,871
Daoming Si.

320
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:52,831
You're so reliable
when I need you the most.

321
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:57,871
Nonsense.

322
00:27:58,591 --> 00:28:00,311
I'm the successor of a business empire.

323
00:28:01,031 --> 00:28:02,511
Being reliable is a basic requirement.

324
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,431
You're such a good guy.

325
00:28:07,031 --> 00:28:08,591
You're better than a best female friend.

326
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:10,591
And you just realized that now?

327
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:12,791
Wait a minute.

328
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,631
You called me your best female friend?

329
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:19,871
Shancai, why did you call me
your best female friend?

330
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:26,751
Hey.

331
00:29:26,871 --> 00:29:28,311
Are you sure she's broken-hearted?

332
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:31,191
I'm not really sure now.

333
00:29:39,551 --> 00:29:40,591
Are you really not singing?

334
00:29:41,151 --> 00:29:43,191
Is it okay to keep the mic to myself?

335
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:44,751
It's fine. Just sing your heart out.

336
00:29:46,111 --> 00:29:46,951
Xiaoyou.

337
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:50,271
You already sang that song
so many times in one hour.

338
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:51,551
Aren't you tired?

339
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:53,031
I'm not.

340
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:54,471
I'm very excited.

341
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:56,031
Can you help me choose more songs?

342
00:29:56,831 --> 00:29:58,431
I'm glad you guys came with me today.

343
00:29:58,591 --> 00:30:00,751
I don't think I can sleep at home.

344
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:03,431
Xiaoyou.

345
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:05,111
Just let her get it all out.

346
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:07,311
Then she can sleep when she's tired.

347
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:08,631
She'll get over it soon.

348
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:15,031
Go and choose some songs for her.

349
00:30:15,471 --> 00:30:16,311
Okay.

350
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,191
<i>I think Xiaoyou will be fine.</i>

351
00:30:22,231 --> 00:30:23,631
<i>The night will be over soon.</i>

352
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:26,431
<i>A new day will come.</i>

353
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:22,591
Good morning.

354
00:31:24,831 --> 00:31:25,831
Why are you so early?

355
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:29,431
You're early too.

356
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:32,151
You couldn't sleep
so you came here this early?

357
00:31:34,671 --> 00:31:35,831
You're talking about yourself.

358
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:41,271
Busted.

359
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:45,711
Let's go.

360
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:39,031
I'm running out of energy.

361
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,151
Well, that went on for quite a while.

362
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:50,191
I wish I had that energy too.

363
00:32:53,911 --> 00:32:56,671
Tell me. Do you think they've already met?

364
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,351
Do you regret it?

365
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:02,631
No, I don't.

366
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:05,511
My heart is just aching.

367
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:08,351
I'm not sure when the pain would stop.

368
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,351
Stop thinking about things
you're not sure about.

369
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,231
Hey, you don't have to say anything.

370
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,711
That's how I did it.

371
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:32,151
No one knows what'll happen in the future
no matter how much we think about t.

372
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:34,591
Just treasure each moment.

373
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:37,191
Your heart is aching.

374
00:33:37,631 --> 00:33:39,111
That means you're still alive.

375
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:30,151
What's the matter?

376
00:34:30,871 --> 00:34:31,951
Nothing.

377
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:33,631
I'm just a little tired.

378
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:37,111
Probably because
I didn't sleep well last night.

379
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:43,951
You've always been weak
since you were little.

380
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:47,071
Yes.

381
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:49,071
When you were little,

382
00:34:51,071 --> 00:34:52,471
you kept playing nonstop.

383
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:55,071
You know your body couldn't take it.

384
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:56,791
But you still kept going.

385
00:34:57,871 --> 00:34:59,271
You slept when you were tired.

386
00:35:00,151 --> 00:35:01,311
You ate when you woke up.

387
00:35:02,031 --> 00:35:03,711
Then your stomach hurt when you were full.

388
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:06,711
Why do you make me

389
00:35:07,391 --> 00:35:08,951
sound like an animal?

390
00:35:12,231 --> 00:35:15,111
In my loneliest, saddest time,

391
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:19,391
your innocence saved me.

392
00:35:26,631 --> 00:35:27,471
Thank you.

393
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:31,551
Ximen.

394
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:34,231
Do you know I've always loved you?

395
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:40,951
Yes.

396
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:43,511
You knew?

397
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:46,831
You're so easy to read.

398
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:51,511
And you're so difficult
for me to figure out.

399
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:55,151
Ximen.

400
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:57,871
Have you realized

401
00:35:58,631 --> 00:36:00,511
after we met again

402
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:03,231
that we've always...

403
00:36:06,191 --> 00:36:07,471
Always what?

404
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:10,911
Nothing.

405
00:36:14,231 --> 00:36:16,431
It's almost time. Let's go.

406
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:18,231
Okay.

407
00:36:27,911 --> 00:36:29,591
The sun is so bright.

408
00:36:30,311 --> 00:36:32,311
It's 8:00 a.m. It should be bright.

409
00:36:32,871 --> 00:36:35,311
Shancai, Daoming Si, thank you.

410
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:39,791
It's good that it's the weekend.
We can catch up on some sleep.

411
00:36:40,071 --> 00:36:41,751
Xiaoyou, will you be able to sleep?

412
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:44,911
Yes.

413
00:36:57,471 --> 00:36:59,191
Hello? Xiaogeng?

414
00:37:05,951 --> 00:37:07,231
<i>Can you come to the rooftop?</i>

415
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:09,231
What? Now?

416
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,111
Okay.

417
00:37:17,951 --> 00:37:19,031
It's so strange.

418
00:37:19,631 --> 00:37:22,711
Isn't Xiaogeng supposed to be with Ximen?

419
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:24,351
Why did she ask me to come?

420
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:28,991
Are you going to see Ximen?

421
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:30,671
Do you want me to drive you?

422
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:31,871
I...

423
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:35,471
But...

424
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:36,551
But what?

425
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:39,111
You'll find out if it's good or bad
once you get there.

426
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:48,431
It's nearby. I'll go there myself.

427
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,511
Shancai, Daoming Si, thank you.

428
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:56,671
<i>Xiaoyou.</i>

429
00:37:57,271 --> 00:37:58,111
<i>You can do it.</i>

430
00:38:39,871 --> 00:38:40,711
Ximen.

431
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:44,991
You're here.

432
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:51,071
Why is the sign gone?

433
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:53,191
Where's Xiaogeng?

434
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:57,071
She left.

435
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:01,151
Did she leave because the sign is gone?

436
00:39:02,191 --> 00:39:04,511
But that sign no longer matters.

437
00:39:05,271 --> 00:39:07,391
-What's important is that you're here.
-Xiaoyou.

438
00:39:10,591 --> 00:39:12,151
It's over between me and Xiaogeng.

439
00:39:14,631 --> 00:39:15,631
Over?

440
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:18,551
What does that mean?

441
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:36,071
We still missed it.

442
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:39,991
Ximen.

443
00:39:40,951 --> 00:39:43,031
Don't you think that this is a sign

444
00:39:43,671 --> 00:39:44,871
that nothing

445
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:47,351
would remain?

446
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:51,111
Did you realize it?

447
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:54,231
After we met again,

448
00:39:55,591 --> 00:39:56,991
everything we talked about

449
00:39:57,791 --> 00:39:59,271
was our past.

450
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:02,671
And it can only stay in the past.

451
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:09,991
We think of the past

452
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:12,311
because we can't go back to it anymore.

453
00:40:14,271 --> 00:40:15,751
Is that what you're trying to say?

454
00:40:42,271 --> 00:40:43,471
I'm sorry.

455
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:48,911
Five years ago,

456
00:40:49,311 --> 00:40:50,631
that day you asked me to come here

457
00:40:51,831 --> 00:40:53,271
was our "Once in a Lifetime" moment.

458
00:40:55,631 --> 00:40:56,831
I missed it.

459
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,751
It's fine.

460
00:41:03,991 --> 00:41:05,071
Some things

461
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:07,631
are only meaningful if they happen

462
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:09,751
right there and then.

463
00:41:15,711 --> 00:41:16,711
If you missed it,

464
00:41:17,871 --> 00:41:19,031
just move on.

465
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:30,391
Actually, I can tell

466
00:41:33,151 --> 00:41:34,631
that your "Once in a Lifetime" moment

467
00:41:37,711 --> 00:41:38,911
doesn't belong to me anymore.

468
00:41:43,471 --> 00:41:44,671
It belongs to another girl.

469
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:49,511
Girls' intuition can be very accurate.

470
00:41:57,951 --> 00:41:58,831
Xiaogeng.

471
00:42:00,991 --> 00:42:03,151
I owe you a confession nevertheless.

472
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:08,591
The old me

473
00:42:09,871 --> 00:42:10,831
really liked you.

474
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:14,151
Back then, you were

475
00:42:16,031 --> 00:42:17,791
more important to me than anything else.

476
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:30,511
Ximen.

477
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:33,711
Me too.

478
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:38,991
I used to really like you so much.
