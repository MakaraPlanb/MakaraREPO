EPISODE 29

4
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:31,374
<i>Look.</i>

5
00:01:31,454 --> 00:01:34,494
To preserve the history of the house,

6
00:01:34,614 --> 00:01:37,614
I suggest not breaking
its entire structure.

7
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:40,334
Let's keep some old structures
and add new elements.

8
00:01:40,654 --> 00:01:41,734
What do you think?

9
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:45,134
I'm not an expert in this field.

10
00:01:46,254 --> 00:01:47,694
You two can decide.

11
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:49,854
Then let's do it soon.

12
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:52,854
After Mr. Ye goes out of the country,

13
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:55,814
it might be a few years
before he comes back again.

14
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:57,614
You're going overseas?

15
00:01:58,654 --> 00:01:59,654
Where?

16
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:02,654
Well...

17
00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:04,854
Talk to Mr. Ye.

18
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:14,774
Don't worry.

19
00:02:16,294 --> 00:02:18,454
I'll complete the design for your house.

20
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:21,374
I'll take care of it until it's finished.

21
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:24,174
How long will you be away?

22
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:26,534
Aren't you coming back anymore?

23
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:27,774
Why?

24
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,094
I accepted the offer

25
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,934
from Mr. Brown, a Cambridge seismologist.

26
00:02:36,534 --> 00:02:39,654
I'm joining his team
to go all over the world

27
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:42,454
to help construct earthquake-proof
houses for earthquake victims.

28
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:46,134
When are you leaving?

29
00:02:46,814 --> 00:02:47,814
Soon.

30
00:02:53,294 --> 00:02:54,134
All right.

31
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:57,334
Are you mad?

32
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,454
What right do I have to be mad?

33
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:06,374
With such a great plan,

34
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,854
you should forge ahead without hesitation.

35
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:12,934
You don't have a house and family.

36
00:03:13,134 --> 00:03:14,894
There's nothing to keep you here.

37
00:03:15,054 --> 00:03:16,694
You can go wherever you want.

38
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:22,054
But I'm not like you.

39
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:25,574
This is my work.

40
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:28,174
It's also my dream.

41
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:31,334
This is what I do.

42
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:34,214
Then we have nothing to talk about, right?

43
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:36,254
We shouldn't have started
in the first place.

44
00:03:40,414 --> 00:03:41,974
Don't you have any feelings for me?

45
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:43,574
No.

46
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,374
Then why did you keep
that coconut in your house?

47
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:56,614
You saw it?

48
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:16,654
Yes.

49
00:04:20,854 --> 00:04:22,614
After I saw you again,

50
00:04:25,294 --> 00:04:27,134
I don't want to travel alone anymore.

51
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:31,374
I want to see the world with you.

52
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:33,654
And live in different tents.

53
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,534
Sing,

54
00:04:35,894 --> 00:04:36,934
dance,

55
00:04:37,014 --> 00:04:38,454
drink and chat.

56
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:41,694
That's the life I dream of.

57
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:48,294
Why me?

58
00:04:50,174 --> 00:04:51,174
Fate.

59
00:04:52,494 --> 00:04:53,454
Fate?

60
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:56,494
You want me to believe in fate?

61
00:04:56,574 --> 00:04:57,614
I believe in it.

62
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,134
I believe that fate let us
meet each other.

63
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,694
I've never been happier than that day.

64
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:08,454
But that won't last forever.

65
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:11,934
You can decide if will or won't.

66
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:16,494
Are you willing to come with me, Caina?

67
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:21,614
I...

68
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:25,174
You don't have to answer me now.

69
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:30,054
Because your answer
is very important to me.

70
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,094
Tell me after thinking about it.

71
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:51,774
Mr. Lu, what's the matter?

72
00:05:52,614 --> 00:05:56,534
The robot vacuum got stuck on something
while it was cleaning.

73
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:57,814
I'm trying to get it out.

74
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:13,614
It's a coconut.

75
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:16,534
I wonder when it fell on the floor.

76
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:41,934
Why did I bring you home with me?

77
00:07:13,214 --> 00:07:14,294
I believe in it.

78
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:16,814
I believe that fate let us
meet each other.

79
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:21,014
I've never been happier than that day.

80
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:29,134
<i>But that won't last forever.</i>

81
00:07:30,814 --> 00:07:32,454
<i>You can decide if will or won't.</i>

82
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:02,494
<i>My dear Caina.</i>

83
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:03,534
<i>I miss you.</i>

84
00:08:03,614 --> 00:08:04,654
<i>What are you doing now?</i>

85
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:10,254
<i>Meizuo.</i>

86
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:12,894
<i>Let's meet at the bar in an hour.</i>

87
00:08:12,974 --> 00:08:14,814
<i>I have something important to tell you.</i>

88
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:26,054
What should I do?

89
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,694
What should I do?

90
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:54,574
Why am I leaving?

91
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:02,854
Caina?

92
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:06,254
It's late. Why are you here?

93
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:10,054
Were you looking for me?

94
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:20,734
You said I can decide on everything.

95
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,454
You'll do whatever I want.

96
00:09:25,654 --> 00:09:29,414
But I think the answer lies with you.

97
00:09:31,894 --> 00:09:33,654
This is the answer I'm giving you.

98
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:36,854
What happened, Caina?

99
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:38,534
I should be the one asking that!

100
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:41,654
You like to travel
and see different women.

101
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:42,854
Don't get me involved!

102
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:45,654
-Why do you say that?
-I saw it.

103
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:52,254
-Ding Qi? Listen to me, Caina.
-You don't need to explain.

104
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:53,534
I don't want to hear it.

105
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:55,094
-Listen.
-It's none of my business!

106
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:56,854
I came to tell you

107
00:09:58,094 --> 00:09:59,534
that I hope you'll leave.

108
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:02,094
Regardless if it's three or five years,

109
00:10:02,974 --> 00:10:05,734
I never want to see you again
in this lifetime.

110
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:56,094
What do you think?

111
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:58,174
The green color is quite interesting.

112
00:10:58,254 --> 00:10:59,974
I know, right? That's my latest cocktail.

113
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:01,414
Try it and see if you like it.

114
00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:03,094
You're here.

115
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,494
I know I asked you to come here.

116
00:11:09,574 --> 00:11:11,374
Why did you arrive
ten minutes earlier than me?

117
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:13,814
Miss Caina.

118
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,374
Because I want to let girls
who admire me know

119
00:11:16,454 --> 00:11:17,494
that I'm waiting for her.

120
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:19,894
Meizuo.

121
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:21,974
You're a really good man.

122
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:25,894
But don't girls like bad men?

123
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:32,054
I left that bad man in the end.

124
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:35,214
Is something bothering you?

125
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:38,134
No.

126
00:11:38,694 --> 00:11:39,894
Nothing is bothering me.

127
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:46,894
I have such a cute
and thoughtful little boyfriend.

128
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:49,454
Others would be so envious of me.

129
00:11:55,894 --> 00:11:57,854
Waiter, I want to drink.

130
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:00,974
Give me a double red dynamite.

131
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,134
All right.

132
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:04,774
You're drinking so much.

133
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:06,014
Are you trying to get drunk?

134
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,254
I can hold my liquor now.

135
00:12:12,454 --> 00:12:13,694
Your red dynamite.

136
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:15,814
Don't just...

137
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:29,094
Caina, are you all right?

138
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:34,774
I just feel

139
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:38,974
that I'm so lucky not to fall in love
with a bad man.

140
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:44,814
Let's drink.

141
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:46,294
Don't drink anymore.

142
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:51,054
Be careful.

143
00:13:55,014 --> 00:13:56,494
Ms. Zhou, why are you so drunk?

144
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:57,854
-Take her upstairs.
-All right.

145
00:13:57,934 --> 00:13:59,214
Hi, Mr. Lu.

146
00:13:59,374 --> 00:14:00,214
Go on.

147
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:07,054
-You...
-I'm home.

148
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:08,374
Lie down and rest for a while.

149
00:14:10,174 --> 00:14:11,774
But I still want to drink.

150
00:14:11,854 --> 00:14:13,614
-I'm not drunk.
-Yes, you are.

151
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:14,774
Give me more.

152
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,334
Lie down and rest for a while.

153
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:17,614
-Okay?
-Give me more.

154
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:20,814
-Mr. Lu.
-Here.

155
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:24,894
Yes. You can drink more.
Have some warm water first.

156
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:27,734
-Is it alcohol?
-Yes, it is.

157
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:35,094
Liar!

158
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,614
What is that?

159
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:47,374
It's so annoying.

160
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:49,534
I don't want to see it. Mr. Lu.

161
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:51,054
Throw it away!

162
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:52,534
Throw this lousy coconut away!

163
00:14:52,814 --> 00:14:54,894
But Ms. Zhou this is your...

164
00:14:56,134 --> 00:14:57,414
Throw it away!

165
00:14:58,134 --> 00:15:00,774
-Get it out of my sight!
-Okay.

166
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,494
I'll throw it away.

167
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:05,974
I will.

168
00:15:14,774 --> 00:15:15,894
Are you all right?

169
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:21,414
Come on.

170
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:44,014
The coconut.

171
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:46,094
Take it away.

172
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:50,654
Why?

173
00:15:51,214 --> 00:15:52,414
The coconut.

174
00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:55,134
I don't want to see it.

175
00:15:58,654 --> 00:15:59,974
Why?

176
00:16:00,614 --> 00:16:04,254
The coconut has a smile
carved by Ye Mingchuan.

177
00:16:06,014 --> 00:16:09,254
I don't want to see
that annoying guy anymore.

178
00:16:55,854 --> 00:16:57,134
Don't just...

179
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:48,574
You're awake?

180
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:51,254
Meizuo?

181
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:52,734
Good morning.

182
00:17:54,454 --> 00:17:55,534
Here you go, Ms. Zhou.

183
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:57,974
-Drink orange juice for your hangover.
-Okay.

184
00:18:00,254 --> 00:18:01,134
Meizuo.

185
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:03,654
Didn't you go home last night?

186
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:06,974
Ms. Zhou, have you forgotten?

187
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:09,054
You were so drunk last night.

188
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:10,574
Meizuo brought you home.

189
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:12,414
And he took care of you all night.

190
00:18:22,014 --> 00:18:23,374
Sorry, Meizuo.

191
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:26,254
I must have been a sight yesterday, right?

192
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,054
It's fine.

193
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:30,894
I've seen worse.

194
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:33,734
Ms. Zhou.

195
00:18:34,174 --> 00:18:38,294
You vomited and made a fuss
the whole night.

196
00:18:38,374 --> 00:18:39,614
And you kept on talking.

197
00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:43,294
You insisted on throwing
that coconut away.

198
00:18:43,694 --> 00:18:46,174
And you insisted you were not drunk
and you wanted to drink more.

199
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,534
What? Say it again.

200
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:52,214
And you insisted you were not drunk
and you wanted to drink more.

201
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,214
-Before that.
-Before...

202
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:59,334
You asked me to throw that coconut away.

203
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,094
Where did you throw it?

204
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:03,694
In the trash can outside.

205
00:19:28,294 --> 00:19:30,254
I don't want to see it.

206
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:34,894
Why?

207
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:39,574
The coconut has a smile
carved by Ye Mingchuan.

208
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:44,014
I don't want to see
that annoying guy anymore.

209
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,214
-It smells so good.
-Yes.

210
00:21:14,294 --> 00:21:16,174
-It's delicious.
-I'm so hungry.

211
00:21:16,254 --> 00:21:17,894
Hello to the viewers of Tengxun broadcast.

212
00:21:18,014 --> 00:21:19,694
We're broadcasting now.

213
00:21:19,774 --> 00:21:22,214
I'm Ms. Fang, your foodie host.

214
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:25,294
Welcome to one of the food streets
in the fishing village.

215
00:21:27,254 --> 00:21:31,574
The trending Dong's King of Squid
in Weibo created a squid fever here

216
00:21:31,854 --> 00:21:35,014
and attracted many tourists,
making this place a hot spot.

217
00:21:36,774 --> 00:21:39,054
Look. This girl wearing a cute hat

218
00:21:39,134 --> 00:21:40,894
is the creator of Dong's King of Squid.

219
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,134
Mom, these are ready.

220
00:21:43,814 --> 00:21:44,814
Here.

221
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:46,374
Be careful. It's hot.

222
00:21:46,454 --> 00:21:48,134
-Hi, how many do you want?
-Two.

223
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:49,374
Okay, two.

224
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:53,454
Here.

225
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:55,374
-Hi, how many do you want?
-Two.

226
00:21:55,454 --> 00:21:57,694
Two. I have two here.

227
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:03,014
Here you go.

228
00:22:03,854 --> 00:22:05,414
Come on. Cheers.

229
00:22:07,214 --> 00:22:08,294
Sorry to keep you waiting.

230
00:22:10,294 --> 00:22:11,894
Mom, it's for that table over there.

231
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:14,694
Be careful. It's hot.

232
00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:17,934
Here. These are yours.

233
00:22:18,454 --> 00:22:19,334
Enjoy.

234
00:22:29,374 --> 00:22:31,854
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

235
00:22:40,294 --> 00:22:41,414
<i>Mom, these are ready.</i>

236
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:43,574
<i>Hi, how many do you want?</i>

237
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,374
<i>-Two.
-Okay. Two.</i>

238
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:52,774
DAOMING SI

239
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,654
Hello? Daoming Si.

240
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:56,414
Are you free right now?

241
00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:01,494
Hey.

242
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:03,174
Are you listening to me?

243
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:05,814
Shancai's in the fishing village nearby.

244
00:23:07,414 --> 00:23:08,374
You found her?

245
00:23:14,814 --> 00:23:16,494
I thought she was kidnapped
for hard labor.

246
00:23:18,054 --> 00:23:19,414
She was.

247
00:23:19,814 --> 00:23:21,334
She looks tired.

248
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:25,454
Do you know what she's doing?

249
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:29,374
She's grilling squid.

250
00:23:30,414 --> 00:23:31,454
She's all sweaty.

251
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:33,374
She can't speak properly
from all the smoke.

252
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:35,214
And she's creating a new flavor.

253
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:38,094
She's really great.

254
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:39,574
She's so creative.

255
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:47,654
Why are you still sitting there?
Go pick her up.

256
00:23:47,814 --> 00:23:48,734
I'm not going.

257
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:50,894
You go.

258
00:23:51,454 --> 00:23:53,694
But what does it have to do with me?

259
00:23:53,774 --> 00:23:56,334
If it's none of your business,
it's even more so with me.

260
00:23:57,294 --> 00:23:58,814
You're her friend. You can go.

261
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:01,054
Let's go together.

262
00:24:03,814 --> 00:24:04,774
Don't be silly.

263
00:24:04,974 --> 00:24:06,174
She left me.

264
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:07,654
Why should I go?

265
00:24:11,654 --> 00:24:12,734
Go if you want to.

266
00:24:13,174 --> 00:24:14,334
You don't need my permission.

267
00:25:49,694 --> 00:25:51,174
That song earlier was really good.

268
00:25:51,814 --> 00:25:52,654
Right?

269
00:25:55,494 --> 00:25:56,694
My makeup is all messed up.

270
00:25:57,454 --> 00:25:58,814
My eyes are swollen.

271
00:26:05,654 --> 00:26:08,414
I think you're especially cute today.

272
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:13,174
Are you teasing me?

273
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:15,454
I'm serious.

274
00:26:19,694 --> 00:26:20,614
Meizuo.

275
00:26:21,774 --> 00:26:23,254
Why are you so nice to me?

276
00:26:27,174 --> 00:26:28,294
Because you're worth it.

277
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,214
Next time, I'll bring you
to a jazz concert.

278
00:26:53,534 --> 00:26:54,934
What's your favorite song?

279
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,334
I like <i>Casablanca</i>.

280
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:01,214
Have you seen that movie?

281
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:05,214
It's a story about Rick
sending his lover and rival away.

282
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,094
-Who are you looking for?
-I'm Zhou Caina's boyfriend.

283
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,814
I'm here to see Mr. Ye Mingchuan.

284
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:26,614
If you don't let him see me,

285
00:27:26,694 --> 00:27:28,534
I'll stand here
until he gets off from work.

286
00:27:29,574 --> 00:27:31,854
-You--
-It's simple and straightforward.

287
00:27:32,174 --> 00:27:35,894
I'm here to end our rivalry
once and for all.

288
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:37,334
Please tell him that.

289
00:27:45,494 --> 00:27:48,414
You're not here to discuss
architectural design with me, are you?

290
00:27:48,574 --> 00:27:49,534
Ye Mingchuan.

291
00:27:50,054 --> 00:27:51,574
What exactly did you do to Caina?

292
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,174
What do you mean?

293
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:56,574
Caina seems so unhappy.

294
00:27:57,974 --> 00:28:00,414
I know it's because of you.

295
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:03,334
You should ask her.

296
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:04,374
Why are you asking me?

297
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:06,494
Because I care about her.

298
00:28:06,694 --> 00:28:07,974
I don't want her to be sad.

299
00:28:13,054 --> 00:28:13,974
Is that so?

300
00:28:16,254 --> 00:28:17,774
What are your feelings towards Caina?

301
00:28:20,134 --> 00:28:21,734
You shouldn't be the one asking me.

302
00:28:23,774 --> 00:28:25,814
Do you want to go on like this?

303
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:28,934
Flirt with girls, dump them,
not take any responsibility,

304
00:28:29,014 --> 00:28:30,974
and continue making them miserable?

305
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:35,734
What have you done for her?

306
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:38,894
I worked hard to make her happy.

307
00:28:38,974 --> 00:28:40,654
I make her laugh every day.

308
00:28:41,014 --> 00:28:44,414
I give her little gifts every day
to show her how I feel.

309
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:46,294
How about you?

310
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:50,214
Yes.

311
00:28:52,574 --> 00:28:53,894
Every time I see her,

312
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:58,694
I can see the uneasiness in her eyes.

313
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:00,974
I want to tell you something.

314
00:29:03,894 --> 00:29:06,254
I'm in a hurry. Maybe next time.
Meizuo's waiting for me.

315
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:07,774
You don't have to.

316
00:29:08,534 --> 00:29:10,294
Just don't avoid me in the future.

317
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:13,334
I...

318
00:29:15,134 --> 00:29:16,574
I'm not avoiding you.

319
00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:24,054
I thought I could do it.

320
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:29,054
But no matter how hard I try,
I can't make her happy.

321
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:31,974
I can only make her sad.

322
00:29:32,214 --> 00:29:34,494
-Ding Qi? Listen to me, Caina.
-You don't need to explain.

323
00:29:34,574 --> 00:29:35,894
I don't want to hear it.

324
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,334
-Listen.
-It's none of my business!

325
00:29:37,414 --> 00:29:39,094
I came to tell you

326
00:29:40,454 --> 00:29:42,174
that I hope you'll leave.

327
00:29:43,134 --> 00:29:44,974
Regardless if it's three or five years,

328
00:29:45,374 --> 00:29:48,614
I never want to see you again
in this lifetime.

329
00:29:52,254 --> 00:29:53,374
Even now,

330
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:56,974
she thinks I'm seeing different women.

331
00:29:58,174 --> 00:29:59,294
She's so disappointed in me.

332
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,254
James is seeing another woman.

333
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,134
What should I do?

334
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:08,734
What should I do?

335
00:30:10,614 --> 00:30:11,934
It'll be all right.

336
00:30:16,694 --> 00:30:17,534
Fine.

337
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:20,814
Just treat me as a womanizing scumbag.

338
00:30:22,414 --> 00:30:25,494
Then she'd get over me quickly
and be happy again.

339
00:30:28,574 --> 00:30:30,414
What do you mean?

340
00:30:32,094 --> 00:30:33,494
I won't bother her again.

341
00:30:35,374 --> 00:30:36,934
I've accepted an offer overseas.

342
00:30:37,414 --> 00:30:38,534
I've made the preparations.

343
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:40,214
I'll be leaving in a few days.

344
00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:42,454
But before I go,

345
00:30:43,894 --> 00:30:46,254
I hope you can give something to her.

346
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:59,414
Please give this to her on my behalf.

347
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:04,734
I hope you can always make her happy.

348
00:31:13,094 --> 00:31:14,014
DONG'S KING OF SQUID

349
00:31:14,094 --> 00:31:16,294
-It's taking so long.
-I'm craving this.

350
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,614
-How much longer?
-Here.

351
00:31:17,694 --> 00:31:19,014
We've lined up for two hours.

352
00:31:19,894 --> 00:31:21,054
I'm so hungry.

353
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:22,814
How many are we getting?

354
00:31:23,454 --> 00:31:24,814
-My legs are killing me.
-It's numb.

355
00:31:25,574 --> 00:31:26,974
-Is two enough?
-Almost done.

356
00:31:28,734 --> 00:31:30,534
There are so many people.
Never mind. Let's go.

357
00:31:30,614 --> 00:31:31,614
It smells so good.

358
00:31:32,814 --> 00:31:33,854
We're almost there.

359
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:39,614
Why is your hat so ugly?

360
00:31:43,454 --> 00:31:44,654
Why are you here?

361
00:31:45,214 --> 00:31:46,574
I'm here to bring you home.

362
00:31:50,334 --> 00:31:52,494
Huaze Lei. Make sure to eat a lot.

363
00:31:52,574 --> 00:31:54,094
Don't be shy.

364
00:31:54,774 --> 00:31:56,174
Thank you.

365
00:31:58,614 --> 00:31:59,614
Here.

366
00:32:01,174 --> 00:32:03,054
Is this the legendary
Eight Treasure Squid?

367
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:05,014
-It's really good.
-All right.

368
00:32:05,094 --> 00:32:07,454
Do you want some Yakult with it?
It will taste even better.

369
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:08,414
Here.

370
00:32:09,574 --> 00:32:10,454
By the way, Shancai.

371
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:12,254
You've stayed here for so long.

372
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:13,734
When are you going back to school?

373
00:32:15,294 --> 00:32:16,894
I don't want to go back yet.

374
00:32:18,094 --> 00:32:20,494
Is your seafood survey assignment
that difficult?

375
00:32:20,694 --> 00:32:21,654
You're not done yet?

376
00:32:24,854 --> 00:32:26,294
No, I'm not.

377
00:32:27,574 --> 00:32:28,494
Shancai.

378
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:31,454
I remember your professor said
that you can go back

379
00:32:31,694 --> 00:32:32,854
if you're almost done with it.

380
00:32:34,094 --> 00:32:35,774
Yes. Why are you staying here?

381
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:37,934
You can ask your professors
if you have any questions.

382
00:32:38,014 --> 00:32:39,014
Right? Here.

383
00:32:39,894 --> 00:32:41,414
Here. Huaze Lei.

384
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:44,614
-Try this flavor.
-Shancai has never cut any class before.

385
00:32:45,094 --> 00:32:46,214
She does well in school.

386
00:32:46,294 --> 00:32:48,614
We don't need to worry about her.

387
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:51,774
-Of course. Whose daughter is she?
-Yes.

388
00:32:52,334 --> 00:32:55,414
I also believe Shancai
would not disappoint you.

389
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:57,734
Right, Shancai?

390
00:33:05,574 --> 00:33:07,694
I'll go back to school
as soon as possible.

391
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:10,374
Have some more.

392
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:12,654
They don't have this in school.

393
00:33:14,134 --> 00:33:15,174
Your Yakult.

394
00:33:21,294 --> 00:33:23,294
It's quite nice here.

395
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:26,774
How did you know I'm here?

396
00:33:30,014 --> 00:33:32,054
I saw the trending video online.

397
00:33:33,214 --> 00:33:35,134
Your outfit was really nice.

398
00:33:35,574 --> 00:33:37,334
You were grilling squid.

399
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,574
You looked really cool cooking it.

400
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:44,934
You're the special prize winner
of the culinary competition indeed.

401
00:33:49,414 --> 00:33:50,774
You didn't disappoint.

402
00:33:51,454 --> 00:33:53,134
You can survive anywhere.

403
00:33:56,094 --> 00:33:57,374
Thanks for coming here.

404
00:33:58,854 --> 00:33:59,734
Don't thank me.

405
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:06,014
How is he doing?

406
00:34:10,134 --> 00:34:11,854
You can see him
when you go back to school.

407
00:34:18,614 --> 00:34:21,814
If you like him that much,
why won't you tell him?

408
00:34:25,494 --> 00:34:27,134
It's because I like him,

409
00:34:28,254 --> 00:34:29,774
that's why I can't let him know.

410
00:34:38,614 --> 00:34:40,414
<i>-Hi, how many do you want?
-Three.</i>

411
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:41,414
<i>Three. All right.</i>

412
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:43,214
<i>Do you want extra or less chili?</i>

413
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:44,494
<i>-Extra.
-All right.</i>

414
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:45,534
<i>-Yes.
-Here.</i>

415
00:34:45,614 --> 00:34:47,494
<i>How many do you want?</i>

416
00:34:47,574 --> 00:34:48,894
<i>-Two.
-Two. All right.</i>

417
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,294
<i>-Do you want extra chili?
-No. Put less.</i>

418
00:34:51,654 --> 00:34:52,494
<i>All right.</i>

419
00:34:53,094 --> 00:34:53,934
<i>Is two enough?</i>

420
00:34:54,014 --> 00:34:55,014
<i>-Dine-in.
-Almost done.</i>

421
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,734
<i>Please wait a moment.</i>

422
00:34:57,134 --> 00:34:59,014
<i>There are so many people. Let's go.</i>

423
00:34:59,094 --> 00:35:00,814
<i>Three sticks with extra chili.</i>

424
00:35:00,894 --> 00:35:02,134
<i>-Okay, thanks.
-Be careful.</i>

425
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:03,854
<i>-Thank you.
-Look at that girl.</i>

426
00:35:03,974 --> 00:35:05,254
<i>-She's quite efficient.
-Yes.</i>

427
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:07,014
<i>Hi, how many do you want?</i>

428
00:35:07,094 --> 00:35:08,414
<i>-Five.
-Give me five.</i>

429
00:35:08,494 --> 00:35:09,534
<i>All right.</i>

430
00:35:09,614 --> 00:35:11,454
<i>-It's good.
-I'm craving this.</i>

431
00:35:11,534 --> 00:35:12,454
<i>It's delicious.</i>

432
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:13,974
<i>-Yes.
-Two sticks. Be careful.</i>

433
00:35:14,054 --> 00:35:15,454
<i>-We've lined up for two hours.
-Thanks.</i>

434
00:35:15,534 --> 00:35:16,414
<i>-It's numb.
-It's numb.</i>

435
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:18,574
Hi, how many do you want?

436
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:20,134
-I want five.
-Five.

437
00:35:20,214 --> 00:35:21,494
There are so many people.

438
00:35:23,574 --> 00:35:26,014
-Do you want extra or less chili?
-Less.

439
00:35:26,094 --> 00:35:27,174
<i>All right.</i>

440
00:35:27,254 --> 00:35:28,734
<i>-It smells so good.
-Two for me.</i>

441
00:35:28,814 --> 00:35:30,414
<i>-Sure. Two, right?
-Yes.</i>

442
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:32,734
<i>Do you want extra or less chili?</i>

443
00:35:32,814 --> 00:35:33,934
<i>Extra.</i>

444
00:35:34,494 --> 00:35:35,934
<i>-Sure. Please wait.
-I'm so hungry.</i>

445
00:36:04,934 --> 00:36:05,934
What are you looking for?

446
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:10,054
A place to rent in Airbnb.

447
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,174
There's no need.

448
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:14,014
We already took care of it.

449
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:16,494
What?

450
00:36:42,574 --> 00:36:44,134
Shancai, we're here.

451
00:37:10,414 --> 00:37:11,374
Ta-da!

452
00:37:11,734 --> 00:37:12,694
Look.

453
00:37:16,654 --> 00:37:17,854
It's so nice.

454
00:37:17,934 --> 00:37:19,934
Is this really where I lived?

455
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:21,774
Let me tell you.

456
00:37:22,254 --> 00:37:23,214
This sofa.

457
00:37:24,014 --> 00:37:24,974
I bought it.

458
00:37:25,694 --> 00:37:27,414
Xiaoyou bought this chair.

459
00:37:27,654 --> 00:37:28,854
And this knife.

460
00:37:28,934 --> 00:37:30,294
Li Zhen brought it from home.

461
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:31,894
-Nice, right?
-It's not just nice.

462
00:37:32,174 --> 00:37:34,134
It's a dreamland.

463
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:38,094
This table is so pretty too.

464
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:40,654
-Is it from the online second-hand store?
-Yes.

465
00:37:41,214 --> 00:37:42,894
I was afraid you'll be mad
if it's too expensive.

466
00:37:42,974 --> 00:37:44,694
The quality might be bad
if it's too cheap.

467
00:37:44,774 --> 00:37:48,094
So I chose carefully
from the online second-hand store.

468
00:37:48,174 --> 00:37:49,854
This is brand new.

469
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,254
I bought it when I saw
that it's 40 percent off.

470
00:37:52,414 --> 00:37:53,974
They'll deliver more furniture later.

471
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:56,894
Thank you, Qinghe. I really like it.

472
00:37:57,934 --> 00:37:59,134
Why do you need to thank me?

473
00:37:59,214 --> 00:38:00,814
I also picked that pillow for you.

474
00:38:00,894 --> 00:38:02,934
Hugging it is like hugging me.

475
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:13,934
Let's all welcome Shancai back.

476
00:38:14,894 --> 00:38:16,814
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

477
00:38:22,014 --> 00:38:22,854
By the way, Shancai,

478
00:38:23,694 --> 00:38:26,054
Meizuo wants me
to welcome you back on his behalf.

479
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:27,534
He'll come when he's free.

480
00:38:27,734 --> 00:38:29,854
You know he's pursuing Caina right now.

481
00:38:30,534 --> 00:38:33,094
And kept asking us to listen
to their love story.

482
00:38:33,654 --> 00:38:34,654
Really?

483
00:38:34,734 --> 00:38:35,894
I want to know too.

484
00:38:35,974 --> 00:38:37,454
How did they get together?

485
00:38:37,534 --> 00:38:39,654
Someone's willing to listen to it.

486
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:41,814
Great! We're finally off the hook.

487
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:46,414
Xiaozi, you can ask Meizuo anytime.

488
00:38:47,134 --> 00:38:49,574
You have to listen to him yourself.

489
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:53,854
I think you guys are trying to trick me.

490
00:38:56,614 --> 00:38:58,414
How come? Why would we do that to you?

491
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:03,814
-Hey, Shancai. I want to try your squid.
-Me too.

492
00:39:03,894 --> 00:39:05,454
-Shancai, we all want to try it.
-No.

493
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:07,614
There are so many of you.

494
00:39:07,694 --> 00:39:08,934
If I grill them now,

495
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:11,094
then won't all of you suffocate
from the smoke?

496
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:19,654
I'll get it.

497
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:29,774
What...

498
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,094
What's this?

499
00:39:32,054 --> 00:39:33,774
Hi, I'm ZZ Bear.

500
00:39:34,574 --> 00:39:38,894
We're delivering the furniture you bought
from the online second-hand store.

501
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,374
You deliver so fast!

502
00:39:52,454 --> 00:39:55,814
Thank you for choosing
our online second-hand store.

503
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:59,454
Our items are varied and practical.

504
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:01,454
We hope you'll continue supporting us.

505
00:40:01,534 --> 00:40:04,374
By the way, this is for you.

506
00:40:05,014 --> 00:40:06,934
It's so cute! Thank you.

507
00:40:07,774 --> 00:40:09,774
I just ordered it yesterday.
It's here today.

508
00:40:10,214 --> 00:40:11,774
ZZ Bear, you're so great!

509
00:40:11,854 --> 00:40:13,854
I want to give you a big hug!

510
00:40:14,614 --> 00:40:17,134
<i>Dong Shancai, you're so lucky.</i>

511
00:40:17,974 --> 00:40:21,294
<i>There are so many good friends
who care about you.</i>

512
00:40:21,534 --> 00:40:22,574
Come on.

513
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:23,734
<i>Even though...</i>

514
00:40:24,614 --> 00:40:26,334
-I want to take a picture too.
-I'll do it.

515
00:40:26,534 --> 00:40:27,454
Move over a bit.

516
00:40:29,254 --> 00:40:30,694
<i>I can't be that greedy.</i>

517
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:33,894
<i>I already have so much.</i>

518
00:40:44,654 --> 00:40:46,694
FRIEND ACTIVITY

519
00:40:46,774 --> 00:40:47,814
DONG SHANCAI

520
00:40:47,894 --> 00:40:49,934
<i>Thank you, Huaze Lei,
for bringing me back to Shanghai</i>

521
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,894
<i>and renting my old place.</i>

522
00:40:52,254 --> 00:40:55,614
<i>Thanks to all my good friends
who prepared such a nice surprise.</i>

523
00:40:55,934 --> 00:40:57,654
<i>Thank you, everyone. I'm back!</i>

524
00:41:13,854 --> 00:41:15,134
<i>Am I a fool?</i>

525
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,294
<i>I know perfectly well that Ye Mingchuan
is just playing around.</i>

526
00:41:20,974 --> 00:41:22,214
<i>That night in Yunan,</i>

527
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:24,374
<i>he said he won't settle down.</i>

528
00:41:25,534 --> 00:41:26,694
<i>Now,</i>

529
00:41:27,574 --> 00:41:29,654
<i>I saw him flirting with his assistant.</i>

530
00:41:31,974 --> 00:41:33,174
<i>I should have realized</i>

531
00:41:33,614 --> 00:41:35,454
<i>that he's not serious with me.</i>

532
00:41:40,974 --> 00:41:42,854
<i>Why am I still keeping this lousy coconut?</i>

533
00:41:45,014 --> 00:41:46,374
<i>I must be crazy.</i>

534
00:41:50,294 --> 00:41:51,534
<i>What should I do?</i>

535
00:41:55,374 --> 00:41:56,854
Is there a cocktail called,

536
00:41:56,934 --> 00:42:00,294
"I'll surely regret what I'll do today"?

537
00:42:00,574 --> 00:42:01,454
Yes.

538
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:03,814
Then I want one.

539
00:42:04,134 --> 00:42:07,454
And add a little "sacrifice" in it.

540
00:42:09,574 --> 00:42:10,454
All right.

541
00:42:14,854 --> 00:42:16,014
No matter what,

542
00:42:16,574 --> 00:42:18,894
meeting me is the start of your happiness.

543
00:42:19,614 --> 00:42:20,854
To your future.

Cheers.

545
00:42:22,734 --> 00:42:23,574
I like it.

546
00:42:24,134 --> 00:42:26,054
Meeting you is the start of my happiness.

547
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:27,974
Let's toast to our future.

548
00:42:33,414 --> 00:42:34,454
Your "sacrifice."

549
00:42:38,854 --> 00:42:40,254
I'll surely regret

550
00:42:41,054 --> 00:42:42,734
what I'll do today.
