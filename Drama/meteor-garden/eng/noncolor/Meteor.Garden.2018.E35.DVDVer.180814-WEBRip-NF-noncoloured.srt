EPISODE 35

4
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,359
Shancai, why are you here?

5
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,679
Aren't you off today?

6
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:58,759
I just happened to pass by.

7
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,599
I'm telling you.

8
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:02,039
There are so many orders today.

9
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:03,519
I can't handle it on my own.

10
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,199
Our boss went out earlier.

11
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,199
Do you still have a hangover?

12
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,639
Come and help me for a while.

13
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,359
Okay, sure.

14
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,519
Go get changed.

15
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:14,519
Okay.

16
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:22,359
Shancai.

17
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,119
No matter what happens
to my family in the future,

18
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,839
don't disappear on your own again.

19
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,159
I'm happy that you and Daoming Si
are together.

20
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:13,199
And I'm even happier to hear
about how you feel.

21
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:16,279
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,039
Thank you...

23
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,839
for not giving up.

24
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,319
Xiaoyou?

25
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,519
Why are you here?

26
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,399
I was waiting for you.

27
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,319
You just stood here and waited?

28
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,919
It seems you like to surprise people.

29
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:31,919
I'm sorry for doing this so suddenly.

30
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:33,839
It's all right.

31
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:37,319
What if I didn't come home?

32
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,399
Then I would have left.

33
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:45,159
Actually, I'm here to apologize to you.

34
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:46,599
Apologize to me?

35
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,919
I'm sorry about yesterday.

36
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,799
It's okay. I'm used to it.

37
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,959
If I worried about these things,
then I'd be really busy.

38
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,999
I thought you'd be mad.

39
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,399
It turns out you don't care.

40
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,599
I thought I already caught your attention.

41
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,079
Xiaoyou.

42
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,399
Do you know

43
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,679
why I never dated any girls
in Mingde University?

44
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:21,119
Because they're too close.
So it'd be too irritating for you?

45
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:23,559
That's right. You're very smart.

46
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,999
You're Shancai's friend.
Shancai is my good friend's girlfriend.

47
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:31,559
That means you're even
more irritating than Mingde's girls.

48
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,559
Sorry to be so blunt.

49
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:40,119
However, I think we'd be good as friends,
don't you think?

50
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:44,599
It's getting late.

51
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,759
You should go home.
It might be dangerous later.

52
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,599
I want it all.

53
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,519
Last time, you said we can go on dates,
kiss and hug, right?

54
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,679
You have to keep your word.

55
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,279
Xiaoyou.

56
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,279
When did you become so bold?

57
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:08,519
You're brave enough to say these things.

58
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,839
You weren't like that before.

59
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,959
If I don't learn to say these things,

60
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,839
how can I like someone like you?

61
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:21,079
-But--
-Arrange your schedule then let me know.

62
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:24,359
Sorry to disturb you today.
I'll leave now. Bye.

63
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,999
Don't you have anything better to do?

64
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,519
Welcome home. Shanghai welcomes you.

65
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,279
Hey. Bottoms up.

66
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,519
-I agree.
-Yes.

67
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:46,919
I just got back
and you're treating me like this.

68
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:49,479
Why didn't you let us see you off?

69
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,039
I felt so guilty all these months.

70
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,199
One or two days in a few months
is more like it.

71
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,639
One day.

72
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,639
Why are you taking turns
with Si to play cool?

73
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,719
You feel like you're the only cool one.

74
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,679
Playing it cool? I was born cool.

75
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,399
Yes, you're the coolest.

76
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,439
-The coolest ever.
-Cool.

77
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,399
Are you as cool as me?

78
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:10,439
Hey.

79
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,079
How's your family situation?
Do you need any help?

80
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:16,599
It's fine.

81
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:19,479
They told me to just study hard
and not to worry.

82
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,359
So, are you willing
to come back to us now?

83
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,519
I never left.

84
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,759
You never left?

85
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,039
Then drink some more.

86
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,439
-Pour more.
-Here.

87
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,439
Full glass.

88
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,319
-Fill it up.
-Finish it all.

89
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,399
-That's fine.
-That's enough.

90
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,159
Drink it.

91
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,599
Two seconds. Countdown.

92
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,119
One.

93
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,319
Two.

94
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,799
You took too long.

95
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,759
One more.

96
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,679
Then let's toast to our friendship.

97
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:01,599
Okay. Here.

98
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,679
-Come on. Cheers.
-Cheers.

99
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,119
Cheers.

100
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:25,999
Do you know?

101
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:30,159
If you don't, then ask me.

102
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,439
I don't know but I don't want to ask you.

103
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:38,119
Why don't you have any curiosity
towards your friend?

104
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,599
I really don't.

105
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,039
I don't care.

106
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,559
Ask me.

107
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,919
Ask me how I'm doing lately.

108
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,639
-You're doing great.
-Who told you that?

109
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,439
-Aren't you doing great?
-I'm doing great.

110
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,439
All right.

111
00:09:58,199 --> 00:09:59,559
He played me.

112
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:03,879
Lei.

113
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:05,559
Just do what he wants,

114
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,359
or else he'll make a fuss all night.

115
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,079
We all won't be able to sleep.

116
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,319
Si, I told Lei as soon as it happened.

117
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,159
Not just Ximen and Meizuo,
even Xiaozi told me about it.

118
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,599
Three people. Three versions.

119
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,519
I don't care.

120
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,119
My version is the original one.

121
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,759
And I want to tell you myself.

122
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:32,039
All right.

123
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,919
Si, how are you and Shancai?

124
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,159
Shancai and I are officially together.

125
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,159
All right.

126
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,679
We're together now.

127
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:55,559
That's great!

128
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,799
Si.

129
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:01,399
Congratulations.

130
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:06,079
This is great. F4 is now back to normal.

131
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,159
I'm so moved.

132
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,479
Cut the crap. Let's make a toast!

133
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,079
Let's toast to Si officially being taken.
What do you think?

134
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,399
Not bad.

135
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:17,719
Come on. Cheers.

136
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,319
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

137
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,559
Lei.

138
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,399
When did you come back to Shanghai?

139
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,119
How's your family situation?

140
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:50,959
How are you?

141
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:53,839
Why are you here?

142
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,759
Yesterday.

143
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,399
Good.

144
00:11:58,599 --> 00:11:59,679
Because I want to come here.

145
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,119
Why are you here?

146
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,879
The same reason as you.

147
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,199
It's so good to have you back.

148
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:17,679
What are your plans?

149
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,759
To continue preparing for the recital.

150
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,439
Really?

151
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:26,239
That's great.
I'd love to hear you play the violin.

152
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,399
Is that so?

153
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:29,799
Yes.

154
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,759
Shancai.

155
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:39,599
You and Si are officially together, right?

156
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,119
I think it's a very good start.

157
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:46,919
Yes.

158
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,839
It just turned out this way.

159
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,679
Actually, I have mixed feelings about it.

160
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:57,359
I'm a little happy and a little sad.

161
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,039
On one hand, I hope things
between you and Si go smoothly.

162
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,279
On the other hand, you're special to me.

163
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,599
Special?

164
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,679
To put it bluntly,

165
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:16,279
you're like my pet.

166
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,039
Pet?

167
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:22,199
Never mind.

168
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:25,319
What do I expect you to say?

169
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,999
You should be happy.

170
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,719
We all should be happy.

171
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,279
You're my good friend's girlfriend.

172
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,319
This way,

173
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,079
we can be friends forever.

174
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:45,799
I'll go to practice now.

175
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,039
Lei.

176
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,359
You know I liked you before, right?

177
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:00,999
Goodbye, Shancai.

178
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,799
<i>I was able to easily blurt out something
I've had a hard time saying before.</i>

179
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,959
<i>I'm happy when I heard Lei say,
"friends forever."</i>

180
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,039
<i>My first love has ended.</i>

181
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,399
<i>This is the moment when love
became friendship.</i>

182
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,399
NEW FRIEND

183
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,639
XIAOYOU

184
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:33,199
How are you lately, Master Ximen?

185
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,079
I'm all right. Still the same as before.

186
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:38,319
I guess so.

187
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,799
Since your dad retired,

188
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:45,119
you've been hosting
the tea ceremonies on your own.

189
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:49,479
That's so great. Unlike me.

190
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:53,879
What's the matter?

191
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,679
You've always participated
in the exhibits, right?

192
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,999
I only participated.

193
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,799
I wasn't responsible for a whole project.

194
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,959
I just needed to take care of my part.

195
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,639
It's different now.

196
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,959
Whether it's a major or a minor thing,

197
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,639
I have to put in a lot of effort in them.

198
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,839
And there are so many details
to take care of.

199
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,479
I'm so stressed out.

200
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,879
You're a detailed person,
so you wouldn't have a problem.

201
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,079
I don't even have time for dates.

202
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,159
I have to go after finishing my drink.

203
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:41,039
What do you plan to do with Xiaoyou?

204
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,399
What can I do?

205
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,519
I think she's quite courageous,

206
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,559
but you won't do anything to her, right?

207
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:49,879
Am I crazy?

208
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:53,879
I'm not as brave as Si.
I don't want to get Shancai's flying kick.

209
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,279
Girls are like drinks at a bar.

210
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,759
Compared to the strong ones,

211
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,399
the fruity ones are easy to drink,
but we'd end up with a terrible hangover.

212
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:07,159
You've had a variety of drinks.

213
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,799
What kind of drink is Xiaoyou?

214
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:18,519
Harsh words don't seem to be effective.

215
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:20,839
I know she's forcing herself.

216
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:23,959
But she keeps going forward
and chasing after me.

217
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,439
Never hitting the brakes
even when she's speeding.

218
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:31,879
This girl is really devoted. Be careful.

219
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,759
You don't have to worry at all.

220
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,519
I'm not the least bit interested
in that kind of girl.

221
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,599
Is that so?

222
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,359
I think you've become warmhearted.

223
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,959
You see even fewer women now.

224
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,679
Meizuo, don't you have a date?

225
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:50,021
I should go.

226
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:54,181
It's hard to date older women.

227
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:57,341
You're always on call
and under strict supervision.

228
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:00,821
That's why dating is so much fun.

229
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:04,181
Age and love are not something
to worry about.

230
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:07,621
Meizuo, do you still like Caina?

231
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,901
She's a goddess, indeed.
You can worship her if you want.

232
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:13,861
But don't forget the ordinary humans
around you.

233
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:17,421
Ximen.

234
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:20,341
True love requires responsibility.

235
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:25,221
When it's necessary,
you have to make sacrifices

236
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:26,861
for that person's future.

237
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:31,741
In the 20 years I've known you,

238
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:34,061
this is the first time you've used
the word, "sacrifice."

239
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:37,021
Caina is really incredible.

240
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:38,861
She taught you about sacrifice.

241
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:48,381
I have to go now.

242
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:02,741
Hey, handsome. It's boring to drink alone.

243
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,621
Do you want to have drinks together?

244
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:08,421
Sorry. I can't today. Maybe next time.

245
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:37,981
DAOMING SI

246
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:45,901
<i>I wonder what he's doing now.</i>

247
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:49,021
<i>I want to see him but I can't.</i>

248
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:53,221
<i>It was better when we weren't
officially dating.</i>

249
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:57,501
<i>No.</i>

250
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:01,461
<i>What am I doing?
Why am I thinking about nonsense again?</i>

251
00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:16,421
DAOMING SI

252
00:19:31,341 --> 00:19:33,701
DAOMING SI

253
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:35,901
Hello? Shancai.

254
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:40,901
<i>Hello? Shancai.
Why aren't you saying anything?</i>

255
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,261
<i>-Who is it?
</i>-What's the matter?

256
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:47,381
I'm going there now.

257
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:54,661
<i>The thief didn't succeed tonight.
He might strike again.</i>

258
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:57,061
<i>If there's anything suspicious,
call the police immediately.</i>

259
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:59,981
<i>Of course, we'll tighten
our security around the area too.</i>

260
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:01,621
<i>Please lock your doors.</i>

261
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,621
Call the police.

262
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:43,661
Call the police if anything happens.

263
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:47,101
Where's my phone?

264
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:49,181
My phone.

265
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:55,541
<i>What's happening? Is the thief back?</i>

266
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:58,021
<i>He's so smug.</i>

267
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:01,821
<i>All right.</i>

268
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:04,141
<i>I'll punish him. I'll destroy him.</i>

269
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:32,621
Hey.

270
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:35,381
Why are you so violent?

271
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:36,981
Daoming Si?

272
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,341
Are you thinking clearly now?

273
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:49,141
It's the middle of the night.

274
00:21:49,581 --> 00:21:50,741
Why are you here?

275
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,141
Silly girl. You had me worried.

276
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:23,541
If I catch that thief,
I'd surely cut him in half.

277
00:22:25,981 --> 00:22:27,261
It's a good thing you're here.

278
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:29,901
I feel safe now.

279
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:36,821
I'll find you a nice place.

280
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:38,621
Don't stay in such a dangerous
area anymore.

281
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:40,541
There's no need.

282
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:43,221
Even though it's nothing great,

283
00:22:44,181 --> 00:22:45,621
but it's my house.

284
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:48,621
I want to live here no matter what.

285
00:22:49,421 --> 00:22:50,781
Thank you, Daoming Si.

286
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:54,141
Who lives next to you?

287
00:22:56,301 --> 00:22:58,221
Nobody, it's empty.

288
00:22:58,821 --> 00:22:59,821
Don't worry.

289
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:07,501
Do you want to stay at my house tonight?

290
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,701
There's no need. I'll just stay here.

291
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:12,821
Okay. I'll stay with you then.

292
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:13,781
No.

293
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,581
You can't sleep here. Go home.

294
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,541
Why? It's not like
we haven't done this before.

295
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:19,261
No. Go home.

296
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:22,301
Go home and sleep there.

297
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:23,901
Are you sure?

298
00:23:23,981 --> 00:23:25,341
-Go home.
-I'm worried about you.

299
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:26,261
I'll be fine.

300
00:23:26,341 --> 00:23:27,541
-Don't worry.
-Are you sure?

301
00:23:27,621 --> 00:23:28,741
-I'm sure.
-Lock the door.

302
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:30,941
Okay. All right.

303
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:21,101
What are you planning to do?

304
00:24:21,221 --> 00:24:23,941
If the thief comes again,
wouldn't it be dangerous?

305
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:27,061
What did Daoming Si say?
He must be really worried.

306
00:24:27,461 --> 00:24:28,301
Yes.

307
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:30,181
So?

308
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:36,261
He asked me to go with him
and sleep at his house.

309
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:38,541
But how can I do that?

310
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:41,141
Why not? He's your boyfriend.

311
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,501
That is true,

312
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,381
-but...
-Shancai.

313
00:24:45,461 --> 00:24:48,221
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it with Daoming Si?

314
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:50,181
-Done what?
-Have sex.

315
00:24:55,181 --> 00:24:56,621
Xiaoyou, what are you saying?

316
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:58,101
You haven't?

317
00:24:58,501 --> 00:25:02,901
I thought liking someone means
giving him everything you can, right?

318
00:25:04,181 --> 00:25:05,621
I think it's a natural thing.

319
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:08,101
Xiaoyou.

320
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:12,981
This topic is too much for me.
I can't take it.

321
00:25:13,981 --> 00:25:16,861
Shancai, you're the innocent type.
I'm not.

322
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:19,021
How can you not be that type?

323
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,421
I'm different now.

324
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,061
I'm not the old Jiang Xiaoyou anymore.

325
00:25:23,141 --> 00:25:25,501
Now, I'm full of fighting spirit.

326
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:30,181
Xiaoyou.

327
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:32,461
I'm very scared of your fighting spirit.

328
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:35,221
What did Ximen do to you?

329
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:47,261
Hello?

330
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:48,821
<i>Do you want to come over?</i>

331
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:51,981
Okay.

332
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,181
Shancai, something came up. I have to go.

333
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:05,341
If our boss asks, just tell her I'm off.

334
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:06,781
Why so sudden?

335
00:26:07,781 --> 00:26:10,181
-Okay, go. I'll take care of this.
-Okay.

336
00:26:23,981 --> 00:26:24,861
Shancai.

337
00:26:27,181 --> 00:26:29,461
Do you think this lipstick color suits me?

338
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:37,621
I think this suits you better.

339
00:26:39,301 --> 00:26:41,101
Okay. I'll use the Coral Fauve color then.

340
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:43,861
This lipstick brand
is very popular lately.

341
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:56,541
Do I look strange?

342
00:26:58,221 --> 00:27:00,061
Not really.

343
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:02,181
-But--
-Shancai, let's talk next time.

344
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:03,621
I'll get going. Bye.

345
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:11,101
Shancai.

346
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:14,301
Isn't the weather really nice today?
Even the air smells sweet.

347
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:17,981
I really like it.

348
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:19,981
I'm so happy today.

349
00:27:20,981 --> 00:27:22,221
Hey, Xiaoyou.

350
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:26,861
Don't you want to get changed first?

351
00:27:28,421 --> 00:27:29,261
That's right.

352
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:37,941
<i>Is it because of the lipstick?</i>

353
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:43,341
<i>I think Xiaoyou seems really happy
and pretty today.</i>

354
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:47,981
<i>The air around her
seems to be a light pink hue.</i>

355
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:50,261
<i>It seems like she's floating.</i>

356
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:06,341
Si has a bad temper and can be rash.

357
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:08,301
But he's all right.

358
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:12,181
Shancai is the same.

359
00:28:13,781 --> 00:28:16,981
Maybe Shancai can only date Si.

360
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:20,901
That's right. They really suit each other.

361
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:31,861
We've only been talking
about Si and Shancai.

362
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:33,581
Shouldn't we talk about us?

363
00:28:37,021 --> 00:28:38,621
All right.

364
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:44,581
How's the milk tea shop doing?

365
00:28:48,581 --> 00:28:49,701
Not bad.

366
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,381
Do you have any new drinks lately?

367
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:55,141
Yes, it's called...

368
00:28:56,741 --> 00:28:57,781
It's called...

369
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:01,461
It's fine.

370
00:29:01,701 --> 00:29:03,501
I'll just go and try it some time.

371
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:13,581
Miss, "You're Most Beautiful Tonight."

372
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:18,981
That's the name of this dessert.
This gentleman ordered it for you.

373
00:29:23,781 --> 00:29:24,781
Don't hesitate.

374
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:26,221
Open it.

375
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:38,701
1573.

376
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:44,061
Does it mean "Our feelings are so true"?

377
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:48,341
No.

378
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:50,341
That's my room number.

379
00:30:20,461 --> 00:30:23,421
<i>That's strange.
I thought nobody's staying next door.</i>

380
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:25,861
<i>Did someone move in?</i>

381
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:40,621
<i>He's so clumsy.</i>

382
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:42,741
<i>The key is still in the door.</i>

383
00:30:51,661 --> 00:30:53,981
Hello. Is anybody home?

384
00:30:55,141 --> 00:30:57,141
I'm Dong Shancai from next door.

385
00:30:57,501 --> 00:30:59,781
You left your key in the door.

386
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:08,221
Is anybody home?

387
00:31:20,781 --> 00:31:21,861
I didn't forget it.

388
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:23,821
I left it especially for you.

389
00:31:25,941 --> 00:31:27,141
Why are you here?

390
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:29,421
I rented this place.

391
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:33,381
What?

392
00:31:34,141 --> 00:31:35,501
You're staying next door?

393
00:31:35,581 --> 00:31:37,821
I'm on a secret mission.

394
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,021
-I need an empty house.
-Secret--

395
00:32:09,301 --> 00:32:13,661
I'm protecting a very precious little pig.

396
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:16,541
She might be attacked anytime.

397
00:32:16,621 --> 00:32:18,381
I have to protect her in secret.

398
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:20,861
Who's a pig?

399
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:22,901
I didn't say it was you.
Why are you so mad?

400
00:32:27,621 --> 00:32:29,141
There are so many empty houses.

401
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:30,781
Why are you renting the one next door?

402
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:33,101
The location is good.
It's very convenient.

403
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:38,861
If your family finds out,
then will the mission fail?

404
00:32:38,981 --> 00:32:39,981
Don't worry.

405
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:42,741
The landlady won't speak a word.

406
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:44,181
How come?

407
00:32:44,621 --> 00:32:45,981
Did you stuff her mouth with cloth?

408
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:48,021
You're really a very stupid pig.

409
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:49,821
I have my ways.

410
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:53,381
Money. I'm sure you used money.

411
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:54,981
You're exactly the type.

412
00:32:55,621 --> 00:32:56,781
Or did you threaten her?

413
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:58,661
Can you let me finish first?

414
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:00,021
Listen.

415
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:02,821
Your boyfriend is so handsome.

416
00:33:03,061 --> 00:33:05,821
She fell for my charms, of course.

417
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,541
That's why she rented the house to me.

418
00:33:08,981 --> 00:33:10,701
So? Do you feel proud?

419
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:13,021
This handsome guy
is not just your boyfriend.

420
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:14,621
He's even your neighbor now.

421
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:18,141
Why are you renting such a small house?

422
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:21,941
If I'm a very stupid pig,
you're the stupidest pig ever!

423
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:24,261
Are you crazy?

424
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:25,621
Don't rent the place anymore.

425
00:33:25,981 --> 00:33:29,981
When the stupid pig encounters danger,
I have to be there right away.

426
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,421
Don't you get it?

427
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:35,461
<i>Of course I know
that you're worried about me.</i>

428
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:37,901
<i>That's why you rented the place next door.</i>

429
00:33:38,821 --> 00:33:42,861
<i>But this type of move is too shocking.</i>

430
00:33:45,101 --> 00:33:46,381
Why are you staring at me?

431
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:48,941
Your boyfriend is really handsome, right?

432
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:56,061
You and your landlady
seem to have similar tastes.

433
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:39,381
Would you like a drink?

434
00:35:12,901 --> 00:35:14,021
Do you need a shower first?

435
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:35,421
Relax.

436
00:36:07,421 --> 00:36:09,381
<i>I wonder if Daoming Si
is already sleeping.</i>

437
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:37,221
<i>The ceiling's so low.</i>

438
00:36:37,581 --> 00:36:39,381
<i>There's a damp smell in here.</i>

439
00:36:40,221 --> 00:36:42,181
<i>How can it be comfortable to stay here?</i>

440
00:36:46,181 --> 00:36:48,941
<i>So Shancai grew up
in this kind of environment.</i>

441
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:56,661
<i>So now we're the same.</i>

442
00:36:58,141 --> 00:37:00,341
<i>I'm also breathing the air
Shancai's breathing.</i>

443
00:37:17,141 --> 00:37:20,981
<i>All the challenges we faced
didn't break us apart,</i>

444
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:23,341
<i>but pulled us closer instead.</i>

445
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:27,061
<i>Do people really place more value</i>

446
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:29,981
<i>on a love that was once lost
then found again?</i>

447
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:56,741
<i>Should I go to Shancai's place now?</i>

448
00:38:06,741 --> 00:38:08,861
<i>Never mind. It's already late.</i>

449
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:10,781
<i>She'll get the wrong idea again.</i>

450
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:12,661
<i>She'll think I want to do
something with her.</i>

451
00:38:25,821 --> 00:38:27,661
<i>Actually, I really do.</i>

452
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:50,661
<i>I thought I had to force myself
to enter his world.</i>

453
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:55,661
<i>I never thought he'd be willing
to come into my world.</i>

454
00:38:58,221 --> 00:38:59,421
<i>I'm so touched.</i>

455
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:02,701
<i>I want to go there now and tell him that.</i>

456
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:05,981
<i>But...</i>

457
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:09,021
<i>if I really knocked on his door,</i>

458
00:39:09,621 --> 00:39:13,861
<i>will he think that I'm a very easy girl?</i>

459
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:52,741
Don't force yourself.

460
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:54,901
You're not that type of girl.

461
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:01,661
I'm not interested in a girl
that's shaking all over.

462
00:40:07,461 --> 00:40:08,861
Treasure yourself.

463
00:40:11,941 --> 00:40:13,341
I treasure...

464
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:17,821
I treasure my feelings for you,
that's why I came here with you.

465
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:24,301
As long as it makes you happy,

466
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:27,421
I'm willing to do anything.

467
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:36,261
It's normal to be nervous the first time.

468
00:40:36,741 --> 00:40:38,021
Please don't mind it.

469
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:40,501
I won't be nervous again next time.

470
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:42,381
Ximen.

471
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:46,341
Please give me some time
and have patience.

472
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:51,341
I originally just wanted to scare you.

473
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:54,501
I never thought
you'd be willing to go through it.

474
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,821
You're not the Xiaoyou I know at all.

475
00:40:59,101 --> 00:41:01,781
But why can't people
who like each other be together?

476
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:14,421
Xiaoyou, are you sure you want to do this?

477
00:41:17,781 --> 00:41:19,341
I can go through with it.

478
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:20,981
And then what?

479
00:41:25,141 --> 00:41:30,221
But I'll surely regret it
if I don't follow my heart.

480
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:37,541
There's always regret in love.

481
00:41:39,421 --> 00:41:42,261
So you also had regrets in love?

482
00:41:42,341 --> 00:41:43,701
That's none of your business.

483
00:41:46,261 --> 00:41:48,821
Asking about other people's privacy
is very impolite.

484
00:41:56,101 --> 00:41:57,461
I've already paid for the room.

485
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:00,261
You can stay to watch the view or leave.

486
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:01,701
It's up to you.

487
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:03,661
Ximen.

488
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:41,261
Why can't people
who like each other be together?

489

<i>Why can't people

490
