EPISODE 22

4
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:41,751
Huaze Lei.

5
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,711
I guess it's normal to feel offended

6
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:49,071
when you see someone being touchy-feely.

7
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:53,671
It does feel awkward
to be caught in the situation.

8
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:57,071
Usually, we'll just laugh
and brush it off.

9
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,751
But you care about it

10
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:01,991
because it's Daoming Si, right?

11
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:06,151
Who said I care about it?

12
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:08,111
Besides,

13
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:11,151
it's good that they're doing well.

14
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:16,471
If you can't hold it in, it's fine to cry.

15
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,951
You don't have to force yourself
to be strong.

16
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:27,831
Can I lean on your back for a bit?

17
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,031
Dad, Mom, I'm home.

18
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:34,431
Shancai, you're back.

19
00:03:37,431 --> 00:03:38,431
What's going on?

20
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,151
Dad.

21
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:41,711
Did you make a bad investment again?

22
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:44,751
Or are you two...

23
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:50,071
Your dad's boss ran away
with the company funds.

24
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:52,351
What? And you didn't stop him?

25
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:53,991
It's too late.

26
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:57,831
Right now, only the ones
who weren't involved are left.

27
00:03:58,911 --> 00:04:00,511
Anything else that has any worth

28
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:04,231
has been taken away
by the bigger shareholders.

29
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:06,711
I'm sorry, my dear.

30
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:12,711
What are we going to do now?

31
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:16,271
Your dad and I will need to stay
at the village for a while.

32
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:18,071
Why?

33
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:21,311
We thought we could sustain for a bit

34
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:24,351
by doing deliveries
while your dad looks for another job.

35
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,511
But your aunt at the village called today

36
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:28,871
and said that your uncle is sick.

37
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:32,911
It's hard for her to care for him and make
a living by fishing at the same time.

38
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:35,111
So she asked if we could go and help her.

39
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:36,551
Is he okay?

40
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:38,511
He's not critical right now.

41
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,591
He'll need time to recover,
but it will take a while.

42
00:04:44,191 --> 00:04:45,071
So...

43
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:47,791
Am I going to stay here by myself?

44
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:49,751
No, I'll pack and go with you.

45
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,711
Shancai.

46
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:53,071
You need to stay here alone.

47
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:56,111
Why do you think your dad and I
are working so hard?

48
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,311
We want you to do well at Mingde.

49
00:04:58,391 --> 00:04:59,991
You can't let this get in your way.

50
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:05,191
What about Dong's Private Kitchen?

51
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:06,871
Are we going to give up?

52
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,271
More reason for you to hang in there.

53
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:12,031
I need your help
so I can create new dishes.

54
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:14,751
Did you forget?

55
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,671
This is our dream.

56
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:19,951
Shancai, don't be scared.

57
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:22,071
I'm here.

58
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:26,711
When are you coming back for me?

59
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:28,791
I don't want us to be separated.

60
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:35,951
We don't want to leave you behind either.

61
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:38,551
Once your uncle is well again,

62
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:41,671
when we've saved some money,

63
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:43,391
we'll come back here.

64
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:45,511
That's right.

65
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:47,631
While we're away,

66
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:50,111
you need to be strong, okay?

67
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:51,151
Okay.

68
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:55,511
For now,
you'll need to look after yourself.

69
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:58,111
Mom.

70
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,551
All right. We'll call you often.

71
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:03,751
We'll keep in touch through WeChat, okay?

72
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:04,831
Okay.

73
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,631
Xiaozi.

74
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:28,951
You've had the long face
since you came back from the hotel.

75
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:31,231
Your dad is worried about you.

76
00:06:34,031 --> 00:06:36,231
You refused to tell us
what happened at the hotel.

77
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,551
The manager there said
the glass was shattered.

78
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:41,391
The room was in a mess.

79
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,071
Did you fight with Daoming Si?

80
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:48,911
Do you want me to call him?

81
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,311
Go ahead and call him
if you want to embarrass me.

82
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:57,871
I heard from his mother.

83
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,871
You've been going out a lot
with a girl named Shancai.

84
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:05,271
Isn't that girl very cunning and tricky?

85
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:07,791
Did she cause trouble at the hotel?

86
00:07:07,871 --> 00:07:09,551
Stop talking about it already.

87
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:12,471
-I'm just worried that she's using you.
-Mom.

88
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:15,391
Shancai is a good friend of mine.

89
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:17,351
I won't let anyone talk bad about her.

90
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:18,711
Even if you talked bad about her,

91
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:20,831
I wouldn't forgive you either.

92
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:43,311
Okay.

93
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:44,831
All good.

94
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:46,711
Now, I can sleep.

95
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:51,751
<i>Today is the first day of living alone.</i>

96
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:55,271
<i>I wonder if Mom and Dad
have arrived at the village.</i>

97
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:11,311
What on earth?

98
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:13,471
Who is it?

99
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:17,591
Shancai.

100
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:22,551
The voice sounds familiar.

101
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:25,511
Could it be...

102
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:35,351
Xiaozi?

103
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:37,311
Hi.

104
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:45,671
Your neighborhood is so dark.

105
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:47,231
I tripped a few times coming here.

106
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:48,831
The street light is broken.

107
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:51,791
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

108
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:54,151
I came here today because I wanted to...

109
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:55,431
-I want to say--
-Sorry.

110
00:08:57,351 --> 00:08:58,471
I don't want to hear it.

111
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:02,831
Xiaozi.

112
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:05,951
My parents went back to the village.

113
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,871
From today onward,

114
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:11,751
I will be living here alone.

115
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:17,391
I was wondering why I didn't see them.

116
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:22,271
I'm going to be very busy from now on.

117
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,351
I don't have time
to think about other things.

118
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:29,911
Next time you want to talk to me
about something,

119
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,351
I might not be able to give you any time.

120
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:37,871
Shancai.

121
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:40,391
Do you hate me?

122
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,591
I...

123
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:44,191
Don't get me wrong.

124
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:47,151
Actually,

125
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:49,911
it's fine if you hate me.

126
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:51,391
Because...

127
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:54,471
Because I lied to you.

128
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:57,751
That day, Si and I

129
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,431
didn't do anything.

130
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,711
He told me...

131
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:07,871
that he can't be with me.

132
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:10,991
What...

133
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:13,111
That's impossible.

134
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:19,831
At first, I was really confident.

135
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:23,751
I thought if I stood before him,
he wouldn't be able to say no.

136
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:26,551
I didn't think

137
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:29,271
he would be so adamant.

138
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,311
He's heartless, isn't he?

139
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:37,511
I already told my mom

140
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:39,111
that I'm not going to see him again.

141
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:40,791
Why?

142
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:45,431
I thought you two were doing
well together.

143
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:48,071
I get it now.

144
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:53,471
I shouldn't force someone
to be with a person they don't love.

145
00:10:56,711 --> 00:10:59,031
But because I like Si,

146
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:00,551
I got to know you.

147
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:02,231
I'm glad.

148
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:06,431
Shancai.

149
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:10,351
Will you still be my friend?

150
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:14,831
Of course.

151
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:33,111
Listen.

152
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,191
I want you and Si to be happy together.

153
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:36,831
Don't mind me.

154
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,591
Stop lying to yourself about how you feel.

155
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:47,111
I came today to tell you this.

156
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:49,231
I'll go now.

157
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:52,631
Wait.

158
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:56,311
Xiaozi.

159
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,391
Are you angry?

160
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:07,271
Do you know why I dumped Daoming Si?

161
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:09,351
Why?

162
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:13,551
Because he said...

163
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,991
"My thoughts are filled with Shancai."

164
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,951
Tell the consul

165
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,511
that I'll be at the party.

166
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:42,471
Don't worry about it.

167
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:44,191
-Sure.
-Mom.

168
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,311
I need to go now. See you.

169
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:50,351
What is it?

170
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:52,111
Xiaozi and I are a no-go.

171
00:12:54,831 --> 00:12:55,991
What are you talking about?

172
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:57,631
I already made myself clear.

173
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:01,111
I don't like her and I'll never marry her.

174
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:07,351
Go to the He family right now
and apologize to Xiaozi.

175
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:10,631
If you do that,
I'll agree to look past this matter.

176
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,991
I did nothing wrong.
Why should I apologize?

177
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:14,871
I told you.

178
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:16,991
The one I like is Shancai.

179
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:20,231
I will not marry anyone other than her.

180
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,551
I told you very clearly too.

181
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:26,831
Dong Shancai will not set foot
inside our house.

182
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,951
Not even in her next life.

183
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:30,031
What's the point of a business marriage?

184
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:33,031
If Xiaozi and I end up being miserable,

185
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:34,991
is that fair to her?

186
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:38,231
You're still young.
You have no idea what life is about.

187
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,431
Or I should say
you know nothing about love.

188
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:41,391
Yes.

189
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:43,871
I know nothing.

190
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:46,831
But who gave you the right
to control my life?

191
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:50,031
I gave birth to you.
So you should listen to me!

192
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:58,511
I will obey everything else.

193
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:01,711
But on this, I will not.

194
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:05,071
I rather not be your son.

195
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,191
I wish I was not Daoming Si!

196
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:09,551
Stop right there!

197
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:21,631
Cheers!

198
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,071
You're staying alone.

199
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,031
You should change to a safer lock.

200
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:31,391
Thanks.

201
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:33,351
How's the safety here?

202
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:34,911
Is it safe to live alone?

203
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:36,511
It should be okay.

204
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:38,431
The street light looks broken.

205
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:41,271
The landlord has reported it.

206
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:42,311
It'll be fixed soon.

207
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,471
Where is Si?

208
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,991
He should be here.

209
00:14:47,431 --> 00:14:49,151
-He's the only one missing.
-No.

210
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:54,231
Why?

211
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:58,231
Why what?

212
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:00,071
My house is too small.

213
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:01,471
There's no space.

214
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:04,271
The floor is already shaking
with the three of you.

215
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:06,951
Having one more person here
will probably cause an earthquake.

216
00:15:07,391 --> 00:15:08,631
There are too many people.

217
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:11,671
Anyway,

218
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:13,631
I wonder what Si is up to.

219
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,911
He's been missing.

220
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,791
Si and Xiaozi are progressing well, right?

221
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,351
Hey, Shancai, how are they doing?

222
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:25,791
You should ask Daoming Si, not me.

223
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:31,671
It's probably Si.

224
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,351
Open the door.

225
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:37,791
Hurry up.

226
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,711
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello, ma'am.

227
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:06,271
Mrs. Daoming.

228
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:08,311
Why are you...

229
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:10,871
Shancai.

230
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:15,871
I thought we wouldn't see
each other again.

231
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:20,071
But there's something I want to ask you.

232
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:22,791
What exactly did you do

233
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:25,991
to split Xiaozi and Si apart?

234
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:28,471
How much longer

235
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:31,191
are you going to get in Si's way?

236
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:33,951
You can't just accuse me.

237
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:35,551
I didn't do anything.

238
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:37,991
Simply accuse?

239
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:41,111
I know you won't admit it.

240
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:43,111
What I don't understand is

241
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:44,471
why such a nice girl

242
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:46,951
would do something so despicable.

243
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:48,471
Ma'am.

244
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,431
Aren't you acting below your dignity here?

245
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:51,791
Sorry.

246
00:16:53,351 --> 00:16:54,911
Are you talking to me?

247
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,991
Are you criticizing me?

248
00:16:57,671 --> 00:16:58,631
Ma'am.

249
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:03,031
I think it's probably a misunderstanding
between Si and Xiaozi.

250
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:05,751
I know very well whether or not
it's a misunderstanding.

251
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:07,071
You can shut up.

252
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:12,711
Shancai.

253
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:15,311
Let me make something clear.

254
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:18,511
You and Si belong to different worlds.

255
00:17:18,991 --> 00:17:20,311
Your family background,

256
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:23,111
lifestyle and way of thinking
are completely different.

257
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:24,911
Imagine this.

258
00:17:25,471 --> 00:17:27,271
If he takes you to a business forum,

259
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:30,351
will you feel inferior
because you can't participate

260
00:17:30,431 --> 00:17:31,751
in the technical discussions?

261
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,631
If he takes you to a royal banquet,

262
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:37,191
are you going to be embarrassed

263
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:40,151
because you don't know
proper table manners?

264
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:42,991
Even if you marry into our household,

265
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:45,551
you won't get used
to this sort of lifestyle.

266
00:17:47,311 --> 00:17:49,391
I never wished for that kind of lifestyle.

267
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:51,631
I know where I stand.

268
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:54,071
I know I'm not suited

269
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:56,071
for those supposed high-society etiquette.

270
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:58,591
Then why are you sticking to Si?

271
00:17:59,231 --> 00:18:01,151
Obviously, you're a gold-digger.

272
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,551
I'm not the one sticking to your son.

273
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:05,591
And I have no interest in your money.

274
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:10,591
Hypocrites are the worst kind of people.

275
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:13,951
How much do you want?

276
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:16,151
No need to beat around the bush.

277
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:19,791
By the way, I heard your parents

278
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:21,431
went back to the village.

279
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:22,871
If you had known,

280
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:25,551
you should've accepted the money.
That would've solved the problem.

281
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:35,471
You brought these boys to your house
so they could defend you?

282
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:37,351
This must be one of your tactics too.

283
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:44,751
Don't think you could bully me
just because I'm young, you old hag!

284
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,031
What did you say? Say that again.

285
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:52,911
Old hag!

286
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:54,831
Yes, I'm calling you that.

287
00:18:55,671 --> 00:18:58,591
If you worry about your precious son,
you should put a collar on him

288
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,631
and latch it onto your waist
so you can bring him anywhere you go.

289
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:03,311
Are you done?

290
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,511
Uneducated as expected,

291
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:09,951
talking to me like that.

292
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:13,191
I don't need you to decide
whether or not I'm educated.

293
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:17,471
Maybe for you,
I am just a weed in the garden.

294
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:19,511
But I never betrayed my conscience.

295
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:21,311
I've never done anything

296
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:23,111
that would stop me
from holding my head high.

297
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:27,031
Honestly, right now, I feel bad for you.

298
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:30,471
You are the worst person
I've ever met in this world.

299
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,551
In your eyes,

300
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:34,751
there are only you and your son.

301
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:37,551
You don't treat anyone else as humans.

302
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:41,831
You're not welcome in my world.

303
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:43,471
Get out.

304
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:53,991
I said leave!

305
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:28,271
Shancai, you're incredible.

306
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:31,111
Did you guys see
the expression on her face?

307
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:34,031
She looked like
she's about to burst a vein.

308
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:37,151
Shancai, you always call yourself a weed.

309
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:39,831
The explosive power of the weed
is awe-inspiring.

310
00:20:39,911 --> 00:20:40,951
That's right.

311
00:20:41,191 --> 00:20:42,831
Because I couldn't take it anymore.

312
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:45,791
So Si and Xiaozi broke up?

313
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:49,991
I had a feeling they won't last very long.

314
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:52,111
But it ended really quickly.

315
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:54,511
Shancai.

316
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:55,871
What are you doing to do now?

317
00:20:55,951 --> 00:20:57,871
Si's mom will not just let this go.

318
00:20:58,511 --> 00:20:59,551
Lei is right.

319
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:01,591
You need to prepare yourself.

320
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:02,991
You can't keep running away.

321
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:04,471
I'm not running away.

322
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:15,671
I won't admit defeat.

323
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:19,391
The more she tries to bully me,
the stronger I must be.

324
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:22,911
I will unleash the spirit of the weed
and fight until the end.

325
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,311
How are you doing to do that?

326
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:27,631
She's the superwoman
of Asia's best hotel chain.

327
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:29,231
Not to forget,

328
00:21:29,311 --> 00:21:31,151
the empress of Daoming Group.

329
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:32,831
So what?

330
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:34,671
She's still human.

331
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:36,751
You're too naive.

332
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:38,471
She's powerful enough

333
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,151
that she could squash you
like squashing an ant.

334
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:42,631
Squash?

335
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:43,791
With a blink of an eye,

336
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:45,911
you'd turn into dust.

337
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:48,311
Stop beating me down.

338
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:52,111
One moment you're supporting me,
the next you're scaring me.

339
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:53,871
We're not trying to scare you.

340
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:57,191
We're just outlining the situation
so we can find a solution.

341
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:02,671
Well...

342
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:04,991
How about this?

343
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,631
I'll think of a way to become
a woman she's happy with.

344
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:14,551
What kind of reaction is that?

345
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:17,951
What do you think about going out with Si?

346
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,111
I have no intention of doing that.

347
00:22:20,391 --> 00:22:21,471
Good idea.

348
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:24,831
First, date Si and then tell his mom,

349
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:28,671
"I, Dong Shancai, am serious
in my relationship with Daoming Si.

350
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:30,751
Don't even think
about ruining our happiness."

351
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:32,991
Good idea.

352
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,311
What?

353
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,391
Next, you can give birth to a baby.
That's how you win.

354
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:44,431
Don't you think Si's mom
will throw their kid off a bridge?

355
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,831
You guys are talking nonsense.

356
00:22:48,111 --> 00:22:51,631
I never thought about
wanting to be with Daoming Si.

357
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:02,431
Hey.

358
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:07,751
Did I say something

359
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:09,871
really bad?

360
00:23:14,031 --> 00:23:15,111
You said,

361
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:18,111
"I might be a weed.

362
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:20,111
But I won't let anyone belittle me.

363
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:22,871
You're not welcome in my world.

364
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:25,391
Get out. I said, leave."

365
00:23:25,591 --> 00:23:26,831
You said that.

366
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,271
Do you think I can take it back?

367
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:33,191
Can I pretend that I didn't say it?

368
00:23:33,671 --> 00:23:36,471
Spoken words are like spilled water.

369
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:37,551
There's no turning back.

370
00:23:39,831 --> 00:23:41,271
As long as Si likes you,

371
00:23:41,391 --> 00:23:43,391
confrontations like these are inevitable

372
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,071
even if you didn't say that earlier.

373
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:48,031
No matter what,

374
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:49,711
we will support you.

375
00:23:50,311 --> 00:23:51,511
Yes, do your best.

376
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:53,391
Yes, we will support you.

377
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,151
All the best.

378
00:24:10,111 --> 00:24:12,111
<i>Fighting with Daoming Si's mom?</i>

379
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:14,711
<i>What did I get myself into?</i>

380
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:18,471
<i>What a witch Daoming Si's mom is.</i>

381
00:24:19,031 --> 00:24:21,351
<i>He had to grow up in such harsh reality.</i>

382
00:24:22,151 --> 00:24:24,911
<i>His world must be full of obstacles.</i>

383
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:27,311
<i>So why...</i>

384
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:31,231
<i>Why do I still want to be involved
with Daoming Si</i>

385
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,991
<i>and worsen the situation?</i>

386
00:25:16,271 --> 00:25:17,671
<i>Such a familiar sight.</i>

387
00:25:18,671 --> 00:25:22,231
<i>When school first started,
Huaze Lei was here playing violin.</i>

388
00:25:22,991 --> 00:25:24,551
<i>I really looked up to him.</i>

389
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:26,551
<i>And now,</i>

390
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:28,831
<i>he's become a great friend in my heart.</i>

391
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,231
<i>I don't know why,</i>

392
00:25:31,671 --> 00:25:32,991
<i>but when he's playing the violin,</i>

393
00:25:33,271 --> 00:25:34,671
<i>it feels like nothing in this world</i>

394
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:36,711
<i>can't be solved.</i>

395
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:40,071
<i>There is no discord and no struggles.</i>

396
00:25:58,831 --> 00:25:59,791
I'm back.

397
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:14,351
<i>Shancai, how was your day today?</i>

398
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,351
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

399
00:27:17,391 --> 00:27:20,231
<i>In order to help your uncle,
Dad has been learning to fish.</i>

400
00:27:20,751 --> 00:27:22,551
<i>Unfortunately, your dad gets seasick.</i>

401
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:25,191
<i>The first time he went out to sea today,
he vomited non-stop.</i>

402
00:27:25,431 --> 00:27:28,391
<i>He wasn't much help at all
and had to be looked after.</i>

403
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:32,791
<i>So we didn't earn much
because of today's low catch.</i>

404
00:27:34,031 --> 00:27:35,431
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

405
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:37,831
<i>I can't give you extra allowance.</i>

406
00:27:38,271 --> 00:27:39,191
<i>Shancai,</i>

407
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:41,551
<i>you need to be more frugal
with your part-time earnings.</i>

408
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:45,031
<i>Things aren't going well</i>,
<i>but we are working hard.</i>

409
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:48,151
<i>Shancai, take good care of yourself.</i>

410
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:51,351
<i>We're not with you
so you must stay strong.</i>

411
00:27:52,391 --> 00:27:55,191
<i>My dear daughter, we miss you a lot.</i>

412
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:05,191
I heard you.

413
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:07,591
Take care of yourselves too.

414
00:28:08,151 --> 00:28:10,711
I miss you and Dad too.

415
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:13,111
Don't worry about me.

416
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:14,591
Things will get better.

417
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:43,951
Who is it?

418
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:46,071
It's me, the landlord.

419
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:53,271
Thanks.

420
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:03,071
Mr. Wang, is something wrong?

421
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:07,031
Ms. Dong.

422
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:08,711
Sorry to say this.

423
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:10,951
I have to stop renting out this place.

424
00:30:12,151 --> 00:30:13,111
Why?

425
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,991
Did something happen?

426
00:30:15,591 --> 00:30:16,831
It's an emergency.

427
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:18,751
My daughter's mother-in-law

428
00:30:18,831 --> 00:30:21,151
needs money for her operation.

429
00:30:21,711 --> 00:30:24,111
I already have someone who is
interested in buying this house.

430
00:30:24,711 --> 00:30:28,071
How about I return the rental fees
you previously paid?

431
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:29,951
On top of that,

432
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:33,711
I will give you an extra 500 yuan
as compensation. Is that okay?

433
00:30:34,671 --> 00:30:36,111
But I'm...

434
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:37,271
I...

435
00:30:38,431 --> 00:30:39,511
I know.

436
00:30:40,231 --> 00:30:41,631
It's unfair to you.

437
00:30:42,111 --> 00:30:43,391
But it's hard for me too.

438
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:45,791
I need this money urgently.

439
00:30:46,231 --> 00:30:48,751
I have to pay the hospital bills.

440
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,711
I hope you can help us.

441
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:53,351
Maybe you can stay with your friends?

442
00:30:54,031 --> 00:30:54,951
Please.

443
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:02,511
Thank you.

444
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:30,031
Mom.

445
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:32,311
Does the house...

446
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:44,271
Mom.

447
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:46,351
I wanted to ask

448
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:49,191
if the house at the village is okay?

449
00:31:50,751 --> 00:31:52,471
I really miss you and Dad.

450
00:31:54,231 --> 00:31:55,951
I've got a bit of a problem here.

451
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:59,831
But I'll settle it soon.

452
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,471
NEW UPDATE FROM DONG SHANCAI

453
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:23,631
CHASED OUT FROM THE HOUSE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

454
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:25,871
WHAT AN EXPERIENCE!

455
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:33,871
Did she really say that?

456
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:37,191
Did she really say she'll challenge my mom
because of me?

457
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:40,151
Too bad you weren't there.
It was jaw-dropping.

458
00:32:40,231 --> 00:32:42,711
We wanted to tell you sooner,
but you've been missing.

459
00:32:44,351 --> 00:32:45,911
Right, I need to see her.

460
00:32:45,991 --> 00:32:47,391
I want to hear it from her.

461
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:48,431
Wait.

462
00:32:49,391 --> 00:32:51,231
A tough girl like Shancai
will never admit it.

463
00:32:51,311 --> 00:32:53,511
So what? I'm going to see her now.

464
00:32:53,591 --> 00:32:54,671
Hang tight.

465
00:32:55,231 --> 00:32:56,111
We should talk.

466
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:58,271
About what? We can talk later.

467
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,271
Don't stop me.

468
00:32:59,831 --> 00:33:01,951
Si, have you thought about
how to deal with your mom?

469
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:04,071
No. I'm not going to deal with her.

470
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:05,991
You know how my mom is.

471
00:33:06,271 --> 00:33:07,111
Why ask?

472
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:08,871
So it's game over for Shancai.

473
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:10,671
Your mom can have her head any time.

474
00:33:12,271 --> 00:33:13,831
I won't let that happen.

475
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:15,911
Where did you get your confidence?

476
00:33:15,991 --> 00:33:18,391
Have you ever gone against her
at anything since childhood?

477
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:20,071
Yeah, talk is cheap.

478
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:21,351
We can forget the past.

479
00:33:22,271 --> 00:33:24,151
But it concerns Shancai now.

480
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:25,111
All right.

481
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:27,151
She's my woman. I'll handle it.

482
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:29,191
Are you done questioning? I'm going then.

483
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,951
Si, I hope you're prepared.

484
00:33:36,911 --> 00:33:39,151
If your mom is serious, Shancai is dead.

485
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:43,471
She's in such a predicament
because of you.

486
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:44,751
Lei means

487
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:47,151
you should have a plan
before going to see Shancai.

488
00:33:47,351 --> 00:33:50,511
Si, do you understand the situation?
Don't you need a plan?

489
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:51,871
A plan for what?

490
00:33:52,511 --> 00:33:53,471
That stupid Shancai.

491
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:55,951
She never tells me any of her problems.

492
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:59,551
She's all alone now, without help
and getting bullied by my mom.

493
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,151
I won't let her go through this alone.

494
00:34:02,591 --> 00:34:03,991
I'm going to her right now.

495
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:05,511
Hey.

496
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:10,711
He's acting like
he's the only gentleman here.

497
00:34:11,671 --> 00:34:12,551
I can understand.

498
00:34:12,671 --> 00:34:13,711
If I were a girl,

499
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:15,551
I'd be touched by his action.

500
00:34:16,391 --> 00:34:18,551
He'd be perfect if he wasn't so stubborn.

501
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:35,391
<i>Shancai, what happened? Are you okay?</i>

502
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:40,391
<i>Shancai, want to come to my place?
I'll wait for you.</i>

503
00:34:43,351 --> 00:34:45,551
<i>Shancai, where are you? I'll come get you.</i>

504
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:56,351
Just yesterday I challenged the old hag,

505
00:34:57,271 --> 00:34:58,511
saying I'll fight her.

506
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:02,871
But now,
I don't even have a place to stay.

507
00:35:06,631 --> 00:35:07,871
What should I do?

508
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:16,151
How will I survive?

509
00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:34,551
Why can't you just stay by my side?

510
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:39,991
I'm very happy.

511
00:35:41,231 --> 00:35:44,511
Because you said no matter what,
you won't let my mom come in between us.

512
00:35:45,431 --> 00:35:47,911
From now on,
I will do my best to protect you.

513
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:49,831
Wait a minute.

514
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:51,431
First, let me go.

515
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:52,751
-You're holding me--
-No.

516
00:35:53,511 --> 00:35:54,671
You're finally in my arms.

517
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:55,751
I'll never let go.

518
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:01,271
Who knows where you'll run to?

519
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,831
Who said I'm running?

520
00:36:06,711 --> 00:36:07,871
What is all this, then?

521
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:11,351
I packed up because I got chased out.

522
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:13,871
Why didn't you tell me?

523
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:15,951
I was about to tell you.

524
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:22,951
Can you not leave me?

525
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:37,511
Daoming Si.

526
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,311
I can't stay here.

527
00:36:40,391 --> 00:36:41,271
Why not?

528
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:42,751
I'm telling you to stay here.

529
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:44,671
I can go to Qinghe's house

530
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:45,671
or Xiaoyou's.

531
00:36:46,151 --> 00:36:47,271
I don't want to stay here.

532
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:50,071
Stop it.

533
00:36:52,151 --> 00:36:54,111
Qinghe? Xiaoyou?

534
00:36:54,831 --> 00:36:56,071
They're not your boyfriend.

535
00:36:59,031 --> 00:36:59,991
Daoming Si.

536
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,031
Can't you think about me for once?

537
00:37:03,111 --> 00:37:04,071
Think about what?

538
00:37:04,311 --> 00:37:06,631
-I have plenty of rooms here.
-That's not the point!

539
00:37:12,111 --> 00:37:13,071
The point is,

540
00:37:14,111 --> 00:37:15,831
I just confronted your mom.

541
00:37:17,031 --> 00:37:18,151
I can't stay here.

542
00:37:19,991 --> 00:37:21,991
-It's ridiculous.
-Perfect timing.

543
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:26,071
You wanted to challenge her, right?

544
00:37:26,831 --> 00:37:28,231
This is our chance

545
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:29,871
to tell her properly.

546
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:32,271
I am back with Shancai!

547
00:37:32,631 --> 00:37:34,071
-Come and get me!
-Hey.

548
00:37:38,031 --> 00:37:39,231
What a ruckus.

549
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:40,871
Where are your manners?

550
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:42,511
There are rules

551
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:45,391
in this household, no?

552
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:46,831
Ms. Yu.

553
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:48,991
You're still alive?

554
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:53,431
Mr. Daoming Si.

555
00:37:54,111 --> 00:37:55,911
Still a joker as always.

556
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:58,111
Like you said,

557
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:01,951
I'm still alive and kicking.

558
00:38:02,511 --> 00:38:03,471
Stop it, Ms. Yu.

559
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:04,831
No need to be so formal.

560
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:06,351
Just call me Si.

561
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:10,031
Saying my full name with honorifics

562
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:11,711
is a little over-the-top.

563
00:38:13,151 --> 00:38:15,471
I'll skip the honorifics then.

564
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:17,791
Si.

565
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:19,831
It's been a while.

566
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:22,071
You are still

567
00:38:23,071 --> 00:38:24,671
such a troublemaker.

568
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:27,271
<i>What's going on?</i>

569
00:38:27,351 --> 00:38:29,151
<i>Who is this grandma?</i>

570
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:31,631
Your mother is away in London.

571
00:38:32,391 --> 00:38:33,391
Before she left,

572
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,951
she asked me to come back
and hold the fort.

573
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:37,391
Without her here,

574
00:38:37,471 --> 00:38:38,871
someone needs to run the household.

575
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:39,871
So,

576
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:43,631
everything is in my scope.

577
00:38:44,311 --> 00:38:45,151
Okay.

578
00:38:45,631 --> 00:38:46,831
I'll tell you right now.

579
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:49,111
This is my friend, Shancai.

580
00:38:49,671 --> 00:38:50,671
From today onward,

581
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,191
she will be living here.

582
00:38:58,431 --> 00:38:59,831
So you're Shancai?

583
00:39:02,391 --> 00:39:03,231
Hello.

584
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:05,391
I'm Dong Shancai.

585
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:08,111
<i>This grandma looks ancient,</i>

586
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:10,511
<i>but she's got a strong aura.</i>

587
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:13,471
Since Si

588
00:39:14,391 --> 00:39:15,711
is adamant about staying with you,

589
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:19,111
I won't make things hard for you.

590
00:39:19,831 --> 00:39:20,831
Good decision.

591
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:27,351
I'll get Shancai to help
with the chores in the house.

592
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:29,711
Ms. Yu!

593
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:33,271
Ms. Yu, have you got dementia?

594
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:35,431
Shancai isn't here to work.

595
00:39:37,911 --> 00:39:38,791
I remember.

596
00:39:39,471 --> 00:39:42,751
Even your dad didn't dare
talk to me like that.

597
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:47,631
Young people nowadays

598
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,711
seem to take things for granted.

599
00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:53,751
They really believe

600
00:39:54,631 --> 00:39:57,031
-that there are free lunches.
-You old piece of...

601
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:00,591
She's...

602
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:03,191
We're friends.

603
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:07,111
What's wrong
with her staying here for free?

604
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:09,151
I know.

605
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:11,271
Society has changed.

606
00:40:12,031 --> 00:40:14,631
Young people always want it easy.

607
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:16,391
But I am

608
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:18,991
an old, traditional person.

609
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:23,111
I believe having
the right attitude is important.

610
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:28,351
Why can't Ms. Shancai work in exchange

611
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:30,671
for room and board?

612
00:40:30,951 --> 00:40:32,151
Of course I can.

613
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:35,511
Ma'am, you shouldn't look down on others.

614
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:37,271
I wouldn't want to stay here

615
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:38,991
for free anyway.

616
00:40:39,711 --> 00:40:42,431
Do you know how to clean?

617
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,271
Are you a hard worker?

618
00:40:45,871 --> 00:40:46,791
Of course.

619
00:40:47,431 --> 00:40:49,311
I helped my mom with chores
since I was young.

620
00:40:49,671 --> 00:40:51,431
-I know how to cook too.
-That's enough!

621
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:55,591
I don't agree.

622
00:40:56,151 --> 00:40:58,471
I didn't ask you to stay
to become a servant.

623
00:40:59,111 --> 00:40:59,951
I'm the man.

624
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:01,071
I should look after you.

625
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:04,591
I think your grandma makes a lot of sense.

626
00:41:05,151 --> 00:41:06,471
I have no money

627
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:08,071
and nowhere to go.

628
00:41:08,871 --> 00:41:10,831
So I need a proper reason to stay.

629
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,631
-That way, I can protect my pride.
-No.

630
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:16,351
There's no way I can let you

631
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:17,711
be a cleaner here.

632
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,391
-But--
-Enough with that.

633
00:41:19,471 --> 00:41:20,311
I will never agree.

634
00:41:23,271 --> 00:41:24,511
Fine. I'll go then.

635
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:26,871
What era are we living in?

636
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,871
There's nothing wrong
with friends staying over.

637
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:30,711
Ximen and Meizuo come here all the time.

638
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:33,631
This isn't about right or wrong.

639
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:35,591
It's about willingness.

640
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:38,471
I don't want her to belittle me.

641
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:42,271
Shancai.

642
00:41:44,231 --> 00:41:45,951
Are you sure you want to be a worker here?

643
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,791
-Yes.
-You...

644
00:41:52,031 --> 00:41:53,071
You piss me off.

645
00:42:06,031 --> 00:42:08,791
Don't expect me to be lenient with you

646
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:11,231
just because you're Si's friend.

647
00:42:12,551 --> 00:42:15,631
You'd better be prepared.

648
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:17,991
You hear me?

649
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:19,551
Yes.

650
00:42:20,951 --> 00:42:21,831
I can't hear you.

651
00:42:23,431 --> 00:42:24,271
Yes.

652
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:27,951
Are you a mosquito?

653
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:31,111
Yes!

654
00:42:31,871 --> 00:42:32,751
Good.
