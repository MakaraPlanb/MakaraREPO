00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:30,166
EPISODE 2

4
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:58,726
<i>I beat the Green Crocodile Pineapple Head.</i>

5
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:05,126
That narcissist.

6
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:06,766
As if he scares me.

7
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:32,766
That girl called Dong Shancai
is quite something.

8
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:34,966
Si deserved a beating.

9
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:38,766
Dong Shancai just carried out
the will of the gods.

10
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:42,006
Today is worth celebrating.

11
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:43,246
I'll record it.

12
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:49,886
This is Meizuo reporting from Egypt

13
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:52,606
on an amazing discovery of a mummy.

14
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:57,366
There's a bump on his head
from a girl's flying kick.

15
00:02:57,446 --> 00:02:59,766
What we have here must be
the unluckiest man

16
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,166
in the 21st century.

17
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:04,246
Lei, do you want a picture with the mummy?

18
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:15,726
This is the report
of Daoming Si's first knock-out.

19
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:22,286
How embarrassing.

20
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:25,406
If I were Si, I'd stop going to Mingde.

21
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:27,286
If I were Si,

22
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:28,726
I'd disappear from Earth.

23
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,726
What time is it?

24
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:52,886
What the hell?

25
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:55,006
You fainted.

26
00:03:55,246 --> 00:03:56,646
We brought you back here.

27
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,486
I remember.

28
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:02,086
That crazy girl actually kicked me!

29
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:04,286
I'm going to knock her head off.

30
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:05,806
Si.

31
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:08,246
Did you know that Shancai
was harassed by two guys

32
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:10,726
on her way back
after delivering your order?

33
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,766
What? You saw her?

34
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:16,046
Is she okay?

35
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,206
That's why she was angry and kicked you.

36
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:20,966
You deserved it.

37
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:23,046
What does that have to do with me?

38
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:28,246
Besides, those two guys
must be stupid to pick on her.

39
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,806
Fine. Since you're awake,

40
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:34,566
we don't have to stay here.

41
00:04:35,086 --> 00:04:35,926
Let's go.

42
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:38,806
Hey.

43
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:40,446
Hey!

44
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,206
Hey, at least untie me!

45
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:50,926
FOOD NUTRITION CLASSIFICATION STAGE 1,
LI ZHEN

46
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:52,646
Hey.

47
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:55,806
Wow, your notes are incredible.

48
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:57,086
I want to be in your group.

49
00:04:57,406 --> 00:05:00,286
Zhen and I did a lot to make this.

50
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:04,806
Hey, Xinhui.

51
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:06,966
Here's the data Zhen and I prepared.

52
00:05:07,246 --> 00:05:09,446
Give me your email addresses
and I'll send them to you.

53
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:10,846
Hey, Shancai.

54
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:14,846
You know very well that Xinhui likes Si
and yet you still flirt with him.

55
00:05:18,406 --> 00:05:20,766
No, I didn't.
Xinhui, I'm not interested in him at all.

56
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:22,806
Hey, Shancai.

57
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:25,926
You're the most famous new kid
in Mingde University right now.

58
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:28,766
First, you attacked the VIP, Mr. Bobbit

59
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:31,766
and then you went and kicked
the most popular senior, Si.

60
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:36,366
You could've done something else
to stand out, right?

61
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:37,886
That's not Shancai's fault though.

62
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:40,246
Who told Si to step on Shancai's phone?

63
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:43,646
Actually, it's my fault.

64
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:45,966
I pissed Si off.

65
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,686
It might seem like I'm the bad guy here,

66
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,006
but Si basically ruined my life.

67
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:53,566
He even sent me a Joker card,
challenging me to Poker.

68
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,806
Should I just let him walk all over me?

69
00:05:55,886 --> 00:05:56,766
What?

70
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,046
You actually got a Joker card?

71
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:00,766
Why did he give it to you?

72
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:02,286
Do you even play Poker?

73
00:06:03,486 --> 00:06:06,046
What are you betting against F4?

74
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:07,366
When?

75
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:08,686
Where?

76
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:11,206
I don't know. I don't know anything.

77
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:13,206
But I'm not giving in.

78
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:14,966
If the situation becomes worse,
I won't go.

79
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:17,326
Hey, if you don't want the Joker,
can I have it?

80
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:18,486
Do whatever you like.

81
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:20,206
I can't stand that guy, Si.

82
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:21,686
Shancai.

83
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:24,766
Why don't you go after
the guy you like then?

84
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:27,806
But as a new student in school,

85
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:30,286
besides getting along with other students,

86
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:32,406
you should also respect
the school's seniors.

87
00:08:12,886 --> 00:08:13,726
Sorry.

88
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:15,446
I interrupted you.

89
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:16,886
What is it?

90
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,766
I came to return your handkerchief.

91
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:22,766
Keep it.

92
00:08:23,126 --> 00:08:26,206
I don't usually take back
what I've given away.

93
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:31,086
Also,

94
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:33,806
I received the Joker card from F4.

95
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:36,166
Yeah, all the best.

96
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:40,166
Hey.

97
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:44,166
Thank you

98
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:46,086
for what happened.

99
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:48,326
If you hadn't shown up,

100
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:50,726
I would've been in big trouble.

101
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:52,526
Don't misunderstand.

102
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:54,526
I only freaked out
because I couldn't stand it.

103
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,246
So

104
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,566
can I look for you

105
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,366
at the rooftop again?

106
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:03,566
Then I won't go there again.

107
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:22,446
Hello.

108
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:23,406
Ms. Dong.

109
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:25,806
Mr. Daoming wants you to get in the car.

110
00:09:27,406 --> 00:09:28,606
Why should I?

111
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:30,206
He wants to see you.

112
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:32,966
He'd like to pay for your phone
and apologize for what happened.

113
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:37,926
You must be kidding.

114
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:41,446
Ms. Dong, please.

115
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:46,806
<i>Help!</i>

116
00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:48,406
What are you doing?

117
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:50,126
Who are you guys?

118
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:52,526
Hey!

119
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,806
Help me! That tickles!

120
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:59,006
Save me!

121
00:10:01,486 --> 00:10:03,566
She has a round face.
An airy bang doesn't suit her.

122
00:10:04,246 --> 00:10:07,006
She's got baby fat.
A center part will make her face look big.

123
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,406
Stop disagreeing with me.

124
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:10,886
It's impossible to make
your face shape nicer, okay?

125
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:12,246
What are you guys talking about?

126
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:13,246
-Shut up.
-Quiet!

127
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:14,566
Let's get on it.

128
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:17,686
First, I'll cover up the blemishes
on her radiant skin using CC cream.

129
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,486
This is more fashionable.

130
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:23,206
-Fix her bangs.
-Cover the blemishes.

131
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:24,126
Like that.

132
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:25,206
Is she done?

133
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:27,166
Yes.

134
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:37,326
She looks much better now.

135
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:46,246
Ms. Dong.

136
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:47,886
Please follow me.

137
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:18,366
Please wait here.

138
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:19,926
Si will be here soon.

139
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:22,606
What does he want?

140
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:25,166
Don't worry, Ms. Dong.

141
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:27,046
Si is a very nice guy.

142
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:28,806
He won't do you any harm.

143
00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:31,766
Hey.

144
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:01,766
Could this be F4 when they were younger?

145
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:08,086
So Lei has always been cute.

146
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:15,286
You're finally here.

147
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:16,686
Where's my phone?

148
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:18,086
I want to go home.

149
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:22,766
Hey.

150
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:31,606
Do you like Lei?

151
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:36,966
Listen.

152
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:40,606
You can't like Lei.

153
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:43,606
Why do you care?

154
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:46,526
What is this place?

155
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:48,526
My house.

156
00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:50,846
Why did you bring me here?

157
00:12:52,326 --> 00:12:54,646
And why did you dress me up like this?

158
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:56,046
Well?

159
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:58,886
Isn't it nice to be pampered like this?

160
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:00,446
You know what?

161
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:04,126
If you listen to me,
I'll let you be my girlfriend.

162
00:13:06,606 --> 00:13:10,486
No matter where I go, you can be with me
within a one-meter radius.

163
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:12,926
When I eat, you can sit with me.

164
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:14,406
Even better,

165
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,446
you can find me anytime you want

166
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:18,006
and be with me immediately.

167
00:13:18,806 --> 00:13:21,366
I can take you to and from school
once a week.

168
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:24,486
I can give you good snacks at school.

169
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:27,006
I can help you with homework
if you need it.

170
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:29,686
We can go to the best restaurant
in Shanghai on your birthday.

171
00:13:30,246 --> 00:13:31,086
When we play games,

172
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,446
I'll let you beat me.

173
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,486
We'll take a trip overseas once a year.

174
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:36,926
Of course,

175
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,686
I can get you a new phone
to replace the broken one.

176
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:43,886
You must feel really happy now.

177
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,646
Happy?

178
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:52,006
You must be kidding me!

179
00:13:54,926 --> 00:13:55,766
Where are my clothes?

180
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:57,926
-I want to get changed.
-Hey, you...

181
00:13:58,446 --> 00:13:59,646
What are you doing?

182
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:00,966
Daoming Si.

183
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:03,806
I'm not sure if you're crazy
or if you're dumb.

184
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,926
I don't know
why you said all of that to me.

185
00:14:06,486 --> 00:14:08,486
I don't need your charity
or some special treatment.

186
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:10,686
I also don't need your money
or a new phone.

187
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,086
I want to go home!

188
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,006
Hey, listen to me.

189
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,686
You'd better not come back crying.

190
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:17,126
There's nothing in this world
that I can't have.

191
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:18,926
Who do you think you are?

192
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:20,966
I don't give a damn.

193
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:22,046
Well?

194
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,566
You can't have me even
if you give me everything in the world.

195
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:26,166
Listen.

196
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:29,606
I, Dong Shancai, simply won't
date a narcissist like you.

197
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:32,486
What you just said is as stupid
as your pineapple head.

198
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:34,166
Goodbye!

199
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:01,846
He brought me to his house to show off?

200
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,606
What an unbelievable guy.

201
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:10,806
<i>But then,</i>

202
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:13,886
<i>if I could exchange
with anything in the world,</i>

203
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,446
<i>what would I wish for?</i>

204
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,166
<i>I think I know.</i>

205
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:36,286
Shancai, you seem
a little different today.

206
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:37,966
Really?

207
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,566
Is there something on my face?

208
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:41,726
Your pores are invisible.

209
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:44,366
And your brows are trimmed.
Did you go to the beauty salon?

210
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:45,966
Of course not.

211
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:13,246
Hey, I think Si was looking
at you just now.

212
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:14,206
Whatever.

213
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:19,606
Did you guys know
that Shancai is infatuated with me?

214
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:23,486
You mean the girl that
knocked you out with a kick?

215
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,926
Hey, stop laughing. You don't believe me?

216
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,166
I believe you.

217
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:29,926
I knew nobody could say no to my charm.

218
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:32,526
That girl says one thing,
but means another.

219
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,806
Even I can't say no to Si's angelic charm.

220
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,366
I have an idea.

221
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:43,406
We'll hide in the girls' bathroom

222
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:45,206
wearing a wig and pretending to be ghosts.

223
00:16:45,286 --> 00:16:47,086
We'll jump out at Shancai.

224
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,966
I bet she'd be scared.

225
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:51,486
Come on, man.

226
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,886
You're asking us to sneak
inside a girls' bathroom.

227
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:55,286
Have you lost your mind?

228
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:57,846
Then what should we do
inside a girls' bathroom?

229
00:16:58,326 --> 00:17:00,286
First, four guys sneaking into
the girls' bathroom

230
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:02,726
is already embarrassing.

231
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:04,646
Also, you're asking us
to pretend to be ghosts.

232
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:06,766
We might just end up
looking like perverted ghosts.

233
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:10,086
Don't worry. We just need to stay alert.

234
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:11,486
No way.

235
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:12,646
Leave me out of it.

236
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:15,926
Si just doesn't really understand women.

237
00:17:18,446 --> 00:17:19,406
Lei.

238
00:17:19,486 --> 00:17:21,366
I won't be a ghost. Forget it.

239
00:17:23,606 --> 00:17:27,046
Si, it's not that hard to hit on a girl.

240
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:29,166
Who said I'm going to hit on her?

241
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:30,726
I just want

242
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:32,726
to pull a prank on her.

243
00:17:33,326 --> 00:17:34,166
Are you sure?

244
00:17:34,526 --> 00:17:36,406
-I won't help you, then.
-It's okay.

245
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:39,206
Yan isn't a good friend.
I'll help you get her.

246
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:40,126
That's great!

247
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,206
I said I don't like her.

248
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:50,806
Sure, you don't like her. Neither do we.

249
00:17:58,886 --> 00:17:59,726
Hey.

250
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,366
What about getting some fake cockroaches

251
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,726
and planting them in her bag tomorrow?

252
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:07,926
Imagine her opening the bag and...

253
00:18:10,926 --> 00:18:12,446
That's something a child would do.

254
00:18:13,846 --> 00:18:14,686
What?

255
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:15,646
Too lame?

256
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:22,846
We could buy some onions
and paint them red.

257
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:24,806
Make them look like they're apples.

258
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:25,926
Hey, Meizuo.

259
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,966
Give them to her tomorrow.

260
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:30,126
She'll be eating it
with tears in her eyes.

261
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:31,966
I can just imagine it.

262
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:33,366
Hey, Si.

263
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,166
We're too busy to be pulling pranks.

264
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:39,006
What are you busy with?

265
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,046
He forgot.

266
00:18:43,126 --> 00:18:45,886
We need to see the professor
to discuss our graduation project.

267
00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:48,406
Oh, we can go tomorrow.

268
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:51,286
By the way, Lei,

269
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:54,006
you're majoring in music.
Why are you coming with us?

270
00:18:55,646 --> 00:18:58,886
I'm just taking a free ride.
It's more environmentally friendly.

271
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:07,806
Who can tell me
the nutritional content of a banana?

272
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,526
-No idea.
-Yeah.

273
00:19:11,606 --> 00:19:12,566
I know, sir!

274
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,966
A banana contains calcium,
sodium, magnesium, manganese,

275
00:19:17,046 --> 00:19:18,886
zinc, potassium, iodine,
selenium, iron, copper.

276
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:20,806
Vitamins A, C, E, B1, B2.

277
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:22,286
Protein and dietary fiber.

278
00:19:27,806 --> 00:19:28,646
Excellent.

279
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:31,646
How did you memorize all that?

280
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:33,806
I come from a family of banana farmers.

281
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:35,446
One year, we had an enormous harvest

282
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:38,326
so we opened a food processing plant
to make banana cakes.

283
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:42,446
The same year, our sales hit the roof.
Then we opened ten more factories.

284
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:47,766
So does your family often step
on banana peels and fall?

285
00:19:48,326 --> 00:19:51,326
You're wrong about banana peels.
People don't fall from banana peels.

286
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:56,846
A fresh banana peel has friction

287
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,886
and won't cause people to trip.

288
00:19:59,726 --> 00:20:00,926
Really?

289
00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:03,846
How about a demonstration?

290
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:04,926
Watch.

291
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:08,526
Be careful.

292
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:17,006
But if the banana peel is not fresh,

293
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:18,126
you'll easily fall.

294
00:20:18,206 --> 00:20:20,286
-Do it again then.
-Yes, one more time.

295
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:21,686
-Do it again.
-Again.

296
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:24,566
This new batch of Nutrition students
has got some interesting people.

297
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:26,086
They all have amazing legs.

298
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:29,086
They can step on banana peel
and kick Si too.

299
00:20:29,206 --> 00:20:30,166
Shut up.

300
00:20:31,526 --> 00:20:33,006
We should go for a visit someday.

301
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:35,446
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

302
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,206
You received a Joker card
just after you started school.

303
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:40,926
A flying kick,
an attempt at reconciliation

304
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:43,246
and a request to be his girlfriend.

305
00:20:44,086 --> 00:20:45,606
What a gripping story.

306
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:47,206
Full of ups and downs.

307
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:52,726
So is that Daoming Si guy
interested in you?

308
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:54,206
Don't be ridiculous.

309
00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:56,486
He just wants to make my life miserable.

310
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:57,766
I'll never let him win.

311
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:00,646
Shancai, don't worry. F4 or whatever,

312
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,606
whoever bullies my friend is a bad guy.

313
00:21:03,686 --> 00:21:05,486
I'll stand up for you if I see them.

314
00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:07,606
Thanks a lot.

315
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,126
But after listening to your stories,

316
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:13,366
it seems like Si
is the ultimate troublemaker.

317
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:14,926
Are his friends annoying too?

318
00:21:20,286 --> 00:21:21,806
You could say

319
00:21:22,526 --> 00:21:24,246
that one of them is different.

320
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,526
How so?

321
00:21:27,046 --> 00:21:28,566
I can't really explain it.

322
00:21:29,846 --> 00:21:33,006
Maybe he's a little less annoying.

323
00:21:42,446 --> 00:21:43,526
A handsome guy.

324
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,246
Welcome.

325
00:21:53,246 --> 00:21:55,046
So you work here on weekends,
Ms. Flying Kick?

326
00:21:55,326 --> 00:21:56,166
How hardworking.

327
00:21:57,206 --> 00:21:59,726
Just order what you want
and don't disrupt our work.

328
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:04,486
Hi, Ms. Milk Tea.

329
00:22:04,566 --> 00:22:06,286
Hi, how are you?

330
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:09,686
I want two drinks.

331
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:11,606
Shancai.

332
00:22:12,086 --> 00:22:12,926
Shancai?

333
00:22:14,006 --> 00:22:15,006
Shancai.

334
00:22:15,086 --> 00:22:16,166
Two drinks.

335
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,526
Yes, two drinks.

336
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:21,686
Our best-sellers are White Jasmine
and Red Royal Peach.

337
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,486
Which one would you like?

338
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:25,006
I'll take both.

339
00:22:25,766 --> 00:22:26,726
Okay.

340
00:22:32,246 --> 00:22:33,966
I don't remember you liking milk tea.

341
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:36,246
I don't really like it.

342
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:39,366
But these drinks have interesting names.

343
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,446
PLEASE PAY

344
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:54,566
Shancai, who are they?

345
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:56,926
They're two of the guys in F4.

346
00:22:57,006 --> 00:22:58,686
Really?

347
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:08,566
They're ready.

348
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:09,926
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

349
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:14,206
Thanks.

350
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:21,846
We're going. Bye.

351
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:24,326
Bye, Ms. Milk Tea.

352
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:25,246
Bye.

353
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,166
What?

354
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,046
Who are they?

355
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,406
He's called Huaze Lei.

356
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:43,166
The other one?

357
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:45,406
The other one isn't important.

358
00:23:46,606 --> 00:23:48,846
So he's the one that's different?

359
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,046
Did he come here just to see you?

360
00:23:55,446 --> 00:23:57,766
-Why are you blushing?
-What?

361
00:23:58,006 --> 00:23:59,366
Where?

362
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:00,686
I'm not blushing.

363
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:03,006
Okay.

364
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:04,486
You're not.

365
00:24:43,126 --> 00:24:44,486
This is Asia.

366
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:48,206
This area looks like...

367
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:51,086
Is it Shanghai?

368
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,846
EAST LONGITUDE 2.21 NORTH LATITUDE 48.52

369
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,726
So this place is...

370
00:24:57,566 --> 00:24:59,726
North latitude of 48.52 degree.

371
00:25:00,046 --> 00:25:02,606
East longitude of 2.21 degree.

372
00:25:04,006 --> 00:25:04,926
Where is that?

373
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,366
It's Paris.

374
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:14,806
Do you know the time difference
between Shanghai and Paris?

375
00:25:16,886 --> 00:25:17,886
I'll check.

376
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:20,286
Seven hours.

377
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:24,246
Shanghai is seven hours ahead of Paris.

378
00:25:25,886 --> 00:25:27,286
I wish time could fly by faster.

379
00:25:29,966 --> 00:25:33,126
I have a classmate named Time.
I'll tell her to come here now.

380
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:40,126
Was that not funny?

381
00:25:42,446 --> 00:25:43,846
You really are a weird girl.

382
00:25:48,886 --> 00:25:51,326
Look. This red bag goes well
with the leather jacket.

383
00:25:51,406 --> 00:25:52,246
Yes.

384
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:54,406
I heard it's the most
trendy design this year.

385
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:55,326
Really?

386
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,286
-Bye.
-Bye.

387
00:26:07,126 --> 00:26:09,006
Wow, Shancai.

388
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:11,806
You got together with Lei quickly enough.

389
00:26:12,286 --> 00:26:14,766
I was just talking to Lei on the rooftop.

390
00:26:14,846 --> 00:26:15,806
Yeah, right.

391
00:26:16,086 --> 00:26:19,406
Anyone could tell from your smile
that you're in love.

392
00:26:19,806 --> 00:26:21,926
You like Lei, don't you?

393
00:26:23,406 --> 00:26:25,926
We're all classmates. I'll do you a favor.

394
00:26:26,006 --> 00:26:29,446
Lei already has someone he likes
since a long time ago.

395
00:26:30,286 --> 00:26:31,126
Look.

396
00:26:31,886 --> 00:26:34,886
This is the goddess of Mingde,
the senior Teng Tangjing.

397
00:26:35,366 --> 00:26:36,206
Well?

398
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:37,686
Aren't they a match made in heaven?

399
00:26:38,446 --> 00:26:39,686
You probably don't know.

400
00:26:40,206 --> 00:26:44,766
Jing will finish her studies
in France and come back here soon.

401
00:27:25,766 --> 00:27:26,606
Shancai.

402
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,326
You're so cute today.

403
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:32,566
Hey.

404
00:28:36,086 --> 00:28:36,966
Hey, Si.

405
00:28:37,246 --> 00:28:38,286
It's you.

406
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,086
What happened to your pineapple head?

407
00:28:42,926 --> 00:28:43,766
What's wrong?

408
00:28:44,646 --> 00:28:46,126
Is it that big of a deal

409
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:47,966
just because I changed my hairstyle?

410
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:50,446
Let me tell you.

411
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:52,486
I wanted to try a new hairstyle.

412
00:28:52,806 --> 00:28:54,166
I didn't change it because of you.

413
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,446
Oh.

414
00:28:58,806 --> 00:28:59,806
It suits you.

415
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:04,926
With an incredible face like this,

416
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:07,526
regardless of my hairstyle,
I still look dashing, don't I?

417
00:29:09,286 --> 00:29:12,366
"Dashing" is used to describe a gentleman.

418
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:13,646
And you're not.

419
00:29:14,246 --> 00:29:15,166
How am I not?

420
00:29:16,286 --> 00:29:17,806
Nothing about you is dashing at all.

421
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:19,886
Are you making fun of me?
Say that one more time.

422
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,926
I will.

423
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:23,646
Good morning, Shancai.

424
00:29:23,726 --> 00:29:25,286
What are you laughing about?

425
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:27,606
I'm laughing

426
00:29:27,846 --> 00:29:30,006
at someone's who is so full of himself.

427
00:29:30,086 --> 00:29:32,166
What are you talking about?
I really am a dashing guy.

428
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:33,286
Si.

429
00:29:35,086 --> 00:29:36,486
-Jing is back.
-What?

430
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,486
Jing is back.

431
00:29:42,326 --> 00:29:43,406
Who is Jing?

432
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:35,286
Welcome back.

433
00:31:00,406 --> 00:31:02,526
Lei, I'm back.

434
00:31:16,766 --> 00:31:17,726
I've missed you.

435
00:31:29,326 --> 00:31:30,806
That senior, Jing, is so pretty.

436
00:31:32,526 --> 00:31:34,406
<i>Is she the girl Lei likes?</i>

437
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:38,206
<i>She's clearly
in a totally different league.</i>

438
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,806
I still think it's funny.

439
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:51,286
This place hasn't changed. But you guys...

440
00:31:51,846 --> 00:31:52,926
After three years,

441
00:31:53,006 --> 00:31:55,966
you're no longer high school students,
but university students now.

442
00:31:56,686 --> 00:31:58,806
Luckily, you guys haven't changed.

443
00:31:59,446 --> 00:32:00,286
I'm glad.

444
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:02,726
Hey, the five of us grew up together.

445
00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:04,486
You can say we're childhood friends.

446
00:32:07,686 --> 00:32:09,006
Si hasn't changed.

447
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,246
You're still the jokester.

448
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:12,446
You're wrong. I'm more amazing now.z

449
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:15,606
I'm doing my own investment.
I'm paying for my own tuition fees.

450
00:32:17,046 --> 00:32:18,406
That is pretty amazing.

451
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:20,406
Your sister must be proud.

452
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,566
I haven't seen her in a while. How is she?

453
00:32:24,126 --> 00:32:27,246
She got married last year.
She's moved to England with her husband.

454
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:29,526
I know you're really close
with your sister.

455
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:31,126
Without her here,

456
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:32,966
you must feel very lonely.

457
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:35,606
Jing, don't worry about that.

458
00:32:35,686 --> 00:32:38,086
There's a girl who's got
all his attention now.

459
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:40,246
Her name is...

460
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:41,206
Dong...

461
00:32:41,286 --> 00:32:42,406
-Something...
-Dong...

462
00:32:42,526 --> 00:32:43,806
You two.

463
00:32:43,886 --> 00:32:45,446
You can't compare her to my sister.

464
00:32:45,526 --> 00:32:47,366
My sister is out of her league.

465
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:51,766
Lei, why are you so quiet?

466
00:32:52,246 --> 00:32:53,086
Yeah.

467
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,326
You're even more quiet with Jing around.

468
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,726
I know. He's always been this way.

469
00:32:57,806 --> 00:33:00,446
He becomes really quiet
whenever he's happy.

470
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:02,366
He doesn't say a word,

471
00:33:02,726 --> 00:33:04,366
but his heart beats really fast.

472
00:33:05,966 --> 00:33:07,806
Lei will never change.

473
00:33:08,006 --> 00:33:09,406
Jing, we've grown up.

474
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:10,686
So has Si.

475
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:12,086
Yes.

476
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,246
Unlike Lei,
who's always such an introvert.

477
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,166
Look at him.

478
00:33:15,246 --> 00:33:17,046
He's still the same Lei from the past.

479
00:33:17,126 --> 00:33:18,206
He's still very amusing.

480
00:33:18,486 --> 00:33:19,326
Come on.

481
00:33:19,646 --> 00:33:21,366
Let's have a toast
to the never-changing Lei.

482
00:33:21,526 --> 00:33:23,006
Cheers!

483
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,286
I'm not!

484
00:33:29,606 --> 00:33:30,446
Lei.

485
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:31,766
What's the matter?

486
00:33:34,566 --> 00:33:35,406
Jing.

487
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,366
Why did you take those vulgar photos?

488
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:38,886
That's not like you at all.

489
00:33:41,806 --> 00:33:43,726
Is Lei acting like he's jealous?

490
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:48,326
I think those photos came out pretty well.

491
00:33:49,086 --> 00:33:50,766
Don't you like them, Lei?

492
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:53,366
I don't like them at all.

493
00:33:53,806 --> 00:33:55,286
You're not like those vulgar girls.

494
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:58,606
I knew you cared about me the most.

495
00:33:59,086 --> 00:34:00,446
That's why I like you the most.

496
00:34:00,926 --> 00:34:03,246
Wow!

497
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:06,086
-Give me a kiss too.
-Me too!

498
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:07,206
-Come on.
-One here.

499
00:34:07,286 --> 00:34:08,406
Give us a kiss too.

500
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:09,606
Come on.

501
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:14,686
Jing.

502
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,966
<i>Dong Shancai, wake up!</i>

503
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:32,486
<i>That guy will never belong to you.</i>

504
00:34:34,486 --> 00:34:37,726
<i>Starting tomorrow,
I have nothing to do with F4.</i>

505
00:34:37,926 --> 00:34:41,526
<i>I will study hard
and be my cheerful self as usual.</i>

506
00:34:51,286 --> 00:34:52,126
I'll buy you lunch.

507
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:53,206
My treat.

508
00:34:53,326 --> 00:34:54,246
My mom made me lunch.

509
00:34:54,566 --> 00:34:55,406
-Really?
-Yes.

510
00:34:55,486 --> 00:34:56,326
Awesome.

511
00:34:56,686 --> 00:34:59,686
I think we were meant to meet again.

512
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,286
We meet again in this school.
We'll study together.

513
00:35:07,046 --> 00:35:09,566
-Si, I need to talk to you.
-Step aside.

514
00:35:11,046 --> 00:35:13,886
Dong Shancai,
I want to talk to you. Come here.

515
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:15,726
What's so important?

516
00:35:15,806 --> 00:35:17,966
It's important that I see you.

517
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:20,326
Why do you want to see me?

518
00:35:20,446 --> 00:35:22,286
Do you want to tell me
some weird stuff again?

519
00:35:22,526 --> 00:35:23,366
No, thanks.

520
00:35:23,446 --> 00:35:24,966
You're free anyway.

521
00:35:25,086 --> 00:35:26,126
Just come with me.

522
00:35:26,206 --> 00:35:27,966
Who said I'm free?

523
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,086
I have a lot of things to do right now.

524
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:31,606
Like what?

525
00:35:32,326 --> 00:35:35,566
I am going to eat the lunch my mom made me

526
00:35:35,646 --> 00:35:37,526
with my best friend, Qinghe.

527
00:35:37,606 --> 00:35:40,286
I don't know about you,
but this is my kind of fun.

528
00:35:40,726 --> 00:35:42,126
Rich guys like you won't understand.

529
00:35:46,046 --> 00:35:48,046
I totally enjoy spending time
with Shancai.

530
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:49,446
Let's go.

531
00:35:51,806 --> 00:35:53,846
-WHAT DO YOU WANT?
-I'M NOT TELLING YOU.

532
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:56,126
Mrs. Chen, you're incredible.

533
00:35:56,206 --> 00:35:57,606
Who's Mrs. Chen?

534
00:35:57,806 --> 00:35:58,886
You are.

535
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:00,206
Isn't this you?

536
00:36:06,286 --> 00:36:08,966
Do you remember the time
the beehive fell from the tree?

537
00:36:09,206 --> 00:36:11,286
Everyone ran off,
but you dragged me there.

538
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:13,046
Of course, I remember.

539
00:36:13,126 --> 00:36:13,966
Back then,

540
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,566
-your face swelled up this big!
-You're terrible.

541
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:17,766
You're awful!

542
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:23,006
Listen up, girls.

543
00:36:23,086 --> 00:36:25,326
A ripe banana peel
will still make people fall.

544
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:36,206
I still can't pass this damn level.

545
00:36:37,806 --> 00:36:39,606
Qinghe, are you okay?

546
00:36:47,726 --> 00:36:48,686
Shancai, look.

547
00:36:48,846 --> 00:36:49,966
I got a Joker card too.

548
00:36:50,846 --> 00:36:52,686
I bet F4 members think
I've got the potential

549
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:54,526
so they want to be friends with me.

550
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:58,486
It'd be rude if I don't accept it.
Right, Shancai?

551
00:36:58,566 --> 00:36:59,646
To hell with them.

552
00:37:00,806 --> 00:37:02,766
They're bothering my best friend now?

553
00:37:03,006 --> 00:37:04,486
Shancai, where are you going?

554
00:37:12,846 --> 00:37:13,766
Daoming Si!

555
00:37:23,926 --> 00:37:24,806
What is this?

556
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:27,166
Tell me if you've got a problem with me.

557
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,806
Why are you bothering my friend?

558
00:37:29,486 --> 00:37:30,486
What do you really want?

559
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:32,206
Why?

560
00:37:32,286 --> 00:37:35,366
Are you pissed off
because of that farmer dude?

561
00:37:35,446 --> 00:37:36,646
"Farmer dude"?

562
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:38,966
He's my best friend.

563
00:37:39,366 --> 00:37:40,566
I won't let you bother him.

564
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:41,886
Are you serious?

565
00:37:43,326 --> 00:37:44,486
What's wrong with your taste?

566
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,326
What's so great
about a lame friend like him?

567
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,966
He's a million times better
than an annoying guy like you.

568
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:55,846
Being with him makes me feel 1,000 times,
10,000 times better!

569
00:37:55,926 --> 00:37:57,086
Fine.

570
00:37:57,726 --> 00:38:01,926
I wish you two 1,000
and 10,000 times happiness.

571
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:08,326
Si, thanks for your Joker card.

572
00:38:08,406 --> 00:38:10,846
My mom made me soy milk. You can have it.

573
00:38:17,606 --> 00:38:19,006
<i>Go back and do your research.</i>

574
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:19,966
<i>Remember.</i>

575
00:38:23,406 --> 00:38:24,366
"Non-fat milk."

576
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:26,006
QQ MESSAGE FROM DAOMING SI

577
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:26,926
Look.

578
00:38:27,926 --> 00:38:28,766
"Chen Qinghe.

579
00:38:28,846 --> 00:38:30,206
Your Poker game with F4

580
00:38:30,286 --> 00:38:32,446
is arranged for next Monday at 6:00 p.m.

581
00:38:32,526 --> 00:38:34,846
Please prepare yourself and be on time."

582
00:38:37,006 --> 00:38:38,566
Stop! Ignore him.

583
00:38:38,646 --> 00:38:39,806
Hey, Daoming Si.

584
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:41,566
You'd better stay away from us, jerk!

585
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,246
Done.

586
00:38:46,446 --> 00:38:47,286
Read this.

587
00:38:48,966 --> 00:38:50,166
Don't be scared, man.

588
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,286
It's an honor to receive the Joker card.
Just be careful not to lose too badly.

589
00:38:54,446 --> 00:38:55,646
Thanks for your concern.

590
00:39:00,286 --> 00:39:01,406
Shancai, read this.

591
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:07,846
"Freshmen Chen Qinghe and Dong Shancai
received the Joker,

592
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:09,446
but too afraid to accept the challenge.

593
00:39:09,566 --> 00:39:10,606
They're nothing, but...

594
00:39:11,446 --> 00:39:12,366
cowards"?

595
00:40:11,126 --> 00:40:12,046
Are you blind?

596
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:13,446
Watch where you're going.

597
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:16,966
-So sorry.
-I'll let you go this time.

598
00:40:17,646 --> 00:40:18,526
You'd better watch it.

599
00:40:20,406 --> 00:40:21,406
Shancai.

600
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:26,926
Being with Qinghe

601
00:40:27,006 --> 00:40:29,606
makes you 100, 1,000,
10,000 times happier, right?

602
00:40:30,086 --> 00:40:31,406
So you must be really happy now.

603
00:40:32,886 --> 00:40:33,966
Daoming Si.

604
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,566
Why are you picking on us?
Do you really enjoy doing that?

605
00:40:38,366 --> 00:40:39,206
I do.

606
00:40:39,886 --> 00:40:42,886
It makes me so happy
to see you fall on your face.

607
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:50,046
Shancai.

608
00:40:51,406 --> 00:40:53,486
You look like you love to eat
all kinds of vegetables.

609
00:40:55,646 --> 00:40:57,886
-No wonder you're called "Shancai."
-Let go!

610
00:40:58,526 --> 00:40:59,526
What's wrong?

611
00:41:01,246 --> 00:41:02,206
Go ahead and hit me.

612
00:41:04,246 --> 00:41:06,166
Si, you're crossing the line.

613
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:10,446
Have you had enough?

614
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:42,966
Lei, do you know what you're doing?

615
00:41:43,526 --> 00:41:45,326
Si, enough is enough.

616
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,726
Don't tell me you like this crazy girl.

617
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,046
Stop it.

618
00:41:59,006 --> 00:42:01,046
If you're my friend, let go.

619
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:07,966
You...

620
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,606
Let go!

621
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:12,846
-No.
-Let me go! You're hurting me!

622
00:42:25,726 --> 00:42:28,886
If you leave with her now,
don't talk to me ever again.
