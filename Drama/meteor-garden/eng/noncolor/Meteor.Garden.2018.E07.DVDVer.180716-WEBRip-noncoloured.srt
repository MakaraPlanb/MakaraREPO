EPISODE 7

4
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,343
Where is he?

5
00:01:38,863 --> 00:01:39,983
What? Are you looking for me?

6
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:41,183
In your dreams.

7
00:01:41,383 --> 00:01:43,503
Hey, who are you looking for then?

8
00:01:43,943 --> 00:01:44,783
Go and sit.

9
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:45,983
I'm...

10
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:47,623
You look pretty nice today.

11
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:49,543
Sit down.

12
00:01:53,183 --> 00:01:54,103
What do you want?

13
00:01:54,183 --> 00:01:55,223
I ordered too much. Eat.

14
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:56,743
I'm not hungry.

15
00:01:58,343 --> 00:02:00,423
I don't care. You can only go
after you finish eating.

16
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:02,703
You're too skinny.
I'm going to make you fatter.

17
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,983
Why do you want to do that? I'm not a pig.

18
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:07,223
Are you sure you're not?

19
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:08,583
You're the pig.

20
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,983
I wish someone would make me
fat like a pig.

21
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:16,503
That's right. I've known you forever,
but never saw you so considerate.

22
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:18,343
Shut up, you two.

23
00:02:19,103 --> 00:02:20,063
Eat up.

24
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,303
All right. I'll just eat the ribs.

25
00:02:23,663 --> 00:02:25,743
How much was the jacket?
I'll pay you back.

26
00:02:26,223 --> 00:02:27,463
What are you talking about?

27
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:30,183
I was never taught to ask the girl to pay.

28
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:40,103
Shancai still doesn't admit
that Daoming Si is his boyfriend?

29
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,423
She says one thing, but does another.

30
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:44,463
Do you believe her?

31
00:02:49,743 --> 00:02:51,983
Who knows what's on her mind?

32
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:55,543
What? You're not hungry? Look at you.

33
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:57,783
Slow down.

34
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:05,303
-Hello?
-<i>Where are you?</i>

35
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:07,423
<i>I'm near the cafeteria. I'll come up.</i>

36
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:08,623
No!

37
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,303
Don't come here. I'll go to you.

38
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:22,303
Was that a guy or a girl?

39
00:03:22,383 --> 00:03:23,343
None of your business.

40
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:25,663
I'm warning you.

41
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:29,303
You're dead meat
if you do anything with another guy.

42
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:34,343
I'm full. I have to go.

43
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:36,143
Hey, where are you going?

44
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:46,303
Hey, Shancai.

45
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:47,823
Shancai, I'm--

46
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:49,303
-Come with me.
-Where to?

47
00:03:52,823 --> 00:03:53,663
Hey.

48
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:56,343
Isn't that Thomas from last night?

49
00:03:56,943 --> 00:03:58,263
He came to school.

50
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:01,183
A minute ago,
she was eating with Daoming Si.

51
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:03,823
Now, she's going on a date with Thomas.

52
00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:06,783
That Shancai sure is something.

53
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:15,783
Hey, why did you come to our school?

54
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:19,463
You called me,
but didn't finish what you were saying.

55
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:21,023
I was worried something had happened.

56
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:24,463
Did you do something bad to me?

57
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:27,143
-Of course I did.
-What?

58
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:31,183
You puked everywhere.

59
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:32,903
You were filthy.

60
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:36,063
I cleaned you up
and let you rest on the bed.

61
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:37,663
And?

62
00:04:39,223 --> 00:04:42,463
And then, I left the hotel.

63
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:44,823
Really?

64
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:46,423
Really.

65
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,543
All right. That's good then.

66
00:04:51,863 --> 00:04:53,103
-I need to go.
-Hey.

67
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:54,223
Wait, Shancai.

68
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:57,623
You put your head on my shoulder
that day and said

69
00:04:58,223 --> 00:04:59,263
that you like me.

70
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:00,983
Is it true?

71
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:08,463
Sorry. I got confused.

72
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:10,703
I like you too.

73
00:05:11,943 --> 00:05:14,423
Why don't you go out with me?

74
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:18,103
I mistook you for someone else that day.

75
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:19,223
What are you two doing?

76
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:23,383
Daoming Si.

77
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:31,663
Who is this guy?

78
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:39,183
I'm warning you.

79
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:42,583
You're dead meat
if you do anything with another guy.

80
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:45,783
He's...

81
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:50,183
He's just asking for directions.

82
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:55,943
Directions?

83
00:05:56,463 --> 00:05:58,223
Why did he grab your shoulders?

84
00:05:58,863 --> 00:05:59,703
I'll ask him.

85
00:06:10,023 --> 00:06:10,863
Hello.

86
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:12,783
I was asking her for directions.

87
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,543
Listen carefully.

88
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:17,023
She's my woman. Don't touch her.

89
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,223
So this pretty girl
already has a boyfriend.

90
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:28,063
That's too bad.

91
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:30,023
What's too bad?

92
00:06:32,943 --> 00:06:34,263
I'm warning you.

93
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,703
Stay away from her.

94
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:39,623
I'm going.

95
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,663
Hey.

96
00:06:49,303 --> 00:06:50,143
Daoming Si.

97
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:52,303
What language were you two using?

98
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:53,503
French.

99
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,303
You actually know French?

100
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:56,383
What's so surprising?

101
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,543
As the heir of the Daoming Group,
it's normal to know many languages.

102
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:00,943
Really?

103
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:02,143
Then...

104
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:03,783
What were you two talking about?

105
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:07,063
I told him you're my girlfriend
and asked him to get lost.

106
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,183
What? Why are you making up stories?

107
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,103
He's obviously taking advantage of you
and pretending to be lost.

108
00:07:12,343 --> 00:07:13,943
You're so naive. How silly!

109
00:07:14,023 --> 00:07:15,103
You're the silly one.

110
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:17,583
I'm not dating you.
Why do you keep butting in?

111
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,343
We're not going out?

112
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:40,663
Hey!

113
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,823
What the hell?

114
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:46,623
He's making me feel guilty.

115
00:07:47,823 --> 00:07:48,663
MINGDE UNIVERSITY POKER CLUB

116
00:07:48,743 --> 00:07:50,943
What? This is unbelievable.

117
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:51,943
What is it?

118
00:07:53,543 --> 00:07:55,023
-My gosh.
-Hey, did you guys see?

119
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:56,143
-Yes.
-Wow.

120
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:57,783
I can't believe she did that.

121
00:07:57,863 --> 00:07:58,703
Look.

122
00:07:58,783 --> 00:07:59,943
That's her.

123
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:01,303
Isn't that her?

124
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:02,863
I don't believe it.

125
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:04,303
Isn't that her?

126
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:05,263
Yeah.

127
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:06,903
-It's her.
-It's her.

128
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:11,983
-Yes.
-It's her.

129
00:08:12,063 --> 00:08:13,023
Don't be ridiculous.

130
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:14,983
Shancai would never do that.

131
00:08:15,263 --> 00:08:16,183
We're not making it up.

132
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,703
She really did lean
on the foreigner that day.

133
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:22,463
Yes. I even have a photo of her
dancing with Thomas.

134
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,463
See?

135
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,903
You're lying.

136
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:30,183
That's not Shancai.

137
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:31,583
The photo is fake.

138
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:34,303
There's the girl we're talking about.
Ask her yourself.

139
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,503
Dong Shancai.

140
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:44,383
You spent the night with Thomas, right?

141
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,943
Look at this.

142
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:50,103
UGLY DUCKLING DONG SHANCAI
CHEATS ON DAOMING SI

143
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:51,343
AND SPENDS A NIGHT WITH A FRENCH GUY?

144
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:53,983
See?

145
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:55,703
She's not denying it.

146
00:08:55,783 --> 00:08:58,023
You're the only one
who still thinks she's innocent.

147
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,383
Why did you two set me up?

148
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:03,743
Shancai, we're not the ones
who posted the photos.

149
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:05,503
Don't yell at us.

150
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:06,583
Right.

151
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:08,743
You're responsible for your own actions.

152
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:11,023
I can't believe you did that
to Daoming Si.

153
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,903
Stop harassing her!

154
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:14,623
Shancai.

155
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:16,863
This is a misunderstanding, right?

156
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:20,983
Just explain it to them.

157
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:22,703
Shancai!

158
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:54,063
Hello. Do you know the long-haired
pianist named Thomas?

159
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:55,623
Do you know where he is?

160
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:57,143
-Thomas?
-Yes.

161
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,183
That foreigner just filled in for the day.

162
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:00,543
I'm not sure where he is.

163
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:24,463
Isn't Si acting weird?

164
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:27,583
He's been swimming
back and forth for an hour.

165
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:31,903
I'm not surprised.

166
00:10:32,103 --> 00:10:34,383
He must have been annoyed
by Shancai again.

167
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,623
I thought Si would've gotten Shancai
in the elevator that night.

168
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:42,423
I didn't think he'd drag it out like this.

169
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:45,623
Logically speaking,

170
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:49,503
any girl who has gone out with an F4
would always call back.

171
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:51,703
They'd ask when the second date is.

172
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:54,183
-How many girls called you today?
-Do you want to see?

173
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:01,863
No way.

174
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,543
-What?
-Look at this.

175
00:11:58,463 --> 00:12:01,823
What the hell is wrong with you?
We're too old for pranks like that.

176
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:06,703
Where's my phone?

177
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,743
<i>Sorry.</i>

178
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:21,463
<i>The person you have reached
is unavailable.</i>

179
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:24,343
<i>Please try again later.</i>

180
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:30,303
<i>Sorry.</i>

181
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:32,023
<i>The person you have reached...</i>

182
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:35,063
What is the photo about?

183
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:36,783
Why did you frame me?

184
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:56,103
Shancai. We saw the photo.

185
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:58,263
What happened
between you and that foreigner?

186
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:01,543
It's not true.

187
00:13:01,943 --> 00:13:02,943
It's a misunderstanding.

188
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:05,983
That night,

189
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:09,143
Xinhui, Baihe, and Li Zhen

190
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:11,183
went out for a ladies' night.

191
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:13,663
I did dance with that guy.

192
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,143
But nothing else happened.

193
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,063
So what's the photo about?

194
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:23,663
I'm not sure.

195
00:13:28,863 --> 00:13:29,783
<i>Sorry.</i>

196
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:35,223
<i>The person you have reached
is unavailable.</i>

197
00:13:35,343 --> 00:13:37,623
<i>Please try again later.</i>

198
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,983
<i>Why would Daoming Si fall
for a shameless girl like her?</i>

199
00:14:00,063 --> 00:14:01,943
<i>Dong Shancai,
you should be ashamed of yourself.</i>

200
00:14:02,023 --> 00:14:03,303
<i>You've embarrassed Mingde.</i>

201
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:05,623
<i>Dong Shancai, whom are you really dating?</i>

202
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:08,303
<i>Do you like Daoming Si or that foreigner?</i>

203
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,623
<i>I wonder what Daoming Si sees in you.</i>

204
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:12,703
<i>Poor Si. I can't believe he likes you.</i>

205
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:14,503
<i>How did it end up like this?</i>

206
00:14:24,503 --> 00:14:25,543
<i>I must not run.</i>

207
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:26,863
<i>Running away means I'm guilty.</i>

208
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:29,863
<i>I didn't do anything wrong.
Why should I hide?</i>

209
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:06,343
-It's her.
-Yes. Ignore her.

210
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:08,623
-How dare she show up?
-Right?

211
00:15:08,703 --> 00:15:10,063
Excuse me.

212
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,583
She's sitting in front.

213
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:18,143
She's really sitting here.

214
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:19,543
-Should we move?
-Gosh.

215
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:21,303
-Let's go.
-Come on.

216
00:15:27,063 --> 00:15:28,103
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

217
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,143
Go.

218
00:15:38,623 --> 00:15:41,063
Damn you. Why won't you answer my calls?

219
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:42,263
Are you hiding from me?

220
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:44,503
Why did you post that photo online?

221
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:48,103
Face me in person
instead of playing dirty!

222
00:15:48,183 --> 00:15:49,863
What kind of a man are you?

223
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:53,063
REENACTING ENGLISH SCENARIO

224
00:15:54,743 --> 00:15:58,143
Let's have two students come up
for an impromptu session.

225
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:02,583
You should call up Shancai.
Her English is excellent.

226
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:03,623
-Okay.
-Right?

227
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:06,223
Yes, her English is outstanding.

228
00:16:06,303 --> 00:16:07,623
Yes, let her do it.

229
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:09,063
She knows a lot of foreigners.

230
00:16:09,143 --> 00:16:10,463
I'm sure she learned something.

231
00:16:10,543 --> 00:16:12,263
Hey, stop making up stories, okay?

232
00:16:12,343 --> 00:16:13,463
I didn't make it up.

233
00:16:14,823 --> 00:16:15,983
Did I make it up?

234
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:29,703
Let's go.

235
00:16:47,143 --> 00:16:50,103
So I don't think Thomas lives in Shanghai.

236
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,023
He's probably gone back to France.

237
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:58,143
I think one of Thomas' friends
shared the photos,

238
00:16:58,823 --> 00:17:00,423
and they were set up.

239
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:03,503
I wonder

240
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,183
who's trying to hurt Shancai.

241
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,463
Hey, you two.
When can I get my phone back?

242
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,583
It's still being repaired.

243
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:19,303
You don't have class this afternoon.

244
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:21,503
Why? I can't come if I don't have class?

245
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:24,543
Sure, you can.

246
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:27,823
Hey.

247
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:29,503
What were you two looking at?

248
00:17:29,663 --> 00:17:30,663
You're being so secretive.

249
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,423
We were watching a romantic action movie.

250
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:36,463
-You won't like it.
-Romance action.

251
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,903
Liars.

252
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:39,983
I doubt you were watching a movie.

253
00:17:40,263 --> 00:17:42,143
-Show me. I want to see.
-Hey!

254
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:44,463
Si!

255
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:52,303
What do we do?

256
00:17:57,223 --> 00:17:58,863
UGLY DUCKLING DONG SHANCAI
CHEATS ON DAOMING SI

257
00:18:03,303 --> 00:18:04,463
Who is this guy?

258
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:08,103
He's just asking for directions.

259
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:19,663
I get it now.

260
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:21,543
They lied to me.

261
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:24,343
Asking for directions? Directions, my ass.

262
00:18:28,663 --> 00:18:29,503
-Hey, Si.
-Si.

263
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,423
-Calm down. Shancai is actually--
-Get off!

264
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:33,663
Si.

265
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:38,183
-What now?
-Let's go after him.

266
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,143
Take this to the classroom first
and then the rest.

267
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:03,663
Are you okay?

268
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:05,583
I'm fine.

269
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:06,823
We're sorry.

270
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,263
Isn't she...

271
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:13,743
Let's go.

272
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:35,343
Daoming Si.

273
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:39,503
That foreigner wasn't asking
for directions, was he?

274
00:19:41,543 --> 00:19:42,383
He's...

275
00:19:44,823 --> 00:19:46,943
You two went to a hotel, didn't you?

276
00:19:49,783 --> 00:19:50,623
No.

277
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:52,543
Nothing happened with him.

278
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:55,543
Those photos on Weibo
are a misunderstanding.

279
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:58,063
Then why did you lie to me?

280
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:05,783
I did lie about who he was,

281
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:08,863
but there's nothing between us.

282
00:20:12,663 --> 00:20:14,783
I don't care if everyone
believes the rumors

283
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:17,103
and nobody believes me.

284
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:19,463
It's fine with me.

285
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:22,503
As long as...

286
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:26,783
As long as you still trust me.

287
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:33,423
We've been sitting here for three hours.

288
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,783
How long are we going to wait?

289
00:21:37,823 --> 00:21:41,143
I think all my blood will be sucked dry
by the mosquitoes.

290
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,703
I'll be a master mosquito killer
before the night ends.

291
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:54,423
Si must be outraged.

292
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:57,023
The girl who the almighty Daoming Si likes

293
00:21:57,303 --> 00:21:59,223
has become the girl
everyone hates and criticizes.

294
00:22:00,103 --> 00:22:01,103
You know what?

295
00:22:01,183 --> 00:22:03,423
-If it happened to us--
-No way.

296
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,063
We'd never like a girl to that extent.

297
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,023
Or we should say

298
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:10,423
there is no girl that we can't handle.

299
00:22:10,903 --> 00:22:11,743
You're right.

300
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,303
But why must three people suffer

301
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,983
when only one person is broken-hearted?

302
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:30,623
Lei is so lucky he isn't here.

303
00:22:38,903 --> 00:22:41,703
I think we won't get through
to Si right now.

304
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,223
There are two options.

305
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:48,183
One, get him drunk and drag him home.

306
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:50,983
Two, knock him out and drag him home.

307
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:53,503
This is all the alcohol left.

308
00:22:54,463 --> 00:22:55,863
We'll have to use force then.

309
00:22:56,063 --> 00:22:56,983
Hey, I'll do it.

310
00:22:57,063 --> 00:22:57,903
-I'll do it.
-Let me.

311
00:22:57,983 --> 00:22:58,823
-I'll do it.
-Me...

312
00:22:58,903 --> 00:22:59,743
-I'll...
-Let me.

313
00:23:00,703 --> 00:23:01,703
Where's Si?

314
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,423
Hey, why are you standing here?

315
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:05,103
<i>-Si.</i>
-Si.

316
00:24:06,983 --> 00:24:09,023
<i>-Why are you sitting here?</i>
-Why are you sitting here?

317
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:45,383
Shancai.

318
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:47,863
Why?

319
00:24:49,143 --> 00:24:50,503
Why did you lie to me?

320
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:53,703
You want me to trust you, right?

321
00:24:53,983 --> 00:24:56,063
Why did you lie then?

322
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:10,183
You're awake.

323
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:16,183
Where am I?

324
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,023
My house.

325
00:25:19,743 --> 00:25:20,783
How did I get here?

326
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:22,943
You were drunk last night.

327
00:25:23,343 --> 00:25:24,823
I didn't know where to take you.

328
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:26,623
I'm going then.

329
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:29,623
I made breakfast.

330
00:25:30,183 --> 00:25:31,903
-Have some before you go.
-It's okay.

331
00:25:33,943 --> 00:25:35,583
-I'll help you.
-Get off.

332
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:39,583
Daoming Si.

333
00:25:40,183 --> 00:25:41,623
Do you really hate me that much?

334
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:46,063
Can you at least tell me

335
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:47,983
why you hate me?

336
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:52,543
I don't hate you. I just don't care.

337
00:25:56,383 --> 00:25:57,743
How am I different from Shancai?

338
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:02,583
We are both from an average family.

339
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:04,623
We're both plain-looking.

340
00:26:05,423 --> 00:26:07,703
We are girls that blend
into the background.

341
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:09,783
Why do you like Shancai

342
00:26:10,463 --> 00:26:11,983
but not even notice me?

343
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:12,903
Shut up.

344
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:17,263
I know.

345
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:20,223
You like girls like Shancai,

346
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:22,143
who look innocent and naive,

347
00:26:22,223 --> 00:26:24,583
but jump on a guy any chance she gets.

348
00:26:25,303 --> 00:26:28,223
If that's the case, I can do it too.

349
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:37,543
-Take your hands off or I'll make you.
-I won't.

350
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:40,583
If that's what you want,
I can be like Shancai too.

351
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:44,183
I can be loud and bold,
pretending to be strong.

352
00:26:45,263 --> 00:26:46,903
I can do everything you want.

353
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:49,303
I'll become whatever you want me to be.

354
00:26:54,983 --> 00:26:56,423
Don't compare yourself to Shancai.

355
00:26:56,503 --> 00:26:58,903
-She's not like you.
-How?

356
00:27:00,503 --> 00:27:02,303
Shancai would never do that.

357
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:11,983
<i>Who on earth posted those photos?</i>

358
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:14,743
Why did that Thomas suddenly disappear?

359
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:16,743
I don't know.

360
00:27:19,383 --> 00:27:20,743
So what are you going to do now?

361
00:27:21,063 --> 00:27:24,303
Aren't you going to clear your name?

362
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:28,783
I know I didn't do anything wrong.

363
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:32,223
I believe that justice will prevail.

364
00:27:34,823 --> 00:27:37,063
I believe the truth will be revealed soon.

365
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:38,783
Hang in there.

366
00:27:40,863 --> 00:27:41,863
Yeah.

367
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:00,583
I don't give a damn.

368
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:01,543
Well?

369
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:04,143
You can't have me even
if you give me everything in the world.

370
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:06,143
If I were you,

371
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:08,463
I would feel very lonely.

372
00:28:08,783 --> 00:28:10,303
I would probably become rebellious.

373
00:28:11,383 --> 00:28:13,183
<i>I don't care if everyone
believes the rumors</i>

374
00:28:13,263 --> 00:28:14,743
and nobody believes me.

375
00:28:15,623 --> 00:28:16,903
It's fine with me.

376
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:18,863
As long as...

377
00:28:21,663 --> 00:28:23,183
As long as you still trust me.

378
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:25,863
What am I doing?

379
00:28:26,543 --> 00:28:27,903
How could I do this to her?

380
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:37,503
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

381
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:45,943
Hey.

382
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:48,383
Doesn't she look familiar to you?

383
00:28:48,863 --> 00:28:51,823
Isn't she the girl we met
in the alley that day?

384
00:28:55,223 --> 00:28:57,263
-Come here.
-Hey, what are you doing?

385
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,063
Let me go!

386
00:28:59,623 --> 00:29:01,263
Let me go! Let go!

387
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:04,223
Let me go!

388
00:29:04,463 --> 00:29:05,383
Let go!

389
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:06,863
Let me go!

390
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,023
Miss, we meet again.

391
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:12,183
Stay away.

392
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:27,223
You bit me!

393
00:29:32,023 --> 00:29:35,023
You bastards will get
what's coming for you!

394
00:30:22,023 --> 00:30:24,623
Sorry, I'm late.

395
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:31,383
Do you believe me?

396
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,143
If you say you didn't do it,
I believe you.

397
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,063
-Mr. Liu, prepare a bath.
-Okay.

398
00:31:28,743 --> 00:31:30,783
It hurts! Can you be more gentle?

399
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:35,343
I'm treating your wound.
There's no need to yell.

400
00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:37,503
People would think I'm hurting you.

401
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:44,223
Who told you to go to my house

402
00:31:44,823 --> 00:31:46,743
and ask my mom where I work?

403
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:49,783
Who would've saved you
if I hadn't gone to the shop?

404
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:55,383
But you shouldn't have told them
that I'm staying at your place.

405
00:31:56,103 --> 00:31:57,263
They may get the wrong idea.

406
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:58,343
I saved you.

407
00:31:58,663 --> 00:31:59,903
I'm letting you stay here.

408
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:02,863
But instead of thanking me,
you're complaining?

409
00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:06,863
Thanks.

410
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:09,223
What? I can't hear you.

411
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,543
There's no need to yell.

412
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:14,943
Hey.

413
00:32:15,423 --> 00:32:18,103
Nothing happened between you
and that foreigner, right?

414
00:32:19,623 --> 00:32:20,663
You're an idiot.

415
00:32:21,383 --> 00:32:25,423
I barely knew him.
Why would I do anything with him?

416
00:32:28,023 --> 00:32:29,063
That had better be true.

417
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:30,863
I'm so angry, I could kill him.

418
00:32:33,423 --> 00:32:34,863
Why are you so pissed off?

419
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:38,183
-Are you jealous?
-Yes, I am.

420
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,223
I'm really jealous!

421
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:58,663
Because I like you.

422
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:03,583
You...

423
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:07,463
Wait.

424
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:09,623
Not even for 0.5 seconds.

425
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:24,863
I'm going to sleep.

426
00:33:41,663 --> 00:33:42,623
Hey.

427
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:45,423
Where's the guest room?

428
00:33:46,183 --> 00:33:47,543
The third room on the right.

429
00:33:48,223 --> 00:33:49,303
-Okay.
-Shancai.

430
00:33:52,303 --> 00:33:53,423
I mean it.

431
00:33:53,863 --> 00:33:54,703
Think about it.

432
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:27,983
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

433
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:30,143
<i>Daoming Si actually likes me?</i>

434
00:34:35,703 --> 00:34:37,943
<i>And I didn't stop him from kissing me.</i>

435
00:34:39,263 --> 00:34:40,703
<i>What is wrong with me?</i>

436
00:35:09,383 --> 00:35:10,223
Yes?

437
00:35:10,703 --> 00:35:11,543
Come with me.

438
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,423
She's in there.

439
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,103
What's going on?

440
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:34,103
The person who posted
those photos is inside.

441
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:36,223
See for yourself.

442
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:48,143
Li Zhen?

443
00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:49,583
Shancai.

444
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,063
Why are you guys here?

445
00:35:55,383 --> 00:35:56,223
Come in.

446
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,423
My place is a bit messy.
I hope you don't mind.

447
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:03,783
Have a seat.

448
00:36:05,023 --> 00:36:07,143
It looks like someone
is still feigning innocence.

449
00:36:11,263 --> 00:36:13,703
What do you mean?

450
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:17,063
I think you made a mistake.

451
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:21,263
Li Zhen can't be the one who set me up.

452
00:36:23,623 --> 00:36:24,703
Li Zhen.

453
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:28,303
You went to high school with Shancai
and attended Mingde University too.

454
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:31,703
Thomas left and couldn't be reached,

455
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:33,663
but we did some digging.

456
00:36:33,743 --> 00:36:36,583
The Weibo user that posted
those defamatory photos

457
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:38,063
was you.

458
00:36:39,023 --> 00:36:40,023
Spit it out.

459
00:36:40,623 --> 00:36:41,463
Why did you do it?

460
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:44,383
Why?

461
00:36:45,143 --> 00:36:46,183
Well...

462
00:36:46,343 --> 00:36:48,703
Perhaps you prefer to settle it in court.

463
00:36:49,423 --> 00:36:50,383
I'll call the lawyer.

464
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,783
No.

465
00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:00,223
Fine. I admit it.

466
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:04,183
I posted those photos online.

467
00:37:09,503 --> 00:37:11,863
So you set me up with Thomas?

468
00:37:13,383 --> 00:37:14,503
Then how did you get the photos?

469
00:37:17,623 --> 00:37:18,543
That night,

470
00:37:19,143 --> 00:37:20,423
Thomas invited you to dance.

471
00:37:22,263 --> 00:37:24,023
<i>You two were having so much fun.</i>

472
00:37:25,983 --> 00:37:28,023
I could tell he was interested in you.

473
00:37:36,383 --> 00:37:37,223
Hi.

474
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:39,103
-I feel sick. I need to go.
-Hey.

475
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:42,383
-Can you look after my friend for me?
-All right.

476
00:37:43,903 --> 00:37:46,943
Can you send me a photo
wherever you go later?

477
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:48,383
Just so I'd know she's safe.

478
00:37:48,463 --> 00:37:49,423
All right.

479
00:38:07,223 --> 00:38:10,303
<i>Don't worry. I dropped your friend off
at the hotel safely.</i>

480
00:38:30,823 --> 00:38:31,783
The next day,

481
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:34,783
Thomas called me to say he likes you
and wanted to see you.

482
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:37,263
I saw you two looking
really friendly on campus.

483
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:39,423
But then...

484
00:38:39,503 --> 00:38:40,583
-Daoming Si.
<i>-I saw you and Daoming Si</i>

485
00:38:40,663 --> 00:38:42,143
<i>arguing by the school entrance.</i>

486
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:44,303
Who is this guy?

487
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:45,823
He's just asking for directions.

488
00:38:47,143 --> 00:38:48,423
Why did he grab your shoulders?

489
00:38:48,503 --> 00:38:49,383
I'll ask him.

490
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:51,863
Listen carefully.

491
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:53,063
She's my woman.

492
00:38:53,183 --> 00:38:54,223
Don't touch her.

493
00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:56,383
So this pretty girl
already has a boyfriend.

494
00:38:56,863 --> 00:39:00,903
<i>I was furious as I looked at the photo
Thomas had sent.</i>

495
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:02,543
<i>So I shared it.</i>

496
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:07,383
POST TO WEIBO

497
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,223
I don't understand.

498
00:39:13,343 --> 00:39:14,903
Aren't we good friends?

499
00:39:15,743 --> 00:39:16,823
Why were you furious?

500
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:18,463
Good friends?

501
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:20,463
Sorry,

502
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,703
but that's too big of a burden for me.

503
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:24,463
What do you mean?

504
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:26,543
What "good friends"?

505
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:30,223
Did you think about me when Qinghe

506
00:39:30,303 --> 00:39:32,983
-invited you to Sanya with F4?
-Qinghe was the one who invited me.

507
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:36,343
At the time, I didn't know
F4 was going to be there.

508
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:39,623
What about lying to me
about Jing's birthday party

509
00:39:39,703 --> 00:39:42,423
and then embarrassing me
by not picking up my call?

510
00:39:43,143 --> 00:39:46,743
My phone was dead at Jing's party.

511
00:39:46,823 --> 00:39:48,503
I called you after that, didn't I?

512
00:39:49,023 --> 00:39:50,943
You said you couldn't come
because you were busy.

513
00:39:51,023 --> 00:39:52,383
I wasn't busy.

514
00:39:52,783 --> 00:39:54,023
I couldn't get in.

515
00:39:54,383 --> 00:39:55,583
You couldn't get in?

516
00:39:58,463 --> 00:40:00,703
I wore an expensive dress

517
00:40:01,503 --> 00:40:03,663
that cost three times
my monthly living expenses.

518
00:40:04,743 --> 00:40:06,543
I stood at the door of Jing's house.

519
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,583
I called you many times,
I couldn't get through.

520
00:40:12,983 --> 00:40:14,583
<i>While you guys were having fun inside,</i>

521
00:40:15,103 --> 00:40:17,583
<i>I stood out in the rain
and denied entry by the guards.</i>

522
00:40:18,063 --> 00:40:20,143
They wouldn't let me in
no matter what I said.

523
00:40:20,263 --> 00:40:21,543
Did you consider how I felt?

524
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:24,903
-I did call you!
-Don't you get it?

525
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,783
Jing's invitation

526
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:30,543
was meant for you.

527
00:40:32,183 --> 00:40:34,143
It was for Dong Shancai.

528
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:38,703
It didn't matter
that my dress cost 6,000 yuan.

529
00:40:40,503 --> 00:40:42,383
I'm just a supporting character.

530
00:40:43,743 --> 00:40:44,983
Your accessory.

531
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:47,743
Nobody pays attention to me.

532
00:40:50,063 --> 00:40:51,503
I could attend the party

533
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:55,823
because I'm Shancai's friend,
not because I'm Li Zhen.

534
00:40:57,103 --> 00:40:58,503
Why would you think that?

535
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:00,103
I'm not imagining things.

536
00:41:00,943 --> 00:41:02,303
It's the truth.

537
00:41:03,783 --> 00:41:04,943
That's the saddest part.

538
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:07,823
If you really believed that,

539
00:41:08,623 --> 00:41:10,463
why didn't you tell me how you felt?

540
00:41:11,223 --> 00:41:13,303
Because I have my pride too, okay?

541
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:14,543
You're just jealous of Shancai.

542
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:16,783
Yes, I admit it.

543
00:41:19,423 --> 00:41:20,423
That day,

544
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:23,463
<i>I realized while walking home in the rain.</i>

545
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:26,583
<i>No matter how hard I try,</i>

546
00:41:26,663 --> 00:41:29,463
or how much effort I put in
to please others, it won't matter.

547
00:41:31,063 --> 00:41:32,703
I should learn from you.

548
00:41:34,023 --> 00:41:36,063
Have a pair of innocent-looking eyes.

549
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:38,303
Pretend to be nice.

550
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:42,783
Play hard to get with guys.

551
00:41:43,783 --> 00:41:45,023
After hurting someone,

552
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,463
just brush it off
by saying it wasn't intentional.

553
00:41:47,663 --> 00:41:49,063
Even if that were true,

554
00:41:50,023 --> 00:41:53,183
you shouldn't have done what you did
to defame and hurt me!

555
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:55,623
You made people turn on me.

556
00:41:57,183 --> 00:41:58,743
That's because I wanted you to know

557
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,783
how it felt to be hated.

558
00:42:01,303 --> 00:42:02,183
Get off.

559
00:42:02,663 --> 00:42:04,143
<i>Just like what I've had to endure.</i>

560
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,583
Don't compare yourself to Shancai.

561
00:42:07,663 --> 00:42:08,863
She's not like you.

562
00:42:16,823 --> 00:42:17,703
Li Zhen.

563
00:42:19,343 --> 00:42:20,983
I am so disappointed in you.

564
00:42:22,503 --> 00:42:24,703
I can't believe
this is what you thought of me.

565
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:30,183
If you're unhappy with me, just tell me.

566
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:34,623
Why did you have to resort to that
and stab me in the back?

567
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,663
You don't deserve to be my friend.

568
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:41,423
Whatever.

569
00:42:42,223 --> 00:42:43,063
The point is,

570
00:42:43,703 --> 00:42:45,183
I don't need a friend like you either.

571
00:42:46,383 --> 00:42:47,383
I no longer care.

572
00:42:53,423 --> 00:42:54,943
I'm really sad.

573
00:42:57,703 --> 00:42:59,823
So sad that I wish I could
hit you and scold you.

574
00:43:03,463 --> 00:43:05,303
But I have nothing to say to you.

575
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:16,743
Li Zhen.

576
00:43:17,623 --> 00:43:20,143
There are many things
that are unfair in this world.

577
00:43:21,343 --> 00:43:24,103
But that doesn't mean
you should treat yourself unfairly.
