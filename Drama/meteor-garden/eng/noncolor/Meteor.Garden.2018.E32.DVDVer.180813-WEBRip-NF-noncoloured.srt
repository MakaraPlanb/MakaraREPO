METEOR GARDEN

00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,079
EPISODE 32

4
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,319
You're an idiot.

5
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,639
Okay.

6
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,679
What do you plan to do?

7
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,999
Quietly look out for Shancai?

8
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:48,959
What do you mean?

9
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,919
Didn't Huaze Lei confess

10
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:52,559
to Shancai today?

11
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,959
Also, the problem with Xiaoyou
and Qinghe's families.

12
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,559
There are so many obstacles
standing in your way.

13
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,759
That's not important.

14
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,399
What's important is

15
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:03,999
Shancai's feelings.

16
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,399
But Shancai said

17
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,319
that she feels at peace

18
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,879
-with Huaze Lei.
-I don't want her to feel at peace!

19
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,319
I want us to be together.

20
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,639
Whether there are obstacles

21
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:28,319
or if Shancai's undecided
on whoever she likes,

22
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,679
I want to get her back.

23
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,119
Daoming Si, you're such a nice guy.

24
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,359
Why aren't you mine?

25
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,439
Xiaozi.

26
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,959
Fine.

27
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,719
I was just kidding. Okay?

28
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:48,919
I support you.

29
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,079
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

30
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,599
Your White Jasmine Dew.

31
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:05,479
I still remember the first time
you came here.

32
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:07,519
You didn't actually like milk tea.

33
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,759
But you ordered it
because of its unique name.

34
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,159
You still remember that?

35
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,519
Where's your friend Xiaoyou?

36
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,959
Why isn't she here today?

37
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:19,479
She's busy with her finals.

38
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,679
So she's got the day off.

39
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:23,519
I'll wait for you and take you home later.

40
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:31,039
Lei.

41
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,959
I'm grateful you brought me back
from the fishing village.

42
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,279
You decorated my place,

43
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,159
helped me with my assignments,

44
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,719
stayed beside me, and took care of me

45
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,599
during my most difficult times.

46
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,759
And the song you played

47
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,399
was really nice.

48
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,119
I really liked it.

49
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,919
I'm really grateful...

50
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,039
to you.

51
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:56,799
You really are a nice guy.

52
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,479
I did those things because I wanted to.

53
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:20,319
We can't be together.

54
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,719
Don't worry.

55
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,399
I just want to be nice to you.

56
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:29,719
Maybe there won't be an opportunity
for me to do so in the future.

57
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,119
Right now, these are
unforgettable memories for me.

58
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,479
Shancai.

59
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,839
This is the first time
I don't have to think about Si

60
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,479
and just be with you.

61
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:02,839
Are you used to living alone?

62
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,759
It's all right.

63
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:07,439
I keep myself busy as much as possible.

64
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,719
That way, I have less time
to think about it.

65
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,719
You sound like Jing.

66
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,959
Jing?

67
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,239
Since I left France,

68
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:21,319
Jing was alone.

69
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:24,319
Even though that was her decision,

70
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,559
I went there and left.

71
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:29,599
It'd be worse if I didn't go there at all.

72
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,639
I know.

73
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,759
When you enter someone's life,

74
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,639
she'll have expectations of you.

75
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:40,879
When you leave,
her life goes back to square one.

76
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:44,439
The disappointment and sadness
are even more unbearable.

77
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:47,759
You're right.

78
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:51,039
But I wasn't thinking clearly at the time.

79
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,439
I wasn't sure how to face her.

80
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,119
So I left.

81
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,879
But Jing didn't blame me.

82
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:02,679
She just said

83
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:05,119
she made herself busier
to tire herself out.

84
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,879
To numb herself.

85
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:10,039
Do you regret it?

86
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:14,559
I do.

87
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,359
I regret giving up on her so easily.

88
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,559
I regret not holding on
a little longer that time.

89
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,519
Shancai.

90
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,119
Do you get it?

91
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,559
Hold on a little longer.

92
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,359
If you do,

93
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,959
a lot of things might end up differently.

94
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,039
But if you miss that opportunity,

95
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,119
you'll regret it your whole life.

96
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,079
Regret?

97
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,959
Your decision

98
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,879
determines the outcome,

99
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,439
whether it's a happy ending or a sad one.

100
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:09,999
If you still don't know
what you want to do,

101
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:12,279
then hold on a little longer.

102
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,759
Just like Si.

103
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:20,039
Even though he's immature,
he's very sincere.

104
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,119
He's still holding on

105
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:25,199
to his love for you.

106
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,039
Didn't you say

107
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,799
that Si can recover as quickly as a dog?

108
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:39,599
I think that's how he is
when it comes to love too.

109
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,279
What do you think, Mrs. Yu?

110
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,279
Do I give out

111
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,439
powerful vibes?

112
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,159
What's wrong?

113
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,999
Is there something on my face?

114
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,599
Si.

115
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:27,999
Right now,

116
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,839
you're back at being your old self.

117
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,759
Of course.

118
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,199
I'm not like you,

119
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,279
who's a flickering candle.

120
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,839
You're joking around again.

121
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:46,319
You meant to say,

122
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,519
"A candle in the wind," right?

123
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,799
Silly boy.

124
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,399
Silly boy?

125
00:08:58,319 --> 00:08:59,519
You can call me silly.

126
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,679
I'm going to do the silliest thing
I'll ever do in my life.

127
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:09,599
This boy.

128
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,119
<i>Doesn't he still have</i>

129
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,759
<i>a lot of silly things
that he's never done in his life yet?</i>

130
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,399
Lei, I want to tell you something.

131
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,119
Okay.

132
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,199
Shancai's mine.

133
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:38,639
Does that mean you're competing with me?

134
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,799
I accept your challenge.

135
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:44,319
Why are you smiling?

136
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:49,039
So you're not giving up on her?

137
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:54,719
That's right.

138
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,319
I can't let her be with another guy.

139
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
I want to win her heart.

140
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:04,679
Regardless if it's my mom or you...

141
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,439
Even if the whole world wants me
to give up on her,

142
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,559
I'd never leave Shancai.

143
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:24,639
In that case, let Shancai choose.

144
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,919
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

145
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,479
Hello?

146
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:54,079
Shancai, promise me one thing.

147
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,359
<i>What is it?</i>

148
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,999
Turn off your cell phone
for 48 hours starting now.

149
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,679
Turn off my phone for 48 hours?

150
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:02,919
Why?

151
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:04,199
I don't want to.

152
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:18,719
POWER OFF

153
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:26,359
Shancai, why did you turn off your phone?

154
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:40,279
Turn to chapter two.

155
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:44,159
Is there anything I can do for you?

156
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,959
Sorry, professor.
I'm looking for Dong Shancai.

157
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,999
She didn't come to class today.

158
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,439
Let's continue.

159
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,999

00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,359

Qinghe.

167
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:03,559
What?

168
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:04,559
Come here.

169
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,639
Wait for me.

170
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,519
What's the matter?

171
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:10,599
Where's Shancai?

172
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:13,839
Why do you want to know?

173
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,279
Cut the crap. Tell me.

174
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,559
I'm not telling you even if I know.

175
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,399
Tell me now.

176
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,599
All right. Let go of me.

177
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,479
Shancai...

178
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,079
Shancai didn't come to school today.

179
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,279
Hi, is Shancai here?

180
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,759
Shancai? She already left.

181
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:49,799
Shancai.

182
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:51,119
Shancai!

183
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:05,239

00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:57,839
<i>The number you are calling
cannot be reached.</i>

188
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,599
Sir, I want to report a crime.

189
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:45,759
There's a thief.

190
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:55,599
<i>Dong Shancai.</i>

191
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,439
<i>No matter where you're hiding,</i>

192
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:00,759
<i>I'll find you.</i>

193
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,799
I bought the moisturizer
you recommended in Canada

194
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,119
right after I returned.

195
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,799
Doesn't it nicely tighten
and moisturize your skin?

196
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:28,239
It's made from the finest herbs.
Safe and effective.

197
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,639
Look. I don't have fine lines anymore.

198
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:31,999
See.

199
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,439
Is Jiang Xiaoyou smart or what?

200
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:34,839
Yes.

201
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:38,719
Shancai, thanks for helping me
look for venues today.

202
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:41,639
You must come to the tea ceremony.

203
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:42,999
No problem.

204
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,319
However,

205
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,399
why did Huaze Lei call and tell me

206
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,599
to hold you up

207
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,039
as long as possible?

208
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,279
He said that?

209
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:55,759
Why?

210
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:57,519
I'm not sure either.

211
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,879
Huaze Lei is very mysterious.

212
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,719
Here. Have some fruit.

213
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:06,159
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

214
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:07,479
Shancai.

215
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:08,999
You haven't been here for so long.

216
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,519
Look. I prepared your favorite fruit.

217
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,799
-Eat more.
-Okay.

218
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,079
It's so sweet.

219
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:18,079
You're such a foodie.

220
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,799
I am and so are you.

221
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,959
<i>This happiness</i>

222
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:31,319
<i>was almost gone because of me.</i>

223
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:36,279
<i>Yesterday, I was still thinking
if I should be true to myself.</i>

224
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:41,119
<i>But if I do that,</i>

225
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,999
<i>I might hurt people around me</i>

226
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,079
<i>and not be able to live with myself.</i>

227
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:01,799
Hey.

228
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:03,599
What is Si doing?

229
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,159
Why isn't he back yet?

230
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,039
I have a feeling

231
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,719
that Si won't be back tonight.

232
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,439
You're trying to say something.

233
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,399
Tell me. What's going on?

234
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,639
Si called me yesterday
and asked where Shancai lives.

235
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,519
Is Si pursuing Shancai again?

236
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,479
No way.

237
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,679
Isn't Shancai with Lei now?

238
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:42,719
I'll call Si.

239
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,639
<i>Hello?</i>

240
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:54,839
Hello, Si.

241
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:55,959
Where are you now?

242
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:15,839
I'm coming.

243
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,279
Who's being so rude?

244
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,319
Who are you looking for?

245
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,599
<i>Shancai stayed here last night.</i>

246
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,159
<i>But a guy picked her up earlier.</i>

247
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:12,359
Lei.

248
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,839
You haven't told me yet.

249
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:16,639
Why did you ask me
to turn off my cell phone?

250
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:19,639
To avoid unnecessary disturbance.

251
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,439
Unnecessary disturbance?

252
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,599
You mean...

253
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:29,679
Daoming Si told me
he's not giving up on you.

254
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,519
What do you think?

255
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,719
I've already decided.

256
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,119
Are you sure?

257
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,399
Yes.

258
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,119
This decision was really hard to make.

259
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:04,959
I admit that I hesitated.

260
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,399
But since I already knew the outcome,

261
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,399
I can't just

262
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:17,319
blindly hold on.

263
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,119
I know Si has been looking for you

264
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:23,559
and waiting for you.

265
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,959
He's been holding on.

266
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,439
I'm going to work.

267
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,039
I'll go with you.

268
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,359
Shancai!

269
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,119
Don't go.

270
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,439
Don't go with Lei.

271
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,359
Don't leave me.

272
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:30,719
Si.

273
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,519
Shancai already made her choice.

274
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,999
Why should she stay with you?

275
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,799
Screw her choice!

276
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:40,799
Shancai.

277
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:44,079
I can't be without you.

278
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:46,759
I can't live without you.

279
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:52,599
Daoming Si.

280
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,159
Let's just give up.

281
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,319
Stop holding on anymore.

282
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:01,519
Absolutely not.

283
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,279
My life has no meaning without you.

284
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:09,479
When I'm awake,

285
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,879
you're all I think of.

286
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:14,199
When I close my eyes, you're in my dreams.

287
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,199
I can only think of one thing.

288
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,279
I can't live without you.

289
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:34,799
Shancai.

290
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,959
I've always done
what I wanted to do before.

291
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:45,119
But I don't know what to do anymore.

292
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,519
Please tell me.

293
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,679
What should I do

294
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,999
for me to continue loving you?

295
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:57,359
Si.

296
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,959
If your love brings problems to Shancai,

297
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:03,959
are you sure that will make her happy?

298
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,159
Shancai.

299
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,719
You know you're the only one for me.

300
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:31,319
Trust me.

301
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,759
I'll definitely make you happy.

302
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:45,999
Shancai.

303
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,479
If you're sure about your decision,

304
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,479
I'll support you no matter what.

305
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,439
Shancai!

306
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:26,319
Shancai!

307
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:34,999
Shancai!

308
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:36,239
Shancai!

309
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,559
Shancai!

310
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:45,599
<i>-Faster. Go faster.</i>
-Shancai!

311
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,679
<i>Don't let me hear his voice again.</i>

312
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,839
Shancai!

313
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:21,879
Shancai!

314
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,999
Shancai!

315
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:33,999
Shancai!

316
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:36,999
Shancai!

317
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,439
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

318
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,919
<i>-My heart...
</i>-Shancai!

319
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,519
<i>...is going to break apart.</i>

320
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:46,879
Shancai!

321
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:50,079
Stop looking.

322
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:53,559
-Don't get off if you've already decided.
-Shancai!

323
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,799
Don't give him any more chances.

324
00:27:58,239 --> 00:27:59,599
Shancai!

325
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:14,959
Shancai!

326
00:28:58,719 --> 00:28:59,959
Daoming Si!

327
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:03,479
Daoming Si!

328
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:18,119
You're such a fool.

329
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:20,039
Do you know how dangerous that was?

330
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,639
She looks like the one in the picture.

331
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:56,919
Let's go.

332
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,359
Wait. It's a misunderstanding.

333
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:02,079
Daoming Si, wait for me.
I won't leave you anymore.

334
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,839
Hey, Daoming Si.

335
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:07,999
Someone reported
that their meteor necklace went missing.

336
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,519
Is it with you?

337
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,319
Meteor necklace?

338
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,079
Yes, it is.

339
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,239
But I didn't steal it.

340
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,879
-Are you admitting it?
-I...

341
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:19,559
The person who reported it
said he was mistaken.

342
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,959
<i>We're responsible to protect the citizens.</i>

343
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,799
<i>We'll thoroughly investigate
every crime reported.</i>

344
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:29,959
<i>I'm really sorry.
I reported it without checking properly.</i>

345
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,399
<i>-Please forgive me.
-All right.</i>

346
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:35,319
<i>Since it's your first offense
and you've regretted your actions,</i>

347
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:38,799
<i>we'll let you go this time.
Don't do it again, okay?</i>

348
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:40,039
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

349
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,439
Daoming Si.

350
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:53,639
Why did you do that?

351
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:55,479
What do you mean?

352
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,359
<i>Silly girl, where did you go?</i>

353
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:03,199
<i>Dong Shancai, listen carefully.</i>

354
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,799
<i>No matter where you're hiding,
I'll find you.</i>

355
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,199
<i>Silly girl.</i>

356
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:11,759
Why did you keep calling me that?

357
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,039
You're a silly boy, right?

358
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:14,999
Why were you hiding?

359
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,559
Didn't I tell you before?

360
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:19,719
No matter what happens,
I need to know where you are.

361
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,559
So you asked the police to arrest me?

362
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:24,759
You're so smart.

363
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,119
I almost got myself a criminal record!

364
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,519
Then what did you want me to do?

365
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:30,439
I almost went crazy looking for you.

366
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:34,679
You've been...

367
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,719
looking for me?

368
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,799
What did you think?

369
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,759
You didn't attend class or go to work.

370
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,159
You didn't go home.

371
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:43,839
Your phone was turned off.

372
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,159
Do you want me to die from stress?
Why did you disappear?

373
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,599
Thank you

374
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,079
for looking for me.

375
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,359
Daoming Si.

376
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:10,759
I thought you'd never come back
to me anymore.

377
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,959
<i>I've always pushed myself into a corner</i>

378
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:24,479
<i>and trapped myself in fear and pain.</i>

379
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:26,359
<i>However,</i>

380
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:28,599
<i>even if I regret it later,</i>

381
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,519
<i>I want to hold on to my happiness now.</i>

382
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:41,239
Are you hungry?

383
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:43,679
It wasn't me.

384
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,079
It wasn't me.

385
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:46,679
I'm sure it was you. I heard it.

386
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:48,639
The sound came from your stomach!

387
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,919
-Why are you accusing me?
-Just because...

388
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,079
All right. Since you looked so cute
when you accused me,

389
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,439
a chivalrous person like me
won't argue with you anymore.

390
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,799
When did I accuse you?

391
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,359
All right. Let's eat.

392
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,879
Why are you holding my hand so tightly?

393
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,239
I'm afraid you'll run away.

394
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:17,719
I'm thinking

395
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,879
I should have borrowed handcuffs
from that officer earlier.

396
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,599
Then you won't be able to run away.

397
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:24,759
Silly boy.

398
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:27,039
Let's go eat ramen.

399
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,559
Ramen?

400
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,199
Why should we eat ramen?

401
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,679
What are you thinking?

402
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,959
I'm thinking of eating ramen.

403
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,079
Then what are you thinking?

404
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:39,559
<i>It suddenly feels like we're flirting.</i>

405
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,759
<i>What should I do to break the awkwardness?</i>

406
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:45,599
I know.

407
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:48,559
You're thinking about me, right?

408
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:52,999
Stop being so narcissistic.

409
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,919
<i>Goodness.</i> <i>What did I just say?</i>

410
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,839
<i>It's even more awkward now.</i>

411
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:05,519
That's so funny.

412
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:08,399
How is that funny?

413
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:09,559
Are we eating or not?

414
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:11,879
-Wasn't it funny?
-Not at all.

415
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,039
-Okay.
-It was not funny.

416
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:19,879
Hey!

417
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,679
Sir, can you please stop the bus?

418
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,479
I'm begging you! It's very important.

419
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,559
Shancai.

420
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:10,959
Are you sure?

421
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,199
Lei, I want to give it a try.

422
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:17,679
Compared to trying my best and failing,

423
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,719
not trying at all would make me
regret it even more.

424
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:01,639
Excuse me.

425
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,639
This is your ramen. Please enjoy.

426
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,679
It looks so good.

427
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,159
-Okay, thanks.
-You're welcome.

428
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,679
Why aren't you eating?

429
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,639
I'm suddenly not that hungry.

430
00:36:26,279 --> 00:36:27,959
It's such a waste not to eat it.

431
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:29,559
Okay, fine.

432
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,199
How is it? Is it good?

433
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,319
Yes, it's all right.

434
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:50,759
Hey.

435
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,599
Do you have a passport?

436
00:36:53,399 --> 00:36:54,599
Yes, I do.

437
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:57,159
I applied for one
the last time I went overseas.

438
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,719
Then there's no problem.

439
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:00,559
What are you talking about?

440
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,799
Shancai, let's go to London together.

441
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:11,999
You mean...

442
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:16,919
that newly-opened London coffee shop?

443
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,639
I think we need to come up
with a plan soon.

444
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,039
My mom is not that easy to handle.

445
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,479
Wait.

446
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:28,999
Aren't we being too rash?

447
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,079
Don't you want to?

448
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,039
No.

449
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:36,279
I don't.

450
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:37,559
Why?

451
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:39,639
What do you mean?

452
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:43,879
I don't want to go to a foreign country.

453
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:47,039
I don't have friends there

454
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:51,439
and my English is bad.
I'm not used to Western food.

455
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,239
What if I get sick?

456
00:37:57,759 --> 00:37:59,399
Then why did you get off the bus?

457
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,839
Did I misunderstand?

458
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:12,719
Why did you get off the bus?

459
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:15,199
<i>Is this guy</i>

460
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:17,879
<i>pushing me to make things clear?</i>

461
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:21,999
Can't I get off the bus?

462
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:28,279
I see.

463
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:31,719
Then I'll go ahead.

464
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:39,879
<i>What exactly am I saying?</i>

465
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:46,759
Daoming Si, wait!

466
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,199
I...

467
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:10,279
I want to say...

468
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:23,999
Good night.

469
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:28,959
That's it?

470
00:39:31,279 --> 00:39:32,399
That's it.

471
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:29,279
Why are you looking for me?

472
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:34,679
I just want to tell you in person
that Shancai is mine.

473
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:35,839
Don't bother her anymore.

474
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:38,559
So you're together now?

475
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:40,559
Is Shancai your girlfriend?

476
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,199
That's none of your business!

477
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:48,959
I don't think she is.

478
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,519
I still have a chance then.

479
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:00,959
Don't you get it?
Tell me that you're giving up on Shancai.

480
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:04,799
I don't see why I should do that.

481
00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:07,679
Huaze Lei.

482
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:09,599
Am I not your friend anymore?

483
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,719
You know I can't live without Shancai.

484
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:12,759
-You know I--
-I don't.

485
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:13,679
You...

486
00:41:13,759 --> 00:41:15,719
I know you hurt her with your temper.

487
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:17,319
How could I hurt her?

488
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,599
Give up on Shancai, understand?

489
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:24,079
I'm not deaf. You don't have to shout.

490
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:31,839
I don't care what you think.

491
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:34,039
I'm warning you.

492
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,399
Shancai is mine.

493
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,279
I, Daoming Si, will be
responsible for her.

494
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,279
I'll take care of her.

495
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:43,119
I won't let her be with a guy like you.
A guy who has no conscience and loyalty.

496
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,319
Do you hear that?

497
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,279
Oh, all right.

498
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:58,279
What do you mean, "Oh, all right"?
What exactly...

499
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:05,199
What did you say again?

500
00:42:05,999 --> 00:42:06,919
I said all right.

501
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:08,239
I'll give up on Shancai.

502
00:42:10,479 --> 00:42:11,359
Why?

503
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,839
-So I can pursue Shancai?
-No.
