00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:30,166
EPISODE 13

4
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:37,686
Zhou Caina is probably
Shancai's most formidable opponent.

5
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:40,686
They're all her opponents.

6
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:43,766
Junior champion
of Chinese Delicacies Competition,

7
00:01:44,926 --> 00:01:47,526
finalist of Le Cordon Bleu
Girls Competition...

8
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:51,926
Even without those titles,
Shancai is nothing compared to her.

9
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,446
You're still drinking milk?

10
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:57,486
Are you even listening to us?

11
00:01:58,046 --> 00:02:00,446
Do you want some? It's in the fridge.

12
00:02:00,646 --> 00:02:02,566
Get some for yourself.

13
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:06,846
Is that supposed to be funny?

14
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,246
If Shancai loses,
don't come complaining to us.

15
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:15,926
Did you guys forget?

16
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:18,846
She's the only girl
that dares stand up to F4.

17
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,446
What can't she do?

18
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:23,366
I believe she can do it.

19
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:31,006
Just wait and see Shancai
surprises everyone.

20
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:24,126
Attitude determines everything.

21
00:03:24,686 --> 00:03:26,526
When you're cooking in the kitchen,

22
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:29,926
your attitude is what's most important.

23
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:33,526
-Have you read the <i>Book of Songs</i>?
-Yes.

24
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:39,846
"The elegant virtuous maiden;
the noble person would love to marry her."

25
00:03:40,446 --> 00:03:41,366
From now on,

26
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:45,646
I'll train you well
and turn you into a star chef!

27
00:03:47,206 --> 00:03:49,286
Only when you combine
the <i>Book of Songs</i> and cuisine,

28
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:53,846
you will be able to make food
that has culture.

29
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:56,086
Those who eat the food
will experience amazement

30
00:03:56,846 --> 00:03:57,926
deep down in their hearts.

31
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:23,366
Bring out the scallions.

32
00:04:24,646 --> 00:04:25,526
Okay.

33
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:45,566
Why did you squeal?

34
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,446
Ms. Zhuang, you stepped on me
with your heels.

35
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:51,286
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:58,286
Make a pot of steaming hot soy milk

37
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:00,606
and instill your love
for your family in it.

38
00:05:01,006 --> 00:05:02,446
That's what touches hearts.

39
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:06,566
Appetizers aren't the main course,

40
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:09,246
but they can complement the main course.

41
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:12,526
They help people build up an appetite

42
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:14,446
and make the meal unforgettable.

43
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:18,886
You and your dishes
will be engraved into their brains.

44
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:22,206
As long as you follow these principles,

45
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:24,646
you will be invincible
in the world of cuisine.

46
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:29,006
But, you must work hard
and practice continuously.

47
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:30,886
That's how you will improve.

48
00:05:31,526 --> 00:05:33,486
I'll record everything I know

49
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:35,686
so you can listen
and practice at the same time.

50
00:05:36,526 --> 00:05:37,366
Remember,

51
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:39,926
no slacking off.

52
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,006
Okay, Ms. Zhuang.

53
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:06,406
<i>BOOK OF SONGS</i>

54
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:13,206
"Like a gem cut and filed,
carved and polished."

55
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:21,806
Vertical cut, pushing cut, pulling cut,
sawing cut, rolling cut.

56
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:24,926
"As if at the brink of a deep abyss,
as if treading on thin ice."

57
00:06:25,006 --> 00:06:28,046
<i>When the water boils, add some salt.</i>

58
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:30,726
<i>Let it boil again and add cold water.</i>

59
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:33,686
<i>Take out the noodles quickly
and put them in iced water.</i>

60
00:06:34,286 --> 00:06:36,966
"The peach tree is young and elegant;
brilliant are its flowers."

61
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:40,486
<i>Use high heat for raw ingredients,
medium heat for cooked ingredients,</i>

62
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:42,126
<i>and low heat for mixing ingredients.</i>

63
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:45,566
<i>When the oil is about 120 degrees heated,
throw in the spices to flavor the oil.</i>

64
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:49,686
<i>"Blue-collared lad,
you’ve long been in my heart."</i>

65
00:06:50,886 --> 00:06:53,606
<i>Whether it be classic plating,
free form plating,</i>

66
00:06:53,686 --> 00:06:56,086
<i>landscape plating, or radial plating,</i>

67
00:06:56,686 --> 00:07:00,046
<i>remember, you must treat
your food as a work of art.</i>

68
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:04,286
Lover ducks meeting at Magpie Bridge.

69
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,366
Mushrooms and assorted vegetables.

70
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,086
Abalone, chicken, and pickled vegetables.

71
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:11,926
Steamed lobsters with garlic.

72
00:07:12,486 --> 00:07:14,406
<i>Today, we're going
to practice cooking chicken.</i>

73
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:17,006
<i>We're making braised
sliced chicken with eggs.</i>

74
00:07:17,206 --> 00:07:19,206
<i>Now, take out a whole chicken.</i>

75
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:21,046
<i>Check if all the feathers
have been plucked.</i>

76
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:24,846
<i>Next, marinate it in the sauce
you prepared beforehand.</i>

77
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:27,166
<i>Massage the chicken
and let the sauce sink in.</i>

78
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:31,006
Zhuang, are you doing yoga?

79
00:07:31,086 --> 00:07:32,446
Si, good thing you're here.

80
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:35,006
Take a video of me
so I can show my friends in London.

81
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:36,326
Why are you wearing earphones?

82
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:37,606
I want to look professional.

83
00:07:37,686 --> 00:07:39,366
Enough talking. Get ready.

84
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:44,806
-Ready?
-Yeah.

85
00:07:44,886 --> 00:07:46,806
<i>There's skill involved
in massaging the chicken.</i>

86
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:54,486
Hello, Mom. I'm busy right now.
I'll call you back later.

87
00:07:56,806 --> 00:07:58,726
<i>There's a skill involved
in massaging the chicken.</i>

88
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:04,646
Okay, make a circle
with your right leg three times.

89
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:11,446
Okay, now your left leg.

90
00:08:15,806 --> 00:08:17,526
Now, relax your neck.

91
00:08:17,646 --> 00:08:19,246
Turn to the right, three times.

92
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:26,366
Okay, let's relax your whole body.

93
00:08:26,446 --> 00:08:27,406
Slap your body.

94
00:08:31,726 --> 00:08:33,966
Now, put your hands up,

95
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,366
exhale.

96
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:40,366
<i>Repeat after me.</i>

97
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:46,766
<i>All right, last of all,</i>

98
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:49,526
lower your head between your legs.

99
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:51,886
<i>Go low for me, come on.</i>

100
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,566
Last three breaths. Repeat after me.

101
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:41,206
Zhuang,

102
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:43,326
why are you here?

103
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:47,846
-I was worried you would disturb Shancai.
-What?

104
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:50,246
I was just tucking her in.

105
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:58,446
<i>"Nights of Azure Aea and Blue Skies."</i>

106
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:01,166
<i>"Famed Peony, Fairest Lady in Bliss."</i>

107
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:04,526
-"Fine Wine in a Luminous Glass."
-"Famed Peony, Fairest Lady in Bliss."

108
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,446
"Shepherd Points
to Almond Flower Village."

109
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:10,486
"South of the River,
the Grass Grows High While it Rains."

110
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,286
"The Moon is Low,
Crows Caw in the Frosty Sky."

111
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:14,646
-"The Swallow Returns from Familiar Days."
-Wait.

112
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:17,006
It's just food.

113
00:10:17,446 --> 00:10:19,606
Why are you giving the dishes
such complicated names?

114
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:22,606
These are all dishes inspired
by Tang poetry.

115
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:24,846
Shancai worked very hard on them.

116
00:10:25,046 --> 00:10:25,966
Try the food.

117
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:45,326
They all taste great.

118
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:51,086
Which one is your least favorite?

119
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:01,286
Which one?

120
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:03,966
I guess, this one.

121
00:11:04,526 --> 00:11:06,326
Improve the shepherd dish.

122
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:07,606
Okay.

123
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:11,846
Which has the worst colors?

124
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:15,526
-Zhuang. I don't want--
-Which one?

125
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,286
I guess, this one.

126
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,966
Improve the moon and crow dish.

127
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:21,406
Okay.

128
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:23,606
Which one is the most delicious?

129
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:27,886
"The Peony and Lady" one was the best.

130
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:30,806
That was a failed dish.

131
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:32,766
You probably only remember
that dish's name.

132
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:33,966
Nope.

133
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:37,486
This one was "The Bird Returns
from Familiar Days."

134
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:38,846
I liked this one the most.

135
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:41,926
It's "The Swallow Returns
from Familiar Days."

136
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:44,806
Don't be picky about the details.

137
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:46,366
You're right.

138
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:50,726
That chicken dish was impeccable.

139
00:11:56,126 --> 00:11:57,166
Don't feel too proud.

140
00:11:58,646 --> 00:11:59,526
Keep working hard.

141
00:12:00,206 --> 00:12:01,566
Be diligent at all times.

142
00:12:01,646 --> 00:12:03,446
-"As if at the brink of a deep abyss,
-"As if at the brink of a deep abyss,

143
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:05,846
-as if treading on thin ice."
-as if treading on thin ice."

144
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:07,446
Ice cream?

145
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:12,406
Let's eat.

146
00:12:14,406 --> 00:12:15,606
What's Shancai up to lately?

147
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:17,326
I think she's preparing for a competition.

148
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:18,406
Competition?

149
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:20,606
Good morning, you two.

150
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:27,006
I was going to class
to have you try this dessert I made.

151
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:29,606
Good thing I saw you here.

152
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:30,766
What a coincidence.

153
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:33,886
Please try this.

154
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:35,646
Let me know what you think.

155
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:43,326
This is so good.

156
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:45,486
Yeah, Shancai, this is amazing.

157
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:46,646
What is it?

158
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,766
"The Chinese Courtesan,

159
00:12:49,846 --> 00:12:53,446
The Beautiful, Youthful,
Sweet-scented Dong Xiaowan."

160
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:55,806
It's just a sesame ball.

161
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:59,726
Normal sesame balls don't have culture.

162
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:01,766
This is different.

163
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,806
By the way, what is Dong Xiaowan?

164
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:11,446
Well, Dong Xiaowan was a person.

165
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:12,806
I guess you didn't know that.

166
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:15,926
Who's Dong XIaowan?

167
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:18,566
She was one of
the Eight Beauties of Qinhuai.

168
00:13:18,686 --> 00:13:20,766
An outstanding cook as well.

169
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:22,406
Do you understand now, dear sir?

170
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,126
Shancai, what did you just call me?

171
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:28,006
Dear sir.

172
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:32,646
Li Zhen, what's wrong with her?

173
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:36,766
Ms. Zhuang said...

174
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:44,486
Ms. Zhuang said
I need to be lady-like at all times.

175
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:46,006
That's how I can be more elegant.

176
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:49,126
By doing so in daily life,

177
00:13:49,206 --> 00:13:52,206
I can be more natural
during the competition.

178
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:54,086
Is this what you call natural?

179
00:13:54,406 --> 00:13:56,206
It sounds like you're a machine.

180
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:58,286
You were cuter the way you were.

181
00:13:58,966 --> 00:13:59,966
Really?

182
00:14:00,726 --> 00:14:02,246
Did I go too far?

183
00:14:02,326 --> 00:14:03,886
It's not like you're in a play.

184
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:07,566
It's not weird when Ms. Zhuang does it.

185
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:10,686
Why is it so weird when I do it?

186
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,726
It's fine. Shancai, just keep trying.

187
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:15,686
What competition were you talking about?

188
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:18,446
Chinese Cuisine Culinary Competition.

189
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,526
I'm participating in the contest
so I can pay Si back with the prize money.

190
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:24,246
My fair lady, I'm sure you'll win.

191
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:27,326
-Qinghe.
-Yes?

192
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:29,726
What did you just call me?

193
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:32,966
Gosh,

194
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:34,326
Shancai influenced me.

195
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:35,886
Now I'm talking weird.

196
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,406
You must work hard, my lady.

197
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,206
I will.

198
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,646
Why are you participating
in the cooking competition?

199
00:14:48,966 --> 00:14:50,166
I saw your name online.

200
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:52,206
Because I need money.

201
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:58,126
Did you know there's
a contestant called Zhou Caina?

202
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:01,166
-Zhou Caina?
-Yes.

203
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:03,686
Her dad is the founder
of Double-X Real Estate Group.

204
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,046
My dad wants me to marry her.

205
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:09,686
She must be good then.

206
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:12,886
If I'm not mistaken,

207
00:15:13,206 --> 00:15:15,286
she's competing because of me.

208
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:16,286
Why?

209
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:19,366
She knows I like cooking.

210
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:22,486
She wants to prove that she has
the same hobby as I do.

211
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:24,366
It's not just because
our families arranged it.

212
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:26,686
She's trying very hard. Do you like her?

213
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:29,886
She's very pretty,

214
00:15:30,486 --> 00:15:32,806
elegant, and talented.

215
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:35,046
But I don't like her.

216
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:36,526
The person I like...

217
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:38,406
You know about that.

218
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:47,206
So, you're trying to tell me

219
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:49,966
I might be beaten
by your childhood friend?

220
00:15:50,926 --> 00:15:52,286
I'm suggesting that you give up.

221
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:53,566
You won't win the prize.

222
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:58,206
Zhou Caina was a finalist
in Le Cordon Bleu Girls Competition.

223
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,166
She's going to win the competition.

224
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:06,886
Shancai, I know your capability.

225
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:10,166
There's a huge difference between you two.

226
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,846
If you compete with her,
you'll embarrass yourself.

227
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:27,406
THE EXTRAORDINARY ZHOU CAINA

228
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,406
<i>Zhou Caina was a finalist
in Le Cordon Bleu Girls Competition.</i>

229
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,686
<i>She's going to win the competition.</i>

230
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:42,326
She's so talented.

231
00:16:43,286 --> 00:16:45,566
Even if I don't eat, drink, sleep,

232
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:47,726
and just study
for three years straight, I can't win.

233
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,806
How can I win?

234
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:54,806
I'm going to embarrass myself.

235
00:16:56,326 --> 00:16:57,246
No.

236
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:01,526
I should go tell Ms. Zhuang
that I'm quitting.

237
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:04,046
Let me tell you.

238
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,366
I hate those people
who think that they'll lose

239
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:08,046
even before they enter the competition.

240
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:11,326
That kind of people
would never succeed no matter what.

241
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:13,846
Never mind.

242
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,526
Ms. Zhuang would beat me to death.

243
00:17:16,926 --> 00:17:19,606
I'll just secretly leave

244
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:21,766
and explain everything to her later.

245
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:07,886
Are you running away?

246
00:18:12,406 --> 00:18:16,326
I'm going to find a way to pay you back.

247
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:23,446
I thought you were a special girl.

248
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:26,446
But you're just another coward

249
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,446
who runs away when things get tough.

250
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:34,566
If I can't win, why should I compete?

251
00:18:38,526 --> 00:18:39,726
You're so weak.

252
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,286
I'm not weak.

253
00:18:42,926 --> 00:18:44,686
But how am I supposed
to compete with someone

254
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:47,206
who competed in Le Cordon Bleu
Girls Competition in high school?

255
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:51,246
-I don't want to disappoint everyone.
-What about disappointing me?

256
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:03,966
I'm sorry.

257
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,806
I'm sorry I let you down.

258
00:19:07,286 --> 00:19:08,526
You're being ridiculous.

259
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:19,646
This isn't the Dong Shancai I know.

260
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:26,126
You don't have the right to say that.

261
00:19:26,686 --> 00:19:29,286
You've never failed
in your whole life growing up.

262
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:31,086
Do you know how much stress I'm under?

263
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:42,486
Why do you care about what people think?

264
00:19:43,806 --> 00:19:45,286
Just do what you want to do.

265
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:47,086
There's always a chance.

266
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:53,166
Why aren't you being mean anymore?

267
00:19:54,246 --> 00:19:56,486
Why are you being so gentle?

268
00:19:57,526 --> 00:19:58,446
Come to my room.

269
00:19:59,126 --> 00:20:00,926
What are we doing?

270
00:20:01,486 --> 00:20:02,926
Sleep. What else would it be?

271
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:09,206
Hurry up. I don't want you
to worry too much.

272
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,726
Your room is so big.

273
00:21:10,446 --> 00:21:11,606
I'm kind of thirsty.

274
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:14,646
Do you want some water?

275
00:21:38,926 --> 00:21:39,766
Here.

276
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:44,686
Are you tired?

277
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:48,126
Then...

278
00:21:51,646 --> 00:21:52,526
Do you want to play?

279
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:01,566
You're very bold.

280
00:22:01,726 --> 00:22:03,606
You tricked me!

281
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:06,526
I won't go easy on you.

282
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:13,646
One, two, three, four, five.

283
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:17,046
You didn't want me
to make it easy for you.

284
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:18,526
I won.

285
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:19,846
You cheated.

286
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:21,886
Hey, don't be a sore loser, okay?

287
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,326
-No.
-No?

288
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:29,126
You already got away with it a few times.

289
00:22:29,206 --> 00:22:30,766
We're going through with it this time.

290
00:22:38,886 --> 00:22:41,126
Don't make me look ugly.

291
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:43,726
Don't move. Or it'll ruin my masterpiece.

292
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:45,766
What are you drawing?

293
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,486
You'll see later.

294
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:15,446
Aren't you getting up yet?

295
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:19,966
Or, do you want
to play rock-paper-scissors?

296
00:23:23,446 --> 00:23:24,326
Sure.

297
00:23:24,926 --> 00:23:26,286
I won't lose this time.

298
00:23:27,486 --> 00:23:28,566
Do you want to win so much?

299
00:23:29,606 --> 00:23:30,686
Of course.

300
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:32,606
It'll be embarrassing if I lose again.

301
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:36,686
How about you take that spirit
and use it during the competition?

302
00:23:39,326 --> 00:23:42,006
Do you think rock-paper-scissors
is the same as the competition?

303
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:45,126
Rock-paper-scissors is about pure luck.

304
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:47,326
The cooking competition is about skill.

305
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:55,766
Shancai,

306
00:23:59,006 --> 00:24:00,766
I believe in you. You can do it.

307
00:24:02,446 --> 00:24:03,806
You should believe in yourself too.

308
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:15,286
You're actually pretty cute up close.

309
00:24:19,246 --> 00:24:20,806
I rarely compliment people.

310
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:22,406
You should be proud.

311
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:32,926
Let's play again.

312
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:37,806
Give it your best.

313
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:42,966
<i>Daoming Si, thank you.</i>

314
00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:44,726
<i>I'll try my best.</i>

315
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,806
What? Shancai disappeared?

316
00:24:54,206 --> 00:24:55,486
-Yes.
-Did you look for her?

317
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:56,886
I did.

318
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:59,526
I called the school and her family.

319
00:25:00,406 --> 00:25:01,806
But, the weird thing is,

320
00:25:02,206 --> 00:25:04,646
Shancai's luggage is in the hall.

321
00:25:05,446 --> 00:25:06,686
Where's Si?

322
00:25:07,086 --> 00:25:08,086
He's sleeping.

323
00:25:08,846 --> 00:25:10,206
I didn't want to disturb him.

324
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,086
Shancai's gone and he's sleeping?

325
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:43,406
Hey, Daoming Si!

326
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:46,206
Who said you could take
these ugly pictures of me?

327
00:26:51,446 --> 00:26:53,246
What? I think they're cute.

328
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:55,526
Cute? They're hideous.

329
00:26:55,606 --> 00:26:57,726
Hey, what are you doing?
You can't rip them up.

330
00:26:57,806 --> 00:26:58,726
They're mine.

331
00:26:58,806 --> 00:27:00,606
It's my face.
I didn't give you permission.

332
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:02,726
Hey!

333
00:27:02,806 --> 00:27:03,646
Calm down!

334
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:04,566
Hey!

335
00:27:04,886 --> 00:27:06,166
-Calm down?
-Hey!

336
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:07,326
I won't!

337
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:08,686
-Hey!
-Hey!

338
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:18,166
So, Si, how's Shancai doing?

339
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,446
It's going great.

340
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:23,406
My sister and I are very confident.

341
00:27:23,486 --> 00:27:24,766
Really?

342
00:27:24,886 --> 00:27:26,606
Ms. Zhuang thinks she'll win?

343
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:30,766
Especially that dish called

344
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:35,086
"The Bird Returns from Familiar Days."

345
00:27:35,846 --> 00:27:40,046
It's better than any dish I've ever had
made by famous cooks.

346
00:27:40,206 --> 00:27:43,086
Isn't it "The Swallow Returns
from Familiar Days"?

347
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:45,166
It's a famous poem by Yan Shu.

348
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:47,406
Whatever.

349
00:27:47,486 --> 00:27:48,766
It's just chicken.

350
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:50,926
I don't understand
what the fancy name is for.

351
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:54,486
Food is not just for the taste buds,
it's a form of cultural exchange.

352
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:55,926
Shancai has really improved.

353
00:27:56,846 --> 00:27:59,206
But, even if she cooked rat poison,

354
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:00,686
Si would gobble it up right away.

355
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:01,606
Shut up.

356
00:28:01,726 --> 00:28:03,166
I'm very objective, okay?

357
00:28:03,326 --> 00:28:04,966
It's really tasty.

358
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:07,526
Here. This is tasty too.

359
00:28:15,086 --> 00:28:17,126
More importantly, this Zhou Caina

360
00:28:17,686 --> 00:28:19,166
seems to be the most likely to win.

361
00:28:19,326 --> 00:28:20,646
I read about her.

362
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:24,446
She's smart, pretty, and elegant.

363
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:27,086
I wonder if she has a boyfriend.

364
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:28,966
Just wait and see.

365
00:28:29,926 --> 00:28:32,606
I don't care if she's Caina, Lina, Xiena,

366
00:28:33,206 --> 00:28:34,846
or even Madonna.

367
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,566
Shancai's cooking skills

368
00:28:38,206 --> 00:28:40,206
will not disappoint you guys.

369
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,726
Let's hope the judges
will be able to see her true talent

370
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,766
and appreciate her for being different.

371
00:28:47,486 --> 00:28:48,846
Who said she's different?

372
00:28:50,246 --> 00:28:51,126
Bye.

373
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:55,366
<i>The competition is starting soon.</i>

374
00:28:56,206 --> 00:28:57,846
I don't know if Shancai has a chance.

375
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:02,206
Honestly, Chinese cuisine
is deep and profound.

376
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:06,326
It's not something she can master
in a short time.

377
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:11,326
<i>But I think her basic skills
are very solid indeed.</i>

378
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:15,446
<i>Shancai's dishes are very natural</i>

379
00:29:15,526 --> 00:29:17,166
<i>and they're free
from excessive processing,</i>

380
00:29:17,246 --> 00:29:18,726
<i>which is a lot like her personality.</i>

381
00:29:19,806 --> 00:29:23,926
Maybe during the competition,
she'll be able to find her niche.

382
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:32,126
<i>"Like a gem cut and filed,
carved and polished."</i>

383
00:29:38,566 --> 00:29:41,086
<i>"As if at the brink of a deep abyss,
as if treading on thin ice."</i>

384
00:29:43,886 --> 00:29:46,846
<i>"The peach tree is young and elegant;
brilliant are its flowers."</i>

385
00:29:58,846 --> 00:30:01,766
<i>"Blue-collared lad,
you’ve long been in my heart."</i>

386
00:30:10,966 --> 00:30:13,406
QINGHE HAS SENT YOU A QQ MESSAGE

387
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:16,126
<i>Shancai, what are you doing after class?</i>

388
00:30:16,886 --> 00:30:19,006
<i>I need to practice cooking.</i>

389
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:28,086
Done.

390
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,126
"The Swallow Returns
from Familiar Days," version two.

391
00:30:34,926 --> 00:30:36,166
Please enjoy.

392
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,686
What's this dish called?

393
00:30:39,646 --> 00:30:41,086
"The Return of the Double Swallows."

394
00:30:45,006 --> 00:30:46,846
There's only one chicken. Why double?

395
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:49,206
Ms. Zhuang, you'll know once you try it.

396
00:31:06,646 --> 00:31:07,886
This chicken...

397
00:31:10,606 --> 00:31:12,526
It's magnificent.

398
00:31:13,646 --> 00:31:16,926
One side tastes sweet and sour,
one side has the fragrance of oranges.

399
00:31:18,806 --> 00:31:20,286
It's too special!

400
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:23,166
Shancai,

401
00:31:23,926 --> 00:31:26,726
how did you come up with this idea?

402
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:30,246
My mom's signature dish
is sweet and sour pork ribs.

403
00:31:30,726 --> 00:31:32,966
I dedicate this dish to her.

404
00:31:33,486 --> 00:31:36,326
There's a lot of vitamin C in oranges.

405
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:37,926
They're healthy and nutritious.

406
00:31:38,086 --> 00:31:41,486
I want to share this dish with everyone
to help people eat healthier.

407
00:31:42,206 --> 00:31:43,926
Shancai, you're very smart.

408
00:31:44,566 --> 00:31:46,846
After using the orange juice,
you didn't throw them out.

409
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,046
You used them as decorations.

410
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:51,646
I really think you can go
to the competition now.

411
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:55,726
<i>Shancai, are you busy?</i>

412
00:31:57,006 --> 00:32:00,006
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said that yesterday.

413
00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:06,726
I know deep down that I'm not good enough.

414
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:10,966
So I never thought that
I would be able to enter the competition.

415
00:32:12,046 --> 00:32:13,966
But, I want to seize this opportunity.

416
00:32:15,086 --> 00:32:18,726
I don't want to let down
the people who helped me along the way.

417
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:22,446
Is one of them Daoming Si?

418
00:32:23,966 --> 00:32:25,446
He's one of them.

419
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:28,286
I never would've guessed.

420
00:32:29,246 --> 00:32:31,326
I thought you didn't like him.

421
00:32:33,486 --> 00:32:34,606
I don't know.

422
00:32:35,846 --> 00:32:38,726
In the beginning, I really hated him.

423
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:41,526
Sometimes I still want to punch him.

424
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:46,246
But, he's always been by my side

425
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,246
in a very peculiar way

426
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:52,806
and I couldn't help but notice him.

427
00:32:54,446 --> 00:32:56,526
When I want to run away,

428
00:32:57,406 --> 00:33:00,406
one look at him gives me courage.

429
00:33:03,206 --> 00:33:06,646
I don't know how this happened.

430
00:33:08,526 --> 00:33:09,406
Shancai,

431
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:13,646
you can probably tell
that I like you, right?

432
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:19,046
I think we'd be great together

433
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:23,006
if Si didn't exist in this world.

434
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:27,526
I hate to admit that

435
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:30,286
I lost to a guy like that.

436
00:33:33,086 --> 00:33:33,926
Tian Ye,

437
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:35,926
I wish you all the best.

438
00:33:36,726 --> 00:33:40,126
In the future, you'll become a great chef.

439
00:33:40,806 --> 00:33:43,646
You'll own a fantastic restaurant

440
00:33:43,806 --> 00:33:46,006
and meet a wonderful woman.

441
00:33:46,086 --> 00:33:48,846
For real. Because you're
a wonderful person, too.

442
00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:51,806
Thank you.

443
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:56,126
Shancai,

444
00:33:57,366 --> 00:33:58,606
I hope you'll find happiness.

445
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,886
All right, I have to go now.

446
00:34:03,686 --> 00:34:05,806
Shancai, you can stay here.

447
00:34:06,966 --> 00:34:08,526
Leave after I'm out the door.

448
00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:11,926
Because I don't have money for the bill.

449
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:15,406
Just kidding.

450
00:34:16,006 --> 00:34:18,046
I just don't want to watch you leave.

451
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:22,126
Bye.

452
00:34:38,366 --> 00:34:39,246
<i>What?</i>

453
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:42,686
You're competing in
Chinese Cuisine Culinary Competition?

454
00:34:43,646 --> 00:34:46,486
No wonder you've been so busy lately.

455
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:48,646
Shancai, that's awesome!

456
00:34:48,726 --> 00:34:50,526
Who's your teacher?
The restaurant you work at?

457
00:34:51,086 --> 00:34:53,006
No, it's Daoming Si's sister.

458
00:34:53,086 --> 00:34:54,766
She and her chef have been teaching me.

459
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:55,966
That's great.

460
00:34:56,526 --> 00:34:57,766
She seems to be very nice.

461
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:58,846
How kind of them.

462
00:35:00,406 --> 00:35:02,206
Next time, invite her to our house.

463
00:35:02,286 --> 00:35:03,926
Your mom will cook them some food.

464
00:35:04,966 --> 00:35:06,086
I can't do that.

465
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,886
They're professionals.

466
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:09,446
My food could never satisfy them.

467
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:10,486
That's not true.

468
00:35:11,566 --> 00:35:12,966
My mom's cooking

469
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:14,966
-is the best in the world.
-That's right.

470
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,366
My wife's cooking
is healthy and delicious.

471
00:35:17,446 --> 00:35:18,726
-Really?
-Yes.

472
00:35:18,966 --> 00:35:21,926
All right, Shancai,
do your best at the competition today.

473
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:23,966
Dad and I will watch it on the TV.

474
00:35:24,046 --> 00:35:25,086
-All right?
-Okay.

475
00:35:26,446 --> 00:35:27,846
-Go!
-Go!

476
00:35:32,326 --> 00:35:34,646

00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:16,886
<i>I'm...</i>

507
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:19,206
<i>Hi, I'm Dong Shancai.</i>

508
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,486
-It's Shancai.
-Shancai!

509
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:25,686
-Shancai!
-Shancai!

510
00:37:25,766 --> 00:37:27,286
-We're here. Shancai!
-Shancai!

511
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:28,406
Go, Shancai!

512
00:37:28,486 --> 00:37:29,366
Shancai!

513
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:30,406
What are you doing?

514
00:37:30,486 --> 00:37:31,606
-Go!
-Go!

515
00:37:33,206 --> 00:37:34,886
-What are you doing?
-Look.

516
00:37:36,766 --> 00:37:38,246
<i>Mom, Dad, I'm on TV!</i>

517
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:39,766
Shancai!

518
00:37:39,846 --> 00:37:40,886
Hey, look!

519
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:43,726
-It's our daughter!
<i>-Shancai said she's on TV.</i>

520
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:44,926
<i>What a cute girl.</i>

521
00:37:45,006 --> 00:37:47,686
<i>Now, we'll hand it over
to today's host for the competition.</i>

522
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:50,606
We've introduced all our contestants.

523
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:54,206
I'm sure our viewers have a good idea
of who all our chefs are.

524
00:37:54,286 --> 00:37:56,286
Going into commercials now

525
00:37:56,406 --> 00:37:59,126
and then we'll see who gets a head start.

526
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:10,406
That Dong Shancai is so funny.

527
00:38:10,486 --> 00:38:11,686
She's such a dork.

528
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:15,926
In my opinion, the organizers
wanted someone funnier

529
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:17,646
so the audience would feel entertained.

530
00:38:27,526 --> 00:38:29,406
Hello, I'm Zhou Caina.

531
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:31,606
Hello.

532
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:33,246
I know about you. You're famous.

533
00:38:33,406 --> 00:38:34,686
I'm Dong Shancai.

534
00:38:34,926 --> 00:38:35,966
I know you too.

535
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:37,886
-You're famous too.
-Me?

536
00:38:38,126 --> 00:38:38,966
That's impossible.

537
00:38:39,566 --> 00:38:41,326
We have a mutual friend, don't we?

538
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,366
I've heard Tian Ye say
that you're very special.

539
00:38:44,086 --> 00:38:45,566
No, that's not true.

540
00:38:45,646 --> 00:38:47,206
It's all right. Good luck.

541
00:38:48,006 --> 00:38:49,686
Don't get eliminated in the first round.

542
00:38:50,726 --> 00:38:54,206
Compared to those showoffs,
I like opponents like you more.

543
00:39:05,486 --> 00:39:06,926
What the hell?

544
00:39:07,006 --> 00:39:08,526
There are so many commercials.

545
00:39:09,926 --> 00:39:12,086
Si, the official competition
hasn't started yet.

546
00:39:12,206 --> 00:39:13,286
Just be patient.

547
00:39:14,566 --> 00:39:16,006
It's been forever.

548
00:39:16,206 --> 00:39:17,606
It's been like one hour, right?

549
00:39:18,206 --> 00:39:21,126
It's only been five minutes, okay?

550
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:24,886
He's in love. Days feel like years to him.

551
00:39:27,126 --> 00:39:30,526
That Caina looks even better in person.

552
00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:33,126
You're watching someone else?

553
00:39:33,886 --> 00:39:34,926
Si's going to beat you up.

554
00:39:38,006 --> 00:39:39,206
I now announce

555
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:42,806
that the sixth Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition starts now.

556
00:39:42,926 --> 00:39:44,686
CHINESE CUISINE COOKING COMPETITION

557
00:39:45,366 --> 00:39:48,366
<i>The first round of this competition
is stir-frying and slow stewing.</i>

558
00:39:48,446 --> 00:39:50,486
<i>The contestants can pick
any ingredients they need</i>

559
00:39:50,606 --> 00:39:53,766
<i>and complete their dishes
within two hours.</i>

560
00:39:53,966 --> 00:39:56,006
<i>Four contestants will be
eliminated in this round.</i>

561
00:39:57,206 --> 00:39:59,926
<i>We can see that our contestants
have chosen their ingredients.</i>

562
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:02,126
<i>They will have to work fast.</i>

563
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:07,926
<i>The main criteria for cutting
is to cut cleanly and precisely.</i>

564
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:12,246
<i>This can help the ingredients
suit the method of cooking.</i>

565
00:40:12,406 --> 00:40:15,446
<i>The ingredients should be
of the same thickness and length.</i>

566
00:40:15,926 --> 00:40:18,886
<i>This will ensure that the ingredients
will be cooked thoroughly</i>

567
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:20,086
<i>at the same time.</i>

568
00:40:21,126 --> 00:40:22,566
<i>It seems like our contestants</i>

569
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:25,886
<i>have all decided to start
with the stewing part.</i>

570
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:28,886
<i>Zhou Caina is making a duck dish.</i>

571
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,086
<i>The duck is placed downwards in the pot.</i>

572
00:40:31,566 --> 00:40:34,526
<i>Jinhua ham is used to give it flavor.
This should be a very healthy duck soup</i>

573
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,166
<i>with handmade fish balls.</i>

574
00:40:37,406 --> 00:40:42,046
<i>Dong Shancai is now
frying the meatballs she just made.</i>

575
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:44,966
<i>She's probably making braised pork balls.</i>

576
00:40:46,326 --> 00:40:48,726
Shancai's making my signature dish!

577
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:52,166
When did you ever make that?

578
00:40:53,846 --> 00:40:54,766
Once or twice.

579
00:40:58,806 --> 00:41:02,006
<i>The contestants are putting their pots
on the stove to stew.</i>

580
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:04,406
<i>They need to constantly check
the heat and be patient.</i>

581
00:41:04,606 --> 00:41:06,446
<i>The first round has a two-hour time limit.</i>

582
00:41:06,526 --> 00:41:08,886
<i>They have only 15 minutes left.</i>

583
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:09,806
Excuse me.

584
00:41:09,886 --> 00:41:12,206
<i>Dong Shancai has finally moved
her pot to the stove.</i>

585
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:14,606
<i>Will her dish be done
within the time limit?</i>

586
00:41:16,246 --> 00:41:17,246
Excuse me.

587
00:41:22,086 --> 00:41:23,046
Thank you.

588
00:41:27,846 --> 00:41:30,446
I'm telling you, Shancai is only
using 50 percent of her skills now.

589
00:41:31,446 --> 00:41:33,646
-Wait and see.
-What about Zhou Caina?

590
00:41:34,886 --> 00:41:36,446
She's going to get eliminated for sure.

591
00:41:38,366 --> 00:41:40,606
<i>While waiting for the pot to heat up,</i>

592
00:41:40,686 --> 00:41:43,886
<i>the contestants are now
starting to make their stir-fry dish.</i>

593
00:41:44,446 --> 00:41:46,846
<i>Stir-frying is an important skill
in Chinese cuisine.</i>

594
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,206
<i>It is essential to control the heat,
mix the ingredients,</i>

595
00:41:49,326 --> 00:41:51,446
<i>and add everything in the right sequence.</i>

596
00:41:51,526 --> 00:41:54,446
<i>This affects the taste of the dish
and shows the contestant's skills.</i>

597
00:41:58,486 --> 00:42:00,646
<i>We can see Dong Shancai's ingredients.</i>

598
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:03,686
<i>She's going to make crystal prawn balls,
a Shanghai cuisine.</i>

599
00:42:04,006 --> 00:42:08,126
<i>On the other side,
Zhou Caina is placing crab into the wok.</i>

600
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:11,806
<i>She's making a Cantonese dish,
fried crab with chili.</i>

601
00:42:12,326 --> 00:42:15,406
<i>Fried crab with chili may seem simple,
but it's hard to get right.</i>

602
00:42:16,486 --> 00:42:18,766
Zhou Caina is really something.

603
00:42:27,486 --> 00:42:30,246
Shancai's crystal prawn balls
look so good!

604
00:42:30,686 --> 00:42:32,486
I'm starting to drool.

605
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:46,326
<i>Who will be able to advance
to the next round?</i>

606
00:42:46,406 --> 00:42:47,806
<i>We are about to find out.</i>

607
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:53,454
