EPISODE 12

4
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,126
Si, how are you doing in London?

5
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:36,006
<i>I'm bored to death here.</i>

6
00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:37,926
How is that possible?

7
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:40,326
There must be
a lot of pretty girls over there.

8
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:43,966
I don't see any.

9
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:47,086
Oh, please. How can you live abroad
with that kind of negative attitude?

10
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:49,966
Why don't you just come back here?

11
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:52,086
We also lack one member for Bridge.

12
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,886
Now you realize how important I am, right?

13
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:56,926
You've always been important.

14
00:01:57,726 --> 00:01:58,566
Please.

15
00:01:58,646 --> 00:02:00,526
We haven't found any place
with bigger space

16
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:01,846
and privacy than your house.

17
00:02:02,526 --> 00:02:05,206
Hey, you guys are so sensible.

18
00:02:05,486 --> 00:02:07,966
<i>Daoming Si, that's your only role.</i>

19
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:11,806
Cut the nonsense. Where's Lei?

20
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:13,886
Lei, Si is looking for you.

21
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:16,446
What's up?

22
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:17,686
What do you mean, what's up?

23
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,846
Tell me clearly.

24
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:20,566
Why am I the one whom Shancai likes?

25
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:22,166
Can't you figure it out yourself?

26
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,806
<i>If I can do that on my own,
why do I need to ask you?</i>

27
00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:28,006
Then come back and find out for yourself.

28
00:02:31,606 --> 00:02:32,686
Have you seen her lately?

29
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:34,446
How is she?

30
00:02:36,246 --> 00:02:37,206
I haven't seen her much.

31
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:38,846
When I see Qinghe,

32
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:41,766
he said that when Shancai is not
in school, she's at her part-time job.

33
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,206
You still remember?

34
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,646
Have you forgotten who I am?

35
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:54,286
-I see Shancai now.
-Where? Now? Let me see her.

36
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:11,086
SHEN NONG VILLAGE, PLANTS

37
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,006
Grandma.

38
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:15,646
This is the list of herbs I want to buy.
Thank you.

39
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:17,566
Oh, sure. Let me see it.

40
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:24,206
ID CARD, DONG SHANCAI

41
00:03:25,846 --> 00:03:27,846
-"Shenwei leaf."
-Grandma.

42
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:29,526
What's up with this ID card?

43
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:33,726
That day, a young girl left her ID card
here because she didn't have enough money

44
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:35,086
to pay for the Shenwei leaf.

45
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:37,046
-Do you know her?
-She's our kitchen assistant.

46
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:42,406
So you're her friend who participated
in the chef qualification exam.

47
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:43,446
Yes.

48
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:47,526
In order to save your Shenwei leaf,
she even got into an accident.

49
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:58,046
Tian Ye, why are you still here?

50
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:00,086
This is yours.

51
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,086
ID CARD, DONG SHANCAI

52
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:03,806
Why is it with you?

53
00:04:05,606 --> 00:04:06,806
Why are you so careless?

54
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:08,886
Even if you were anxious
to get me the Shenwei leaf,

55
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:10,086
you must be careful too.

56
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:13,246
If I knew that would happen,
I'd have just taken the exam next year.

57
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:14,366
It's fine.

58
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:15,726
It didn't hurt at all.

59
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,006
All right.

60
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:19,686
Actually, it's all my fault.

61
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,646
I was the one who ruined the ingredients.
And I even scolded you.

62
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:24,406
But Shancai,

63
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:26,326
I really want to thank you.

64
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:29,166
Let me buy you dinner.

65
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:31,126
Sure.

66
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:34,246
Congratulations on becoming a chef!

67
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:35,566
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

68
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:43,366
Why do you look happier than me?

69
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:45,206
Of course I'm happy.

70
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:49,526
Your parents must even be happier
to have such a talented son like you.

71
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:52,766
My mom passed away when I was very young.

72
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:57,406
My dad actually doesn't want me
to become a chef.

73
00:04:57,846 --> 00:04:58,726
Why?

74
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:02,006
I know he has his reasons.

75
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:04,366
However,

76
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:08,846
I won't easily give up
on something I really like to do.

77
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:12,766
Yes, I would do the same if I were you.

78
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:15,846
What kind of life do you want to live?

79
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,926
I want to live a simple life.

80
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:23,926
Then have my own dream.

81
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,286
And work hard
to make the people around me happy.

82
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:32,046
-Shancai.
-Yes?

83
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,966
I think we're so alike.
And we have a pre-destined connection.

84
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:37,486
Are we so alike?

85
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:38,846
Yes.

86
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:43,646
You mean we're both very frugal
and work very hard, right?

87
00:05:45,326 --> 00:05:47,726
We're both fighting for survival.

88
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:50,326
I really hope I can be as brave as you.

89
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:52,846
You? You can definitely do it.

90
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:07,086
All right. My house
is just straight ahead.

91
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:09,486
Let me walk you there.

92
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:12,646
There's no need. I'll just go by myself.

93
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:14,326
Then...

94
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:16,526
Shancai.

95
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,686
No matter what happens in the future,

96
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:22,766
I hope that you can be beside me
whenever I'm cooking.

97
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,526
I'm your kitchen assistant, right?

98
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,006
Don't worry.

99
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:29,926
I won't just quit
and work in another place.

100
00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:31,846
That's not what I meant.

101
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:33,846
-I mean--
-What he means

102
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:40,206
is that he wants you
to become his girlfriend,

103
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,686
and not a poor kitchen assistant.

104
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:45,846
Daoming Si?

105
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:48,766
What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be in London?

106
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,326
Because I went to London,
you went on a date with this liar?

107
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:01,006
What are you talking about? What liar?

108
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:02,926
He's been deceiving you
from the very start.

109
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:05,566
Why is Tian's Chinese Medicine's successor

110
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:08,326
pretending to be poor
and doing a part-time job?

111
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:12,206
How is that possible?

112
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:15,486
He obviously lied to you.

113
00:07:16,246 --> 00:07:17,686
You can't even be honest with her,

114
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:19,766
yet you want her to become
your girlfriend?

115
00:07:20,886 --> 00:07:22,086
Maybe you've misunderstood.

116
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:25,526
I didn't misunderstand anything.
You were deceived.

117
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:31,686
TIAN'S CHINESE MEDICINE SUCCESSOR
TIAN YE TO INHERIT FAMILY BUSINESS

118
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:38,326
Tian Ye,

119
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,846
is that really you?

120
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:44,246
Shancai. Listen to me.

121
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:45,526
You're rich,

122
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:47,766
yet you told me

123
00:07:48,486 --> 00:07:51,086
that we're both fighting for survival.

124
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:53,646
Do you take me for a fool?

125
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:55,286
No, Shancai.

126
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:57,526
I meant that I need to fight my family.

127
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:04,886
I really respect you as my colleague.

128
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:07,206
Actually,

129
00:08:09,126 --> 00:08:12,886
it doesn't matter
whether you tell me the truth or not.

130
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:15,806
I just feel

131
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:19,206
that you didn't treat me as a real friend.

132
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:21,046
No, Shancai.

133
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,166
-Let me explain--
-Hey.

134
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:23,886
You're so full of it.

135
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:25,286
Shancai.

136
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:27,166
Are you stuttering?

137
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:31,206
I'll go first.

138
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:54,606
You're a stupid girl. If I'm not here,
you'd be easily tricked by guys.

139
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:57,646
-How can you believe someone so easily?
-I was born this way.

140
00:08:57,726 --> 00:08:59,646
-So what?
-That's why I said you're stupid.

141
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,046
I'm stupid?

142
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,846
Don't feel too good about yourself.
Do you think you're that smart?

143
00:09:04,526 --> 00:09:07,526
If I wasn't there earlier,
you could've been tricked by that guy.

144
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:10,766
Fine. Even if that happens,
it has nothing to do with you.

145
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:13,086
-Can you just mind your own business?
-No.

146
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,486
Now it has nothing to do with me?

147
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:16,486
Why does it matter?

148
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:19,006
Didn't you go to London
and never plan to come back?

149
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,166
Why are you here now?

150
00:09:21,486 --> 00:09:22,446
I...

151
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:26,206
I miss my country, my friends,
my hometown. Am I not allowed to be here?

152
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:29,886
Daoming Si, you're here.

153
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:32,366
Shancai and I missed you.

154
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,006
Who missed him?

155
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,646
Why are you here?

156
00:09:40,486 --> 00:09:42,406
Didn't you open the door for me
to come inside?

157
00:09:42,486 --> 00:09:45,326
-I--
-Hey. Where are your manners?

158
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:47,886
Daoming Si can come here if he wants to.

159
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:49,966
Daoming Si, welcome.

160
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:51,926
It has been a while.

161
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:53,246
Hi, ma'am.

162
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:58,646
Why do you look so pale? Are you sick?

163
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:01,406
I just came back from London.
I still have jet lag.

164
00:10:01,486 --> 00:10:02,566
London?

165
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:05,326
That's so far.
You must not be feeling well.

166
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:06,886
Come here and have a seat first.

167
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:07,806
Have a seat.

168
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:09,606
Sit down and rest here for a while.

169
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:13,046
You rude girl.
Why are you just standing there?

170
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:15,846
Get him some water.
Can you get some fruit for him?

171
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:19,566
I'll get some tiger balm for you.
Sit and rest here first, okay?

172
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,046
So you were abroad.

173
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:31,166
That makes me feel better.

174
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:33,446
I thought you had a fight with Shancai.

175
00:10:34,286 --> 00:10:35,486
Are you two all right?

176
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:37,526
Mom, what are you saying?

177
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:41,966
Fine. I won't keep asking you.
I'll just talk about something else.

178
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:46,566
Daoming Si,
what do you want to specialize in?

179
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:50,166
Dear, why are you asking him that?

180
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:52,246
Can't I ask about that?

181
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:54,606
He's rarely here.

182
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,606
What did you do in London?

183
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,966
-Strolling around.
-Strolling around?

184
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,206
-Where did you go for a stroll?
-At home.

185
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:04,966
At home...

186
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:11,646
Dear, it's really late.

187
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:14,446
Daoming Si has been yawning
all this while.

188
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:16,726
Maybe he wants to rest now.

189
00:11:17,406 --> 00:11:19,646
Are you sleepy?
Do you want to rest already?

190
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,126
I wish there's a bed
I can lie down on right now.

191
00:11:22,206 --> 00:11:24,406
Then just spend the night here.

192
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:25,446
Okay.

193
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:26,606
You...

194
00:11:36,606 --> 00:11:37,446
Hey.

195
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:41,366
Get lost! Your bed is over there.

196
00:11:42,726 --> 00:11:43,566
Get over there.

197
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:48,686
You're so strange.

198
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:52,766
-Why are you sleeping in my room?
-Because you have to take care of me.

199
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,006
-I--
-What if I feel thirsty

200
00:11:54,086 --> 00:11:55,286
in the middle of the night?

201
00:11:55,486 --> 00:11:57,126
I'm not your maid.

202
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:04,446
Why are you laughing?

203
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:06,326
Your dad's legs are so short.

204
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,686
Just pretend it's a pair of capri pants.

205
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:12,846
What else can I do? My handsome self
just needs to deal with it.

206
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:28,126
I think the person
Shancai really likes is you.

207
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,166
-Hey, Shancai.
-Hey.

208
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:38,286
What are you doing?
My parents are just in the next room.

209
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:40,366
Don't think of doing anything.

210
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:41,446
Oh, please.

211
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:43,966
You should refrain
from doing anything to me.

212
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:45,886
Hey.

213
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:49,606
If I didn't come back, can you imagine
how Tian Ye would have tricked you?

214
00:12:52,086 --> 00:12:54,646
Did you come back
just to expose Tian Ye's lie?

215
00:12:55,686 --> 00:12:58,006
Of course not. I have better things to do.

216
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:00,646
Did you go on a date today?

217
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:04,566
Why are you even nosier than my mom?

218
00:13:05,206 --> 00:13:06,366
Did you two hold hands?

219
00:13:07,526 --> 00:13:08,766
Or kiss?

220
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:11,166
No.

221
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:16,926
Is that true?

222
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:19,246
Never mind if you don't believe me.

223
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:33,846
How have you been for these past few days?

224
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:37,766
What did you think
about me not being here?

225
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:41,686
What do you mean?

226
00:13:42,686 --> 00:13:44,246
Did you feel more carefree

227
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:46,646
or a bit sad?

228
00:14:07,486 --> 00:14:08,326
Never mind.

229
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:10,046
I don't care what you think.

230
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,006
I'm going to sleep.

231
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:27,046
Good night.

232
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:57,846
Hey! Why didn't you knock?

233
00:15:58,046 --> 00:15:59,766
-Sorry.
-Why aren't you dressed?

234
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,406
My clothes are dirty.

235
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:04,926
I'll ask my dad to give you
something to wear.

236
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:08,326
Never mind. I don't think I can carry
the uncle-style clothes your dad wears.

237
00:16:09,526 --> 00:16:12,206
But you can't go out
without your shirt on.

238
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:15,006
Why not?

239
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:17,726
My perfect abs cannot be seen
just by anyone.

240
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:19,886
You don't have abs.

241
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:20,846
Hey.

242
00:16:20,926 --> 00:16:22,366
Come here. Look clearly.

243
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:23,806
-Aren't these abs?
-You--

244
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:28,446
Sorry to bother the two of you.

245
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:30,646
It's so nice to be young.

246
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:43,046
Get out!

247
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:46,606
Close the door!

248
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,406
Isn't that Daoming Si?

249
00:16:57,966 --> 00:16:58,806
It's really him.

250
00:16:58,886 --> 00:16:59,926
-You...
-He isn't in London?

251
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:04,086
Weren't you in London?

252
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,726
I only asked for a few days leave.
Should I report that to you?

253
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:10,886
Also, I was afraid this stupid girl
couldn't live without me. So I came back.

254
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:12,526
Who couldn't live without you?

255
00:17:15,886 --> 00:17:16,846
Last night,

256
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:18,726
-I slept together with Shancai.
-What?

257
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:20,126
You slept together with Shancai?

258
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,886
No. Yesterday, my mom wanted him
to stay over at my house.

259
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:25,886
Your mom already agreed?

260
00:17:26,926 --> 00:17:29,046
Aren't you going too fast?

261
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:32,846
Li Zhen, let's go.

262
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:43,286
-Zao Yue.
-Present.

263
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:45,606
-Liu Bozhen.
-Present.

264
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:48,206
-Jin Jinqiao.
-Present.

265
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:50,766
-Zhang Chi.
-Present.

266
00:17:51,686 --> 00:17:52,566
Chen Qinghe.

267
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,326
-Qinghe.
-Isn't Chen Qinghe present?

268
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:56,246
Qinghe.

269
00:17:56,846 --> 00:17:57,806
-Yang Yang.
-Present.

270
00:17:57,886 --> 00:17:59,766
-Hey, your name is being called.
-Li Zhen.

271
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:00,846
-Present.
-Present.

272
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:05,526
-Zao Bowen.
-Present.

273
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,846
-Huang Mongtian.
-Present.

274
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:10,126
-Zhang Yawen.
-Present.

275
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:34,166
Hello, Ximen? Where did you three go?

276
00:18:34,726 --> 00:18:36,366
<i>Si, we came to London to see you.</i>

277
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:38,246
<i>We just landed. Where are you?</i>

278
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:41,526
What? I came back to Shanghai.
Come back here.

279
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:45,126
<i>We can't. Because of you,
we enrolled in a school in London.</i>

280
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:48,206
<i>-We already paid the tuition fees.</i>
-I don't care. Come back here.

281
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:49,286
<i>No.</i>

282
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:52,366
<i>Lei said that he's not coming back anymore
if you're not talking to him.</i>

283
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:55,526
Who says I'm not talking to him?
I have a lot of things to tell him.

284
00:18:55,606 --> 00:18:56,566
Ask Lei to come back.

285
00:18:57,726 --> 00:18:58,846
What do you want to tell me?

286
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:08,406
So it's a prank?

287
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:18,966
So what do you want to tell me?

288
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:24,406
Lei.

289
00:19:24,806 --> 00:19:26,246
What happened before...

290
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:28,766
Which one?

291
00:19:30,406 --> 00:19:31,526
Regarding the Spiderman.

292
00:19:32,646 --> 00:19:33,726
I don't mind.

293
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:38,806
However, I think you still owe me
an official apology.

294
00:19:41,726 --> 00:19:43,726
Si, you're my good friend.

295
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:46,806
But you should really
apologize to Lei for that.

296
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:50,686
I want to film this historic moment
where Daoming Si apologizes.

297
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:52,246
Go away.

298
00:19:59,726 --> 00:20:00,566
Lei.

299
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:03,566
Regarding Spiderman

300
00:20:04,366 --> 00:20:06,006
and me forcing you to go away,

301
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:08,286
they're all my fault.

302
00:20:09,286 --> 00:20:10,606
I'm officially apologizing to you.

303
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:16,366
-He's bowing.
-What are you doing?

304
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:18,006
I'm not dead yet.

305
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:27,646
This moment is so precious.

306
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:30,566
I want to post this.

307
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,046
-It'd surely be a hit.
-Definitely.

308
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:33,286
Hey, don't you dare.

309
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,566
Stand properly.

310
00:20:36,046 --> 00:20:38,046
I want to officially apologize to you.

311
00:20:38,286 --> 00:20:40,086
-Okay.
-Hey, don't go too far.

312
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:42,126
I'm telling you. Don't go there.

313
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:44,366
-Come on. Delete all of it.
-I don't want to.

314
00:20:58,046 --> 00:20:59,686
Qinghe, what's wrong with you?

315
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:01,766
You haven't been paying attention
at all today.

316
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:05,126
How is Daoming Si better than me?

317
00:21:06,006 --> 00:21:08,726
Originally, Shancai's parents said
she and I were made for each other.

318
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:12,206
We're like a nutritious
and delicious dish combined together.

319
00:21:12,886 --> 00:21:15,366
Why did they choose
a different son-in-law?

320
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:18,166
I feel like a battery pack
without any juice.

321
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:20,246
A balloon with a hole.

322
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,366
A dried up cactus.

323
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:25,646
My world is full of darkness.

324
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:28,246
I'm dying.

325
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:30,126
Do you know how Daoming Si
is better than you?

326
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,806
He doesn't act like he's dying like you.

327
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,166
You're right.

328
00:21:39,086 --> 00:21:40,966
I can't let Daoming Si see me like this.

329
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:43,806
Shancai isn't married yet.

330
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:45,446
I still have a chance.

331
00:21:52,286 --> 00:21:54,206
I especially liked
Professor Tian's class today.

332
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:56,006
Meizuo, how about you?

333
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:59,526
Are you talking about the topic
"the most irresponsible company

334
00:21:59,606 --> 00:22:01,006
treats its employees leniently"?

335
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,526
Yes. I think he really
made a lot of sense.

336
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:08,006
If a company wants to improve,
it must be strict with its employees.

337
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,646
I think it depends on the situation.

338
00:22:10,726 --> 00:22:14,046
As long as they have a common goal,
the employee can work hard to achieve it.

339
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:16,326
Lei, what do you think?

340
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:17,606
Me?

341
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:20,126
I think it's creativity.

342
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:22,206
Only creativity is irreplaceable.

343
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:26,326
-Si, what about you?
-Me?

344
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:27,686
Determination.

345
00:22:28,086 --> 00:22:30,846
Regardless of what anyone says.
Once you're determined to do something,

346
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:33,766
you have to stick with it
no matter what happens.

347
00:22:33,846 --> 00:22:35,886
You're talking about your feelings, right?

348
00:22:37,246 --> 00:22:38,086
It's the same thing.

349
00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:42,926
Oh, no! It's my sister.
My sister is calling me! Quick!

350
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:45,166
-Let me do it. I like Ms. Zhuang.
-Help me.

351
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:47,246
Hi, Ms. Zhuang.

352
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:49,046
<i>Ask my brother to talk to me.</i>

353
00:22:51,526 --> 00:22:53,006
He says he's not here.

354
00:22:57,206 --> 00:23:00,326
<i>Stop it. I know he's right beside you.
Ask him to talk to me.</i>

355
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,566
No. He's really not here.

356
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:05,046
Do you want to leave any message?

357
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:07,486
You can talk to me first, or Lei,

358
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:09,766
-Hi.
-or Ximen.

359
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:11,126
Hello, Ms. Zhuang.

360
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:14,366
<i>All right. You're not letting him
talk to me, right?</i>

361
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:15,766
Then I'll sing.

362
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:20,686
<i>The most beautiful woman in the world
Is named Daoming Zhuang</i>

363
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:24,846
-Si suddenly appeared.
-Hey.

364
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:28,446
-We'll get going first.
-<i>...narcissist</i>

365
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:31,446
-You can do it.
-<i>Ms. Zhuang</i>

366
00:23:33,886 --> 00:23:35,486
Hi.

367
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:37,566
<i>Are you tired of living?</i>

368
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:39,526
<i>Do you want me come and beat you up?</i>

369
00:23:39,846 --> 00:23:41,686
<i>You went back to Shanghai
without telling us.</i>

370
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:43,166
<i>Do you know how mad Mom is?</i>

371
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:44,566
All right.

372
00:23:45,286 --> 00:23:46,166
I'm sorry.

373
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,366
It's not a big deal.

374
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:51,046
-Why are you so mad?
-<i>Do you think I want to be mad?</i>

375
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:54,806
<i>I was worried about you.</i>

376
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:57,086
Worried?

377
00:23:57,286 --> 00:23:58,366
I'm not a kid anymore.

378
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:01,046
What's there to be worried about
even if I come home by myself?

379
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,006
And I need to go to my classes, right?

380
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:06,326
<i>All right. I have something to tell you.</i>

381
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:07,566
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

382
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,686
<i>Inhale deeply and exhale
three times first. Come on.</i>

383
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:13,086
Okay.

384
00:24:23,246 --> 00:24:25,446
<i>Mom will be back in Shanghai
for your birthday this year.</i>

385
00:24:26,126 --> 00:24:26,966
What?

386
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:28,846
<i>You know what I mean, right?</i>

387
00:24:29,486 --> 00:24:31,326
<i>What do you plan to do with Shancai?</i>

388
00:24:31,966 --> 00:24:33,846
<i>You should know
that Mom wouldn't like her.</i>

389
00:24:36,486 --> 00:24:39,126
Then tell me.
What type of girl does Mom like?

390
00:24:40,086 --> 00:24:42,526
<i>Somebody like Teng Tangjing or me.</i>

391
00:24:43,006 --> 00:24:44,126
Then what type is that?

392
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:48,126
<i>Elegant, classy, smart, talented.
Someone who shines when she's outdoors.</i>

393
00:24:48,206 --> 00:24:50,686
<i>Someone who's virtuous when she's indoors.
Someone well-mannered.</i>

394
00:24:52,286 --> 00:24:56,046
<i>Shouldn't you start thinking
about what you should do?</i>

395
00:25:07,086 --> 00:25:08,806
Si, what are you so busy with?

396
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,486
It's almost the end of the year.
Didn't we say we'll practice

397
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:15,566
for next year's
Asian Games Bridge Competition?

398
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:16,766
Wait. I'll be right there.

399
00:25:22,846 --> 00:25:23,686
What are you doing?

400
00:25:24,846 --> 00:25:27,086
I'm looking for something
for Shancai's makeover.

401
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,646
-Shancai's makeover?
-Why a makeover?

402
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:36,366
Because I want to turn her
into a girl that suits me.

403
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:40,566
Haven't you two always been a good match?

404
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:55,166
Shancai, it's time.

405
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:02,646
Let me do it.

406
00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:26,886
Shancai, I'm sorry.

407
00:26:28,246 --> 00:26:29,646
I know you're still mad.

408
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:32,646
But I really don't want to lie to you.

409
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:37,966
Tian's Chinese Medicine
is indeed my family's business.

410
00:26:39,446 --> 00:26:41,326
I didn't think that was important to you.

411
00:26:42,246 --> 00:26:43,166
Because I'm still me.

412
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:47,326
I didn't tell you before

413
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:50,406
because I didn't want to get
special treatment at work.

414
00:26:51,406 --> 00:26:54,446
I want to make friends
with people for who I am.

415
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:00,446
I overreacted.

416
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:03,846
Thank you for being honest with me.

417
00:27:07,086 --> 00:27:08,726
Then you're not mad anymore?

418
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:11,206
Yes.

419
00:27:26,566 --> 00:27:28,846
Dad, Mom, what happened?

420
00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:37,646
Mom, why are you crying?

421
00:27:38,486 --> 00:27:39,486
Ask your dad.

422
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:42,926
He did something wrong and he even
threw a fit when he got home.

423
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:46,966
Dad.

424
00:27:47,886 --> 00:27:48,806
What's the matter?

425
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,126
Your dad

426
00:27:55,326 --> 00:27:56,406
lost one million yuan.

427
00:27:58,006 --> 00:27:59,006
One million yuan?

428
00:28:01,206 --> 00:28:02,966
He earned some money with the investment.

429
00:28:03,806 --> 00:28:05,926
So he put in the company's money as well.

430
00:28:06,006 --> 00:28:07,646
He lost everything in the end.

431
00:28:07,726 --> 00:28:10,046
Now we have to return the money
to them immediately.

432
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:11,886
Dad.

433
00:28:12,846 --> 00:28:13,806
Is this true?

434
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:18,526
Say something.

435
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:23,926
Shancai.

436
00:28:26,486 --> 00:28:28,086
I was blinded by greed.

437
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,766
I shouldn't have been too greedy.
I wanted to get rich overnight.

438
00:28:33,566 --> 00:28:36,406
Dad, how can you do that?

439
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,166
Dear.

440
00:28:43,366 --> 00:28:44,206
I'm sorry.

441
00:28:46,446 --> 00:28:49,046
I just want to let you have a chance
to wear nicer clothes,

442
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:51,566
to live in a bigger house.

443
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:58,166
I did everything in order
to make you live a happier life.

444
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:01,246
Don't say anything anymore.

445
00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:05,246
Let's get divorced.

446
00:29:05,686 --> 00:29:06,606
Mom.

447
00:29:08,286 --> 00:29:09,566
Dong Danian.

448
00:29:10,366 --> 00:29:12,246
I'm really disappointed in you.

449
00:29:13,246 --> 00:29:14,966
You don't understand me at all.

450
00:29:18,286 --> 00:29:19,726
Even if you have money,

451
00:29:19,806 --> 00:29:22,846
I won't let you buy me a big house
or a nice car.

452
00:29:23,246 --> 00:29:24,886
I love you for who you are.

453
00:29:25,446 --> 00:29:28,766
Because you're kind and honest.
You have a sense of responsibility.

454
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:34,846
But today, just for a little profit,
you committed such a big mistake.

455
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,686
I want to get a divorce!

456
00:29:38,246 --> 00:29:41,006
Mom! Calm down!

457
00:29:44,446 --> 00:29:46,046
Dear, I didn't do it on purpose.

458
00:29:46,846 --> 00:29:47,686
I'm sorry.

459
00:29:54,366 --> 00:29:55,366
Shancai.

460
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:57,246
It's my fault.

461
00:29:58,206 --> 00:29:59,646
I'm sorry.

462
00:30:01,526 --> 00:30:02,526
Dear.

463
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:05,086
I'll do anything you want.

464
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:14,966
If you really want to get a divorce,

465
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,926
I'll grant you that.

466
00:30:19,006 --> 00:30:19,846
Dad!

467
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:28,686
Who wants to divorce you?

468
00:30:30,326 --> 00:30:33,286
Just promise me
you won't ever do it again.

469
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,446
I won't. I promise I won't do it anymore.

470
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,086
I know I was wrong. I won't do it again.

471
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:43,966
But what do we do now?

472
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:46,966
We have to return so much money
to the company.

473
00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:50,526
We might only have one or two
hundred thousand yuan altogether.

474
00:30:51,086 --> 00:30:53,486
What do we do?

475
00:30:55,206 --> 00:30:56,206
Don't worry.

476
00:30:56,766 --> 00:30:59,046
Let me think of something.
I'll think of something.

477
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:08,846
Daoming Si.

478
00:31:21,926 --> 00:31:22,806
What happened?

479
00:31:28,246 --> 00:31:29,646
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

480
00:31:29,726 --> 00:31:31,446
My husband is so embarrassing.

481
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:34,446
-I'm sorry about that.
-Mom, stop it.

482
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,606
Daoming Si, go home first.

483
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,606
We have a lot of things to settle.

484
00:31:46,526 --> 00:31:48,166
BANK OF COMMUNICATIONS

485
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:53,366
This card has one million yuan.
The password is six zeroes.

486
00:31:53,446 --> 00:31:54,526
You can use it first.

487
00:31:58,766 --> 00:31:59,806
What are you doing?

488
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:01,566
How can we use your money?

489
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:03,286
Dad, Mom.

490
00:32:03,846 --> 00:32:06,286
-We can't accept it.
-Why not?

491
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:09,726
I earned this money
from the stock market on my own.

492
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:12,086
Would it be a problem if I lend it to you?

493
00:32:12,206 --> 00:32:13,846
I don't want to take advantage of you.

494
00:32:14,406 --> 00:32:16,806
Use it first. Just pay me back later.

495
00:32:17,006 --> 00:32:20,206
What other options does your dad have?
He might go to jail for this, you know?

496
00:32:32,206 --> 00:32:33,286
Take it.

497
00:32:38,046 --> 00:32:39,686
Daoming Si, well...

498
00:32:42,006 --> 00:32:44,286
Thank you so much for helping us.

499
00:32:47,806 --> 00:32:49,406
How should I pay the money back to you?

500
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,166
Come to my house
after school tomorrow, okay?

501
00:32:52,606 --> 00:32:53,446
What?

502
00:32:54,126 --> 00:32:55,526
See you tomorrow. Bye.

503
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:59,046
Ma'am, sir, I'll take my leave.
Get a good rest tonight.

504
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:00,046
All right.

505
00:33:04,246 --> 00:33:05,206
Hey.

506
00:33:06,326 --> 00:33:07,326
Daoming Si!

507
00:33:11,126 --> 00:33:12,326
<i>What?</i>

508
00:33:12,966 --> 00:33:14,646
<i>What did he mean by that?</i>

509
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,566
Daoming Si.

510
00:33:46,646 --> 00:33:47,926
Thank you.

511
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:51,166
Even though I don't have
enough money to pay you back now,

512
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:54,646
but I'll think of something.
I'll earn money and pay it back to you.

513
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:57,646
I have an idea for you
to pay the money back sooner.

514
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:14,046
What do you want to do?

515
00:34:17,366 --> 00:34:18,366
Guess.

516
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:20,166
I'm warning you.

517
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,566
I rather eat slippers.

518
00:34:23,526 --> 00:34:24,606
There's a competition.

519
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:27,126
The winner can get one million yuan.

520
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:29,166
One million yuan?

521
00:34:30,686 --> 00:34:32,686
-How is that possible?
-What?

522
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:34,126
It's fine if you're not interested.

523
00:34:34,326 --> 00:34:36,286
Think of your own way
to pay the money back to me.

524
00:34:43,606 --> 00:34:44,446
Wait.

525
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,206
What kind of competition is it?
Let me see.

526
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:05,926
What kind of competition is it?

527
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:10,166
This one.

528
00:35:13,006 --> 00:35:14,926
Let me see it again.

529
00:35:15,006 --> 00:35:16,846
-You can't.
-I just want to look at it.

530
00:35:17,526 --> 00:35:18,446
Let me see it.

531
00:35:20,006 --> 00:35:22,446
"The Chinese Cuisine Cooking Contest

532
00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:25,846
integrates the essence of Chinese culture

533
00:35:26,206 --> 00:35:28,326
and creates a new attitude for food."

534
00:35:29,446 --> 00:35:30,726
It sounds really difficult.

535
00:35:32,446 --> 00:35:34,246
But it looks interesting.

536
00:35:35,206 --> 00:35:36,206
I can try it.

537
00:35:40,446 --> 00:35:42,086
Are you joining this contest?

538
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,406
You...

539
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,846
I can get the prize and learn
new things at the same time.

540
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:54,286
I'll try my best.

541
00:35:55,606 --> 00:35:57,326
That's the Dong Shancai I know.

542
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,006
Is there anything else?

543
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,806
If not, I'll get going.

544
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:05,286
Wait.

545
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:09,166
-What about the interest?
-What?

546
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:11,166
The interest?

547
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:13,966
You're ridiculous.
Of course there's interest fee.

548
00:36:17,326 --> 00:36:18,486
How much do you want?

549
00:36:30,526 --> 00:36:31,486
What do you want?

550
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,926
The interest is a kiss on my cheek.

551
00:36:44,526 --> 00:36:46,086
Are you a person of integrity or not?

552
00:37:12,246 --> 00:37:13,126
<i>What?</i>

553
00:37:13,206 --> 00:37:16,246
You want Shancai to join
the Chinese Cuisine Cooking Competition?

554
00:37:16,846 --> 00:37:19,006
-The competition sponsored by your mom?
-That's right.

555
00:37:19,966 --> 00:37:22,606
-Si, are you serious?
-Of course.

556
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:24,526
The inspiration came from my sister.

557
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:26,166
And Jing.

558
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:28,846
But this competition
is only done once in three years.

559
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,686
If she wants to win,
she must have exceptional cooking skills

560
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:35,046
and she needs to have
a famous chef's recommendation.

561
00:37:35,966 --> 00:37:38,166
Shancai doesn't seem qualified
to participate in it.

562
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:40,446
I'll find a famous chef to test her.

563
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:41,446
Is it that hard?

564
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,406
So you want to use this opportunity
to train Shancai?

565
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,366
I want to use this opportunity

566
00:37:47,846 --> 00:37:51,566
to let Shancai improve
and also to let my mom accept Shancai.

567
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:53,566
Isn't this killing two birds
with one stone?

568
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:55,366
That's a good idea.

569
00:37:55,446 --> 00:37:56,606
Even so,

570
00:37:56,806 --> 00:37:59,566
the competition would be fierce.
Aren't you afraid she'll be humiliated?

571
00:38:00,126 --> 00:38:02,406
That's not a problem for Shancai.

572
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:05,566
You don't know how fierce she is.

573
00:38:06,206 --> 00:38:08,926
She can make the impossible possible.

574
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,726
But we have less than a month
before the competition.

575
00:38:13,806 --> 00:38:14,766
Do you have enough time?

576
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:17,366
How would we know if we don't try?

577
00:38:30,126 --> 00:38:30,966
Hello?

578
00:38:32,886 --> 00:38:34,366
Yes, I'm Shancai.

579
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:35,766
May I ask who's calling?

580
00:38:37,446 --> 00:38:38,446
Ms. Zhuang?

581
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:46,686
<i>How unfortunate I am.</i>

582
00:38:46,966 --> 00:38:48,566
<i>I have such a stupid brother.</i>

583
00:38:48,646 --> 00:38:50,966
He begged me to come back
and help you with your training.

584
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:54,606
So you came back just for me?

585
00:38:54,686 --> 00:38:57,486
Yes. What do you think?
How would you prepare for the competition?

586
00:38:59,526 --> 00:39:02,166
I'm not sure where to start.

587
00:39:02,726 --> 00:39:04,686
I don't think I'll succeed.

588
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:06,726
Let me tell you.

589
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:08,966
I hate those people
who think that they'll lose

590
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,566
even before they enter the competition.

591
00:39:11,206 --> 00:39:13,766
That kind of people
would never succeed no matter what.

592
00:39:15,246 --> 00:39:18,126
But a great teacher can produce
a brilliant student.

593
00:39:18,486 --> 00:39:22,006
If someone great like me teaches you,
as long as you're not too bad yourself,

594
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,766
you can still win the competition.

595
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:27,206
I'll do everything I can to help you.

596
00:39:27,286 --> 00:39:28,486
-Thank you, Ms. Zhuang.
-Okay.

597
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,206
Let me hear about your skill level first.

598
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,646
What's your specialty?

599
00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:34,166
-I can cook sweet and sour pork.
-What else?

600
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,966
Kung Pao chicken, shredded pork
with dried bean curd,

601
00:39:36,046 --> 00:39:37,766
Napa cabbage with dried shrimp,
shrimp with green peas.

602
00:39:37,846 --> 00:39:38,886
Stir-fried tomatoes with egg.

603
00:39:38,966 --> 00:39:40,366
Boiled Chinese Broccoli.

604
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:41,806
These dishes are basic!

605
00:39:43,646 --> 00:39:45,646
I think a lot of people
don't know how to cook them.

606
00:39:46,726 --> 00:39:47,926
Do you know

607
00:39:48,006 --> 00:39:51,286
that you're joining an international-scale
Chinese cuisine cooking competition?

608
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,486
It's not a competition
where you compete with your relatives.

609
00:39:57,526 --> 00:39:59,286
Then I'm doomed to fail?

610
00:40:02,646 --> 00:40:04,406
Do you know
what's the most important factor

611
00:40:04,526 --> 00:40:06,086
required to win this competition?

612
00:40:19,686 --> 00:40:21,406
Do you know how I won
the competition before?

613
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:23,046
How?

614
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:28,846
It has the essence of Dong Xiaowan's
hair and posture, graceful and elegant.

615
00:40:29,086 --> 00:40:32,406
Fragrant, flavorful, enticing,
and gold in color.

616
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,006
That sounds incredible.

617
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:38,046
-What is it?
-Silly girl.

618
00:40:38,126 --> 00:40:40,166
-It's a pumpkin pie.
-What?

619
00:40:40,726 --> 00:40:42,686
-Pumpkin pie?
-That's right.

620
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:45,486
How small of a bowl is it?

621
00:40:45,886 --> 00:40:46,846
Stupid girl.

622
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:50,486
Dong Xiaowan is a woman, not a bowl.

623
00:40:53,926 --> 00:40:55,726
Then how did you think
of cooking such a thing?

624
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:01,166
There was a reason, of course.

625
00:41:17,966 --> 00:41:19,966
-Did you fight with someone again?
-Why do you care?

626
00:41:23,366 --> 00:41:24,646
Stupid boy.

627
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:27,006
I need to discipline you.

628
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:31,046
<i>As a big sister, I had to take on
the role of disciplining Si</i>

629
00:41:31,686 --> 00:41:33,686
<i>since my parents were not around.</i>

630
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:34,726
Hey, what are you doing?

631
00:41:34,806 --> 00:41:35,966
Hey.

632
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:46,246
I'm invincible. How can I lose to you?

633
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:55,446
What are you doing?

634
00:41:56,206 --> 00:41:58,086
<i>I know he hates
the flavor of pumpkins the most.</i>

635
00:41:58,166 --> 00:42:00,726
<i>So I intentionally learned how to make
pumpkin pies to punish him.</i>

636
00:42:09,766 --> 00:42:11,566
That's your punishment.

637
00:42:18,566 --> 00:42:19,566
So what happened?

638
00:42:21,046 --> 00:42:23,086
What happened was Si didn't want
to come home anymore.

639
00:42:23,446 --> 00:42:25,886
And even our helpers ended up
eating pumpkin pies every day.

640
00:42:26,486 --> 00:42:28,966
I'll get rashes whenever I see
pumpkin nowadays.

641
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,166
What does that have to do
with the competition?

642
00:42:34,926 --> 00:42:36,966
We're talking about feelings.

643
00:42:44,326 --> 00:42:46,606
Not really.

644
00:42:48,006 --> 00:42:50,806
Do you know why I seem
so sensible and full of substance?

645
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:52,526
And so ahead of the times?

646
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:55,086
That's because I've always
read about Chinese history

647
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:56,326
and understood food very well.

648
00:42:56,406 --> 00:42:59,046
So when they a presented pumpkin pie
as the topic in the competition,

649
00:42:59,126 --> 00:43:01,846
I can use a completely different
point of view to win the competition.

650
00:43:02,486 --> 00:43:03,406
Really?

651
00:43:03,686 --> 00:43:05,246
I want to do that too.

652
00:43:05,326 --> 00:43:06,486
Think about it.

653
00:43:06,566 --> 00:43:08,646
The pumpkin pies made by those girls

654
00:43:08,726 --> 00:43:11,286
didn't contain any cultural heritage
in the flavors they presented.

655
00:43:11,766 --> 00:43:12,726
Unlike mine,

656
00:43:13,046 --> 00:43:15,366
it was full of international charm
and elegance.

657
00:43:15,766 --> 00:43:17,926
So who else could the winner be, but me?

658
00:43:18,886 --> 00:43:21,166
-I need to be like you too.
-Of course.

659
00:43:21,526 --> 00:43:23,166
-Are you feeling more confident now?
-Yes.

660
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:24,926
Thank you for your pointers.

661
00:43:25,006 --> 00:43:27,006
-I'll work extra hard.
-Very good.

662
00:43:27,526 --> 00:43:28,686
<i>THE BOOK OF SONGS</i>
