EPISODE 32

3
00:00:06,313 --> 00:00:07,193
You're an idiot.

4
00:00:17,673 --> 00:00:18,513
Okay.

5
00:00:18,753 --> 00:00:20,553
What do you plan to do?

6
00:00:20,673 --> 00:00:21,873
Quietly look out for Shancai?

7
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:23,833
What do you mean?

8
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:25,793
Didn't Huaze Lei confess

9
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:27,433
to Shancai today?

10
00:00:27,673 --> 00:00:29,833
Also, the problem with Xiaoyou
and Qinghe's families.

11
00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:32,433
There are so many obstacles
standing in your way.

12
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:35,633
That's not important.

13
00:00:36,393 --> 00:00:37,273
What's important is

14
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:38,873
Shancai's feelings.

15
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:45,273
But Shancai said

16
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:48,193
that she feels at peace

17
00:00:48,753 --> 00:00:50,753
-with Huaze Lei.
-I don't want her to feel at peace!

18
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:54,193
I want us to be together.

19
00:00:58,193 --> 00:00:59,513
Whether there are obstacles

20
00:01:00,513 --> 00:01:03,193
or if Shancai's undecided
on whoever she likes,

21
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:04,553
I want to get her back.

22
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:11,993
Daoming Si, you're such a nice guy.

23
00:01:12,913 --> 00:01:14,233
Why aren't you mine?

24
00:01:15,473 --> 00:01:16,313
Xiaozi.

25
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:18,833
Fine.

26
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,593
I was just kidding. Okay?

27
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:23,793
I support you.

28
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:29,953
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

29
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:34,473
Your White Jasmine Dew.

30
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:40,353
I still remember the first time
you came here.

31
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:42,393
You didn't actually like milk tea.

32
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:44,633
But you ordered it
because of its unique name.

33
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:46,033
You still remember that?

34
00:01:49,313 --> 00:01:50,393
Where's your friend Xiaoyou?

35
00:01:50,593 --> 00:01:51,833
Why isn't she here today?

36
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:54,353
She's busy with her finals.

37
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:55,553
So she's got the day off.

38
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:58,393
I'll wait for you and take you home later.

39
00:02:04,873 --> 00:02:05,913
Lei.

40
00:02:06,553 --> 00:02:08,833
I'm grateful you brought me back
from the fishing village.

41
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:11,153
You decorated my place,

42
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,033
helped me with my assignments,

43
00:02:13,953 --> 00:02:15,593
stayed beside me, and took care of me

44
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:17,473
during my most difficult times.

45
00:02:17,953 --> 00:02:19,633
And the song you played

46
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:21,273
was really nice.

47
00:02:21,913 --> 00:02:22,993
I really liked it.

48
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:25,793
I'm really grateful...

49
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:28,913
to you.

50
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:31,673
You really are a nice guy.

51
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,353
I did those things because I wanted to.

52
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:55,193
We can't be together.

53
00:02:58,713 --> 00:02:59,593
Don't worry.

54
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,273
I just want to be nice to you.

55
00:03:01,993 --> 00:03:04,593
Maybe there won't be an opportunity
for me to do so in the future.

56
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:08,993
Right now, these are
unforgettable memories for me.

57
00:03:10,513 --> 00:03:11,353
Shancai.

58
00:03:12,513 --> 00:03:14,713
This is the first time
I don't have to think about Si

59
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:16,353
and just be with you.

60
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:37,713
Are you used to living alone?

61
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:39,633
It's all right.

62
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:42,313
I keep myself busy as much as possible.

63
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,593
That way, I have less time
to think about it.

64
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,593
You sound like Jing.

65
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:50,833
Jing?

66
00:03:52,553 --> 00:03:54,113
Since I left France,

67
00:03:54,473 --> 00:03:56,193
Jing was alone.

68
00:03:57,473 --> 00:03:59,193
Even though that was her decision,

69
00:03:59,913 --> 00:04:01,433
I went there and left.

70
00:04:02,113 --> 00:04:04,473
It'd be worse if I didn't go there at all.

71
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:06,513
I know.

72
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:09,633
When you enter someone's life,

73
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,513
she'll have expectations of you.

74
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:15,753
When you leave,
her life goes back to square one.

75
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:19,313
The disappointment and sadness
are even more unbearable.

76
00:04:21,673 --> 00:04:22,633
You're right.

77
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:25,913
But I wasn't thinking clearly at the time.

78
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,313
I wasn't sure how to face her.

79
00:04:30,393 --> 00:04:31,993
So I left.

80
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:35,753
But Jing didn't blame me.

81
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:37,553
She just said

82
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:39,993
she made herself busier
to tire herself out.

83
00:04:40,753 --> 00:04:41,753
To numb herself.

84
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:44,913
Do you regret it?

85
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:49,433
I do.

86
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:54,233
I regret giving up on her so easily.

87
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,433
I regret not holding on
a little longer that time.

88
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:06,393
Shancai.

89
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:07,993
Do you get it?

90
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:09,433
Hold on a little longer.

91
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,233
If you do,

92
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:16,833
a lot of things might end up differently.

93
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:19,913
But if you miss that opportunity,

94
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:22,993
you'll regret it your whole life.

95
00:05:26,913 --> 00:05:27,953
Regret?

96
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,833
Your decision

97
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:33,753
determines the outcome,

98
00:05:33,953 --> 00:05:36,313
whether it's a happy ending or a sad one.

99
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:44,873
If you still don't know
what you want to do,

100
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:47,153
then hold on a little longer.

101
00:05:51,713 --> 00:05:52,633
Just like Si.

102
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,913
Even though he's immature,
he's very sincere.

103
00:05:56,793 --> 00:05:57,993
He's still holding on

104
00:05:58,873 --> 00:06:00,073
to his love for you.

105
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:05,913
Didn't you say

106
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,673
that Si can recover as quickly as a dog?

107
00:06:10,873 --> 00:06:14,473
I think that's how he is
when it comes to love too.

108
00:06:38,993 --> 00:06:40,153
What do you think, Mrs. Yu?

109
00:06:40,953 --> 00:06:42,153
Do I give out

110
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:44,313
powerful vibes?

111
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,033
What's wrong?

112
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:55,873
Is there something on my face?

113
00:06:59,513 --> 00:07:00,473
Si.

114
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:02,873
Right now,

115
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:05,713
you're back at being your old self.

116
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:08,633
Of course.

117
00:07:08,913 --> 00:07:10,073
I'm not like you,

118
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:12,153
who's a flickering candle.

119
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:17,713
You're joking around again.

120
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:21,193
You meant to say,

121
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:23,393
"A candle in the wind," right?

122
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:28,673
Silly boy.

123
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:32,273
Silly boy?

124
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:34,393
You can call me silly.

125
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:37,553
I'm going to do the silliest thing
I'll ever do in my life.

126
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:44,473
This boy.

127
00:07:45,953 --> 00:07:47,993
<i>Doesn't he still have</i>

128
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:51,633
<i>a lot of silly things
that he's never done in his life yet?</i>

129
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:05,273
Lei, I want to tell you something.

130
00:08:06,113 --> 00:08:06,993
Okay.

131
00:08:08,673 --> 00:08:10,073
Shancai's mine.

132
00:08:11,953 --> 00:08:13,513
Does that mean you're competing with me?

133
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:15,673
I accept your challenge.

134
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:19,193
Why are you smiling?

135
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:23,913
So you're not giving up on her?

136
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:29,593
That's right.

137
00:08:32,393 --> 00:08:34,193
I can't let her be with another guy.

138
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:36,473
I want to win her heart.

139
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:39,553
Regardless if it's my mom or you...

140
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,313
Even if the whole world wants me
to give up on her,

141
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,433
I'd never leave Shancai.

142
00:08:56,113 --> 00:08:59,513
In that case, let Shancai choose.

143
00:09:07,753 --> 00:09:10,793
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

144
00:09:24,473 --> 00:09:25,353
Hello?

145
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:28,953
Shancai, promise me one thing.

146
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:31,233
<i>What is it?</i>

147
00:09:31,393 --> 00:09:33,873
Turn off your cell phone
for 48 hours starting now.

148
00:09:34,673 --> 00:09:36,553
Turn off my phone for 48 hours?

149
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:37,793
Why?

150
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:39,073
I don't want to.

151
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:53,593
POWER OFF

152
00:09:59,193 --> 00:10:01,233
Shancai, why did you turn off your phone?

153
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,153
Turn to chapter two.

154
00:10:17,313 --> 00:10:19,033
Is there anything I can do for you?

155
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,833
Sorry, professor.
I'm looking for Dong Shancai.

156
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:23,873
She didn't come to class today.

157
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:31,313
Let's continue.

158
00:10:34,673 --> 00:10:36,873
<i>The number you are calling

159
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:38,433

160
00:10:49,473 --> 00:10:51,233
Hey, have you seen Shancai?

Qinghe.

166
00:11:37,593 --> 00:11:38,433
What?

167
00:11:38,593 --> 00:11:39,433
Come here.

168
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:40,513
Wait for me.

169
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:44,393
What's the matter?

170
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:45,473
Where's Shancai?

171
00:11:47,713 --> 00:11:48,713
Why do you want to know?

172
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:50,153
Cut the crap. Tell me.

173
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,433
I'm not telling you even if I know.

174
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:54,273
Tell me now.

175
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:56,473
All right. Let go of me.

176
00:11:58,513 --> 00:11:59,353
Shancai...

177
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:01,953
Shancai didn't come to school today.

178
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:14,153
Hi, is Shancai here?

179
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:16,633
Shancai? She already left.

180
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:24,673
Shancai.

181
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:25,993
Shancai!

182
00:12:38,113 --> 00:12:40,113

00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:19,473
Sir, I want to report a crime.

188
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:20,633
There's a thief.

189
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:30,473
<i>Dong Shancai.</i>

190
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:33,313
<i>No matter where you're hiding,</i>

191
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,633
<i>I'll find you.</i>

192
00:14:54,073 --> 00:14:56,673
I bought the moisturizer
you recommended in Canada

193
00:14:56,753 --> 00:14:57,993
right after I returned.

194
00:14:58,673 --> 00:15:00,673
Doesn't it nicely tighten
and moisturize your skin?

195
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:03,113
It's made from the finest herbs.
Safe and effective.

196
00:15:03,273 --> 00:15:05,513
Look. I don't have fine lines anymore.

197
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:06,873
See.

198
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:08,313
Is Jiang Xiaoyou smart or what?

199
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:09,713
Yes.

200
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,593
Shancai, thanks for helping me
look for venues today.

201
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,513
You must come to the tea ceremony.

202
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:17,873
No problem.

203
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:21,193
However,

204
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:23,273
why did Huaze Lei call and tell me

205
00:15:23,353 --> 00:15:24,473
to hold you up

206
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,913
as long as possible?

207
00:15:27,913 --> 00:15:29,153
He said that?

208
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:30,633
Why?

209
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:32,393
I'm not sure either.

210
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:35,753
Huaze Lei is very mysterious.

211
00:15:37,113 --> 00:15:38,593
Here. Have some fruit.

212
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,033
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

213
00:15:41,513 --> 00:15:42,353
Shancai.

214
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:43,873
You haven't been here for so long.

215
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:46,393
Look. I prepared your favorite fruit.

216
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:47,673
-Eat more.
-Okay.

217
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:50,953
It's so sweet.

218
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:52,953
You're such a foodie.

219
00:15:55,513 --> 00:15:57,673
I am and so are you.

220
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:03,833
<i>This happiness</i>

221
00:16:03,953 --> 00:16:06,193
<i>was almost gone because of me.</i>

222
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:11,153
<i>Yesterday, I was still thinking
if I should be true to myself.</i>

223
00:16:13,553 --> 00:16:15,993
<i>But if I do that,</i>

224
00:16:16,913 --> 00:16:18,873
<i>I might hurt people around me</i>

225
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:20,953
<i>and not be able to live with myself.</i>

226
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:36,673
Hey.

227
00:16:37,273 --> 00:16:38,473
What is Si doing?

228
00:16:38,993 --> 00:16:40,033
Why isn't he back yet?

229
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:43,913
I have a feeling

230
00:16:44,593 --> 00:16:46,593
that Si won't be back tonight.

231
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:50,313
You're trying to say something.

232
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,273
Tell me. What's going on?

233
00:16:57,393 --> 00:17:00,513
Si called me yesterday
and asked where Shancai lives.

234
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:04,393
Is Si pursuing Shancai again?

235
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:06,353
No way.

236
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:08,553
Isn't Shancai with Lei now?

237
00:17:16,313 --> 00:17:17,593
I'll call Si.

238
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:28,513
<i>Hello?</i>

239
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:29,713
Hello, Si.

240
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:30,833
Where are you now?

241
00:17:49,553 --> 00:17:50,713
I'm coming.

242
00:17:50,953 --> 00:17:52,153
Who's being so rude?

243
00:17:56,113 --> 00:17:57,193
Who are you looking for?

244
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,473
<i>Shancai stayed here last night.</i>

245
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:17,033
<i>But a guy picked her up earlier.</i>

246
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:47,233
Lei.

247
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,713
You haven't told me yet.

248
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:51,513
Why did you ask me
to turn off my cell phone?

249
00:18:53,113 --> 00:18:54,513
To avoid unnecessary disturbance.

250
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,313
Unnecessary disturbance?

251
00:19:00,393 --> 00:19:01,473
You mean...

252
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:04,553
Daoming Si told me
he's not giving up on you.

253
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:07,393
What do you think?

254
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:15,593
I've already decided.

255
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:21,993
Are you sure?

256
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:30,273
Yes.

257
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:35,993
This decision was really hard to make.

258
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:39,833
I admit that I hesitated.

259
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,273
But since I already knew the outcome,

260
00:19:48,993 --> 00:19:50,273
I can't just

261
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:52,193
blindly hold on.

262
00:19:55,113 --> 00:19:56,993
I know Si has been looking for you

263
00:19:57,353 --> 00:19:58,433
and waiting for you.

264
00:19:59,473 --> 00:20:00,833
He's been holding on.

265
00:20:14,153 --> 00:20:15,313
I'm going to work.

266
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:18,913
I'll go with you.

267
00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:52,233
Shancai!

268
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:56,993
Don't go.

269
00:20:58,233 --> 00:20:59,313
Don't go with Lei.

270
00:21:00,153 --> 00:21:01,233
Don't leave me.

271
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:05,593
Si.

272
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,393
Shancai already made her choice.

273
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:09,873
Why should she stay with you?

274
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:11,673
Screw her choice!

275
00:21:14,793 --> 00:21:15,673
Shancai.

276
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:18,953
I can't be without you.

277
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:21,633
I can't live without you.

278
00:21:26,513 --> 00:21:27,473
Daoming Si.

279
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:31,033
Let's just give up.

280
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:34,193
Stop holding on anymore.

281
00:21:35,553 --> 00:21:36,393
Absolutely not.

282
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,153
My life has no meaning without you.

283
00:21:42,873 --> 00:21:44,353
When I'm awake,

284
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,753
you're all I think of.

285
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,073
When I close my eyes, you're in my dreams.

286
00:21:52,313 --> 00:21:54,073
I can only think of one thing.

287
00:21:55,953 --> 00:21:57,153
I can't live without you.

288
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:09,673
Shancai.

289
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,833
I've always done
what I wanted to do before.

290
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:19,993
But I don't know what to do anymore.

291
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:22,393
Please tell me.

292
00:22:23,473 --> 00:22:24,553
What should I do

293
00:22:25,473 --> 00:22:26,873
for me to continue loving you?

294
00:22:31,353 --> 00:22:32,233
Si.

295
00:22:33,993 --> 00:22:35,833
If your love brings problems to Shancai,

296
00:22:36,873 --> 00:22:38,833
are you sure that will make her happy?

297
00:22:59,153 --> 00:23:00,033
Shancai.

298
00:23:01,993 --> 00:23:03,593
You know you're the only one for me.

299
00:23:05,273 --> 00:23:06,193
Trust me.

300
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:08,633
I'll definitely make you happy.

301
00:23:19,993 --> 00:23:20,873
Shancai.

302
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,353
If you're sure about your decision,

303
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,353
I'll support you no matter what.

304
00:23:42,473 --> 00:23:43,313
Shancai!

305
00:24:00,353 --> 00:24:01,193
Shancai!

306
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:09,873
Shancai!

307
00:24:10,193 --> 00:24:11,113
Shancai!

308
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:14,433
Shancai!

309
00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:20,473
<i>-Faster. Go faster.</i>
-Shancai!

310
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:23,553
<i>Don't let me hear his voice again.</i>

311
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:24,713
Shancai!

312
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:56,753
Shancai!

313
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:03,873
Shancai!

314
00:26:07,553 --> 00:26:08,873
Shancai!

315
00:26:10,793 --> 00:26:11,873
Shancai!

316
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:16,313
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

317
00:26:17,433 --> 00:26:18,793
<i>-My heart...
</i>-Shancai!

318
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:20,393
<i>...is going to break apart.</i>

319
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:21,753
Shancai!

320
00:26:23,793 --> 00:26:24,953
Stop looking.

321
00:26:25,953 --> 00:26:28,433
-Don't get off if you've already decided.
-Shancai!

322
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:30,673
Don't give him any more chances.

323
00:26:33,113 --> 00:26:34,473
Shancai!

324
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:49,833
Shancai!

325
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:34,833
Daoming Si!

326
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,353
Daoming Si!

327
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,993
You're such a fool.

328
00:27:53,473 --> 00:27:54,913
Do you know how dangerous that was?

329
00:28:28,953 --> 00:28:30,513
She looks like the one in the picture.

330
00:28:30,953 --> 00:28:31,793
Let's go.

331
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,233
Wait. It's a misunderstanding.

332
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,953
Daoming Si, wait for me.
I won't leave you anymore.

333
00:28:37,673 --> 00:28:39,713
Hey, Daoming Si.

334
00:28:40,193 --> 00:28:42,873
Someone reported
that their meteor necklace went missing.

335
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:44,393
Is it with you?

336
00:28:44,993 --> 00:28:46,193
Meteor necklace?

337
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:47,953
Yes, it is.

338
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:50,113
But I didn't steal it.

339
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:51,753
-Are you admitting it?
-I...

340
00:28:52,113 --> 00:28:54,433
The person who reported it
said he was mistaken.

341
00:28:57,073 --> 00:28:58,833
<i>We're responsible to protect the citizens.</i>

342
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:01,673
<i>We'll thoroughly investigate
every crime reported.</i>

343
00:29:02,353 --> 00:29:04,833
<i>I'm really sorry.
I reported it without checking properly.</i>

344
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:07,273
<i>-Please forgive me.
-All right.</i>

345
00:29:07,393 --> 00:29:10,193
<i>Since it's your first offense
and you've regretted your actions,</i>

346
00:29:10,273 --> 00:29:13,673
<i>we'll let you go this time.
Don't do it again, okay?</i>

347
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:14,913
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

348
00:29:26,393 --> 00:29:27,313
Daoming Si.

349
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:28,513
Why did you do that?

350
00:29:29,073 --> 00:29:30,353
What do you mean?

351
00:29:33,673 --> 00:29:35,233
<i>Silly girl, where did you go?</i>

352
00:29:36,753 --> 00:29:38,073
<i>Dong Shancai, listen carefully.</i>

353
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:40,673
<i>No matter where you're hiding,
I'll find you.</i>

354
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,073
<i>Silly girl.</i>

355
00:29:44,753 --> 00:29:46,633
Why did you keep calling me that?

356
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:47,913
You're a silly boy, right?

357
00:29:48,793 --> 00:29:49,873
Why were you hiding?

358
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:51,433
Didn't I tell you before?

359
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:54,593
No matter what happens,
I need to know where you are.

360
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:56,433
So you asked the police to arrest me?

361
00:29:58,273 --> 00:29:59,633
You're so smart.

362
00:30:00,193 --> 00:30:01,993
I almost got myself a criminal record!

363
00:30:02,073 --> 00:30:03,393
Then what did you want me to do?

364
00:30:03,513 --> 00:30:05,313
I almost went crazy looking for you.

365
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:09,553
You've been...

366
00:30:10,473 --> 00:30:11,593
looking for me?

367
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:12,673
What did you think?

368
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:15,633
You didn't attend class or go to work.

369
00:30:15,873 --> 00:30:17,033
You didn't go home.

370
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:18,713
Your phone was turned off.

371
00:30:18,953 --> 00:30:22,033
Do you want me to die from stress?
Why did you disappear?

372
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:27,473
Thank you

373
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:29,953
for looking for me.

374
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:39,233
Daoming Si.

375
00:30:43,873 --> 00:30:45,633
I thought you'd never come back
to me anymore.

376
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:56,833
<i>I've always pushed myself into a corner</i>

377
00:30:57,633 --> 00:30:59,353
<i>and trapped myself in fear and pain.</i>

378
00:31:00,273 --> 00:31:01,233
<i>However,</i>

379
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:03,473
<i>even if I regret it later,</i>

380
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,393
<i>I want to hold on to my happiness now.</i>

381
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:16,113
Are you hungry?

382
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:18,553
It wasn't me.

383
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:19,953
It wasn't me.

384
00:31:20,073 --> 00:31:21,553
I'm sure it was you. I heard it.

385
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:23,513
The sound came from your stomach!

386
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:25,793
-Why are you accusing me?
-Just because...

387
00:31:27,993 --> 00:31:30,953
All right. Since you looked so cute
when you accused me,

388
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:34,313
a chivalrous person like me
won't argue with you anymore.

389
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,673
When did I accuse you?

390
00:31:36,753 --> 00:31:38,233
All right. Let's eat.

391
00:31:46,233 --> 00:31:47,753
Why are you holding my hand so tightly?

392
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:51,113
I'm afraid you'll run away.

393
00:31:51,353 --> 00:31:52,593
I'm thinking

394
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:55,753
I should have borrowed handcuffs
from that officer earlier.

395
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,473
Then you won't be able to run away.

396
00:31:58,713 --> 00:31:59,633
Silly boy.

397
00:32:00,593 --> 00:32:01,913
Let's go eat ramen.

398
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:03,433
Ramen?

399
00:32:03,793 --> 00:32:05,073
Why should we eat ramen?

400
00:32:05,193 --> 00:32:06,553
What are you thinking?

401
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,833
I'm thinking of eating ramen.

402
00:32:08,753 --> 00:32:09,953
Then what are you thinking?

403
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:14,433
<i>It suddenly feels like we're flirting.</i>

404
00:32:14,793 --> 00:32:16,633
<i>What should I do to break the awkwardness?</i>

405
00:32:19,553 --> 00:32:20,473
I know.

406
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,433
You're thinking about me, right?

407
00:32:26,793 --> 00:32:27,873
Stop being so narcissistic.

408
00:32:30,393 --> 00:32:32,793
<i>Goodness.</i> <i>What did I just say?</i>

409
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,713
<i>It's even more awkward now.</i>

410
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:40,393
That's so funny.

411
00:32:42,313 --> 00:32:43,273
How is that funny?

412
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:44,433
Are we eating or not?

413
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:46,753
-Wasn't it funny?
-Not at all.

414
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,913
-Okay.
-It was not funny.

415
00:32:53,913 --> 00:32:54,753
Hey!

416
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:30,553
Sir, can you please stop the bus?

417
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:33,353
I'm begging you! It's very important.

418
00:33:42,593 --> 00:33:43,433
Shancai.

419
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:45,833
Are you sure?

420
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:50,073
Lei, I want to give it a try.

421
00:33:50,873 --> 00:33:52,553
Compared to trying my best and failing,

422
00:33:53,393 --> 00:33:55,593
not trying at all would make me
regret it even more.

423
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:36,513
Excuse me.

424
00:34:37,953 --> 00:34:39,513
This is your ramen. Please enjoy.

425
00:34:41,553 --> 00:34:42,553
It looks so good.

426
00:34:44,713 --> 00:34:46,033
-Okay, thanks.
-You're welcome.

427
00:34:56,473 --> 00:34:57,553
Why aren't you eating?

428
00:34:58,993 --> 00:35:00,513
I'm suddenly not that hungry.

429
00:35:01,153 --> 00:35:02,833
It's such a waste not to eat it.

430
00:35:03,113 --> 00:35:04,433
Okay, fine.

431
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,073
How is it? Is it good?

432
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,193
Yes, it's all right.

433
00:35:24,753 --> 00:35:25,633
Hey.

434
00:35:26,513 --> 00:35:27,473
Do you have a passport?

435
00:35:28,273 --> 00:35:29,473
Yes, I do.

436
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:32,033
I applied for one
the last time I went overseas.

437
00:35:32,553 --> 00:35:33,593
Then there's no problem.

438
00:35:34,353 --> 00:35:35,433
What are you talking about?

439
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:40,673
Shancai, let's go to London together.

440
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:46,873
You mean...

441
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:51,793
that newly-opened London coffee shop?

442
00:35:52,953 --> 00:35:55,513
I think we need to come up
with a plan soon.

443
00:35:55,593 --> 00:35:56,913
My mom is not that easy to handle.

444
00:36:00,513 --> 00:36:01,353
Wait.

445
00:36:02,313 --> 00:36:03,873
Aren't we being too rash?

446
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:04,953
Don't you want to?

447
00:36:09,073 --> 00:36:09,913
No.

448
00:36:10,153 --> 00:36:11,153
I don't.

449
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:12,433
Why?

450
00:36:13,353 --> 00:36:14,513
What do you mean?

451
00:36:16,113 --> 00:36:18,753
I don't want to go to a foreign country.

452
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:21,913
I don't have friends there

453
00:36:23,033 --> 00:36:26,313
and my English is bad.
I'm not used to Western food.

454
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:29,113
What if I get sick?

455
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:34,273
Then why did you get off the bus?

456
00:36:43,553 --> 00:36:44,713
Did I misunderstand?

457
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:47,593
Why did you get off the bus?

458
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:50,073
<i>Is this guy</i>

459
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:52,753
<i>pushing me to make things clear?</i>

460
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,873
Can't I get off the bus?

461
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,153
I see.

462
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:06,593
Then I'll go ahead.

463
00:37:12,873 --> 00:37:14,753
<i>What exactly am I saying?</i>

464
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:21,633
Daoming Si, wait!

465
00:37:34,233 --> 00:37:35,073
I...

466
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:45,153
I want to say...

467
00:37:57,673 --> 00:37:58,873
Good night.

468
00:38:02,953 --> 00:38:03,833
That's it?

469
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:07,273
That's it.

470
00:39:03,113 --> 00:39:04,153
Why are you looking for me?

471
00:39:06,313 --> 00:39:09,553
I just want to tell you in person
that Shancai is mine.

472
00:39:09,673 --> 00:39:10,713
Don't bother her anymore.

473
00:39:12,273 --> 00:39:13,433
So you're together now?

474
00:39:14,193 --> 00:39:15,433
Is Shancai your girlfriend?

475
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:17,073
That's none of your business!

476
00:39:22,953 --> 00:39:23,833
I don't think she is.

477
00:39:26,993 --> 00:39:28,393
I still have a chance then.

478
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:35,833
Don't you get it?
Tell me that you're giving up on Shancai.

479
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,673
I don't see why I should do that.

480
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:42,553
Huaze Lei.

481
00:39:43,153 --> 00:39:44,473
Am I not your friend anymore?

482
00:39:44,953 --> 00:39:46,593
You know I can't live without Shancai.

483
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:47,633
-You know I--
-I don't.

484
00:39:47,713 --> 00:39:48,553
You...

485
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:50,593
I know you hurt her with your temper.

486
00:39:50,673 --> 00:39:52,193
How could I hurt her?

487
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:54,473
Give up on Shancai, understand?

488
00:39:56,673 --> 00:39:58,953
I'm not deaf. You don't have to shout.

489
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:06,713
I don't care what you think.

490
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:08,913
I'm warning you.

491
00:40:08,993 --> 00:40:10,273
Shancai is mine.

492
00:40:10,473 --> 00:40:12,153
I, Daoming Si, will be
responsible for her.

493
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:13,153
I'll take care of her.

494
00:40:14,353 --> 00:40:17,993
I won't let her be with a guy like you.
A guy who has no conscience and loyalty.

495
00:40:18,953 --> 00:40:20,193
Do you hear that?

496
00:40:29,713 --> 00:40:31,153
Oh, all right.

497
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:33,153
What do you mean, "Oh, all right"?
What exactly...

498
00:40:39,113 --> 00:40:40,073
What did you say again?

499
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:41,793
I said all right.

500
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:43,113
I'll give up on Shancai.

501
00:40:45,353 --> 00:40:46,233
Why?

502
00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:50,713
-So I can pursue Shancai?
-No.
