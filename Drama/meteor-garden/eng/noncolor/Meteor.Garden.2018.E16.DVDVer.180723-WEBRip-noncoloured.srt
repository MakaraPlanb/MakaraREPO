A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:27,027
METEOR GARDEN

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,039
EPISODE 16

4
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,959
Ximen, you'll like this wine.

5
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,839
I didn't expect such a place
to have an amazing cabin

6
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,279
and wine cellar here.

7
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,719
What a surprise.

8
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:07,519
This one has a strong fruity flavor.

9
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,999
Am I describing it correctly?

10
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,759
You've got talent.

11
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,519
This is called a Merlot.

12
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:14,679
Fruity and sweet.

13
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,559
It tastes good, right?

14
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,119
Yes, it's good.

15
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:20,759
Do you want to try this?

16
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:21,959
It's drier.

17
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,759
It's very dry.

18
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:33,399
And a little sour.

19
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,679
I still prefer the previous one.
It's sweet.

20
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,999
This one is a smoked wine.

21
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,479
The longer it ages,

22
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:40,839
the stronger the taste.

23
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,639
Are there people
that actually like this wine?

24
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,439
Plenty of people.

25
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:51,119
Everyone has different tastes
and preferences.

26
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,119
For Meizuo, he likes aged wine.

27
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:55,519
Like brandy.

28
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:57,439
The longer it is stored,

29
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:58,839
the more fragrant it becomes.

30
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,639
Lei likes newer wine.

31
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:03,279
Si prefers malt wine.

32
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,359
Each person chooses something

33
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,639
based on their preferences.

34
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,599
How about you? What kind do you like?

35
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,119
I like all kinds.

36
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:20,799
Every wine has its own charm.

37
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:25,759
So have you tried all the wine
in this cellar?

38
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,559
This cellar belongs to Si,

39
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,399
but the one who manages it is Ximen.

40
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,799
You shouldn't drink that.

41
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,599
It doesn't suit you.

42
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:44,879
I haven't tried it yet.
How would you know?

43
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,239
All right. Don't get drunk though.

44
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,519
It's dinner time. Let's head up.

45
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,999
Should we bring these two bottles?

46
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:18,479
Yes, I think so.

47
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,439
This useless teammate.
He's already a burden.

48
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:33,959
Now he's gone missing?

49
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,599
Where are they?

50
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,279
Where's Shancai?

51
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,719
Hey, Lei.

52
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:14,799
Where were you? Have you seen Shancai?

53
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:18,479
I was out looking for Shancai.
Hasn't she come back?

54
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,719
What do you mean?

55
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,119
Shancai said Xiaoyou went
for a night stroll.

56
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,599
She went looking for her.

57
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,159
Xiaoyou.

58
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,039
I'll recommend some special wine to you
to pair with tonight's dinner.

59
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,399
Xiaoyou?

60
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,399
You are Xiaoyou?

61
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:42,039
Aren't you out for a night stroll?

62
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:44,919
A night stroll? No.

63
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,999
I was at the wine cellar
with Ximen and Meizuo.

64
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:50,239
But Shancai went to look for you.

65
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,279
There's a blizzard outside.

66
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,399
She isn't--

67
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,599
What exactly happened?

68
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,079
Someone told Shancai
that you went for a night stroll.

69
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,079
That's impossible.

70
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:12,759
Have you seen the weather?
Nobody should be out there.

71
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:19,719
Xiaoyou!

72
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,839
Xiaoyou!

73
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,279
Xiaoyou!

74
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,839
Xiaoyou!

75
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,839
Xiaoyou!

76
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:51,359
Xiaoyou!

77
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,559
Where are you?

78
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,959
Xiaoyou.

79
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:23,759
Xiaoyou!

80
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,359
That hurts.

81
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,359
This won't work. I should go back.

82
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,679
I need help finding Xiaoyou.

83
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:58,439
But the cabin is...

84
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:13,959
How did this happen?

85
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:16,199
I hope nothing bad happens to Shancai.

86
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,239
At the time,

87
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,839
I really thought she went out
to see the night sky.

88
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,319
Yeah.

89
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:27,199
We really did see Xiaoyou
go out the front door.

90
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:29,599
-That's why--
-I never went out.

91
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:30,799
The thing is

92
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:32,799
I didn't ask Shancai to go.

93
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,159
But she herself--

94
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:39,959
Lei.

95
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,119
You shouldn't do that.

96
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,879
What's a glass of wine
compared to Shancai's life?

97
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,359
Yes.

98
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:52,439
But I don't think

99
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,999
anything would happen to Shancai.

100
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,879
It's minus 20 degrees outside.

101
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,519
She's been out there
for more than two hours.

102
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:02,759
If she got stuck in the blizzard,
she'd be dead.

103
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:06,359
You'd better pray that Si finds her.

104
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,279
Otherwise, you'll be murderers.

105
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,679
We...

106
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,919
We didn't do it on purpose.

107
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:13,879
Still not admitting your mistake?

108
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,999
How shameless.

109
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,919
It's my fault.

110
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,439
If something happens to Shancai,

111
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,479
what am I going to do?

112
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:31,319
She will be fine.

113
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,279
I'm going to call the SAR team.

114
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,719
We need help.

115
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:49,839
Dong Shancai!

116
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,479
Shancai!

117
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,519
Shancai!

118
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,759
Shancai.

119
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:14,839
Shancai!

120
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,239
Shancai!

121
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,159
Shancai!

122
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,559
<i>Who would've thought I'd die today.</i>

123
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:32,519
<i>I left the house in such good spirits
this morning.</i>

124
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,679
<i>I was so eager.</i>

125
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,239
<i>How ironic.</i>

126
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,559
<i>I don't want to die here.</i>

127
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,999
<i>I still have so many things I want to do.</i>

128
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,039
<i>I still have to graduate.</i>

129
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:48,199
<i>I want to graduate with my friends
from Mingde University.</i>

130
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,319
<i>Dad and Mom will be proud</i>

131
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,399
<i>that I graduated.</i>

132
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,719
<i>They'll be smiling from ear to ear.</i>

133
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,319
<i>We'll celebrate together.</i>

134
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,719
<i>Sometimes,</i>

135
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,119
<i>I'll indulge a little.</i>

136
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,319
<i>I'll go on a vacation overseas
with my friends.</i>

137
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:22,959
<i>Lastly,</i>

138
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:25,599
<i>I'll meet a man I love dearly</i>

139
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,159
<i>and marry him.</i>

140
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,719
<i>It will not be</i>

141
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,719
<i>very big or expensive,</i>

142
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,159
<i>but a beautiful wedding.</i>

143
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:42,199
<i>I'll spend the rest of my life
with him in happiness.</i>

144
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:48,079
<i>The groom is a man I love.</i>

145
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,399
<i>But...</i>

146
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,759
<i>why can't I see his face clearly?</i>

147
00:11:58,199 --> 00:11:59,519
<i>Dong Shancai!</i>

148
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,079
Where are you?

149
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:03,559
Hey!

150
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,319
Xiaoyou never left the cabin.

151
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,759
Dong Shancai!

152
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,239
Dong Shancai!

153
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:32,839
Shancai.

154
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:38,839
Shancai.

155
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:40,879
Shancai!

156
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,199
Hey.

157
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,119
Hey, Shancai.

158
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,519
Shancai.

159
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,359
Hey.

160
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,239
Are you okay?

161
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,599
Stand up.

162
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,319
Daoming Si.

163
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,919
-What are you babbling about?
-Am I...

164
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:01,039
-I'm here. I won't let you die.
-...already dead?

165
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,879
Xiayou didn't go outside.

166
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,759
-You've been lied to.
-Where's Xiaoyou?

167
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:16,039
-That's good.
-Shancai.

168
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,479
Hey.

169
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,279
Shancai, don't fall asleep.

170
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,719
Hey, stay awake.

171
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,639
Wake up.

172
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:22,719
Hey.

173
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,079
You'll freeze if you sleep.

174
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,399
Come, Shancai.

175
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:32,919
Get up.

176
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:36,879
I'll carry you. Here.

177
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,119
Shancai, hang in there.

178
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,279
Stay awake.

179
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,159
We're almost there.

180
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,279
Hang in there.

181
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:08,879
Dong Shancai.

182
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,399
Shancai. Dong Shancai!

183
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,599
Don't sleep.

184
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:24,879
You must not sleep.

185
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,759
Shancai.

186
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:51,679
Wake up.

187
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,559
Hang on.

188
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,079
Stay warm.

189
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,119
We'll stay here until it's morning.

190
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,399
Wait here.

191
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,079
Trust me.

192
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,719
I'll be right back.

193
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,079
Shancai.

194
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,279
Shancai.

195
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,159
Hang in there.

196
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,639
It'll be fine.

197
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,399
Si will find Shancai.

198
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,919
Well? What did they say?

199
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,199
The blizzard is so bad
they can't start searching.

200
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:12,119
They told us not to go out on our own.

201
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,879
Luckily there's a storeroom at the back.

202
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,279
The wood should be enough until tomorrow.

203
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:27,599
Shancai.

204
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:30,079
Hang in there. Don't sleep.

205
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:31,679
Daoming Si.

206
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,359
You'll warm up soon.

207
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,879
Hang in there.

208
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:39,319
I'm going to see if there's anything else
to keep you warm.

209
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,439
Stay awake.

210
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,199
Don't fall asleep.

211
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,679
<i>Incredible.</i>

212
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,519
<i>Daoming Si actually saved me
in the snowstorm.</i>

213
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:54,319
<i>If it wasn't for him,</i>

214
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,959
<i>I'd probably be dead.</i>

215
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,159
<i>What a weird feeling.</i>

216
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:03,519
<i>Despite not knowing
whether we could survive the night,</i>

217
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:06,079
<i>all that doesn't matter now.</i>

218
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,399
<i>Because at this moment
where I'm with Daoming Si,</i>

219
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,079
<i>my heart</i>

220
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:13,959
<i>feels warm</i>

221
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,879
<i>and fuzzy.</i>

222
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,879
No, I have to go look for Shancai.

223
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:25,039
-What if she doesn't come back?
-Xiaoyou, calm down.

224
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,879
There are already two of them out there.
It's riskier if you go too.

225
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,519
But if I hadn't nagged her
about coming to Canada,

226
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:33,199
this wouldn't have happened to Shancai.

227
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,159
Xiaoyou.

228
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,239
Don't worry.

229
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:39,679
But Shancai...

230
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:45,159
Okay, I'll go with you.

231
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,319
Yes, we should all go.
It's safer in numbers.

232
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,599
Wait, Ximen.

233
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,879
We should think about this.

234
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,919
But we can't just do nothing.

235
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:59,119
Staying here is the best way.

236
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,239
But Si is...

237
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,039
We all believe in Si, right?

238
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,879
We believe that
he's with Shancai right now.

239
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,439
They will be okay.

240
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:09,919
Just one night.

241
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:11,959
Wait until tomorrow.

242
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:15,319
We'll go find them tomorrow morning.

243
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,039
Okay.

244
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,239
You're right.

245
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:22,759
Si isn't an ordinary person.

246
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:24,679
He is...

247
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,919
an animal with passion.

248
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,599
Here.

249
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,079
Drink it hot.

250
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,319
Go on.

251
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,039
We're too far away from the cabin.

252
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:56,039
It's pretty deserted.

253
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:58,319
I couldn't find anything useful.

254
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,879
How do you feel? Is the hot water helping?

255
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:06,519
I feel like my body doesn't belong to me.

256
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:09,399
I can't feel anything.

257
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,919
There's only one other way.

258
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,119
You too.

259
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,159
Are you human, Daoming Si?

260
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,119
Stupid girl.

261
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,239
Do you know your situation?
Stop imagining things.

262
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,679
What are you doing then?

263
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,359
I thought I could warm you up
with my body.

264
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,479
You're beyond help.

265
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,239
Why did you undress?

266
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,839
Your clothes are wet.

267
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:58,999
Wearing it will only make you feel colder.

268
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,919
I can't save you
if you keep being stubborn.

269
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,879
-Are you going to undress--
-Turn around.

270
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,639
Daoming Si, don't look at me.

271
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,879
Don't touch me.

272
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,439
I'm trying to save you.

273
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,439
Just lie still.

274
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,399
You'll warm up.

275
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:08,479
<i>He's only trying to save me.</i>

276
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,599
<i>Dong Shancai, stop imagining things.</i>

277
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,039
Sleep.

278
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:21,559
We can go back once morning comes.

279
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:28,319
<i>I can't think of anything
more embarrassing.</i>

280
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:31,879
<i>Daoming Si and I are actually
hugging each other half-naked.</i>

281
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:34,559
<i>How am I going to face him again?</i>

282
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,319
<i>I can't be bothered about that now.</i>

283
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:39,119
<i>I'll sleep comfortably.</i>

284
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:42,159
<i>I'll pretend I'm hugging a big dog.</i>

285
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:44,599
<i>All safe</i>

286
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:46,639
<i>and warm.</i>

287
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,639
Why are you looking at me?

288
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:32,479
I wasn't looking at you.

289
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,599
Hurry up and get dressed.

290
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,119
Can you promise me one thing?

291
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:58,999
What?

292
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,319
Can you stop doing things that worry me?

293
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:07,799
Do you know that...

294
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:11,119
I was sick with worry last night over you?

295
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:20,399
I promise.

296
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,719
How do you feel? Better?

297
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:41,759
Yes, better.

298
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:51,879
Hey, why are you so heavy?

299
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,319
You can put me down.

300
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,599
Shancai.

301
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:29,479
Shancai.

302
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,759
I'm so glad you're okay.

303
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:34,759
I thought something happened to you.

304
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,439
It's all my fault.

305
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:38,839
Don't say that.

306
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,279
If it was you,

307
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:41,919
I'd do the same.

308
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,079
We thought you died out there.

309
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:51,599
A mere blizzard can't do anything to me.

310
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:57,839
Glad that you're safe.

311
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:00,839
Sure, we're okay.

312
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:03,559
But...

313
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:07,199
who was it that said Xiaoyou went out?

314
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:10,399
Shancai, I'm so glad you're safe.

315
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:14,079
People say that you'll be blessed
if you survive a crisis.

316
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:15,799
Yes, Shancai.

317
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:16,839
We are...

318
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,479
Thank goodness you're back.

319
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,759
If Shancai and Si
had died in the blizzard,

320
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,679
how would you make up for it?

321
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,039
Please leave, the two of you.

322
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,759
I won't allow such despicable women

323
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,599
to be under the same roof as me.

324
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:42,839
Daoming Si.

325
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,839
It's cold and snowy outside.

326
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:46,999
We'll freeze if we leave this house.

327
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,959
Please, Daoming Si. Don't kick us out.

328
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,119
Funny how that didn't cross your mind
when you lied to Shancai!

329
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,839
Shancai.

330
00:26:58,399 --> 00:26:59,719
Please forgive us.

331
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:04,159
Shancai, you're a good person.

332
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,839
You wouldn't let us
freeze to death outside.

333
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,359
You'll forgive us, right?

334
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:14,359
That's enough. Get out.

335
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:15,439
Wait.

336
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:22,879
I'm back safe and sound.

337
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,359
I hurt my foot.

338
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,799
But it's nothing serious.

339
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,159
Why don't we...

340
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:33,919
just forget about it?

341
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,559
Forget about it?

342
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:41,119
Did you forget
that you almost died out there?

343
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:43,319
If you forgive them so easily,

344
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,439
knowing how self-centered these two are,

345
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:47,719
-they'd cause even more harm.
-No.

346
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,399
This time was a misunderstanding.

347
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,279
We're willing to do anything
as long as you don't kick us out.

348
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,639
Yes, anything.

349
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,239
Daoming Si.

350
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,279
I'll punish them.

351
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:04,799
Yes. Shancai, you can punish us.

352
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:06,359
Do whatever you want.

353
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:14,719
Tell us, how are you going to punish them?

354
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,759
I'll get them...

355
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:23,639
to clean the house.

356
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:26,839
Clean the house?

357
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:28,359
That's the punishment?

358
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,919
They'll need to clean
for at least ten years.

359
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:34,159
Okay, we'll clean it right away.

360
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,559
Where's the broom?

361
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,919
Thanks, Shancai. Thanks, Daoming Si.

362
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,559
It was snowing so hard.

363
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,159
You two must be thirsty and cold.

364
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,079
How about some wine to warm up?

365
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:09,079
The blizzard was terrible last night.

366
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,559
How did you two survive?

367
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:20,519
What do you mean?

368
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:22,919
It was snowing so heavily.

369
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:23,879
Where did you go?

370
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:30,199
Could it be like what happens
in romance movies?

371
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:34,399
Holding one another
while being naked to keep warm?

372
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:43,559
-No way.
-No way.

373
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:45,079
-We guessed it.
-We guessed it.

374
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:48,759
"I'm scared, so cold.

375
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:50,359
I'm going to faint."

376
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:51,759
"Come, lean on me.

377
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,079
My chest is warm."

378
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:57,279
"Hold me tight.

379
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,919
Hold me tighter."

380
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,639
Huaze Lei.

381
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,079
You can be the blazing fire.

382
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:03,879
Hurry up.

383
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:07,199
"Feel the warmth."

384
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,359
That's enough.

385
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,999
Stop it.

386
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,559
We didn't do that.

387
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:18,439
Why are you two blushing?

388
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:20,959
Who's blushing?

389
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:22,559
I'm not.

390
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:26,559
I can't be bothered with this.
This is lame.

391
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,839
I'm going to shower.

392
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:31,599
The door is that way, sir.

393
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:40,879
I'm going too.

394
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:42,319
Hey.

395
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,119
Shancai, you're incredible.

396
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:04,279
I was going to look for you.

397
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:07,839
But seeing the blizzard, I chickened out.

398
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:11,079
It's because I was worried about you.

399
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:13,479
You're my best friend.

400
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:15,399
What am I going to tell your parents

401
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:16,959
if something happened to you?

402
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,839
Daoming Si is just as brave as you are.

403
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:23,279
When he heard you were missing,
he ran out to save you without a word.

404
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,159
I didn't expect him to show up.

405
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,319
To be honest,

406
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:33,119
the way he acted last night

407
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,279
was so different from usual.

408
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:40,039
Actually, there's another person
who was really worried.

409
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,479
Huaze Lei.

410
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:46,359
When he heard that you went out
because of Xinhui and Baihe,

411
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:48,319
he got angry and threw wine at them.

412
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:51,119
Huaze Lei threw his wine?

413
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:53,439
Did I hear that right?

414
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,079
He's such an amiable guy.

415
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:58,039
I can't believe he acted out like that.

416
00:31:58,599 --> 00:31:59,919
It must be because it was you.

417
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,919
You're a dear friend to him.

418
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:04,359
That's why he did something
he normally wouldn't have.

419
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:27,839
Huaze Lei.

420
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,599
Thank you.

421
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:31,799
I heard it all from Xiaoyou.

422
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:32,959
You're welcome.

423
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,279
It didn't sit well with me

424
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,359
how some people
could put a life in danger.

425
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:39,279
That was very irresponsible.

426
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:43,759
Anyway,

427
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:46,599
it must've been traumatic for you.

428
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,559
Are you feeling okay?

429
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,999
I'm the undying weed, Shancai.

430
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,079
I'm totally fine.

431
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:59,559
This is why people worry about you.

432
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,599
Are you worried about me?

433
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,079
That goes without saying.

434
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:20,199
<i>I could truly feel
the warmth of friendship</i>

435
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,919
<i>in this icy, foreign land.</i>

436
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:25,599
<i>Suddenly, it doesn't seem so cold.</i>

437
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:42,799
Where's Si?

438
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,159
He was just here.

439
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:48,519
Did you guys see Shancai?

440
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,599
Where is she?

441
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,039
What are you doing out here?

442
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,759
I came out for some fresh air.

443
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:16,959
You?

444
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:18,839
I came to find you.

445
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:24,959
Shancai.

446
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,559
Nobody else is around.

447
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:31,639
Do you have something to say?

448
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:35,839
Something to say?

449
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:37,999
No.

450
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:41,199
You said no without thinking.

451
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,239
What do you want me to say?

452
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:48,359
Or is there something you want to hear?

453
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:50,839
Figure it out.

454
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,199
Nobody asks the other person
what they want to hear.

455
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,439
Don't you have anything
to say to your savior?

456
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,519
I almost forgot to thank you.

457
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,519
Thank you.

458
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:16,359
Just a "thank you"?

459
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:23,239
Is "thank you" all that you owe me?

460
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,759
I still owe you 500,000 yuan.

461
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,919
I've already got
a detailed repayment plan.

462
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,399
Every month, I'll use two thirds
of my salary to pay you.

463
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:44,039
I'm going to get another job.

464
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,839
-This way--
-Nobody wants to hear that.

465
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:52,439
You want me to pay you all at once?

466
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,079
That's a little difficult for me.

467
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:58,239
I hope you can understand.

468
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:03,839
Fireworks!

469
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:13,439
Little Xiaoyou, I'm so happy
to spend time with you.

470
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:14,839
Happy New Year.

471
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:17,079
Happy New Year.

472
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:26,079
Hey, are you honestly dumb
or are you just pretending to be dumb?

473
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:29,039
It's the new year.
Why are you yelling at me?

474
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:32,639
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

475
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,879
That's because you won't say it.

476
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,199
Say what?

477
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,079
So you're not going to say it?

478
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:56,119
Fine. I'll do it then.

479
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,479
Go on.

480
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:03,719
Shancai.

481
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:06,719
I love you.

482
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:13,639
Happy New Year!

483
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,239
Happy New Year!

484
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:25,479
<i>I said it.</i>

485
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,839
<i>I really said it.</i>

486
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,039
Daoming Si.

487
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,039
One more time.

488
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,119
Shut up.

489
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:30,999
Having fun?

490
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:18,399
Mom!

491
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:20,199
I'm right here.

492
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:21,519
Keep quiet.

493
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,239
This is an important call.

494
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,119
I'm Dong Danian.

495
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:30,439
Wishing you a prosperous new year.

496
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,039
Best of luck and good fortune.

497
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:38,479
How did this happen?

498
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:39,599
Gosh.

499
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:41,879
I sprained my ankle while skiing.

500
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:43,679
It's fine now.

501
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:46,399
You clumsy girl.
You should be more careful.

502
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:50,399
How was the trip?

503
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,119
Not bad.

504
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,519
The scenery was nice.

505
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,119
We counted down to the new year.
It was fun.

506
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:58,599
Shancai.

507
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:01,479
Show us the photos you took
when you're free.

508
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,679
Tell me.

509
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:08,759
How did it go with Daoming Si this time?

510
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:11,599
I'm Dong Danian.

511
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:13,799
-Wishing you a happy new year.
-He's...

512
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:14,999
A prosperous and healthy

513
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,399
-new year.
-It's a long story.

514
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,199
What do you--

515
00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:22,079
What do you mean by "a long story"?

516
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:24,639
Well...

517
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,439
Forget it. It's too embarrassing to tell.

518
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,679
Shancai, tell us honestly.

519
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:32,599
While you were in Canada,

520
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,759
who did you stay with?

521
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:37,559
With Xiaoyou. I told you guys, right?

522
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:40,559
-You were with Xiaoyou every night?
-Yes.

523
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,039
You little whore.

524
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,479
Did you spend the night with Daoming Si?

525
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,039
I...

526
00:40:51,479 --> 00:40:53,079
What did I tell you before you left?

527
00:40:53,279 --> 00:40:55,479
I want you to have a good relationship
with a good man.

528
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:58,279
I didn't ask you to sleep around.
What happened to you?

529
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,039
I'll make that boy pay.

530
00:41:00,399 --> 00:41:01,839
How dare he bully our daughter?

531
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,119
Give me his contact number.

532
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:04,599
Dad, Mom.

533
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:06,439
It wasn't like that.

534
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:08,639
Nothing happened between us.

535
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,319
Nothing happened?

536
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:14,639
You didn't hug and kiss?

537
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:15,879
That's all right, you know.

538
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,559
What's the matter?

539
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,279
That's what we did when we were in love.

540
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:22,719
Don't compare him to me.

541
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:24,119
Besides,

542
00:41:24,799 --> 00:41:26,679
who could say no to your beauty?

543
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,639
I'm going back to my room.

544
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:30,999
-Be careful.
-Your foot...

545
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,199
Is it really okay?

546
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,919
Si, you're in a good mood.

547
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:57,759
There's only us here.

548
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:58,799
You can say it.

549
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,239
What really happened with Shancai?

550
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,239
Yeah, what happened?

551
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:06,399
What do you mean? It's like that.

552
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:09,759
"Like that" means what exactly?

553
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:12,839
Like that.

554
00:42:14,279 --> 00:42:16,719
You two were stuck together
in the blizzard.

555
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:19,199
Where were you and Shancai

556
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,159
on New Year's Eve?

557
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:27,439
I told her what I had to
on New Year's Eve.

558
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:31,279
Why didn't you do what you had to?

559
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,559
For instance, holding her close

560
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:34,479
and kissing.

561
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,719
Shouldn't you say it before doing it?

562
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,239
Why didn't you do it first
before saying it then?

563
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:54,359
I, Daoming Si, have my own way.

564
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:57,679
I decide what I want to do.
It was too noisy that night anyway.

565
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:05,359
You guys are being annoying.

566
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:06,679
Go bug Huaze Lei.

567
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:07,879
Stop bugging me.

568
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,239
Fine. I'll do it then.

569
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,199
Go on.

570
00:43:24,959 --> 00:43:25,799
Shancai.

571
00:43:27,759 --> 00:43:28,599
I love you.

572
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:40,039
-What really happened?
-What really happened?
