00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:30,118
EPISODE 31

4
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:47,358
Lei.

5
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:49,198
Why did you bring me here?

6
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,518
After experiencing so many things,

7
00:01:56,758 --> 00:01:59,478
I think you haven't let out the feelings

8
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:01,558
that you have bottled up inside.

9
00:02:05,598 --> 00:02:07,038
Don't underestimate me.

10
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:09,278
I'm Shancai, the weed in the garden.

11
00:02:10,718 --> 00:02:11,558
Shancai.

12
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:14,078
You have to learn to express your emotions

13
00:02:14,678 --> 00:02:17,198
in order to face reality
and make the right decisions.

14
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:20,318
So that you'll see things clearly.

15
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:24,198
I wasn't being emotional.

16
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:25,678
I was just--

17
00:02:34,518 --> 00:02:37,198
When you're with me,
you don't need to hide your emotions.

18
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:38,838
I didn't--

19
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:44,318
Release your emotions.

20
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:49,078
Release all your sadness,
grievance, and pain.

21
00:03:05,798 --> 00:03:06,838
Do you feel better?

22
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:10,078
Thank you.

23
00:03:14,198 --> 00:03:15,038
Relax.

24
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:17,238
You can rest.

25
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:18,958
You should rest.

26
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:21,638
I'll always be by your side.

27
00:03:22,398 --> 00:03:23,598
Just be yourself.

28
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:45,558
Lei, you've always avoided
getting involved before.

29
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:47,038
Why is it different this time?

30
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:50,078
Lei, do you know what you're doing?

31
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,078
I really don't understand you anymore.

32
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:56,198
Meizuo, it's not that
you don't understand me.

33
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:59,118
The circumstances are different this time.

34
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:02,478
Do you think Daoming Si and Shancai
can be together again?

35
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:03,798
We're not sure.

36
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:07,598
But since you got involved,
this matter has gotten worse.

37
00:04:07,678 --> 00:04:09,158
There's no more room for negotiation.

38
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:11,158
Maybe.

39
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:13,358
What does Si think?

40
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:15,198
You're even smiling.

41
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:18,198
Do you know Si got so drunk last night?

42
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:20,398
He said he was celebrating
for you and Shancai.

43
00:04:21,158 --> 00:04:22,198
What celebration?

44
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:26,158
Ximen and I knew
that he just wanted to escape the pain.

45
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:30,238
You know we're not siding with Si.

46
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:33,398
But do you really need to do this?

47
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:36,438
Must Shancai be Jing's replacement?

48
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:41,278
Don't say things like that.

49
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:42,878
Shancai is not Jing's replacement.

50
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:44,918
They're different individuals.

51
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:46,678
No person can replace another.

52
00:04:50,118 --> 00:04:51,638
You even asked for a fair competition.

53
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:53,518
You're just adding insult to injury!

54
00:04:53,638 --> 00:04:54,678
Ximen.

55
00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:57,038
Lei is not like that.
Don't say those things to him.

56
00:04:57,718 --> 00:04:59,398
Lei, explain yourself.

57
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:04,198
Instead of arguing with me,

58
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:06,798
you should remind Si

59
00:05:08,278 --> 00:05:11,238
not to escape reality
and be honest with himself.

60
00:05:21,518 --> 00:05:22,798
I'm so tired.

61
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:30,198
Only a few of these youngsters
are good at doing their job.

62
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:33,158
Why are they not like Shancai?

63
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,278
Speaking of which,

64
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:41,598
how long has she been back
from the fishing village?

65
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:45,918
Has she forgotten about me?

66
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:56,718
Shancai.

67
00:05:57,518 --> 00:05:58,358
Mrs. Yu?

68
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:00,078
Why did you call me?

69
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,078
<i>You even dare to ask me why I'm calling.</i>

70
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,078
How long have you been back?

71
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:08,558
<i>You didn't even tell me.</i>

72
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:09,878
<i>You didn't come to see me.</i>

73
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:12,918
<i>Have you forgotten about me?</i>

74
00:06:14,518 --> 00:06:16,758
Mrs. Yu, I didn't do it on purpose.

75
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:19,798
I was busy moving into my new place.

76
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:21,718
And catching up with school.

77
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,318
-I'm--
<i>-Why are you still babbling?</i>

78
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:24,958
<i>Seven o'clock tonight</i>

79
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:27,638
<i>at Suzhehui Restaurant.</i>

80
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:29,398
<i>-See you there.
</i>-Hey.

81
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:30,598
Hello?

82
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:35,398
Mrs. Yu is so energetic.

83
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:43,278
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

84
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:48,718
Shancai.

85
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:50,638
Tell me the truth.

86
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,038
To you youngsters,

87
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,318
am I old and useless?

88
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:00,718
Is that why you didn't bother
to come see me after coming back

89
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:02,598
from the fishing village?

90
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:05,358
Mrs. Yu, why would you think that?

91
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:07,318
I missed you.

92
00:07:07,518 --> 00:07:09,238
Why wouldn't I want to see you?

93
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:11,958
I was just afraid I'd cause you trouble.

94
00:07:12,758 --> 00:07:14,678
You won't cause me any trouble.

95
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:16,838
But can you tell

96
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:20,918
that I wanted to trouble you
with something?

97
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:23,118
All right.

98
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:24,438
Tell me, Mrs. Yu.

99
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:27,318
If you need my help,
I'll be there anytime.

100
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:28,758
All right.

101
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:33,318
But what can I help you with?

102
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:35,838
You can help me with a lot of things.

103
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:37,438
Among them,

104
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:41,278
you should always visit me

105
00:07:41,358 --> 00:07:42,398
and see if I'm still alive.

106
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:46,518
Mrs. Yu, don't say that.

107
00:07:47,078 --> 00:07:49,638
They say that good people don't live long.

108
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:52,318
You'd probably live to be a hundred.

109
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:54,918
You're mocking me.

110
00:07:55,238 --> 00:07:58,758
That means you still have a strong
fighting spirit.

111
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:02,598
Here.

112
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:03,958
Eat some vegetables.

113
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:05,398
I ordered all this.

114
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:08,278
-Finish it or you're not going home.
-Okay.

115
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:12,598
Eat some more.

116
00:08:16,118 --> 00:08:18,198
How's your new home?

117
00:08:19,518 --> 00:08:20,478
It's quite nice.

118
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:22,198
It's a good thing Huaze Lei helped me.

119
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:25,318
And my friends decorated the place for me.

120
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,118
How is everything with you and Si?

121
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:41,398
Daoming Si and I

122
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:45,438
have broken up.

123
00:08:47,038 --> 00:08:48,678
You broke up?

124
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:51,198
Yes.

125
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:54,758
He and I

126
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:57,718
have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

127
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:00,038
What?

128
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:03,558
So,

129
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:06,078
you've given up?

130
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:10,318
Mrs. Yu.

131
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,838
I can't win over Daoming Si's mom.

132
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:17,958
I'm powerless

133
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,878
when it comes to her.

134
00:09:22,558 --> 00:09:25,238
A person like me
wouldn't make Daoming Si happy.

135
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:34,998
Actually,

136
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,278
logically,

137
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,558
I should stay as far away as possible.

138
00:09:42,118 --> 00:09:43,278
You're good for nothing.

139
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:46,038
You're so irresponsible.

140
00:09:49,478 --> 00:09:51,158
I'm sorry, Mrs. Yu.

141
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:56,118
I really did my best.

142
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,038
"Might as well not start a journey

143
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,078
if you're going to stop in the middle."

144
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:06,518
Do you think I'd say that?

145
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:10,318
It's never easy to survive

146
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:12,878
in this world.

147
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,558
You'll encounter a lot of hardships.

148
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,798
There's no guaranteed outcome.

149
00:10:20,158 --> 00:10:21,318
Shancai.

150
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:24,558
You chose to give up,

151
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:28,078
to extinguish your passionate feelings

152
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,038
by throwing them to the wind.

153
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:35,718
You chose others' happiness

154
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:38,678
over yours.

155
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:42,518
I know

156
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:45,118
these things

157
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,678
are even harder to do.

158
00:10:55,838 --> 00:10:57,318
At your age,

159
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:00,598
you can completely ignore

160
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:06,638
your friends' problems.

161
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:09,478
But you didn't.

162
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:16,078
You're a good kid.

163
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,038
I know better than others

164
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:20,678
that sometimes,

165
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:23,398
reality is very cruel.

166
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:26,598
And hard to overcome.

167
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:29,958
However,

168
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:32,878
you have to make a decision.

169
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:39,158
You already did your best.

170
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:43,518
If you want to stop now,

171
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:47,038
then stop and rest.

172
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:52,038
It's not your fault.

173
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:54,558
Don't feel hopeless.

174
00:11:54,638 --> 00:11:55,798
Don't blame yourself.

175
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:01,598
Stop crying.

176
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:05,358
Remember.

177
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:07,518
You didn't do anything wrong.

178
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:23,038
I should make a decision.

179
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,518
What I can do right now

180
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:28,598
is to eat a good meal.

181
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:31,478
I can only start fresh on a full stomach.

182
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:32,838
That's a must.

183
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:35,118
-Eat.
-Okay.

184
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:38,918
Eat more.

185
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:41,198
Here.

186
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:50,278
Mrs. Yu.

187
00:12:50,798 --> 00:12:52,158
Take care.

188
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,398
Let me know when you get home.

189
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:54,838
How fussy.

190
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:57,038
Are you the housekeeper or am I?

191
00:12:57,598 --> 00:12:58,718
Little Miss Housekeeper.

192
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:02,238
I'm so happy to see you today.

193
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:04,078
We have to do this again next time.

194
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:05,878
Of course.

195
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:12,958
What's the matter?

196
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:16,518
Nothing.

197
00:13:29,798 --> 00:13:31,798
Mrs. Yu.

198
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:34,238
Mrs. Yu!

199
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:38,598
Mrs. Yu!

200
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:45,078
Look behind you, ma'am.

201
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,238
Mrs. Yu!

202
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:55,558
-Mrs. Yu.
-What is it?

203
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:57,758
I...

204
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,718
I want to tell you how I really feel.

205
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:02,758
I hope at least one person

206
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:05,918
can know how I really feel.

207
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:11,518
Mrs. Yu.

208
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:14,238
Actually, I...

209
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:17,678
I really like Daoming Si.

210
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,238
I know I won't be able to forget

211
00:14:21,998 --> 00:14:23,598
everything he did for me.

212
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:30,158
But I can't be selfish
and hurt everyone around me

213
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:33,238
because of my love for him.

214
00:14:36,438 --> 00:14:37,358
So I...

215
00:14:37,438 --> 00:14:40,238
I can't keep going back and forth
with him anymore.

216
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:43,718
I had to end it.

217
00:15:10,318 --> 00:15:11,478
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

218
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,958
<i>I wonder what you're doing now.</i>

219
00:15:17,238 --> 00:15:18,358
<i>I miss you.</i>

220
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:21,638
<i>I really miss you.</i>

221
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:26,238
<i>But our worlds are completely different.</i>

222
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:30,078
<i>Maybe our time together
has come to an end.</i>

223
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,558
<i>Let's go back to being friends.</i>

224
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:37,198
<i>And treat each other casually.</i>

225
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:28,718
Si's here.

226
00:16:33,478 --> 00:16:34,918
I thought you're not coming today.

227
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:36,918
It's not good to cut class.

228
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:37,918
Cut the crap.

229
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,398
Why should I cut classes?

230
00:16:40,118 --> 00:16:41,318
What time is it now?

231
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:42,758
-Why are you late?
-Who knows?

232
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:44,158
I think so too.

233
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:46,198
Good morning, everyone.

234
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:47,878
-Morning.
-Morning, guys.

235
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:57,678
Morning, Shancai.

236
00:16:58,718 --> 00:16:59,558
Shancai.

237
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,118
Are you all right?

238
00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:03,998
Why are you asking that?
Of course I'm all right.

239
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:05,838
I'm going to class.

240
00:17:05,918 --> 00:17:07,918
The professor is really strict.

241
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:09,518
We're doomed if we're late.

242
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:10,638
I'll go now.

243
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:14,838
Shancai.

244
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:15,918
Our classroom is here.

245
00:17:15,998 --> 00:17:17,838
Yes. Where are you going?

246
00:17:41,438 --> 00:17:44,278
Don't you think Shancai
is really strange today?

247
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:46,518
She's not just strange,

248
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:48,558
but it seems like she's possessed.

249
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:50,518
She's forcing her smile,

250
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:52,478
pretending like nothing happened,

251
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,318
and acting so unlike her.

252
00:17:56,598 --> 00:17:58,278
Si, what's going on with you two?

253
00:18:11,238 --> 00:18:13,558
If she showed me any affection at all,

254
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:16,078
I'd be willing to do anything for her.

255
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:18,198
Elope.

256
00:18:19,158 --> 00:18:20,438
Or even fight with my mom.

257
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:23,918
But that never happened.

258
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:29,998
So...

259
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:31,798
I'll leave it as that.

260
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:53,598
Is it really over between them?

261
00:18:54,678 --> 00:18:57,078
Who knows what kind of tricks
they are playing now?

262
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:13,958
Hey, Daoming Si's ex-fiancée.

263
00:19:14,158 --> 00:19:15,638
Can you stop following me?

264
00:19:15,718 --> 00:19:17,558
I want you to take me to Shancai.

265
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:19,158
You can just call her.

266
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:21,038
That won't be any fun.

267
00:19:21,598 --> 00:19:23,678
I want to catch her off guard
and surprise her.

268
00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:27,238
By the way, I got her a small gift.
She'll surely like it.

269
00:19:28,638 --> 00:19:29,518
What is it?

270
00:19:30,518 --> 00:19:31,838
What is it...

271
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,198
Take it out and see.

272
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:37,638
Wait.

273
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:41,998
Like Daoming Si, would you
place a toy inside to prank me?

274
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:45,038
Of course I won't.

275
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:48,718
What's that?

276
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:50,798
A cactus.

277
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:53,198
You lied.

278
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,358
You didn't let me finish.

279
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:58,038
I mean of course I won't miss

280
00:19:58,318 --> 00:20:00,358
-the chance to prank you.
-You...

281
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:01,998
Xiaozi.

282
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:05,878
Meizuo, Ximen.

283
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,598
Have you seen Shancai?

284
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:11,638
I'm not sure where she is.

285
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,718
She's always with Huaze Lei lately.

286
00:20:15,678 --> 00:20:16,958
Does that mean

287
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:19,558
Si and Shancai are really over?

288
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:22,598
What do you mean?

289
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:24,838
Are they still avoiding each other?

290
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:26,558
No, not anymore.

291
00:20:27,118 --> 00:20:29,358
Si said he doesn't want
anything to do with Shancai.

292
00:20:30,678 --> 00:20:33,998
And Lei said he'll pursue Shancai.

293
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:35,438
Wait.

294
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:39,318
That means they didn't make up
after Shancai came back.

295
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:41,078
Instead, she became closer to Lei?

296
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:43,638
I think so.

297
00:20:44,398 --> 00:20:45,318
Then Si...

298
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:46,958
Is Si broken-hearted?

299
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:51,598
He deserves it.

300
00:21:09,278 --> 00:21:10,918
Where are you going?

301
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,198
Let's rest a bit.

302
00:21:13,758 --> 00:21:15,158
Your legs are so long.

303
00:21:15,238 --> 00:21:17,278
Your stride is so wide.
I can't catch up with you.

304
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:18,878
I'm not saying my legs are short.

305
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:19,878
My shoes today...

306
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:25,238
Why did you suddenly stop?

307
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:31,078
Go home. Stop following me.

308
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,078
I'll call you a cab.

309
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,358
-Then I'll leave.
-No.

310
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:37,918
When will you stop walking around?

311
00:21:43,878 --> 00:21:44,878
Si.

312
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:47,158
If you're unhappy, just say it.

313
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:49,398
Why are you pretending?

314
00:21:50,078 --> 00:21:50,918
Hey.

315
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:52,238
Daoming Si.

316
00:21:52,518 --> 00:21:53,438
Daoming Si!

317
00:22:44,718 --> 00:22:46,318
Why are you so annoying?

318
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:48,518
Si.

319
00:22:48,718 --> 00:22:50,198
Since when did you become so gentle?

320
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:53,438
I remember the first time that I met you,

321
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:55,998
you really left me alone, barefooted.

322
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:57,918
You're different this time.

323
00:22:58,758 --> 00:23:00,318
It must be because of Shancai.

324
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:04,158
People say that a good woman
can change a man.

325
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,798
I think it's true.

326
00:23:08,318 --> 00:23:11,198
Between me and Lei, who would you choose?

327
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:13,478
You and Lei?

328
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:17,158
Based on gentleness, you lose.

329
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,558
-Never mind. Go home.
-No.

330
00:23:21,678 --> 00:23:23,118
I was kidding.

331
00:23:23,678 --> 00:23:25,598
If Shancai didn't choose you,

332
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,678
she must have her own reasons.

333
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:30,318
Reasons?

334
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:35,918
What an excuse.

335
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:38,398
I've had enough of the same excuse!

336
00:23:38,758 --> 00:23:39,918
Whatever it is,

337
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:41,718
regardless if it's wrong or right,

338
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:43,998
is it always forgivable
because she has her own reasons?

339
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:48,398
Why are girls like that?

340
00:23:48,598 --> 00:23:50,398
It's just an excuse
for not being firm enough!

341
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:52,438
Si...

342
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,278
I'm not sure what I'm saying.

343
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:02,598
I can't think straight now.

344
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:05,038
Go home.

345
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:08,198
I said go home!

346
00:24:14,758 --> 00:24:16,238
You still have me!

347
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:57,438
I was kidding!

348
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,518
See? You got scared, right?

349
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,678
Were you scared?

350
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:02,398
Did you get scared? Did you?

351
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:06,078
Seeing your serious face,
I just wanted to tease you.

352
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:08,638
It's so much fun, you know?

353
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:13,798
-Xiaozi.
-All right.

354
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:15,518
I'm leaving.

355
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,518
You should also go home early.

356
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:24,598
Daoming Si.

357
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:28,998
That brow of yours.

358
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:30,998
Don't keep it wrinkled like that, okay?

359
00:25:32,158 --> 00:25:34,518
When you do that,
you look like an old man.

360
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:36,198
Okay?

361
00:25:58,238 --> 00:25:59,198
<i>Shancai.</i>

362
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:01,438
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

363
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:05,638
<i>I'm such a bad friend.</i>

364
00:26:07,998 --> 00:26:08,838
<i>But...</i>

365
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,598
<i>I really can't bear</i>

366
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:14,398
<i>seeing Si in so much pain.</i>

367
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:45,238
SHANGHAI MINGDE UNIVERSITY
19TH GRADUATION CEREMONY

368
00:27:21,678 --> 00:27:23,518
You played really well today.

369
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:25,158
-Yes.
-It was superb.

370
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:40,958
What can I do for you?

371
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,118
Huaze Lei, happy graduation.

372
00:27:44,878 --> 00:27:46,318
You're not here to congratulate me.

373
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,638
Do you really like Shancai?

374
00:28:02,518 --> 00:28:04,438
Tell me. What do you want?

375
00:28:06,758 --> 00:28:10,118
If you really like Shancai,

376
00:28:11,478 --> 00:28:12,718
I hope you can let Si give up.

377
00:28:15,518 --> 00:28:16,878
I'm not responsible for that.

378
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:22,158
If Si really gives up,
a part of F4 would die too.

379
00:28:25,478 --> 00:28:27,238
Then you're just going to let him suffer?

380
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,398
I know Si said he already gave up
on Shancai.

381
00:28:31,478 --> 00:28:32,518
But he didn't.

382
00:28:36,238 --> 00:28:38,518
And I think it's better
if we don't make it worse.

383
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:42,078
I can't keep on seeing him like this.

384
00:28:44,518 --> 00:28:45,838
You'll help me, right?

385
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:50,038
Sorry, I can't.

386
00:28:51,118 --> 00:28:52,118
Hey, wait.

387
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:55,638
I admit...

388
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:58,958
I have my own motives.

389
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,038
If you and Shancai are together,

390
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:04,718
maybe

391
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:07,198
Si would accept me too.

392
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:16,918
I know I'm a very bad and selfish friend.

393
00:29:17,998 --> 00:29:20,198
But they want to give up
on each other already.

394
00:29:21,998 --> 00:29:23,878
I'm just fighting for my feelings.

395
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:34,758
Maybe we'd both be happy

396
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:38,038
after this.

397
00:29:48,318 --> 00:29:49,158
Huaze Lei.

398
00:29:51,718 --> 00:29:52,678
I'm begging you.

399
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:01,158
Can't you help me?

400
00:30:10,598 --> 00:30:11,718
All right.

401
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:14,758
What do you want me to do?

402
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:25,478
Let's take a picture here.

403
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:29,278
This is for you.
Take care after graduation.

404
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:32,478
If you go to Sanya, go to our banana farm.

405
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:36,238
Our bananas are golden yellow,
soft, and sweet.

406
00:30:36,598 --> 00:30:38,718
I sent a box to Professor Ma once.

407
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:40,038
He said nothing but compliments.

408
00:30:41,118 --> 00:30:45,038
When I think about not seeing
F4 anymore next year,

409
00:30:45,598 --> 00:30:48,238
the campus seems less attractive.

410
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:50,398
That's right.

411
00:30:50,638 --> 00:30:53,318
My motivation to come to school decreased.

412
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:56,478
-There.
-Let's take a picture.

413
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:57,918
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

414
00:30:57,998 --> 00:30:59,918
-Say cheese.
-Say cheese.

415
00:31:01,118 --> 00:31:02,918
-Happy graduation.
-Let's take a picture later.

416
00:31:04,158 --> 00:31:05,958
-Happy graduation.
-Come here.

417
00:31:06,838 --> 00:31:07,838
Over here.

418
00:31:08,878 --> 00:31:10,278
-Let's take a picture?
-Okay.

419
00:31:10,998 --> 00:31:12,038
Come on.

420
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:19,078
You woke up late.

421
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:20,638
You're teasing me.

422
00:31:21,718 --> 00:31:22,758
Hello, Xiaozi?

423
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:25,438
Now?

424
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:27,358
At the Math building courtyard?

425
00:31:27,598 --> 00:31:28,998
You're at my school?

426
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,638
Hey.

427
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:33,478
-Come here.
-Okay.

428
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,398
One more.

429
00:31:44,998 --> 00:31:47,678
Didn't Xiaozi ask me to come here?

430
00:31:48,238 --> 00:31:49,638
Why don't I see her?

431
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,438
-What's that sound?
-It's the violin.

432
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:17,358
It sounds so nice.

433
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:18,678
He's so handsome.

434
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:25,558
What's Huaze Lei doing?

435
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:27,318
-He's so good.
-What's he doing?

436
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:28,958
-Who is he playing for?
-I'm not sure.

437
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:32,198
Why is Lei playing here?

438
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:34,518
He said he'll just play
at the ceremony, right?

439
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:39,358
Isn't that Shancai?

440
00:32:40,198 --> 00:32:42,638
Is Lei playing the violin for Shancai?

441
00:32:50,358 --> 00:32:52,558
<i>It's been a while since I saw
Lei play the violin.</i>

442
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:54,758
<i>The last time I saw him play,</i>

443
00:32:54,838 --> 00:32:56,518
<i>he's still the same person
who always said,</i>

444
00:32:56,598 --> 00:32:58,758
<i>"I really have no interest
in other people's business."</i>

445
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:02,318
<i>Without realizing it,
a lot of time has passed.</i>

446
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:05,478
<i>F4's graduating already.</i>

447
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:08,678
<i>A lot has happened in the past year.</i>

448
00:33:30,518 --> 00:33:33,318
That will be the last song
I play for you in Mingde University.

449
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,918
Shancai, I dedicated it to you.

450
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:56,838
What are you doing?

451
00:34:00,078 --> 00:34:01,198
No way.

452
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:02,638
Huaze Lei and Shancai?

453
00:34:03,318 --> 00:34:04,638
What's going on with them?

454
00:34:04,718 --> 00:34:06,918
Huaze Lei is playing the violin
for Shancai?

455
00:34:06,998 --> 00:34:07,838
Wow.

456
00:34:07,918 --> 00:34:09,958
I really envy Dong Shancai.

457
00:34:10,558 --> 00:34:12,318
-Don't--
-Don't push me away yet.

458
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:16,558
Before I go, please give me some time.

459
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:19,638
Lei.

460
00:34:21,118 --> 00:34:23,318
I'll be happy...

461
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:26,038
if you're happy.

462
00:35:33,918 --> 00:35:34,878
Si?

463
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:39,398
Hello?

464
00:35:41,318 --> 00:35:42,478
You want to see me?

465
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:44,798
Sure.

466
00:35:45,038 --> 00:35:47,638
I'll wait for you at the coffee shop
near your school.

467
00:35:48,638 --> 00:35:49,478
Okay.

468
00:36:22,998 --> 00:36:23,918
Xiaozi?

469
00:36:46,398 --> 00:36:47,358
Shancai.

470
00:36:47,598 --> 00:36:48,558
Sorry.

471
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:52,678
What happened today
was planned by Huaze Lei and myself.

472
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:54,758
You know already, right?

473
00:36:56,438 --> 00:36:57,398
Yes.

474
00:36:57,598 --> 00:37:00,478
So what exactly is going on?

475
00:37:01,078 --> 00:37:02,438
Isn't it obvious?

476
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:06,198
A low-key person like Huaze Lei
played the violin for you

477
00:37:06,478 --> 00:37:08,558
in front of everyone
and he even hugged you.

478
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:10,358
He's making a love confession.

479
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:12,118
A love confession?

480
00:37:14,638 --> 00:37:16,518
Aren't you going to accept him?

481
00:37:17,078 --> 00:37:18,998
You really liked him before.

482
00:37:21,398 --> 00:37:22,478
I'm not sure.

483
00:37:24,438 --> 00:37:25,558
Before,

484
00:37:26,158 --> 00:37:29,878
I'd feel nervous for no reason
when I'm with him.

485
00:37:30,078 --> 00:37:33,238
I'm not sure when it started,
but seeing him now

486
00:37:34,158 --> 00:37:37,438
makes me feel very safe and secure.

487
00:37:41,518 --> 00:37:43,358
He's being so nice to you.

488
00:37:44,558 --> 00:37:45,878
Aren't you the least bit affected?

489
00:37:47,918 --> 00:37:49,158
Right now,

490
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:53,318
there is no other place in my heart
to love anyone.

491
00:37:57,038 --> 00:37:58,318
Is it because of Si?

492
00:38:02,718 --> 00:38:04,078
Shancai, if...

493
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,918
I mean,

494
00:38:06,438 --> 00:38:08,758
if there's someone

495
00:38:09,878 --> 00:38:12,358
who can comfort Si's pain,

496
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:14,278
would...

497
00:38:16,198 --> 00:38:17,478
Would you mind?

498
00:38:26,718 --> 00:38:28,878
If there's such a person,

499
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:31,758
I'd be really happy.

500
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:34,638
I hope

501
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:38,758
that his suffering will end with me.

502
00:38:41,038 --> 00:38:42,278
Do you really mean it?

503
00:38:42,878 --> 00:38:44,078
It can be anyone?

504
00:38:45,478 --> 00:38:46,318
Yes.

505
00:38:47,118 --> 00:38:48,558
It can be anyone.

506
00:38:51,558 --> 00:38:53,158
When Si's with me,

507
00:38:53,878 --> 00:38:55,558
he suffers as much as me.

508
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:01,918
So if there is someone
who can make him happy,

509
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:05,238
I'd be happy for him too.

510
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:17,558
Xiaozi, are you waiting for someone?

511
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:19,878
I...

512
00:39:20,398 --> 00:39:21,278
Yes.

513
00:39:23,918 --> 00:39:25,238
-Why is this so hot?
-Are you hurt?

514
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:30,878
Shancai, isn't it time
for you to go to work?

515
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:31,918
Don't be late.

516
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:35,118
Yes, I have to go to work.

517
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:36,238
I'll go now.

518
00:39:41,558 --> 00:39:42,678
Shancai.

519
00:39:50,158 --> 00:39:52,358
I really like being your friend.

520
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,518
Me too.

521
00:40:09,278 --> 00:40:12,358
<i>Today, Xiaozi looked really nervous.</i>

522
00:40:12,998 --> 00:40:15,038
<i>She seemed like
she wanted to say something.</i>

523
00:40:15,798 --> 00:40:17,798
<i>And she was speaking hesitantly.</i>

524
00:40:18,478 --> 00:40:21,558
<i>And why would she be helping Lei?</i>

525
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,678
Sorry I asked you to come so suddenly.

526
00:40:42,758 --> 00:40:44,478
It's fine. I'm free anyway.

527
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:48,158
<i>Turns out Xiaozi was waiting
for Daoming Si.</i>

528
00:40:49,398 --> 00:40:50,398
Sir, what are you having?

529
00:40:50,478 --> 00:40:51,638
-I'll order later.
-Sure.

530
00:40:57,358 --> 00:40:58,478
Xiaozi.

531
00:41:06,478 --> 00:41:07,598
Find a nice guy.

532
00:41:11,518 --> 00:41:13,078
It's not possible for us.

533
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:14,998
For the longest time,

534
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:16,678
Shancai is all I can think of.

535
00:41:29,398 --> 00:41:30,838
You finally said it.

536
00:41:30,918 --> 00:41:32,358
I thought you'd say something else.

537
00:41:32,438 --> 00:41:34,078
I'm so relieved, you know?

538
00:41:35,518 --> 00:41:37,758
I thought you're here

539
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:41,118
because you wanted to forget Shancai
and be with me again.

540
00:41:41,478 --> 00:41:43,318
I'm so relieved that you said that.

541
00:41:44,798 --> 00:41:46,798
How can I go through that again?

542
00:41:46,878 --> 00:41:48,038
That's right.

543
00:41:48,718 --> 00:41:49,838
I wasn't wrong about you.

544
00:41:53,518 --> 00:41:55,278
I'll always treat you as a good friend.

545
00:41:57,078 --> 00:42:00,038
You consider me as a friend
but you consider Shancai as a woman?

546
00:42:04,478 --> 00:42:05,558
Daoming Si.

547
00:42:07,518 --> 00:42:08,638
In our next life,

548
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:13,158
consider me as a woman too.

549
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:16,838
Stupid girl.

550
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:26,398
<i>He's smiling.</i>

551
00:42:27,238 --> 00:42:29,518
<i>I haven't seen his smile for a long time.</i>

552
00:42:31,158 --> 00:42:34,318
<i>I'm not sure why I'm happy for him.</i>

553
