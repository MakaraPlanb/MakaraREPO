00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:30,166
EPISODE 3

4
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:45,326
Don't be mad.

5
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:47,086
Si isn't a bad person.

6
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:49,246
He's just very immature sometimes.

7
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:50,606
He can't help himself.

8
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:54,166
Jing.

9
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:56,366
I can do it myself.

10
00:01:57,806 --> 00:01:58,646
All right.

11
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:08,646
I've known Lei for many years.

12
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:11,086
This is the first time
I've seen him so agitated.

13
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:14,486
You must be very important to him.

14
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:17,606
That's impossible.

15
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:19,886
Huaze Lei likes you, Jing.

16
00:02:23,286 --> 00:02:24,126
I guess.

17
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,766
Do you like Huaze Lei too?

18
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:38,326
Your clothes and shoes are wet.

19
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:41,086
I have some clean clothes.

20
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,126
You can wear them.

21
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:44,646
I don't need to change.

22
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:50,166
Girls should always be clean and stylish.

23
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:51,606
Put them on.

24
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:00,646
Thank you, Jing.

25
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:12,846
Those shoes are so pretty.

26
00:03:20,126 --> 00:03:22,446
Every girl should have
a pair of nice shoes.

27
00:03:23,126 --> 00:03:25,966
They can take you to beautiful places.

28
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:37,446
Shancai, are you okay?

29
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:39,446
I'm fine.

30
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:42,006
Are you wearing new shoes?

31
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:43,046
They look nice.

32
00:03:44,046 --> 00:03:45,646
Jing gave them to me.

33
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:47,766
Qinghe.

34
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:49,926
Today was so embarrassing.

35
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:52,806
Shancai, I'm sorry.

36
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:55,646
When Daoming Si was picking on you,
I should have punched him.

37
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:57,926
No, you can't win against him.

38
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:00,646
You're not the one he's picking on.

39
00:04:01,646 --> 00:04:02,846
If he picks on you again,

40
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:04,566
I'll never forgive him. I...

41
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:06,366
I'll start learning taekwondo.

42
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:09,166
I'm sorry, Qinghe.

43
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:12,406
Because of me, you got into trouble.

44
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,366
What are you talking about?

45
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:17,846
It's very challenging to be able
to fight with people like F4.

46
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,246
Also, I can stand by your side.

47
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:22,246
I think it's meaningful and fun.

48
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:26,446
-Fun?
-Yes, just like Fantasy Westward Journey.

49
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:28,886
I used to be so weak,
I couldn't beat anyone.

50
00:04:29,446 --> 00:04:30,846
But you encouraged me,

51
00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:32,886
now I can even beat
the bosses in the game.

52
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:35,286
Together, we can beat the whole world.

53
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:38,046
So, I worried about you for nothing.

54
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:41,166
By the way,

55
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,526
my family has a villa in Sanya.

56
00:04:44,086 --> 00:04:44,926
A villa?

57
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:49,046
Do you want to go there
during the national holiday?

58
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:53,006
Do you think I can go with my allowance?

59
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:55,366
We're friends. Money's not an issue.

60
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:57,966
Trust me, it's really fun there.

61
00:04:58,046 --> 00:04:59,486
There's a waterfall and an aquarium.

62
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,366
My dad was going to take my aunts there,

63
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:03,646
but my uncle...

64
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:05,006
My uncle's kid got married,

65
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:06,646
so they canceled.

66
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:10,486
It will be just the two of us.

67
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:23,606
Shancai.

68
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:24,806
Shancai, what's wrong?

69
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:26,446
Shancai.

70
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:28,126
Help!

71
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:34,286
Three times a day.

72
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:37,006
-One pill each time.
-I'm telling you,

73
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:39,606
if she doesn't get better,
we still have to pay tuition

74
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:41,686
-even if she's not going.
-One pill each time.

75
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:44,286
If she can't go to class, she'll miss out.

76
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:45,366
Yeah.

77
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:47,086
The tuition is very expensive.

78
00:05:52,806 --> 00:05:53,926
Don't listen to your mom.

79
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,046
The tuition is very expensive.

80
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:58,766
Here you go, sweetheart.

81
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:01,446
Let me see.

82
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:03,006
You're getting better.

83
00:06:03,486 --> 00:06:05,206
Do I need to take that many pills?

84
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:08,446
If you don't take them, you'll get worse.

85
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:11,806
Yes, you should listen to the doctor.

86
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,126
Who is it?

87
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:23,006
Shancai, your classmate
is here to see you.

88
00:06:23,086 --> 00:06:24,646
Who is it? Qinghe?

89
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:28,046
No, it's a tall and handsome boy.

90
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:29,966
-Shancai, come here.
-Handsome?

91
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:31,446
Let me see how handsome he is.

92
00:06:36,046 --> 00:06:37,646
Am I looking into a mirror?

93
00:06:37,926 --> 00:06:40,726
He's so handsome and so tall.

94
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:43,806
You're too kind.

95
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:46,206
You didn't have to bring all these gifts.

96
00:06:50,446 --> 00:06:52,046
How dare you come to my house?

97
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:53,646
Dad, Mom, kick him out.

98
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:55,686
He's Daoming Si,
the guy that made me sick.

99
00:06:56,686 --> 00:06:59,566
Daoming Si? Do you mean that Daoming Si?

100
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:03,126
The son of Daoming Feng,
the famous businesswoman?

101
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:06,046
My mother succeeded
because she worked hard.

102
00:07:09,006 --> 00:07:09,966
Cut out the act.

103
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:13,406
You're an immature jerk
who picks on everyone.

104
00:07:15,046 --> 00:07:17,606
I think Shancai
must have misunderstood me.

105
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:19,766
I'm here to apologize.

106
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:22,406
Yes, he's a guest at our house.

107
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,606
Be polite.

108
00:07:24,406 --> 00:07:27,886
Daoming Si, Shancai never thinks
before she talks.

109
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:30,526
-Please don't be offended.
-Yes.

110
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:33,886
We're very honored that you could visit
our humble abode today.

111
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:35,446
-Yes.
-Please come in.

112
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:36,966
-Right here.
-Come in.

113
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:52,366
Your house looks small,

114
00:07:52,726 --> 00:07:55,566
but I never thought
that it would be this small.

115
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:57,806
That's because you're tall, Daoming Si.

116
00:07:58,286 --> 00:08:00,526
-It's perfect for us.
-Yes.

117
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:04,486
Are you done, Daoming Si?
Thank you for visiting.

118
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:06,686
The door's over there. You can go now.

119
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,366
Daoming Si,

120
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,486
Shancai still has a bit of a fever.

121
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:13,766
That's why she's saying rude things.
Please don't be mad.

122
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:14,846
Yes.

123
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:16,806
We're preparing dinner now.

124
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:19,006
-Yes.
-If you don't mind,

125
00:08:19,086 --> 00:08:21,646
would you be willing
to have dinner with us?

126
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:28,646
I think that Daoming Si wouldn't like
eating the normal food we eat.

127
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:31,206
Our food isn't delicious at all.

128
00:08:31,286 --> 00:08:33,886
If you don't like it
and throw it in my face,

129
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:35,966
my mom will beat you up.

130
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:39,446
That's nonsense. Do I look mean?

131
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,846
You're the nicest mom I've ever seen.

132
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:46,086
Yes. I'm really good at cooking.

133
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,246
Why don't you have dinner here?

134
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:49,886
I'll have to agree.

135
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:51,326
Wonderful.

136
00:08:57,326 --> 00:08:59,366
Here. Try my signature dish.

137
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:01,726
-Sweet and sour pork ribs.
-Thank you.

138
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:07,366
Look familiar?

139
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:09,686
You're probably not hungry.

140
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:13,286
If you don't like it, you can spit it out.

141
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:17,286
You weren't lying. This is delicious.

142
00:09:21,486 --> 00:09:22,446
What's this?

143
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:25,886
This is braised minced eel.

144
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,886
It's a classic dish.

145
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:28,966
Eel?

146
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:30,286
Yellow eel.

147
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:33,446
The dirty, stinky kind
that lives in swamps.

148
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:39,646
It tastes great.

149
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:41,646
Did you hear that? He likes it.

150
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:45,406
-Thank you so much.
-No, I should thank you.

151
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:52,766
What? Is there a fish bone in your throat?

152
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,326
I told you so many times,

153
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:56,526
don't laugh when you're eating.
Look at you...

154
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:58,686
Why are you still here? Get some vinegar.

155
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:01,326
Have you ever seen a fish bone in an eel?

156
00:10:01,406 --> 00:10:03,446
-Then...
-Let's eat now.

157
00:10:03,526 --> 00:10:04,526
What's she laughing about?

158
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:05,446
She...

159
00:10:06,246 --> 00:10:08,486
She's happy because her classmate is here.

160
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,406
Right?

161
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:12,606
Don't get so worked up.

162
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:14,446
Let's eat. Have some more.

163
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:17,446
I cooked this for you.

164
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,726
For me? As if I'm not plump enough.

165
00:10:20,806 --> 00:10:23,446
<i>This is the first time
I've seen Daoming Si being so polite.</i>

166
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:26,206
<i>He ate everything in his bowl.</i>

167
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:29,086
I told you to eat it.

168
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,126
What?

169
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:32,766
-Are you trying to make me mad?
-Are you mad?

170
00:10:32,846 --> 00:10:34,246
Thank you for having me.

171
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:35,566
I'm full.

172
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:38,326
It's getting late now. I should head home.

173
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,686
So soon?
Don't you want to stay a bit longer?

174
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,366
No, it's okay. thank you.

175
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:44,926
You're very polite.

176
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,606
Shancai, stop eating.
See your classmate out.

177
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:50,886
Mom, I have a fever.

178
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:53,166
You look very healthy. Just walk him out.

179
00:10:53,246 --> 00:10:54,166
Go.

180
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:55,366
I...

181
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:56,926
Hurry up!

182
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:01,846
It's all his fault.

183
00:11:01,926 --> 00:11:03,126
Look at what I'm wearing.

184
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:05,446
Your parents seem to like me.

185
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:09,326
Okay.

186
00:11:09,846 --> 00:11:11,206
You're outside now.

187
00:11:11,526 --> 00:11:12,486
Stop pretending.

188
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:14,086
What are you trying to do?

189
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,246
I'm pretending?

190
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:16,766
I never lie.

191
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:18,406
Stop acting.

192
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,686
Aren't you here to make fun of me?

193
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,686
Now that I'm sick, are you happy now?

194
00:11:23,646 --> 00:11:24,726
I'm not happy at all.

195
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:31,566
Let me see.

196
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:49,366
Who gets a fever on a hot day like this?

197
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:51,166
What did you say?

198
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,006
Why did you come to my house?

199
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:56,926
What are you doing

200
00:11:57,246 --> 00:11:58,566
for the seven-day holiday?

201
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:00,206
Not much.

202
00:12:01,526 --> 00:12:02,686
I want to go to Hawaii.

203
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:03,846
Are you interested?

204
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:05,166
Hawaii...

205
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:07,806
The tickets are super expensive.

206
00:12:07,886 --> 00:12:09,246
Probably around 50 thousand.

207
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:10,406
50 thousand?

208
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:13,646
-Do I look like I have that money?
-You don't?

209
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:18,206
I don't even have 500 yuan.
How would I have 50 thousand?

210
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:20,526
If you don't even have 500,
where are you going?

211
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:21,446
I'll pay for you.

212
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:24,606
-Why are you paying for me?
-Because you don't have money.

213
00:12:24,686 --> 00:12:26,206
And you don't have anywhere to go.

214
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:28,806
Who said I don't have anywhere to go?

215
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:30,046
Where are you going then?

216
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:31,006
I...

217
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:34,766
I'm going to Qinghe's
family villa in Sanya.

218
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:36,486
It's big and beautiful.

219
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:39,286
You can surf, snorkel,
and eat tons of seafood there.

220
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:41,366
You're going with Qinghe? That lame guy?

221
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:43,886
Yes. We've been planning it.

222
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:46,046
I'm so glad that during those seven days,

223
00:12:46,126 --> 00:12:47,766
I won't have to see you.

224
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:48,686
You...

225
00:12:49,046 --> 00:12:50,286
You think I want to see you?

226
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:52,166
-Best if we don't.
-Bye!

227
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:53,486
Bye forever!

228
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:56,926
Your house is over there, tiny girl.

229
00:12:57,086 --> 00:12:58,326
I know.

230
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:23,526
Si.

231
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:25,366
Did you go to visit a sick friend?

232
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:28,286
Who said that?

233
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:30,126
I went to say something.

234
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:31,726
Just to say something, okay?

235
00:13:33,206 --> 00:13:35,246
You're joking around again.

236
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:37,246
You mean you went to threaten someone?

237
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:40,526
You know what I mean.

238
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:43,886
By the way,

239
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:48,006
this is your packing list
for your trip to Hawaii next week.

240
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:50,086
You can see if anything's missing.

241
00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:52,086
Who said I'm going to Hawaii?

242
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:20,206
This is so much fun!

243
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:31,926
<i>I shouldn't have thought of you like that</i>

244
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:34,366
-You suck at singing.
-That's not true!

245
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:41,126
<i>I want to laugh</i>

246
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:42,366
<i>-And have fun
-And have fun</i>

247
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:03,486
We're here at the beach!

248
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:05,686
We're here!

249
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:08,286
I'm Shancai!

250
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,646
I'm Qinghe!

251
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:15,246
F4 can go to hell!

252
00:15:17,726 --> 00:15:18,566
Say it.

253
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,206
F4 can go to hell!

254
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:27,006
-Let's take a picture.
-Okay.

255
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:44,846
-What do you think?
-It's beautiful.

256
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:47,486
This is my family's villa.
Isn't it awesome?

257
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:48,766
-Can I go in?
-Of course.

258
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:53,326
-Wait for me.
-Hurry up.

259
00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:55,766
Look.

260
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:59,246
The person who sold us this lamp
said Jack Ma has the same one.

261
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:00,486
Really?

262
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:02,926
It's a very extravagant lamp.

263
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:05,926
Let me find you a room
with a view of the lamp.

264
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:06,846
Let's go.

265
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,446
This is the living room.

266
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:17,086
It's so pretty.

267
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,326
Right? You can see
the lamp through the window.

268
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:23,006
So this beautiful house is usually empty?

269
00:16:23,926 --> 00:16:26,086
We rent it out as a bed and breakfast.

270
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:29,966
See? You can earn extra money
and also make new friends.

271
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,486
They even have cleaning services.

272
00:16:31,606 --> 00:16:33,486
-Isn't that awesome?
-It is.

273
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,566
Let me take you to one more place.

274
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:38,526
Come on.

275
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:50,166
There are so many yachts.

276
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:52,326
Look, my family bought one too.

277
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,646
That big?

278
00:16:57,206 --> 00:16:58,846
Is it big?

279
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:01,286
It's pretty cool, right?

280
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:04,606
It must be super expensive.

281
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:12,806
It's not that one.

282
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:14,366
It's the one in front of it.

283
00:17:19,926 --> 00:17:21,046
Want to go on it?

284
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:22,606
-Sure.
-Let's go.

285
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,806
All aboard!

286
00:17:29,486 --> 00:17:31,126
QINGHE

287
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,326
Why aren't we moving yet?

288
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:36,886
I don't understand.

289
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:38,526
My dad taught me how to do this.

290
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:39,806
Why isn't it starting?

291
00:17:54,126 --> 00:17:57,646
Why do I feel like
that person looks familiar?

292
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,486
It's Daoming Si.

293
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:09,246
Daoming Si?

294
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:11,926
Isn't he in Hawaii? Why is he here?

295
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:13,646
Isn't that F4?

296
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:27,886
Hey!

297
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:30,166
Hey!

298
00:18:30,646 --> 00:18:31,646
Hey!

299
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:32,566
Hey!

300
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:35,086
Let's go.

301
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:37,326
Let's go.

302
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:51,166
Daoming Si, why are you here?

303
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,206
Why are you here?

304
00:18:54,526 --> 00:18:56,926
I can go wherever I want on this planet.

305
00:18:57,006 --> 00:18:58,286
Do I need to have a reason why?

306
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,606
Is that your family's boat?

307
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:05,206
Can it go out to sea?

308
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:09,806
I think you can only go around the pond.

309
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:10,926
Who said so?

310
00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:12,206
I went fishing on it one time.

311
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:13,886
So it's a fishing boat?

312
00:19:25,846 --> 00:19:28,086
Shancai, we meet again.

313
00:19:28,326 --> 00:19:29,286
Jing.

314
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:31,126
You're here too?

315
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:34,366
I was just saying that
these boys are making me bored.

316
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:35,326
Then, you appeared.

317
00:19:35,406 --> 00:19:37,006
We're having a party tonight.

318
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:38,686
You should come.

319
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,686
I wouldn't want to cause trouble.

320
00:19:43,326 --> 00:19:46,446
I'd ruin the atmosphere.

321
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:47,966
That's not true.

322
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,966
The more, the merrier.

323
00:19:50,726 --> 00:19:51,726
Right, Lei?

324
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:54,726
Yes, you should come.

325
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:56,526
Can I come too?

326
00:19:57,806 --> 00:19:58,686
Don't worry.

327
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:00,766
I'll be there, so Si won't pick on you.

328
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:02,526
Come on. I'll do your makeup.

329
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:03,886
Then we'll pick a dress.

330
00:20:30,286 --> 00:20:31,566
NOW LIVE

331
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:33,166
Ximen, are you using Now Live?

332
00:20:33,246 --> 00:20:34,486
I want to be on it too.

333
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:53,646
Jing,

334
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:56,166
you're so pretty.

335
00:20:57,606 --> 00:20:58,646
You're pretty too.

336
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:06,366
Has Daoming Si made up with Huaze Lei?

337
00:21:08,606 --> 00:21:09,926
I don't think so.

338
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:12,926
<i>Si is kind of immature.</i>

339
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:14,886
<i>He hasn't been talking to Lei.</i>

340
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:17,886
<i>Ximen and I persuaded Lei to come along.</i>

341
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:20,806
Don't worry.

342
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,606
Si has always been very impulsive.

343
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:24,166
His temper comes and goes quickly.

344
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:25,366
He'll get over it soon.

345
00:21:26,846 --> 00:21:27,766
As for Lei,

346
00:21:28,526 --> 00:21:32,206
I don't think anything in this world
could make him mad.

347
00:21:38,726 --> 00:21:40,486
Oh, this is a gift for you.

348
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:43,646
Thank you, Jing.

349
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:47,326
My birthday is next week.
I invited some friends.

350
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:49,046
You should come.

351
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:51,686
Your birthday?

352
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:53,806
It must be a huge event.

353
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:57,126
Don't worry,
I won't invite those girls at school.

354
00:21:58,286 --> 00:22:02,286
-Can I bring my friends?
-Of course.

355
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:05,006
As long as they're your friends,
you can bring them all.

356
00:22:05,606 --> 00:22:07,286
-Thank you, Jing.
-Okay.

357
00:22:07,406 --> 00:22:08,606
Let's get you a dress.

358
00:22:09,006 --> 00:22:12,326
I'm going to make you so pretty
to surprise everyone.

359
00:22:25,726 --> 00:22:27,726
Why are there so many girls?
Are they your friends?

360
00:22:29,886 --> 00:22:30,966
Bye.

361
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:14,126
Shancai.

362
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:16,446
You look so cute like this.

363
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,526
Girls really need to dress up.

364
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,366
Jing has impeccable taste.

365
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:23,326
Even Shancai looks amazing
with Jing's help.

366
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:25,926
Right, Si?

367
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,326
Si!

368
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:33,806
You're exaggerating.

369
00:23:33,886 --> 00:23:35,406
She looks fine.

370
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:43,726
Shancai.

371
00:23:43,806 --> 00:23:45,606
You look really pretty today.

372
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:47,046
I...

373
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:52,526
I have a stomachache. Wait.

374
00:26:00,966 --> 00:26:02,806
NOW LIVE

375
00:26:04,406 --> 00:26:05,326
Gosh.

376
00:26:18,806 --> 00:26:20,766
I was wondering who tackled me.

377
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:21,926
It was you.

378
00:26:24,006 --> 00:26:25,446
You almost knocked my teeth out.

379
00:26:30,246 --> 00:26:31,206
Hey.

380
00:26:31,446 --> 00:26:32,846
What kind of expression is that?

381
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:37,046
Was that...

382
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:40,246
Was that your first kiss?

383
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:08,686
<i>Oh my god,</i>

384
00:27:08,766 --> 00:27:10,126
<i>I have the worst luck.</i>

385
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:12,406
<i>I can't believe I gave
that pineapple head my first kiss.</i>

386
00:27:26,086 --> 00:27:27,246
<i>Shancai,</i>

387
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:31,846
<i>do you take this man as your husband</i>

388
00:27:32,886 --> 00:27:35,006
and whether rich or poor,

389
00:27:35,726 --> 00:27:38,486
in sickness and in health,

390
00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:40,886
you will remain faithful to him?

391
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:43,326
I do.

392
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:49,686
I do.

393
00:27:50,046 --> 00:27:51,246
I don't!

394
00:27:53,686 --> 00:27:54,966
Let go of me!

395
00:27:55,486 --> 00:27:56,326
Let go!

396
00:28:24,006 --> 00:28:25,566
There's a lot of people on the beach.

397
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,246
Hey, Shancai.

398
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:32,406
Why are you so weird today?

399
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,086
Am I?

400
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:36,606
Have a drink.

401
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,086
Hey.

402
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:50,406
First kiss Shancai.

403
00:28:53,446 --> 00:28:54,686
Don't call me that.

404
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:56,246
What first kiss?

405
00:28:58,406 --> 00:29:00,046
She and Si kissed last night.

406
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:02,326
What?

407
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:04,126
Shancai, is that true?

408
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:07,686
I...

409
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:12,086
Of course, it is.

410
00:29:12,566 --> 00:29:15,326
I'm sure she's been waiting
so long for this.

411
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:20,046
She tackled me and gave me her first kiss.

412
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:22,646
Oh my god.

413
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:24,446
Really?

414
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:34,326
No.

415
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,086
It was dark. I couldn't see anything.

416
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,806
-That's why--
-You don't need to explain.

417
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:40,926
I don't care who you kiss.

418
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:04,246
Shancai.

419
00:30:05,686 --> 00:30:06,926
Shancai, wait!

420
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:08,686
Wait for me!

421
00:30:24,806 --> 00:30:27,366
Daoming Si! You stole
Shancai's first kiss, you jerk!

422
00:30:27,486 --> 00:30:29,566
Come out. I'm going to kill you.

423
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:40,126
Stop hiding in there like a coward!

424
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:41,206
Come on!

425
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:42,966
Didn't you give me a joker card?

426
00:30:43,046 --> 00:30:44,926
I'll take the challenge now.

427
00:30:45,286 --> 00:30:46,486
Come out now.

428
00:30:46,566 --> 00:30:48,846
You're a bully. Open the door.

429
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:50,646
You're trash. You're garbage!

430
00:31:06,446 --> 00:31:07,806
You're such a lame guy.

431
00:31:08,806 --> 00:31:10,206
The joker card is for Bridge.

432
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:13,006
Cut out the crap.

433
00:31:13,086 --> 00:31:14,046
Let's start the game.

434
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:15,206
Are you scared?

435
00:31:16,446 --> 00:31:17,406
Scared?

436
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:19,166
Let's do it.

437
00:31:19,726 --> 00:31:21,006
If I win...

438
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:24,006
-I'll admit that you're better than me.
-That won't be enough.

439
00:31:24,806 --> 00:31:27,046
If I win, you can't stand next
to Shancai anymore.

440
00:31:27,126 --> 00:31:28,006
Fine.

441
00:31:28,206 --> 00:31:30,126
-What if I win?
-You can't stand next to me.

442
00:31:30,206 --> 00:31:31,166
Okay.

443
00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:41,846
This is your family's boat?

444
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:42,966
Why is it so small?

445
00:31:43,206 --> 00:31:44,206
And why is it so shaky?

446
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:46,526
It's to cut down on carbon emission.

447
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:50,686
Lame people

448
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:53,526
are never willing
to admit how lame they are.

449
00:31:54,086 --> 00:31:56,806
-Are you talking about me or Shancai?
-You're the same.

450
00:31:56,886 --> 00:31:58,046
It's fine if it's me,

451
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,166
but if it's Shancai,

452
00:31:59,246 --> 00:32:00,446
I won't forgive you.

453
00:32:01,246 --> 00:32:02,446
But it's true.

454
00:32:02,566 --> 00:32:03,686
She's a girl,

455
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:06,446
but she's rude and short-tempered.

456
00:32:07,006 --> 00:32:08,326
She dresses terribly.

457
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:10,886
Most importantly, she's stupid.

458
00:32:12,686 --> 00:32:14,126
You don't know Shancai.

459
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:16,526
You don't know how great she is.

460
00:32:16,766 --> 00:32:18,326
How is she great?

461
00:32:19,246 --> 00:32:20,166
You don't know

462
00:32:20,766 --> 00:32:24,006
how cute Shancai was
before she came to Mingde.

463
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:27,566
<i>In high school,</i>

464
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:30,366
<i>one time, class funds went missing.</i>

465
00:32:30,446 --> 00:32:31,486
SHAME

466
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:32,886
<i>In order to find the culprit,</i>

467
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:35,846
<i>the teacher made us stay after school.</i>

468
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:39,406
It must have been someone in this class.

469
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,446
Does nobody want to admit to it?

470
00:32:47,406 --> 00:32:48,286
Fine.

471
00:32:49,646 --> 00:32:50,966
You're all so smart.

472
00:32:51,526 --> 00:32:53,606
Take out a piece of paper

473
00:32:54,686 --> 00:32:57,766
and write down
who you think stole the money.

474
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:01,806
The three classmates
with the highest votes

475
00:33:03,086 --> 00:33:04,326
will be the culprits.

476
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:10,606
Sir, you can't make us
do this to our classmates.

477
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:12,086
Shancai.

478
00:33:12,606 --> 00:33:14,206
Could it be you then?

479
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:16,406
Sir,

480
00:33:17,006 --> 00:33:18,606
you shouldn't make us vote.

481
00:33:19,046 --> 00:33:20,286
Our classmates aren't thieves.

482
00:33:20,926 --> 00:33:22,686
We'll just find the money.

483
00:33:23,246 --> 00:33:25,206
Let me check your book bags!

484
00:33:25,286 --> 00:33:26,406
We won't.

485
00:33:26,926 --> 00:33:27,846
You...

486
00:33:27,926 --> 00:33:28,926
You...

487
00:33:29,326 --> 00:33:31,166
-Sir.
-What?

488
00:33:31,246 --> 00:33:33,166
Can I go to the restroom?

489
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:39,326
Shancai, you're so cool.

490
00:33:39,406 --> 00:33:40,886
Why are you crying?

491
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:42,166
Stop crying.

492
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:43,526
I think you're cool too.

493
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:45,806
But this is so embarrassing.

494
00:33:45,886 --> 00:33:48,606
-It's not embarrassing.
-I really just want to pee.

495
00:33:51,286 --> 00:33:52,286
<i>From that day on,</i>

496
00:33:52,886 --> 00:33:53,886
I swore that

497
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,966
I would never let anyone pick on Shancai.

498
00:33:57,046 --> 00:33:58,526
Whoever picks on her,

499
00:33:58,646 --> 00:33:59,966
picks on me.

500
00:34:02,726 --> 00:34:04,006
Why does your story

501
00:34:04,526 --> 00:34:06,246
sound so familiar?

502
00:34:06,446 --> 00:34:08,286
I feel like I've heard it before.

503
00:34:09,286 --> 00:34:10,126
Hey.

504
00:34:10,206 --> 00:34:12,766
Did you steal that story from a movie?

505
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:15,206
It's a real story, okay?

506
00:34:19,286 --> 00:34:20,446
That year,

507
00:34:21,006 --> 00:34:23,086
Shancai became Mrs. Chen.

508
00:34:23,326 --> 00:34:25,326
What? Mrs. Chen?

509
00:34:25,406 --> 00:34:26,886
What the hell are you talking about?

510
00:34:29,086 --> 00:34:30,406
In Fantasy Westward Journey.

511
00:34:31,046 --> 00:34:32,926
Look, this is Shancai's handle.

512
00:34:33,006 --> 00:34:35,686
In the game, our intimacy level

513
00:34:35,966 --> 00:34:37,686
has gone up to 9,999.

514
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:40,566
I have a screenshot
of when we got married.

515
00:34:42,926 --> 00:34:44,646
Are you stupid or something?

516
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:49,806
You're just jealous that we're so close.

517
00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:05,966
<i>What was I expecting?</i>

518
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:16,006
What's that?

519
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:19,446
None of your business.

520
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,166
What are you doing?

521
00:35:32,326 --> 00:35:33,366
What the hell is this?

522
00:35:33,446 --> 00:35:35,246
-Why is it so spicy?
-It's spicy, isn't it?

523
00:35:38,926 --> 00:35:39,886
No.

524
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:41,606
I think it's good.

525
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:47,966
I think I got something.

526
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:48,886
Hey.

527
00:35:57,566 --> 00:35:59,846
See? I told you I was a genius.

528
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:01,286
I'm good at everything.

529
00:36:01,446 --> 00:36:02,806
It's just one catch.

530
00:36:02,886 --> 00:36:04,166
Are you that proud?

531
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:07,806
I wasn't even trying.

532
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:11,046
Hey.

533
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:12,646
I clearly won.

534
00:36:13,646 --> 00:36:14,966
Look at my bucket.

535
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:20,686
So?

536
00:36:21,286 --> 00:36:22,206
I won.

537
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,126
What did we bet on?

538
00:36:25,206 --> 00:36:28,006
You can't stand next to me.

539
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,046
What?

540
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:30,526
You...

541
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:32,846
What kind of bet is that?
Do you think I'm stupid?

542
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:34,846
-You are stupid.
-You...

543
00:36:35,846 --> 00:36:36,686
You...

544
00:36:36,966 --> 00:36:37,806
What?

545
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:20,446
Shancai is special to you, isn't she?

546
00:37:25,606 --> 00:37:26,846
Why do you care about her?

547
00:37:30,006 --> 00:37:33,126
Do you like her?

548
00:37:39,206 --> 00:37:42,286
I thought so when you saved her
at the restaurant.

549
00:37:43,406 --> 00:37:44,326
To be honest,

550
00:37:44,926 --> 00:37:46,126
I'm kind of jealous.

551
00:37:50,806 --> 00:37:52,766
Because you're no longer mine.

552
00:37:58,686 --> 00:38:00,846
So, what are you trying to say?

553
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:03,686
Do I think both of you are alike?

554
00:38:05,126 --> 00:38:06,086
Lei.

555
00:38:08,446 --> 00:38:10,086
Stop lying.

556
00:38:11,406 --> 00:38:13,126
You care about everyone.

557
00:38:13,686 --> 00:38:16,406
You try so hard to maintain
the image of a princess.

558
00:38:18,366 --> 00:38:20,566
Even if someone gets hurt
because of your indecisiveness,

559
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:21,966
you don't care.

560
00:38:24,926 --> 00:38:26,926
I don't want to be manipulated
by you anymore.

561
00:38:29,486 --> 00:38:31,566
Lei, that's not what I mean.

562
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:39,526
You say I care about Shancai...

563
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:57,646
The truth is,

564
00:39:02,046 --> 00:39:03,366
I only care about you.

565
00:39:29,526 --> 00:39:31,326
<i>There's no need to feel sad.</i>

566
00:39:32,126 --> 00:39:33,206
<i>He's so great.</i>

567
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:36,526
<i>He's supposed to be with Jing.</i>

568
00:39:37,926 --> 00:39:38,966
<i>But...</i>

569
00:39:39,566 --> 00:39:41,886
<i>Why do I feel so sad?</i>

570
00:39:42,846 --> 00:39:44,206
<i>Shancai,</i>

571
00:39:45,526 --> 00:39:46,686
<i>you're so cute today.</i>

572
00:39:51,086 --> 00:39:53,766
When you feel like crying, do a handstand.

573
00:39:55,246 --> 00:39:57,166
That way, your tears won't fall down.

574
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:28,566
What?

575
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:32,166
Why are you like this?

576
00:40:34,046 --> 00:40:35,606
What should I be like?

577
00:40:43,326 --> 00:40:44,766
I'm forcing you,

578
00:40:44,966 --> 00:40:46,526
why aren't you resisting?

579
00:40:49,206 --> 00:40:52,046
I didn't realize that
you're already a man.

580
00:40:53,846 --> 00:40:55,086
Now I realize it.

581
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,046
What?

582
00:41:08,606 --> 00:41:10,686
-Hold this.
-Why?

583
00:41:11,366 --> 00:41:12,446
DAO

584
00:41:13,686 --> 00:41:15,486
That's how you do it.

585
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:19,166
Shancai?

586
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:21,006
Shancai,

587
00:41:21,326 --> 00:41:22,446
why are you here alone?

588
00:41:26,446 --> 00:41:27,686
Why are your eyes red?

589
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,486
Were you crying?

590
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:34,526
No, it's just really windy here.

591
00:41:35,046 --> 00:41:36,646
Some sand got into my eyes.

592
00:41:37,646 --> 00:41:38,766
Why are you guys here?

593
00:41:39,846 --> 00:41:41,046
To get revenge for you,

594
00:41:41,246 --> 00:41:44,006
I challenged Daoming Si to squid-fishing.
He lost by a lot.

595
00:41:45,926 --> 00:41:46,806
Look.

596
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:51,206
Hey.

597
00:41:52,006 --> 00:41:53,726
Are you proud of being good
at squid-fishing?

598
00:41:53,806 --> 00:41:57,206
I remember someone
couldn't even get the squid off the hook.

599
00:41:58,926 --> 00:42:00,366
It's really hard, okay?

600
00:42:00,926 --> 00:42:02,286
They have so many tentacles.

601
00:42:02,366 --> 00:42:03,766
And they suck on to it really hard.

602
00:42:12,686 --> 00:42:14,926
Hey, why are you blushing?

603
00:42:15,006 --> 00:42:16,246
-You...
-I...

604
00:42:18,966 --> 00:42:20,646
What's the matter with you?

605
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:22,326
You pervert!

606
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:24,726
You're thinking
about that kiss, aren't you?

607
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:29,206
It's none of your business.

608
00:42:30,326 --> 00:42:31,686
You can't stand next to me anymore.

609
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:34,086
You're the one standing next to me.

610
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:35,126
You're so petty.

611
00:42:35,606 --> 00:42:38,166
Dong Shancai, say something
about your rude friend.

612
00:42:38,246 --> 00:42:39,286
Come at me then.

613
00:42:39,366 --> 00:42:40,726
-You...
-I'm going to kill you.

614
00:42:40,806 --> 00:42:42,846
-Get back here.
-No!

615
00:42:42,926 --> 00:42:43,766
Stop it.

616
00:42:47,806 --> 00:42:48,726
I...

617
00:42:49,246 --> 00:42:50,366
I'm going to get you.

618
00:42:52,766 --> 00:42:54,486
<i>Even though I hate to admit it</i>

619
00:42:55,046 --> 00:42:56,806
<i>on this cold and sad night,</i>

620
00:42:57,846 --> 00:42:59,766
<i>my worst enemy</i>

621
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:02,406
<i>brought me back to the warmth of life.</i>
