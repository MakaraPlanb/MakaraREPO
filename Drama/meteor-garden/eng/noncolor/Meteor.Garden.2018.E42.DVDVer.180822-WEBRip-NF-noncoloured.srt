EPISODE 42

4
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,463
<i>Lei, are you back from London?</i>

5
00:01:52,783 --> 00:01:53,663
<i>Let's meet up.</i>

6
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:43,023
Is this...

7
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:45,063
a dream?

8
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:57,023
Daoming Si?

9
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:09,663
Daoming Si?

10
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,543
Daoming Si!

11
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:14,303
Daoming Si! Wake up!

12
00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:15,543
Daoming Si!

13
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:17,743
Hey!

14
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:19,743
Are you really dead?

15
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:21,703
Hey!

16
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:23,943
Hey!

17
00:03:24,423 --> 00:03:25,783
Wake up!

18
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:34,463
You almost beat me to death.

19
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:37,263
You're awake.

20
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,383
Where are we?

21
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:54,383
I don't know.

22
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:56,743
There's nobody around.

23
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:01,143
My phone is gone.

24
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:02,783
What about yours?

25
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:09,063
Mine is gone too.

26
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:12,183
What happened?

27
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:27,863
Are you crazy?

28
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,343
You know how important he is
to Daoming Group right now.

29
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:35,463
How could you let him out?
Where did he go?

30
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:36,543
If he doesn't come back,

31
00:04:36,863 --> 00:04:38,863
our family will be doomed.
Don't you know that?

32
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:43,223
You're the one who destroyed
the Daoming family.

33
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:45,263
What are you talking about?

34
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:46,543
It was the same with Zhuang.

35
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:48,183
Now it's Si.

36
00:04:49,183 --> 00:04:50,863
They're your children,

37
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:53,463
-not your pawns!
-Shut up!

38
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:56,583
Go find him right now!

39
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,983
Si just went out to have some noodles.

40
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:00,223
He'll be back.

41
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:02,823
Is he having noodles all night long?

42
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,783
We could make noodles for him at home!

43
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:07,863
When he's at home,

44
00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:10,103
he doesn't have any appetite.

45
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:20,143
Mrs. Daoming.

46
00:05:20,743 --> 00:05:23,823
For the former president of our group...

47
00:05:24,143 --> 00:05:25,143
For his father,

48
00:05:25,863 --> 00:05:26,863
for you,

49
00:05:27,463 --> 00:05:29,943
Si has begun to face reality.

50
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,503
Give him some time.

51
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:37,303
I don't care.

52
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:39,223
Go find him.

53
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:42,263
I'm taking him to a party tonight.

54
00:05:42,623 --> 00:05:44,023
Mr. He's daughter will be there.

55
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:46,423
Mrs. Daoming, Mr. He is on the phone.

56
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:52,503
Hello? Mr. He?

57
00:05:52,783 --> 00:05:53,983
So, about tonight--

58
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:01,543
What did you say?

59
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:17,823
-How did we get kidnapped?
-How would I know?

60
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:20,543
How could you not know?

61
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:22,663
I was attacked with a taser.

62
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:24,863
I couldn't even see his face.
How would I know anything?

63
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:28,023
I wasn't attacked. Why did I faint too?

64
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:39,383
Was it...

65
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:41,543
your mom?

66
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,103
The person who kidnapped us
doesn't work for our family.

67
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:47,303
How can you be sure?

68
00:06:47,383 --> 00:06:49,503
If my bodyguard attacked me with a taser,

69
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,783
I would have killed him first.

70
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:00,663
Are you scared?

71
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:05,223
Aren't you worried?

72
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:08,023
We're stuck on an island

73
00:07:08,703 --> 00:07:10,023
with no water,

74
00:07:10,703 --> 00:07:11,703
no food,

75
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:14,343
and no cell phones.

76
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:26,103
Hey. Where are you going?

77
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,583
If you want to survive, help me out.

78
00:08:57,743 --> 00:08:58,583
Hey.

79
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:01,343
I found a bag.

80
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:11,503
A fishing rod.

81
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:31,383
A lighter.

82
00:09:40,943 --> 00:09:42,063
And a bottle of water.

83
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:06,463
Si...

84
00:10:20,623 --> 00:10:21,823
Hello, this is Xitian.

85
00:10:29,343 --> 00:10:30,183
Xitian.

86
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:33,303
Has Mr. He said anything?

87
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,543
Does he know who did it?

88
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:37,343
No.

89
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:39,823
Xiaozi's bodyguard was unconscious.
He didn't see anything.

90
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:41,663
What about Zhuang?

91
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:43,543
Where is she?

92
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:45,143
Miss Zhuang is fine.

93
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:47,743
She had a fight with her husband
and went to the Alps alone.

94
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:02,343
<i>How much money is your son worth?</i>

95
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:46,063
Have some water.

96
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:51,463
Thank you.

97
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:22,623
We've been missing for over 24 hours now.

98
00:12:23,863 --> 00:12:25,823
People are probably worried about us.

99
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,023
But can they find us here?

100
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:30,943
Don't forget,

101
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:32,463
I'm missing too.

102
00:12:33,183 --> 00:12:34,903
My mom can find anything in this world.

103
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:36,823
As long as we survive,

104
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,623
I'm sure they will find us.

105
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:43,903
I suddenly think your mom is so reliable.

106
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,543
Is it okay for me to think that?

107
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:58,143
Being on this island
where time is irrelevant,

108
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:01,903
nothing is important anymore.

109
00:13:05,023 --> 00:13:07,023
<i>We should thank the person
who kidnapped us.</i>

110
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:09,423
<i>If it wasn't for him,</i>

111
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,983
<i>we would've been separated by now.</i>

112
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:27,623
The sunset is so pretty.

113
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:33,103
This is our first time watching
the sunset together, right?

114
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:35,303
Yes.

115
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:48,343
I'll go gather some firewood.

116
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:51,583
Let's go together.
I need some grass to make a bed.

117
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:52,943
It's getting dark.

118
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,623
If you get lost, I'll have to go find you.

119
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:01,063
Come on.

120
00:14:34,063 --> 00:14:36,863
I made a bed with wood and grass.

121
00:14:37,783 --> 00:14:38,783
You should go to sleep.

122
00:14:41,023 --> 00:14:41,903
A sea view

123
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:44,463
and a personal suite.

124
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,503
This is the best gift I've ever received.

125
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:53,223
Are you not sleeping?

126
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:55,703
There might be wild animals at night.

127
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,983
I need to tend to the fire.
You should sleep.

128
00:14:58,463 --> 00:14:59,423
Wild animals?

129
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:02,023
That's very unlikely.

130
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:11,263
I'll go check it out.

131
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:17,063
Stay here and don't move.

132
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,023
Daoming Si.

133
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:06,583
Daoming Si.

134
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,663
Daoming Si.

135
00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:17,503
Daoming Si.

136
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:25,263
Who is it?

137
00:17:30,503 --> 00:17:31,383
Daoming Si.

138
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:33,423
Is that you?

139
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,383
That was so scary.

140
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,383
Why didn't you wait by the fire?

141
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:50,263
I heard some noises over here.

142
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:51,783
I was so scared.

143
00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:54,023
Don't be scared. I'm here.

144
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:00,303
Daoming Si.

145
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:03,743
Can you never leave me again?

146
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:13,143
I'll never leave you again.

147
00:18:37,343 --> 00:18:39,103
Go to sleep. I'll watch the fire.

148
00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:41,223
No.

149
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:43,943
What if someone attacks us at midnight?

150
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:46,743
You won't be able to fight them off.

151
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:49,543
I feel scared whenever I think

152
00:18:49,623 --> 00:18:53,143
of those bad guys watching us in the dark.

153
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,863
Go lie down if you can't sleep.

154
00:18:58,983 --> 00:19:00,423
We'll go explore the forest tomorrow.

155
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:34,983
And you said you weren't tired.

156
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,343
This way, please.

157
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:19,703
The He family group is doing the same.

158
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:21,783
We'll track their location
through their phones.

159
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,263
You said the cameras
didn't get the kidnapper's face?

160
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:26,583
How is that possible? Tell me!

161
00:20:26,663 --> 00:20:27,823
It was a blind spot.

162
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:31,383
It's obvious that
it was a planned kidnapping.

163
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:33,183
-What should I do?
-About that--

164
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:35,983
Has the kidnapper contacted you?

165
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:38,023
No, not at all.

166
00:20:38,223 --> 00:20:39,983
If you can contact the kidnapper,

167
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,303
please tell him,

168
00:20:41,383 --> 00:20:43,583
I'll give him any amount he wants.

169
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:45,063
About that...

170
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:48,383
What?

171
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,703
What are you saying?

172
00:20:49,863 --> 00:20:52,743
If anything happens to my son,

173
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:54,423
what am I going to do?

174
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,223
All right.

175
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:26,663
Daoming Si!

176
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:29,943
Daoming Si, where are you?

177
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:34,103
Daoming Si!

178
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:37,263
Shancai, I got some squid!

179
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:52,983
You didn't sleep all night?

180
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:54,983
It's not a big deal.

181
00:21:59,023 --> 00:21:59,863
It smells great.

182
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,143
If only we had some
Eight Treasure Spicy Sauce.

183
00:22:04,143 --> 00:22:07,383
You don't know how well
the King of Squid is doing.

184
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:08,823
Of course I know.

185
00:22:10,383 --> 00:22:11,263
You know?

186
00:22:11,823 --> 00:22:13,063
I saw your video.

187
00:22:13,903 --> 00:22:16,863
Also, who designed that hat?

188
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:18,503
It's so ugly!

189
00:22:19,183 --> 00:22:20,903
That's what a squid looks like.

190
00:22:30,943 --> 00:22:31,943
I guess at that time,

191
00:22:34,303 --> 00:22:35,743
Lei was the one by your side.

192
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:45,863
All I do...

193
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:49,743
is hurt you.

194
00:22:52,983 --> 00:22:53,823
Maybe...

195
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:58,783
Maybe Lei can make you happier than I can.

196
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:02,783
Daoming Si.

197
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:04,743
What are you talking about?

198
00:23:07,143 --> 00:23:08,343
You said you like me.

199
00:23:09,143 --> 00:23:10,943
And now you're pushing me away
to someone else?

200
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,663
Do you think I'll be happier
with someone else?

201
00:23:15,703 --> 00:23:17,183
You're an idiot.

202
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:37,303
I understand.

203
00:23:38,863 --> 00:23:39,943
No matter what happens,

204
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:41,903
I won't let go of you.

205
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:46,063
Actually,

206
00:23:47,223 --> 00:23:48,623
when you came to see me in London,

207
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:50,503
I was so happy.

208
00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:53,543
I really regret

209
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:56,543
breaking up with you so viciously.

210
00:23:57,623 --> 00:23:58,583
I regret it so much.

211
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:25,063
The last time we spoke,
Shancai was going to the airport.

212
00:24:25,143 --> 00:24:26,383
But if you think about it,

213
00:24:26,703 --> 00:24:28,303
she should already be there.

214
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,223
If Shancai's missing, what about Lei?

215
00:24:33,303 --> 00:24:34,383
Did he find her?

216
00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:39,863
Now I can't even get in touch
with Ximen and Meizuo.

217
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:42,383
I wonder if something happened.

218
00:24:43,863 --> 00:24:45,463
-What if the plane she was on--
-Hey!

219
00:24:45,543 --> 00:24:46,583
Why would you say that?

220
00:24:46,823 --> 00:24:49,143
That would be
on the international news, okay?

221
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,223
Shancai.

222
00:26:28,183 --> 00:26:29,063
Are you okay?

223
00:26:29,943 --> 00:26:30,783
I'm fine.

224
00:26:32,063 --> 00:26:33,063
Don't move.

225
00:26:33,303 --> 00:26:34,143
Let me see.

226
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:40,183
Don't move.

227
00:26:42,023 --> 00:26:43,023
What are you doing?

228
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,983
That's so ugly.

229
00:27:07,743 --> 00:27:09,183
It's better than your ugly hat.

230
00:27:13,263 --> 00:27:14,103
Let's go.

231
00:27:20,063 --> 00:27:21,623
I feel their presence nearby.

232
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,063
If we run into them, I'll beat them up.

233
00:27:48,863 --> 00:27:51,663
<i>Have you heard? Si is missing.</i>

234
00:27:51,743 --> 00:27:53,823
The ICPO is on the case.

235
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:55,983
I hope they'll be okay.

236
00:27:56,543 --> 00:27:57,423
You mean--

237
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:13,383
Daoming Si.

238
00:28:15,263 --> 00:28:16,423
It's getting dark.

239
00:28:17,623 --> 00:28:18,863
There's nobody here.

240
00:28:19,423 --> 00:28:20,383
What should we do?

241
00:28:21,903 --> 00:28:23,503
Will we die here?

242
00:28:23,863 --> 00:28:24,983
No.

243
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,183
I won't let that happen.

244
00:28:27,863 --> 00:28:28,743
Trust me.

245
00:28:31,783 --> 00:28:33,623
Where's the sunshine, beach and hot girls?

246
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:36,823
Hey.

247
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,383
Did you hear

248
00:28:38,863 --> 00:28:40,343
someone talking over there?

249
00:28:41,783 --> 00:28:42,623
I think so.

250
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:48,463
How would I know
the weather would be like this?

251
00:28:48,663 --> 00:28:50,663
It's so windy. I'm freezing.

252
00:28:57,183 --> 00:28:58,063
Slow down.

253
00:28:58,463 --> 00:28:59,423
Be careful.

254
00:29:08,143 --> 00:29:09,623
I shouldn't have listened to you.

255
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,423
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

256
00:29:17,143 --> 00:29:18,223
I'm going to beat you up!

257
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:19,743
Get over here!

258
00:29:19,863 --> 00:29:20,983
-I'll kill you!
-Hey!

259
00:29:21,623 --> 00:29:22,503
Shancai!

260
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:25,383
-Get over here!
-Calm down, man!

261
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:26,423
Stop!

262
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:28,423
Stop running!

263
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:29,703
Stop it!

264
00:29:31,223 --> 00:29:32,423
I'll kill you!

265
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,863
-I got you!
-Why did you do this to us?

266
00:29:37,183 --> 00:29:38,183
Stop!

267
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:40,863
-I'll kill you!
-It wasn't me!

268
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:42,623
-Is this a prank?
-Stop!

269
00:29:43,183 --> 00:29:44,503
-Go to hell!
-It wasn't me!

270
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:48,143
-I'm dying here.
-You think you're so smart.

271
00:29:48,463 --> 00:29:49,943
-It wasn't me.
-Pranking me?

272
00:29:55,783 --> 00:29:58,103
Shancai, I prepared some drinks for you.

273
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:03,183
Do you want some?

274
00:30:09,383 --> 00:30:11,663
Xiaozi, what's going on?

275
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:12,863
Can't you tell?

276
00:30:13,423 --> 00:30:14,903
This is my brilliant plan.

277
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:17,903
Look at him.
He got chased and then held captive.

278
00:30:18,103 --> 00:30:19,263
Poor thing.

279
00:30:19,343 --> 00:30:21,543
He just wants to be
in a relationship with you.

280
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:24,343
So, I decided to bring you to this island.

281
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,583
Bring us? That was kidnapping.

282
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:49,703
Your mom did things to Shancai's friends.

283
00:30:49,783 --> 00:30:52,903
I'm just giving her
a taste of her own medicine.

284
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:58,063
So,

285
00:30:58,383 --> 00:31:01,423
your bodyguard used a taser on me?

286
00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:04,543
That was me.

287
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:06,303
How else could I beat you?

288
00:31:06,383 --> 00:31:07,583
What a jerk!

289
00:31:07,823 --> 00:31:09,023
Stop it!

290
00:31:10,623 --> 00:31:11,663
That scared me.

291
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:13,503
Don't hit her.

292
00:31:15,183 --> 00:31:16,703
I understand why Monkey did this,

293
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:18,663
but the three of you got involved too?

294
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:24,823
Hey, don't take this prank too seriously.

295
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:25,983
How about you forgive us?

296
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,863
Despite the weather,
maybe you should do it today.

297
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:37,343
Or you'll keep worrying about it.

298
00:31:40,503 --> 00:31:41,543
Do what?

299
00:31:42,263 --> 00:31:43,143
Get married.

300
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:46,103
Destination weddings are always romantic.

301
00:31:46,543 --> 00:31:47,543
The rain is falling.

302
00:31:48,303 --> 00:31:49,303
How special.

303
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:58,103
Si and Shancai would be
the most terribly-dressed couple.

304
00:31:58,463 --> 00:32:01,103
We would be the most terribly-dressed
bridesmaid and groomsmen too.

305
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:04,823
I'm sure Si and Shancai
can go through anything together.

306
00:32:15,503 --> 00:32:16,343
I've decided.

307
00:32:25,103 --> 00:32:26,183
I've decided that

308
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:27,583
no matter what happens,

309
00:32:27,663 --> 00:32:30,583
I have to be with Dong Shancai!

310
00:32:33,383 --> 00:32:35,903
You like Shancai, Shancai likes you.

311
00:32:35,983 --> 00:32:37,543
We knew that a long time ago.

312
00:32:38,863 --> 00:32:41,583
Si, what about your family business?

313
00:32:42,063 --> 00:32:46,183
I won't give up on Shancai
or Daoming Group.

314
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:49,303
I'm going back to London.
I'll take care of everything.

315
00:32:49,383 --> 00:32:51,263
I'm Daoming Si!

316
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:53,223
Because I'm Daoming Si,

317
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:57,303
I'll never give up on Shancai!

318
00:32:58,983 --> 00:33:00,983
Si, I support you!

319
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,183
I support you, brother.

320
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:03,263
Me too!

321
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:04,423
Me too!

322
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:07,103
We'll help you!

323
00:33:10,903 --> 00:33:12,423
You're crazy!

324
00:33:14,343 --> 00:33:15,743
Yes, we're the cutest!

325
00:33:15,823 --> 00:33:16,983
-Crazy people!
-Crazy!

326
00:33:18,143 --> 00:33:19,063
Crazy!

327
00:33:19,343 --> 00:33:21,223
-You're crazy!
-You're crazy!

328
00:33:23,823 --> 00:33:25,503
-Crazy people!
-Stop!

329
00:33:28,263 --> 00:33:29,103
Come here!

330
00:33:32,983 --> 00:33:33,823
Si.

331
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:36,623
-Get over here!
-Come here.

332
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,863
You too, Xiaozi!

333
00:33:51,183 --> 00:33:52,823
Mrs. Daoming, food is ready.

334
00:33:53,143 --> 00:33:55,223
-Take it away. I don't want it.
-But--

335
00:33:56,623 --> 00:33:59,823
Why is it so hard to catch a kidnapper?

336
00:33:59,903 --> 00:34:02,543
Why can't the server locate them? Why?

337
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:11,543
Hello, this is Daoming Feng.

338
00:34:11,743 --> 00:34:12,783
Are there any updates?

339
00:34:15,543 --> 00:34:16,423
Michael?

340
00:34:17,743 --> 00:34:18,743
Which Michael?

341
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:22,223
How is that possible?

342
00:34:22,703 --> 00:34:24,703
The kidnapper is
Xiaozi's bodyguard, Michael?

343
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:26,143
Michael?

344
00:34:31,743 --> 00:34:32,983
<i>Now on the international news,</i>

345
00:34:33,063 --> 00:34:34,823
<i>the successor of Daoming Group, Daoming Si</i>

346
00:34:34,903 --> 00:34:37,783
<i>and He Yuanzi from the He Business Group,
have been missing for three days.</i>

347
00:34:37,863 --> 00:34:39,743
<i>The groups have officially denied this,</i>

348
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:41,303
<i>but we have received confirmation</i>

349
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:43,103
<i>that the kidnappers have been identified.</i>

350
00:34:43,223 --> 00:34:44,223
Ms. Xiaozi.

351
00:34:44,823 --> 00:34:46,703
Are you telling me
that it was just a prank?

352
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:48,863
It's on the international news now.

353
00:34:49,543 --> 00:34:51,583
What am I supposed to do?
You really messed up.

354
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:49,023
What will happen when we go back?

355
00:35:51,103 --> 00:35:52,703
Don't worry. I'll be there with you.

356
00:35:56,903 --> 00:35:59,223
Thank you for not giving up on me.

357
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:02,943
How could I leave you?

358
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:12,983
Shancai.

359
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:15,303
I love you.

360
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:24,103
How many times
have we slept together like this?

361
00:36:25,943 --> 00:36:28,903
When can we take the next step?

362
00:37:15,863 --> 00:37:16,703
Come out.

363
00:37:18,463 --> 00:37:19,463
What did you say?

364
00:37:20,983 --> 00:37:22,143
It wasn't a kidnapping?

365
00:37:23,983 --> 00:37:25,303
They're all safe?

366
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:27,743
Keep talking.

367
00:37:29,303 --> 00:37:33,423
Mr. He's daughter, Xiaozi,
planned a prank?

368
00:37:36,743 --> 00:37:38,103
I understand.

369
00:37:40,983 --> 00:37:42,503
What a terrible prank.

370
00:37:43,703 --> 00:37:44,583
Unforgivable.

371
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:48,063
Xitian, notify
the public relations officer.

372
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:52,143
This has to do with the public image
of the successor of Daoming Group.

373
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:55,543
Block all negative news
in the media immediately.

374
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:56,463
Yes, ma'am.

375
00:37:57,103 --> 00:37:58,583
How is Si?

376
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:00,703
Si?

377
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:02,823
He's doing fine.

378
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:05,383
He's having
a carefree vacation on the island.

379
00:38:05,903 --> 00:38:08,223
He's under the protection of the ICPO.

380
00:38:08,383 --> 00:38:10,063
He's heading to Shanghai right now.

381
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:14,063
How could she plan
such a huge prank like that?

382
00:38:14,703 --> 00:38:16,023
Unbelievable.

383
00:38:17,703 --> 00:38:20,143
But the good thing is that they're safe.

384
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:22,583
That's what's important.

385
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,783
Xitian, buy the tickets.

386
00:38:28,263 --> 00:38:30,143
-We're flying to Shanghai tomorrow.
-Yes, ma'am.

387
00:39:01,983 --> 00:39:02,943
They're coming.

388
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:17,863
Daoming Si.

389
00:39:17,943 --> 00:39:18,783
Daoming Si!

390
00:39:18,863 --> 00:39:20,863
-Daoming Si.
-Don't push.

391
00:39:21,743 --> 00:39:22,983
Daoming Si!

392
00:39:23,103 --> 00:39:25,543
-Move.
-Daoming Si!

393
00:39:25,623 --> 00:39:26,463
-Sir.
-Sir.

394
00:39:26,543 --> 00:39:28,463
-Where did you go?
-Tell us.

395
00:39:28,663 --> 00:39:30,303
Sir, please answer some questions.

396
00:39:30,383 --> 00:39:31,503
-Daoming Si!
-Sir.

397
00:39:31,623 --> 00:39:33,703
-Can you explain where you've been?
-Please answer us.

398
00:39:33,783 --> 00:39:34,823
We have so many questions.

399
00:39:34,903 --> 00:39:36,783
-Please answer us.
-Sir.

400
00:39:36,903 --> 00:39:38,063
Please explain everything.

401
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:39,183
-Daoming Si.
-Sir.

402
00:39:39,263 --> 00:39:41,423
What happened? Who are all these people?

403
00:39:46,143 --> 00:39:47,863
The only son of
Daoming Group went missing,

404
00:39:48,063 --> 00:39:49,703
it's probably all over the news.

405
00:39:50,863 --> 00:39:51,823
That's great.

406
00:39:53,063 --> 00:39:55,943
Now we're probably seen as kidnappers.

407
00:39:57,263 --> 00:40:00,103
The first thing I have to do
is to find Xiaozi.

408
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:03,783
The media is here for Si.

409
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:05,303
Let's split up.

410
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:06,903
I'll stay with Si.

411
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:09,423
You guys take Shancai
and go the other way.

412
00:40:11,223 --> 00:40:12,783
Why do I have to part with Shancai?

413
00:40:14,143 --> 00:40:16,783
You want your mom to see you
hold Shancai's hand

414
00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:18,703
after seeing the news?

415
00:40:23,663 --> 00:40:25,583
Yes. I want her to see it.

416
00:40:25,863 --> 00:40:27,423
I want the whole world to see.

417
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:31,703
I don't know if you're brave or stupid.

418
00:40:32,703 --> 00:40:34,103
I'm both of them.

419
00:40:38,863 --> 00:40:39,783
All right.

420
00:40:39,983 --> 00:40:41,063
I'll walk with you.

421
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:42,783
Ximen, Meizuo,

422
00:40:43,463 --> 00:40:45,183
you guys help distract the media.

423
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:12,503
-Say something.
-Where did you go?

424
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:13,943
-Can you explain?
-Please answer.

425
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:15,183
Mr. Daoming,

426
00:41:15,303 --> 00:41:16,983
-explain where you've been.
-Tell us.

427
00:41:17,223 --> 00:41:19,423
-We need to ask you something.
-Yes.

428
00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:20,743
-Mr. Daoming.
-Excuse us.

429
00:41:20,823 --> 00:41:22,783
-Please move.
-Talk to us.

430
00:41:23,423 --> 00:41:25,063
-Sir!
-We just want to interview you.

431
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:26,303
-Mr. Daoming!
-Excuse us.

432
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:28,903
-Excuse me.
-Talk to us.

433
00:41:29,423 --> 00:41:32,143
Mr. Daoming,
you were kidnapped for 72 hours.

434
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,783
What happened during that time?

435
00:41:34,063 --> 00:41:36,503
Were they international criminals?
Did you see them?

436
00:41:36,743 --> 00:41:38,623
Why is F4 here?

437
00:41:38,983 --> 00:41:40,263
-Please answer us.
-Talk to us.

438
00:41:40,343 --> 00:41:42,143
-Where were you?
-Mr. Daoming!

439
00:41:42,223 --> 00:41:43,783
-Is this your girlfriend?
-Mr. Daoming!

440
00:41:43,863 --> 00:41:44,783
Talk to us.

441
00:41:44,863 --> 00:41:46,223
-Answer us.

442
00:41:46,343 --> 00:41:48,383
-Get out of the way!
-Talk to us.

443
00:41:49,303 --> 00:41:50,303
Stop pushing!

444
00:41:51,703 --> 00:41:52,863
Please talk to us.

445
00:41:53,703 --> 00:41:54,983
We just want an interview.

446
00:41:55,103 --> 00:41:56,023
Mr. Daoming.

447
00:41:56,103 --> 00:41:58,463
-Excuse me.
-Tell us where you've been.

448
00:41:59,743 --> 00:42:01,103
-Tell us.
-Mr. Daoming.

449
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:03,223

-Mr. Daoming!

450
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:04,823
-Just a few words.
-Yes.

451
00:42:06,103 --> 00:42:07,103
Shancai!

452
00:42:08,023 --> 00:42:08,983
Shancai!

453
00:42:10,343 --> 00:42:11,343
Shancai!

454
00:42:14,303 --> 00:42:15,263
Shancai!

455
00:42:16,423 --> 00:42:17,503
Daoming Si!

456
00:42:22,423 --> 00:42:23,583
Daoming Si!

457
00:42:25,463 --> 00:42:26,463
Talk to us.

Mr. Daoming.

Talk to us.

461
00:42:42,263 --> 00:42:44,583

Talk to us.

465
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:51,023
-Mr. Daoming.
-Sir!

466
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:51,943
Please talk to us.

467
00:42:58,343 --> 00:42:59,183
Si!

468
00:43:00,543 --> 00:43:01,383
Shancai!

469
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:03,263
Shancai!

470
00:43:23,223 --> 00:43:25,103
This is because you're Daoming Si.

471
00:43:36,743 --> 00:43:38,223
-Help!
-He's bleeding!

472
00:43:38,303 --> 00:43:39,463

-What's wrong?

473
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:40,663

475
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,303
