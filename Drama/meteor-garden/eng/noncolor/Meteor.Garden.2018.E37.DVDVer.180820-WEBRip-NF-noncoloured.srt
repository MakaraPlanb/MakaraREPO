TALENT'S TEA SHOP

5
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:35,495
Hi. Your White Jasmine Dew
and Peach Red Royale.

6
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:36,735
-Please come again.
-Thank you.

7
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:56,175
Xiaoyou.

8
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:04,135
Where did you and Ximen go the other day?

9
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:06,575
Did anything happen?

10
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:09,415
Nothing happened.

11
00:02:14,895 --> 00:02:16,255
Xiaoyou, listen to me.

12
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:19,295
You and Ximen can be good friends.

13
00:02:19,695 --> 00:02:21,495
But you can't date him.

14
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,375
You'll get hurt, you know?

15
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,375
Why do you always say that about him?

16
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:29,095
Because I've seen it with my own eyes.

17
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:31,655
He dates girls one after another.

18
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:33,615
You know that too, right?

19
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:38,335
Ximen won't be serious with you...

20
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:39,375
No.

21
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:41,815
He won't be serious with anyone.

22
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:44,295
How do you know?

23
00:02:44,895 --> 00:02:45,935
Do you understand him?

24
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:48,975
You don't. So how can you conclude that?

25
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:50,935
How about you? Do you understand him?

26
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:52,975
Does he want you to understand him?

27
00:02:58,215 --> 00:02:59,775
That's none of your business.

28
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,615
Asking about other people's privacy
is very impolite.

29
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,215
You're right.

30
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:13,135
He doesn't.

31
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:17,735
I'm sorry, Xiaoyou.

32
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:19,735
I was too harsh.

33
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,215
I just don't want you to get hurt.

34
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:26,535
Shancai.

35
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:28,015
What is it?

36
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:33,375
One day, if Ximen treats me
like a stranger, don't be surprised.

37
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,815
You're acting really strange.

38
00:03:40,335 --> 00:03:41,615
I've already decided.

39
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:44,735
Decided what?

40
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:00,975
Cheers.

41
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,575
You're beautiful.

42
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:05,095
-You're so sweet.
-Okay.

43
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:09,575
How long have you been in Shanghai?

44
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:11,335
I just arrived here.

45
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:12,775
Really?

46
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:14,935
You're the first person I know here.

47
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:17,095
-Let's toast to our encounter.
-It's too noisy here.

48
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:18,935
Let's go somewhere else.

49
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:20,935
-Sure.
-It's Xiaoyou.

50
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:23,735
Why is she all alone there?

51
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:25,775
Did something happen to her?

52
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:30,815
Forget about her.

53
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:41,695
What do you want to drink?

54
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,455
I'm fine.

55
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:45,135
All right.

56
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,375
I think you like fruity cocktails.

57
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:50,575
The sweet ones.

58
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:52,255
Hey.

59
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:55,895
It's okay. I'll order if I want something.

60
00:04:56,335 --> 00:05:01,015
Aren't you here all alone
so that someone else can order for you?

61
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,415
No, that's not why I'm here.

62
00:05:04,975 --> 00:05:07,535
I noticed you immediately
when you came in.

63
00:05:08,095 --> 00:05:09,855
You sat here and didn't order anything.

64
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:13,935
Weren't you hoping someone
would come over and chat with you?

65
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:17,615
-Listen to me.
-All right. Buy me a drink.

66
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:19,855
I don't know the rules
since it's my first time here.

67
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:24,575
You're such a cute girl.

68
00:05:24,655 --> 00:05:26,375
No problem. Let's drink.

69
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:29,135
It's my treat. Order whatever you want.

70
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:38,295
Okay. Let's drink.

71
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,455
I can tell that you're not a girl
who frequents bars.

72
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:45,215
It's your first time in a bar

73
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:47,255
and we met.

74
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:48,735
I'm so lucky.

75
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:52,215
Someone bought me a drink
when it's my first time here.

76
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:53,495
I'm quite lucky too.

77
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:56,455
How alcohol tolerant are you?

78
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,975
I haven't really drunk that much before.

79
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:02,975
Then you will know
how much you can drink today.

80
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:09,255
Ximen.

81
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:12,655
Where are we going later?

82
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:16,255
Karaoke? A restaurant? Or to your place?

83
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:18,975
-To your place, of course.
-Really?

84
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:21,535
-Xiaoyou is drinking too much.
-One more glass.

85
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:25,175
Can she handle it?

86
00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:32,775
All that guy ordered for her
are strong drinks.

87
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:36,055
If this continues,
Xiaoyou will get drunk soon.

88
00:06:36,135 --> 00:06:37,495
Aren't you going to check on her?

89
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:50,655
You're sitting at the bar too.

90
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:52,815
I'm buying this time. What are you having?

91
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:54,895
You're so cute.

92
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:57,335
Guys are supposed to buy drinks for girls.

93
00:06:57,415 --> 00:06:59,335
Not the other way around.

94
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,055
Shouldn't I pay you back
for your generosity?

95
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,495
Let's make a deal first.
If you buy me a drink

96
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:07,495
and I get drunk,
you have to take responsibility.

97
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:09,455
One drink should be fine.

98
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:11,295
I don't want to owe you anything.

99
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:15,215
We'll have the same again.

100
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:18,295
-Are you drunk?
-I'm not.

101
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,415
-My face is just a bit hot.
-Let me see.

102
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:23,215
You had too much to drink.

103
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:25,495
Do you want to get some air outside?

104
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:27,655
-What do you think?
-There's no need.

105
00:07:27,735 --> 00:07:28,975
I want to go home.

106
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,255
The drink just arrived.

107
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:31,775
Maybe after this drink?

108
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,455
I bought that drink for you.

109
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:36,775
No.

110
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:40,335
You said you're going home.
So you have to drink this.

111
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:41,895
That's my wish.

112
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:44,775
If you don't want to drink it
and want to go home,

113
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:46,215
I'll take you home.

114
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:48,255
All right.

115
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:52,335
-I'll leave after I drink this.
-Sure.

116
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:54,095
I'll take you home after this.

117
00:07:58,135 --> 00:07:59,175
I'll drink this for her.

118
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:07,935
-Who are you?
-Done.

119
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:08,895
You can go now.

120
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:15,735
Bye then.

121
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:23,615
You're drunk, right?

122
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,095
You drank so much, of course you are.

123
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,015
I thought I'd be drunk.

124
00:08:29,095 --> 00:08:31,095
But I can actually drink a lot.

125
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:34,255
-Want to buy me another drink?
-Why are you doing this?

126
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:37,135
Why did you come to such a place?

127
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:40,975
If you can come here, I can too.

128
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,255
If you can drink, I can too.

129
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,735
And I learned how to order drinks today.

130
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,655
Never mind. I'll buy you a drink.

131
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:49,935
-We'll have the same--
-Come on.

132
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:01,775
I've already decided.

133
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:04,135
I want to be with you.

134
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:06,015
Do you know that you're giving me
a hard time?

135
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:08,295
And you're making me mad.

136
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:09,775
I know.

137
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:14,335
Stop being so self-centered.

138
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:17,535
Don't act like you want to give up
everything for me.

139
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,535
That doesn't work on me.

140
00:09:21,535 --> 00:09:24,335
And do you think other girls around me
never acted like you do?

141
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,975
But right now,
I'm the one in front of you.

142
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:48,175
You're...

143
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:50,535
really one of a kind.

144
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:55,895
Yes.

145
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,855
I think I'm a weirdo too.

146
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:01,775
So?

147
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:05,375
What do you want me to do?

148
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:10,335
Last time, you said
that there's always regret in love.

149
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:14,135
So did you also have regrets in love?

150
00:10:15,175 --> 00:10:16,455
Tell me.

151
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:18,535
Let me know.

152
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:23,495
I promise I'll stay away from you.
I won't bother you anymore.

153
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:30,895
All right.

154
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:32,575
I'll tell you.

155
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:36,575
But after this, leave me alone.

156
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:38,055
Okay.

157
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,455
What do you want to know?

158
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,375
Everything.

159
00:10:50,135 --> 00:10:51,935
<i>I knew a girl named Xiaogeng before.</i>

160
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:54,495
<i>We grew up together.</i>

161
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,535
<i>She used to live next door</i>

162
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:00,095
<i>and always came to play at my house.</i>

163
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:10,935
Seven.

164
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:13,215
Nine.

165
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:17,375
J.

166
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:20,535
I win.

167
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,095
Don't play poker again.

168
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:27,495
But I'm better at playing cards
than studying.

169
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:29,655
I can help you.

170
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:31,775
I'll help you get good grades.

171
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:35,775
Am I that easily convinced?

172
00:11:47,535 --> 00:11:49,135
<i>I'm used to having Xiaogeng by my side.</i>

173
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:53,215
<i>Being together
was as natural as breathing.</i>

174
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:06,815
You're not studying at all.

175
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:13,135
<i>But on the other hand,
she made me breathless.</i>

176
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:17,615
Even though my family seems
to be doing well,

177
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:20,455
it has been long broken.

178
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:22,455
Can't you just pretend?

179
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,895
You haven't been coming home.

180
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:27,255
Have you ever considered my position?

181
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:30,455
Can we stop fooling other people
as well as ourselves?

182
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:33,455
Let's stop pretending.

183
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:36,135
Whether we get divorced or not,

184
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:38,535
I'll take care of you.

185
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:41,895
-But we can't go back to the way we were.
-You...

186
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:44,495
<i>My parents' marriage was a lie.</i>

187
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:46,815
<i>They were leading false lives.</i>

188
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:48,815
<i>And they wanted me to live the same way.</i>

189
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:51,455
<i>But it was really hard.</i>

190
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:55,695
Tell me.

191
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:57,695
Can people's feelings

192
00:12:59,215 --> 00:13:00,855
remain unchanged their whole lives?

193
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:05,415
I get it now.

194
00:13:07,135 --> 00:13:09,215
You were influenced
by your parents' relationship.

195
00:13:09,815 --> 00:13:11,855
You don't trust love.

196
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:19,655
<i>I always saw and heard my mom crying.</i>

197
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:22,095
<i>I've learned one thing.</i>

198
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:24,535
<i>Love hurts people too much.</i>

199
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:26,615
<i>Love is like a sharp blade.</i>

200
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:30,295
<i>The more you hold on to it,
the deeper and more painful your wound is.</i>

201
00:13:31,615 --> 00:13:33,335
<i>I was fortunate
to have Xiaogeng by my side.</i>

202
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:35,895
<i>She was a switch given by the heavens</i>

203
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,095
<i>that could turn off
all the lies in this world.</i>

204
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:43,015
<i>At that time,</i>

205
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:46,055
<i>I felt relaxed whenever I saw Xiaogeng.</i>

206
00:13:46,255 --> 00:13:47,975
Chocolate.

207
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:51,255
Cake.

208
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:53,735
Ice cream.

209
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:58,855
They're so delicious.

210
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:02,655
<i>Xiaogeng was different from F3.</i>

211
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:08,135
<i>Her existence made me feel at peace.</i>

212
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:14,455
<i>I hoped our relationship
would never change.</i>

213
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:18,815
<i>I hoped we would always stay the same
forever and ever.</i>

214
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:29,655
Men don't seem
to like dolls and stuffed toys.

215
00:14:30,575 --> 00:14:31,535
It depends.

216
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:33,735
To me,

217
00:14:35,015 --> 00:14:36,415
you're the best stuffed toy.

218
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:38,295
Me? Do I look like one?

219
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,855
Then I'll become a doll.

220
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:47,455
<i>But Xiaogeng was not a doll.</i>

221
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,735
<i>She didn't just want to stay in one place.</i>

222
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:51,695
<i>She moved closer to me.</i>

223
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:54,415
<i>I knew she gathered up
her courage to do it.</i>

224
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:15,295
Look at me.

225
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:18,575
Do I look like a girl now?

226
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:21,775
Take me out.

227
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,415
Okay?

228
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,655
What has gotten into you today?

229
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:34,495
Why are you wearing that?

230
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:36,615
It looks so strange.

231
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,095
Did you also put on makeup?

232
00:15:43,295 --> 00:15:44,855
Don't change so quickly.

233
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:48,095
Go scare other people.
Don't come and scare me.

234
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:54,575
I know, right?

235
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:57,495
I think this doesn't suit me either.

236
00:15:58,055 --> 00:15:59,695
I'm too boyish.

237
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:08,775
By the way, I need to go and do something.

238
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,015
I'll get going now.

239
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,055
I'll come again tomorrow.

240
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:21,775
<i>I hurt her really bad
so that she wouldn't come near me.</i>

241
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:24,855
<i>Xiaogeng.</i>

242
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:27,775
<i>Please stay where you are.</i>

243
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:30,855
<i>It's the best for you and me.</i>

244
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:50,295
It's been a while since I tasted
the tea you made.

245
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,535
It's so good.

246
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:53,015
You're exaggerating.

247
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,575
It really is.

248
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:56,895
You've been busy lately.

249
00:16:57,335 --> 00:16:59,295
I don't see you when I come here.

250
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:03,175
What's the matter?
Why were you looking for me?

251
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:07,015
It's nothing.

252
00:17:09,615 --> 00:17:12,095
Xiaogeng, why don't you find a boyfriend?

253
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:18,135
What if I have a boyfriend
and you ask me to come for tea?

254
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:19,815
I won't be able to come then.

255
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:23,335
You think too much.

256
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:24,855
I'm always very busy.

257
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:28,335
<i>I ignored how hurt she felt.</i>

258
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:29,975
<i>And purposely stayed away.</i>

259
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:32,335
<i>I thought I was doing the right thing.</i>

260
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:35,495
<i>But Xiaogeng never came for tea again.</i>

261
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:46,975
All right. I'm done talking.

262
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:50,735
Based on our deal,

263
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:53,055
don't come to me again.

264
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:01,695
Your White Jasmine Dew.

265
00:18:03,495 --> 00:18:04,735
Please come again.

266
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:16,375
Hi, ma'am.

267
00:18:16,975 --> 00:18:18,855
-Is Xiaoyou not coming today?
-No.

268
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:21,015
She called and said
she won't be coming for a while.

269
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:21,975
Why?

270
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:23,215
She didn't tell me.

271
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:25,375
She sounded quite down.

272
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:26,655
So I didn't ask.

273
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:30,095
So you have to work extra hard.

274
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,655
-I'm sorry about that.
-It's fine.

275
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:43,975
Did you bring your friend home today?

276
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:47,415
What do you care?

277
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:49,255
It doesn't matter if you did.

278
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:51,575
We didn't see anything anyway.

279
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:53,255
We wouldn't say anything if we did.

280
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:24,975
ZHUANG

281
00:19:26,055 --> 00:19:27,735
<i>I went back to London.</i>

282
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:29,055
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

283
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,575
<i>And take good care of Shancai.</i>

284
00:19:31,575 --> 00:19:34,775
<i>By the way, are you satisfied
with my arrangement?</i>

285
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:43,495
Arrangement?

286
00:20:05,575 --> 00:20:06,735
<i>That night,</i>

287
00:20:06,975 --> 00:20:09,495
<i>Ximen said his story
with Xiaogeng's was over.</i>

288
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:12,815
<i>But I don't think so.</i>

289
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:15,095
<i>He's still not over it.</i>

290
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:20,255
<i>I feel so lost going around
all these buildings.</i>

291
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:22,215
<i>But I'm determined to do so.</i>

292
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:26,975
<i>Because I really want to find the answer.</i>

293
00:20:59,895 --> 00:21:00,855
Xiaoyou.

294
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:04,775
Mom.

295
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:09,255
Come here. I want to talk to you.

296
00:21:15,855 --> 00:21:18,735
Xiaoyou, where do you always go at night?

297
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:22,295
You leave in the middle of the night
and return early morning.

298
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,495
Right?

299
00:21:26,215 --> 00:21:29,135
Are you doing something
that you can't tell me?

300
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,535
No. I'm not.

301
00:21:34,615 --> 00:21:35,455
What is this?

302
00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:46,175
What exactly are you looking for?

303
00:21:47,415 --> 00:21:49,295
Names of different buildings
are listed there.

304
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:53,735
And you marked the places
you've been and haven't been to.

305
00:21:54,295 --> 00:21:55,495
What are you looking for?

306
00:21:58,175 --> 00:22:00,615
I'm not doing anything
you should worry about.

307
00:22:06,135 --> 00:22:10,375
This might be
a very important time for me.

308
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:13,895
Mom, I hope you understand.

309
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:41,055
Hey.

310
00:22:41,175 --> 00:22:43,095
What is it? You scared me, you jerk.

311
00:22:49,175 --> 00:22:50,615
Where are your bodyguards?

312
00:22:52,935 --> 00:22:54,135
My sister took care of them.

313
00:23:07,455 --> 00:23:08,295
Listen carefully.

314
00:23:08,895 --> 00:23:11,855
You didn't see anything.
And you won't say anything.

315
00:23:12,135 --> 00:23:13,015
Understand?

316
00:23:15,575 --> 00:23:16,495
Wait.

317
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:22,735
As Daoming family's bodyguards,
that won't work.

318
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:27,415
Even if you're a bodyguard,

319
00:23:27,535 --> 00:23:29,775
you have to look good
and be more confident.

320
00:23:35,855 --> 00:23:37,335
Ms. Zhuang is so strange.

321
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:40,135
My sister is really unusual.

322
00:23:40,935 --> 00:23:43,655
Why would she have such
an outstanding brother otherwise?

323
00:23:45,335 --> 00:23:46,615
Ms. Zhuang is really outstanding.

324
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,495
But you...

325
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:50,935
What?

326
00:23:52,095 --> 00:23:53,655
Say it clearly, stupid girl.

327
00:23:53,735 --> 00:23:55,415
You're the stupid one, the stupidest.

328
00:23:55,495 --> 00:23:57,975
Me? You're the stupidest of them all.

329
00:23:58,535 --> 00:24:00,615
If you didn't pull down your teammates,

330
00:24:00,735 --> 00:24:03,335
I'd have already conquered
Fantasy Westward Journey.

331
00:24:05,535 --> 00:24:07,255
Fantasy? Fantasy what?

332
00:24:07,335 --> 00:24:08,415
Fantasy Westward Journey?

333
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:13,015
Yes.

334
00:24:13,655 --> 00:24:15,775
-You can play it, why can't I?
-I...

335
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:19,095
I didn't say you can't play it.

336
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:20,895
But you never played with me.

337
00:24:20,975 --> 00:24:23,055
How would you know
if I pulled down my teammates?

338
00:24:24,135 --> 00:24:25,975
I play with you all the time.

339
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:28,495
I know clearly how you play.

340
00:24:29,015 --> 00:24:29,895
What?

341
00:24:30,615 --> 00:24:31,655
All right.

342
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:34,055
Actually, I'm "I Call the Shots."

343
00:24:35,895 --> 00:24:37,615
You're "I Call the Shots"?

344
00:24:38,735 --> 00:24:41,335
How's that possible?
He's the X9 League champion.

345
00:24:41,415 --> 00:24:42,935
How can you play so well?

346
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,295
You don't believe me?

347
00:24:51,215 --> 00:24:53,095
What do you think? I'm so cool, right?

348
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:56,095
I've wanted to show you for a long time.
I just haven't had the chance.

349
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:00,815
You're really "I Call the Shots."

350
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:02,735
You're amazing.

351
00:25:05,095 --> 00:25:08,295
But don't use codenames to play games
without me knowing again.

352
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,215
I'll do whatever I want. Why do you care?

353
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:28,095
Shancai.

354
00:25:28,615 --> 00:25:31,135
Is that the medal
in Fantasy Westward Journey?

355
00:25:31,815 --> 00:25:32,775
Yes.

356
00:25:33,335 --> 00:25:36,095
You're amazing.
You got the champion medal.

357
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:38,055
I like it so much.

358
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:39,855
Can you give it to me?

359
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:43,335
I really treasure this. You wish.

360
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,775
How stingy of you.

361
00:25:56,695 --> 00:25:58,175
<i>It's been days.</i>

362
00:25:58,735 --> 00:26:01,775
<i>I've been going to different buildings
in the city after my class.</i>

363
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:04,895
<i>I don't even know what I'm looking for.</i>

364
00:26:06,015 --> 00:26:08,975
<i>But like Xiaogeng,
I want to do this for Ximen.</i>

365
00:26:10,055 --> 00:26:11,655
<i>So I couldn't stop.</i>

366
00:26:19,735 --> 00:26:21,895
ENTER STREET AFTER 29 METERS

367
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,575
BEEN THERE

368
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:09,655
Where's Si?

369
00:28:10,935 --> 00:28:12,095
He should be here soon.

370
00:28:13,295 --> 00:28:14,975
Why do you look like
you're only half-awake?

371
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:18,255
It's too early.

372
00:28:19,455 --> 00:28:21,975
How is it too early?
It's already noon, okay?

373
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:33,015
How's your recital practice going?

374
00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:34,175
It's all right.

375
00:28:34,775 --> 00:28:35,815
How about you?

376
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:37,775
I'm quite interested
in your exhibit this time.

377
00:28:37,855 --> 00:28:39,535
I knew you'd like it.

378
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,815
We'll be done with the preparations soon.

379
00:28:41,895 --> 00:28:43,495
You have to be there on the opening day.

380
00:28:44,295 --> 00:28:45,135
Okay.

381
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:53,295
It's so hard to even go on a date now.
I'm so envious of the college students.

382
00:28:53,855 --> 00:28:55,615
They can have a daily romance.

383
00:28:59,175 --> 00:29:00,015
Ximen.

384
00:29:03,255 --> 00:29:04,775
How did it go with Xiaoyou that night?

385
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:16,735
You didn't come back to the bar.
You also didn't answer my calls.

386
00:29:17,935 --> 00:29:19,855
-Xiaoyou has fallen, right?
-Fallen?

387
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:22,135
What do you mean?

388
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,335
Nothing. We're talking about someone else.

389
00:29:29,655 --> 00:29:30,655
Xiaoyou?

390
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,815
Oh. Shancai's best friend.

391
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:41,095
Lei, aren't you usually bad with names?

392
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:44,655
Hey, didn't you say you will never
touch Xiaoyou?

393
00:30:05,895 --> 00:30:07,855
What's going on?
I just arrived and he left.

394
00:30:12,935 --> 00:30:17,375
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

395
00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:25,015
-Two Peach Red Royales.
-Thank you.

396
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:26,255
Please come again.

397
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:47,135
Xiaoyou.

398
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:50,935
Can you tell me what's going on
between you and Ximen?

399
00:30:52,535 --> 00:30:53,975
Shancai, stop asking me.

400
00:30:54,535 --> 00:30:56,575
This is between me and Ximen.

401
00:30:56,935 --> 00:30:58,695
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

402
00:30:59,095 --> 00:31:01,015
But I'm really worried about you.

403
00:31:01,815 --> 00:31:04,815
I met Ximen today.
He was also acting quite strange.

404
00:31:06,775 --> 00:31:07,775
He was?

405
00:31:08,455 --> 00:31:09,295
Yes.

406
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:11,375
Both of you are not like yourselves.

407
00:31:13,935 --> 00:31:15,775
It's all because of me.

408
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:17,535
I'll take care of it.

409
00:31:20,175 --> 00:31:23,135
I don't understand what you're saying.

410
00:31:23,335 --> 00:31:24,575
It'll be fine, Shancai.

411
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:26,535
Just cheer for me.

412
00:31:27,335 --> 00:31:28,775
I hope you can cheer for me.

413
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,055
That's what you said before.

414
00:31:32,215 --> 00:31:33,855
I just want to hear that.

415
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:37,375
All right.

416
00:31:37,815 --> 00:31:38,815
You can do it.

417
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,735
By the way, I told our boss
I'd leave earlier.

418
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:46,855
I'll leave the rest to you then.
I'll get going now. Bye.

419
00:31:48,335 --> 00:31:49,815
Hey. Wait.

420
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:51,935
Why? Did something happen again?

421
00:31:52,015 --> 00:31:52,855
Xiaoyou.

422
00:31:53,295 --> 00:31:54,135
Hey.

423
00:32:09,655 --> 00:32:10,495
Daoming Si.

424
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:14,615
I'm being serious. Bring me to Ximen.

425
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:16,815
Why?

426
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:20,655
I don't care. Bring me to Ximen
or we're breaking up.

427
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:29,495
Have you had dinner?

428
00:32:30,095 --> 00:32:31,855
Yes. Do you believe that?

429
00:32:33,215 --> 00:32:34,175
I don't think so.

430
00:32:38,935 --> 00:32:40,575
Si, why are you here?

431
00:32:42,935 --> 00:32:43,895
Something's up.

432
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:49,095
Miss, don't be fooled by this wolf
in sheep's clothing.

433
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,135
Shancai.

434
00:32:50,695 --> 00:32:52,415
Don't you have anything better to do?

435
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:56,455
Do you know that Xiaoyou's so down
and she's crying every day?

436
00:32:56,695 --> 00:32:58,095
Isn't that because of you?

437
00:32:58,175 --> 00:32:59,575
It can't be because of someone else.

438
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,975
Tell me. What exactly happened
between you two?

439
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,175
Nothing happened.

440
00:33:06,255 --> 00:33:08,295
But she has to grow up.

441
00:33:09,895 --> 00:33:12,095
No. Let's talk about it outside.

442
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:18,855
Hey.

443
00:33:43,215 --> 00:33:46,815
Xiaoyou is serious about you.
Why are you so irresponsible?

444
00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:48,735
Do you have to be so mad?

445
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,535
What does Xiaoyou's business
have to do with you?

446
00:33:52,335 --> 00:33:53,775
She's my friend.

447
00:33:54,295 --> 00:33:55,935
How can I not be concerned?

448
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,375
And you.

449
00:33:57,815 --> 00:33:59,415
You're such a lousy friend.

450
00:33:59,975 --> 00:34:02,175
Can't you just date seriously?

451
00:34:02,255 --> 00:34:04,175
Can't you just treasure nice girls?

452
00:34:05,935 --> 00:34:06,855
That's right.

453
00:34:07,055 --> 00:34:09,215
-Learn from me.
-Haven't you had enough?

454
00:34:12,575 --> 00:34:14,735
If you don't like Xiaoyou,
why did you show any interest?

455
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:18,415
Yes. I did show some interest.

456
00:34:18,495 --> 00:34:19,655
I regret it now.

457
00:34:20,295 --> 00:34:23,295
I'm not a good man.
I'll never be with her.

458
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:25,415
Satisfied?

459
00:34:28,415 --> 00:34:29,735
Hey, Ximen.

460
00:34:48,775 --> 00:34:50,815
Why did you do that?
Why did you go to Ximen?

461
00:34:50,895 --> 00:34:52,615
I told you I'd take care of it.

462
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:53,615
Take care of what?

463
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,495
What can you take care of?

464
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:56,775
I...

465
00:34:59,095 --> 00:35:01,575
You haven't been to work or home.
What are you trying to do?

466
00:35:02,415 --> 00:35:04,255
Ximen said he doesn't like you.

467
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,255
I know. You don't have to remind me.

468
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:16,655
Is this all worth it

469
00:35:17,735 --> 00:35:18,575
just for Ximen?

470
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:22,375
Shancai.

471
00:35:23,095 --> 00:35:24,295
Don't mind me.

472
00:35:24,775 --> 00:35:26,655
Just let me do what I want.

473
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,935
He treated you that way.

474
00:35:32,535 --> 00:35:33,735
You still refuse to give up?

475
00:35:35,935 --> 00:35:39,975
I want to know
what the girl Ximen liked did for him

476
00:35:40,415 --> 00:35:41,615
or else I won't feel at ease.

477
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:45,215
Does it matter if you find out?

478
00:35:45,575 --> 00:35:48,375
Yes. It matters to me now.

479
00:36:06,335 --> 00:36:08,455
Xiaogeng is the only one who knows you

480
00:36:10,575 --> 00:36:12,375
before you led a false life

481
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:14,255
or maybe even after that.

482
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,855
You left your sincerity
in the Way of the Tea.

483
00:36:18,415 --> 00:36:19,855
She knew that.

484
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:25,455
<i>Have you ever heard of what they call
"Once in a Lifetime" in the tea ceremony?</i>

485
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,695
<i>The first time I heard of it</i>

486
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:34,335
<i>was when my teacher mentioned it.</i>

487
00:36:39,455 --> 00:36:42,615
Do you know what "Once in a Lifetime"
means in the Way of the Tea?

488
00:36:44,015 --> 00:36:46,375
It means

489
00:36:46,935 --> 00:36:50,295
a certain encounter
will only happen once in this life.

490
00:36:51,135 --> 00:36:54,735
Treasure every encounter
as if it's the last one.

491
00:36:55,535 --> 00:36:56,815
<i>Do everything you can.</i>

492
00:36:57,295 --> 00:36:58,375
<i>Don't have any regrets.</i>

493
00:36:59,415 --> 00:37:02,495
<i>No matter what you do
or who you encounter,</i>

494
00:37:02,975 --> 00:37:04,455
<i>that's the attitude</i>

495
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:07,655
<i>you should have in life.</i>

496
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:19,415
The Way of the Tea's "Once in a Lifetime"

497
00:37:20,215 --> 00:37:21,855
is a pursuit of sincerity.

498
00:37:25,455 --> 00:37:26,375
And...

499
00:37:28,335 --> 00:37:29,535
I could never do that.

500
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:33,575
What happened between you two?

501
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:23,055
QZONE MESSAGE FROM XIAOGENG

502
00:38:25,295 --> 00:38:27,295
<i>Ximen. This is Xiaogeng.</i>

503
00:38:28,695 --> 00:38:30,175
I have something to show you.

504
00:38:30,655 --> 00:38:32,015
I'll send you the address.

505
00:38:32,095 --> 00:38:33,375
See you at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

506
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:48,495
<i>Ximen said</i>

507
00:38:48,975 --> 00:38:51,975
<i>she never went to his house to have tea,
do homework, and play cards again.</i>

508
00:38:52,575 --> 00:38:56,135
<i>The last time she contacted him
was for a date.</i>

509
00:38:57,615 --> 00:38:59,255
<i>She set it at a specific location</i>

510
00:39:00,015 --> 00:39:01,335
<i>at a specific time,</i>

511
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:03,655
<i>which was at 5 a.m.</i>

512
00:39:06,535 --> 00:39:09,415
<i>I keep telling myself it would be fine.</i>

513
00:39:10,495 --> 00:39:13,975
<i>As long as we never begin anything,
there'd be no ending as well.</i>

514
00:39:15,495 --> 00:39:16,815
<i>As long as I don't go there,</i>

515
00:39:17,215 --> 00:39:19,935
<i>Xiaogeng and I can surely
go back to the way we were.</i>

516
00:39:21,135 --> 00:39:22,695
<i>Because I don't want to lose her.</i>

517
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:38,055
Don't you want to know
what Xiaogeng wanted to show you?

518
00:39:47,735 --> 00:39:48,735
<i>That day,</i>

519
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:53,295
<i>Ximen simply deleted
the address Xiaogeng sent.</i>

520
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:55,815
<i>He didn't want to look at it.</i>

521
00:39:56,615 --> 00:39:58,015
<i>By not knowing where it was,</i>

522
00:39:58,255 --> 00:40:01,135
<i>he could repress his feelings
and not go there.</i>

523
00:40:02,135 --> 00:40:04,135
<i>Because he didn't have
the courage to find out</i>

524
00:40:04,815 --> 00:40:06,695
<i>what Xiaogeng wants to confess to him.</i>

525
00:40:31,255 --> 00:40:33,135
Did you listen to
the QZone voice message I sent?

526
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:35,855
I did.

527
00:40:36,175 --> 00:40:39,015
But I went out with my friends
all night yesterday.

528
00:40:40,735 --> 00:40:41,655
I see.

529
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:43,775
Xiaogeng.

530
00:40:44,135 --> 00:40:47,895
I mean, who meets at 5 a.m.?

531
00:40:48,335 --> 00:40:49,375
It's too early.

532
00:40:53,695 --> 00:40:56,415
I had too much fun last night.
I'm going to sleep now.

533
00:40:57,095 --> 00:40:58,295
Ximen.

534
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:01,935
<i>It'll be all right.</i>

535
00:41:02,735 --> 00:41:03,975
<i>I told myself</i>

00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,975
<i>that tomorrow, Xiaogeng
would be back like nothing happened.</i>

537
00:41:08,975 --> 00:41:11,335
<i>She'd surely come to me with a smile then.</i>

538
00:41:12,295 --> 00:41:13,855
<i>We'd surely be back to the way we were.</i>

539
00:41:15,135 --> 00:41:16,055
<i>Because...</i>

540
00:41:17,135 --> 00:41:18,495
<i>I don't want to lose her.</i>

541
00:41:41,655 --> 00:41:42,535
Goodbye.
