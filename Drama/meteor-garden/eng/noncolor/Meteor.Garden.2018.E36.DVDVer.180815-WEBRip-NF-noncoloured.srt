METEOR GARDEN

00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:30,031
EPISODE 36

4
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:12,671
Hey.

5
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,831
What are you doing outside?

6
00:03:18,511 --> 00:03:19,391
I...

7
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:21,191
I came out for some air.

8
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:27,911
Me too.

9
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:36,631
Well, I'll go inside then.

10
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:39,191
Shancai.

11
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,431
Can you give me a hug before you go?

12
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:56,431
Just one time.

13
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:00,911
You're so petty. Can't it be twice?

14
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:03,191
If I don't set a limit,
you'll keep on hugging me.

15
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:07,431
Come here.

16
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:09,151
You got it.

17
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:10,751
Five more times.

18
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:17,671
Last night, after giving 100 hugs,

19
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:20,391
I couldn't sleep the whole night.

20
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:27,311
I wasn't like this when I was a cleaner
at his house.

21
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:17,311
Why am I frying two eggs?

22
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:20,511
Don't I usually just have one egg?

23
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:31,071
That silly Daoming Si

24
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:33,471
just simply entered into my world.

25
00:06:34,031 --> 00:06:35,111
If I don't take care of him,

26
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:38,111
I'm not sure how bad he'll end up.

27
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:40,551
He's so childish.

28
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:02,551
That's strange. Why is the door open?

29
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:07,311
This guy is so stupid.
He didn't close the door last night.

30
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:26,951
Turns out he wasn't home.

31
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:45,551
I never thought you'd live
in such a place for Shancai.

32
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:50,671
The power of love is so scary.

33
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:54,511
This can be a classic tutorial
in Ximen's Love Lessons.

34
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:57,911
A tutorial of what not to do.

35
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:01,791
The ceiling's so low and it's old.

36
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:03,951
Won't you hit your head when you stand up?

37
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,431
Won't your legs hit the wall
when you stretch them out?

38
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:10,671
I'm really a supermodel.

39
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,831
That's why I couldn't
sleep well all night.

40
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:19,391
That's really not the point, okay?

41
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:23,871
You don't get it.

42
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:26,471
A place with cockroaches is really cool.

43
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,991
I really like it.

44
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:32,351
<i>I never thought
he'd endure all that for me.</i>

45
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:35,271
<i>He even said that he liked
this kind of life with a smile.</i>

46
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:38,991
<i>Daoming Si, why are you so good to me?</i>

47
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:41,391
<i>I feel so guilty.</i>

48
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,951
You're saying a place like that
with Shancai is really cool, right?

49
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:47,871
You're out of line.

50
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:49,991
You're changing my concept.

51
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,391
Which concept?

52
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:55,671
Shancai is a weed.

53
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,471
She's definitely not a cockroach.

54
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:01,911
She is my little white pig.

55
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:11,711
Then did you hug your little white pig
last night?

56
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:12,951
Here, piggy.

57
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,351
Tell the truth.

58
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:16,351
What happened last night?

59
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:22,911
You're too concerned about me.

60
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:24,951
You ask me personal questions
in school every day.

61
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:28,071
You're the one who asked us to come here
and think of a plan.

62
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:30,671
Okay. You're a good friend.

63
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:32,671
All right. I'm going home for a nap.

64
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:38,911
Ximen.

65
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:41,271
Are you seeing Xiaoyou lately?

66
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:43,231
How do you know?

67
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:45,271
Are you stalking me?

68
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:47,991
But...

69
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:51,271
an innocent girl like Xiaoyou
is not your type, right?

70
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:55,551
Don't worry. I didn't do anything.

71
00:09:55,991 --> 00:09:57,511
I just took her to a hotel.

72
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:00,511
<i>What? They went to a hotel?</i>

73
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:04,191
Shancai.

74
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:08,311
Do you think this lipstick color suits me?

75
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:16,671
I think this suits you better.

76
00:10:18,471 --> 00:10:20,111
Okay. I'll use the Coral Fauve color then.

77
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:27,191
Aren't you afraid Shancai will punch you?

78
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:29,791
Shancai? Is she her mom or guardian?

79
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:31,431
Why is she interfering with her life?

80
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,911
Be good.

81
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,191
Don't worry. I know my limits.

82
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:52,231
Hey, Ximen.

83
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:54,871
Oh, it's you Shancai.

84
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:57,191
I have something to tell you.

85
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,111
How is it?

86
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,791
Do you like living so closely with Si?

87
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:03,271
What do you mean?

88
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,591
Daoming Si just rented the place
next door.

89
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,031
That's still a step further than before.

90
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:10,031
That means he finally gets it now.

91
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:14,071
By the way, he went home already.
I'll get going.

92
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,751
Hey, wait.

93
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:20,631
Ximen.

94
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:24,431
If you're not serious about Xiaoyou,

95
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:26,951
please stop now.

96
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:34,551
I heard you went to a hotel.

97
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:36,031
Is that true?

98
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:39,511
Shancai.

99
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:41,551
-Qinghe likes you, you know?
-Qinghe...

100
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:43,551
Don't joke about that.

101
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:46,871
I'm just showing you an example.

102
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:48,991
Qinghe likes you, but you like Si.

103
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:50,871
He's well aware of that.

104
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:53,471
But he still told you,
"Shancai, I'll wait for you to come back."

105
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:57,431
What would you do if it were you?

106
00:11:58,671 --> 00:11:59,511
I...

107
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:02,871
I'll always be his good friend.

108
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:05,751
I won't date him even if I'm single.

109
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,111
That's right.

110
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:08,951
That's exactly how Xiaoyou is to me.

111
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,271
So don't worry.

112
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:12,711
Then...

113
00:12:13,071 --> 00:12:16,071
-You promise you won't do anything to her?
-I won't make any promises.

114
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:19,271
-You don't have the right to ask me that.
-Then you'll do something to her?

115
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:22,271
What do you mean?

116
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:27,591
You're so cunning. You know what I mean.

117
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,151
I won't do whatever it is you're thinking.

118
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:36,711
That means you promise...

119
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:38,551
No, you said you won't promise anything.

120
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,791
Then will you or won't you?

121
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:42,791
Hey.

122
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:44,351
Hey.

123
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:19,351
<i>Why is it so quiet over there?</i>

124
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:21,431
<i>Is Daoming Si not home?</i>

125
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:37,631
<i>What's happening to me?</i>

126
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:41,031
<i>Why is he all I can think of?</i>

127
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:43,831
<i>I get more anxious when I think of him.</i>

128
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,151
Hey.

129
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:24,511
What? You're like a ghost.
Are you trying to scare me to death?

130
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:26,671
How dare you call me a ghost.

131
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:30,351
You stare at me with those big eyes.
You walk without a sound.

132
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:31,551
What else should I call you?

133
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:36,551
Good thing I have a strong heart.

134
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:39,111
Or else I'd be scared to death.

135
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:41,271
You're the scary one.

136
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:45,351
It's the middle of the night
but you're sitting alone by the door.

137
00:16:47,911 --> 00:16:51,191
The bugs are bothering me, okay?
I couldn't sleep with all the noise.

138
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:56,231
That's right.

139
00:16:57,311 --> 00:17:00,191
This kind of old house has a lot of bugs.

140
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:03,671
And termites. And cockroaches.

141
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:06,351
So why are you staying here?

142
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,351
Isn't it more comfortable
at your own house?

143
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:12,711
What do you care? I rented this place.

144
00:17:13,271 --> 00:17:15,391
I can come and go whenever I want.

145
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:25,671
Don't force yourself anymore.

146
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:28,431
This is not a place you like staying at.

147
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:33,631
Who says I don't like staying here?

148
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:36,351
I like to battle with the cockroaches.

149
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:37,551
Can't I do that?

150
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:42,831
Daoming Si.

151
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:48,391
We're not part of the same world.

152
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:53,351
Don't force yourself to stay
in such a lousy place for me.

153
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:56,151
I feel more miserable that way, you know?

154
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:09,791
Shancai.

155
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:14,351
You care about me.
That's why you're saying this, right?

156
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:18,551
Of course not.

157
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,751
I'm saying...

158
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:28,551
can you not enter my world so easily?

159
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:37,071
We both know

160
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:40,351
that this relationship
would not have a happy ending.

161
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:50,631
The deeper I fall,

162
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:54,471
the more anxious I get.

163
00:18:58,311 --> 00:18:59,431
I'm such a fool.

164
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:02,471
You're stupid too.

165
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,311
Stupid?

166
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,791
How dare you say I'm stupid.

167
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:10,511
If you're not stupid, why did you
fall for a person like me?

168
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:15,871
I'm truly stupid for loving someone

169
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:17,831
who is stupider than me.

170
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:31,951
Did you feel lonely because I'm not here?

171
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,071
Stop thinking so highly of yourself.

172
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:46,591
Actually, I've been coming at 1 a.m.
and going back at 5 a.m. all this time.

173
00:19:46,671 --> 00:19:47,671
You just didn't know it.

174
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:53,311
Liar.

175
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:55,991
Why would I lie to you?

176
00:19:56,631 --> 00:19:58,151
It's more dangerous at that time.

177
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,071
Don't thieves come
in the middle of the night?

178
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,591
And our bodyguards are keeping
a tight watch.

179
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:04,871
My every move is under surveillance.

180
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:09,591
Then wouldn't your mom soon find out

181
00:20:10,431 --> 00:20:12,831
that you've been coming here?

182
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,991
That's why I leave
in the middle of the night.

183
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:17,231
And I don't dare take my car.

184
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:18,871
I just hail cabs.

185
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:30,671
What's wrong? It's fine.

186
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:34,791
I...

187
00:20:56,311 --> 00:20:57,591
So that's what you've been doing.

188
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,431
I'm really stupid.

189
00:21:03,391 --> 00:21:06,631
I'm throwing a fit here
in the middle of the night.

190
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,551
It's so embarrassing.

191
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:17,871
I'm so sleepy.

192
00:21:18,271 --> 00:21:19,711
It's late. You must be tired, right?

193
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,071
Go home and get some rest.

194
00:21:23,391 --> 00:21:24,511
Okay.

195
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,311
I'll go back to bed then.

196
00:21:27,991 --> 00:21:29,111
Good night.

197
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:30,951
Good night.

198
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:42,911
Daoming Si.

199
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:49,031
You can't sleep,

200
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:50,431
right?

201
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:55,271
I'm so high-maintenance.
Of course I can't sleep.

202
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:00,751
If you're afraid

203
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:04,551
to sleep alone...

204
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:11,031
I'll sleep with you.

205
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:47,871
Are you sure you want to sleep with me?

206
00:22:48,751 --> 00:22:49,911
Don't worry.

207
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:51,551
I won't do anything to you.

208
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:55,951
You're not worried.

209
00:22:56,671 --> 00:22:57,951
But I'm worried.

210
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:02,711
Last time when you came back from London
and slept at my house,

211
00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:04,871
didn't we also sleep together?

212
00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:09,671
This is not the first time.
Why are you making such a big fuss?

213
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:22,951
I'll just lay down beside you
until you fall to sleep.

214
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,271
Why are you looking at me?

215
00:23:50,311 --> 00:23:52,551
Because I want to. Can't I?

216
00:23:53,191 --> 00:23:54,511
I'm warning you.

217
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:56,551
Don't get any weird thoughts.

218
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:01,951
I'm just sleeping beside you
like your mom when you were little.

219
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:04,471
My mom

220
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,791
slept beside me like this.

221
00:24:08,191 --> 00:24:09,671
-What are you doing? Let go.
-No.

222
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:12,071
-Let go.
-No.

223
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:27,111
You can't sleep, right?

224
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:31,511
Do you want me to sing you a lullaby?

225
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:36,351
<i>Lullaby</i>

226
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:38,711
<i>and good night</i>

227
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:41,191
<i>-Now the daytime--
</i>-All right. Stop singing.

228
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:42,911
Why?

229
00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:45,631
Is my voice too nice

230
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:48,071
that you can't take it?

231
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:52,111
It's not only nice. My ears feel plugged.

232
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:55,111
Do you want me to unclog them?

233
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:57,231
"Unclog"? Do you think I'm a sewer?

234
00:25:02,071 --> 00:25:04,191
Okay. So are you sleeping or not?

235
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:06,591
Good night.

236
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,231
Daoming Si.

237
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:28,951
What?

238
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,071
Thank you.

239
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:38,151
I'm so happy

240
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:40,151
today.

241
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:46,271
Because even though our lives
are so different,

242
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:49,831
and we're not part of the same world,

243
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:53,831
you...

244
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:56,591
try so hard to be a part of my world

245
00:25:57,711 --> 00:25:59,871
in order to adjust to me.

246
00:26:04,431 --> 00:26:08,191
Even though I've already decided
to be with you against all odds.

247
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,431
But...

248
00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:16,711
actually, I feel so anxious about it.

249
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:23,951
I feel so confused and tired

250
00:26:25,991 --> 00:26:27,751
thinking about the problems

251
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:30,351
we have to face.

252
00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:39,671
Don't think too much.
Everything will be all right.

253
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:50,431
Shancai.

254
00:26:51,431 --> 00:26:52,911
I want to turn around and hug you.

255
00:27:01,831 --> 00:27:03,111
I'm turning around now.

256
00:27:45,191 --> 00:27:47,151
She can even sleep in this situation.

257
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:49,071
What a stupid girl.

258
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:52,551
Aren't you afraid I won't be able
to control myself?

259
00:28:41,231 --> 00:28:43,071
Zhuang, you're back?

260
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,951
What's with the bodyguards?

261
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,671
I just left for a while and everything
fell into chaos?

262
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:53,951
Mrs. Yu, what exactly happened?

263
00:28:55,431 --> 00:28:56,671
These days,

264
00:28:56,991 --> 00:29:00,151
Si leaves in the middle of the night
and returns in the morning

265
00:29:00,311 --> 00:29:02,071
in order to be with Shancai.

266
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:05,031
The President threw a fit
after she found out.

267
00:29:05,631 --> 00:29:07,871
And sent bodyguards to watch him.

268
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,031
She's way out of line!

269
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,551
Does she plan to use the tricks

270
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:17,231
she used on me to separate Si and Shancai?

271
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:21,471
Hasn't she done enough?

272
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:23,791
Zhuang.

273
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:27,471
You know the President's temper very well.

274
00:29:27,551 --> 00:29:28,431
No.

275
00:29:29,111 --> 00:29:30,271
I can't let her do this.

276
00:29:30,711 --> 00:29:32,071
Where's Si?

277
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:33,871
Upstairs in the bedroom.

278
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:47,911
Scram.

279
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:08,111
Youngsters nowadays,
have really great skills.

280
00:30:08,671 --> 00:30:12,231
Si must have gotten out
from that window over there.

281
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:17,711
Should we continue pretending
Si's in this room

282
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:19,591
for the benefit of the bodyguard outside?

283
00:30:22,351 --> 00:30:24,711
Si, get up!

284
00:30:25,071 --> 00:30:26,391
Your sister's back.

285
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,111
Wake up and chat with me.

286
00:30:29,071 --> 00:30:30,871
Wake up!

287
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:39,351
Mom, I just came back
from the property office.

288
00:30:40,191 --> 00:30:41,071
Yes.

289
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:43,231
I have already added more locks
on the doors.

290
00:30:43,311 --> 00:30:44,351
Don't worry. I'm fine.

291
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:46,191
You and Dad take care too.

292
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:48,031
Bye.

293
00:30:48,591 --> 00:30:50,151
Yes. Shancai's not home yet.

294
00:30:51,471 --> 00:30:52,791
I'll continue monitoring her.

295
00:30:55,551 --> 00:30:56,911
Please don't worry, ma'am.

296
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:19,631
Hello?

297
00:31:19,951 --> 00:31:21,191
Hello, Daoming Si.

298
00:31:22,111 --> 00:31:24,711
-Where are you now?
-I'm almost there.

299
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:26,751
Why? Do you miss me?

300
00:31:27,631 --> 00:31:28,951
In your dreams.

301
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,391
<i>Your bodyguards are in front of my door.</i>

302
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:33,831
Go to the corridor entrance.

303
00:32:05,311 --> 00:32:06,511
What should we do?

304
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,991
Don't worry. We'll think of something.

305
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:11,751
How about going to Ximen
or Meizuo's house?

306
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:15,191
No. Their houses must be
under surveillance too.

307
00:32:17,591 --> 00:32:18,631
What should we do?

308
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:20,831
We can't stay out on the streets, right?

309
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:22,551
How about going to a hotel?

310
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:25,151
What? Hotel?

311
00:32:25,671 --> 00:32:26,631
What's wrong?

312
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:28,671
No.

313
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:31,911
We need to check in hotels.

314
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,071
Your mom would find us sooner there.

315
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:48,631
Then let's go somewhere
even better than a hotel.

316
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:03,751
Hey.

317
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:06,191
-Isn't this your house?
-Lower your voice.

318
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:07,791
Of course I know it's my house.

319
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:10,391
What are you planning to do?

320
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,831
Why are you staring at me like that?

321
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:15,191
Don't you know?

322
00:33:15,271 --> 00:33:17,791
The most dangerous place is the safest.

323
00:33:21,151 --> 00:33:22,351
Will this work?

324
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:24,271
I have my ways.

325
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:26,031
I'll distract the head bodyguard.

326
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:27,711
Try sneaking in from the back door.

327
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:29,511
How do I get in?

328
00:33:30,311 --> 00:33:33,031
There's a key to the back door
that only the F4 know about.

329
00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:37,631
I feel like I'm sneaking
into a military base.

330
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:39,151
I hope we succeed in our mission.

331
00:34:04,991 --> 00:34:06,951
Si, weren't you inside the bedroom?

332
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,711
I went to the convenience store earlier.

333
00:34:09,031 --> 00:34:09,911
When?

334
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:11,991
What do you care?

335
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:43,471
Hey. You took a really long shower.

336
00:34:45,031 --> 00:34:47,591
This shirt is really big.

337
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:52,831
Stop laughing.

338
00:34:54,311 --> 00:34:56,271
You're so loud.
What if the bodyguard hears you?

339
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:13,511
Why are you staring at me?

340
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:16,751
Why? Can't I stare at your beautiful face?

341
00:35:18,671 --> 00:35:20,071
Come and sleep with me.

342
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:52,231
Don't you want to be with me anymore?

343
00:35:54,471 --> 00:35:56,711
-I...
-With me,

344
00:35:57,391 --> 00:35:58,591
you have to sneak around

345
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:02,071
and you'll be under a lot of pressure.

346
00:36:03,591 --> 00:36:04,751
You risk being judged

347
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:06,631
and bullied.

348
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:11,671
Because of this, are you so afraid
that you want to give up?

349
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,551
That's right.

350
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,991
I didn't do anything wrong.

351
00:36:21,951 --> 00:36:23,991
Yet I have to sneak into your house

352
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:26,311
in the middle of the night.

353
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:30,271
I'm also thinking why loving someone
has to be so hard.

354
00:36:31,631 --> 00:36:33,391
Why should I torture myself this way?

355
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:37,031
However...

356
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:46,671
Your determination and perseverance
moved me.

357
00:36:48,231 --> 00:36:49,991
I'm not able to hate you.

358
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:01,151
Maybe we need to experience
these hardships

359
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:03,231
and pay the price

360
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:06,591
so that we'll treasure
our relationship even more.

361
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:14,951
<i>Shancai. Let me ask you something.</i>

362
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:16,551
Have you done it with Daoming Si?

363
00:37:16,631 --> 00:37:17,631
Done what?

364
00:37:17,711 --> 00:37:19,071
Have sex.

365
00:37:23,111 --> 00:37:24,791
Xiaoyou, what are you saying?

366
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:26,591
You haven't?

367
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:28,551
I thought liking someone means

368
00:37:28,631 --> 00:37:31,031
giving him everything you can, right?

369
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:32,951
I think it's a natural thing.

370
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:25,191
Si, you're home...

371
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:35,071
Zhuang.

372
00:38:36,031 --> 00:38:37,231
Why didn't you knock?

373
00:38:45,631 --> 00:38:47,271
When did you become such a scumbag?

374
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:49,791
Forcing a girl to go to bed with you?

375
00:38:50,671 --> 00:38:53,431
No, Ms. Zhuang. You've misunderstood.

376
00:38:54,511 --> 00:38:57,311
Daoming Si didn't force me.

377
00:39:01,431 --> 00:39:02,471
What?

378
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:05,991
Really?

379
00:39:08,671 --> 00:39:09,631
Really.

380
00:39:13,871 --> 00:39:14,951
Goodness!

381
00:39:15,951 --> 00:39:18,311
You and Si are already at this level?

382
00:39:20,431 --> 00:39:21,991
I'm so happy I want to cry.

383
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:27,391
Then why were you being
so harsh on me just now?

384
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:31,391
Ms. Zhuang, I should have told you sooner.

385
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:32,431
But...

386
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:35,711
You've made such a huge decision.

387
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,151
I'm so happy.

388
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:43,311
Thank you, Shancai.

389
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:45,031
Ms. Zhuang.

390
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:51,911
Did I...

391
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:54,791
ruin your plans?

392
00:39:54,871 --> 00:39:55,871
What do you think?

393
00:40:00,271 --> 00:40:01,511
But Si.

394
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:05,431
This kind of thing
is very meaningful to girls.

395
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:06,991
You can't rush it.

396
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,351
You have to be with Shancai
and protect her

397
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:11,631
every day from now on.

398
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:13,511
You can't let her get hurt.

399
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:14,911
Why do you need even to say that?

400
00:40:14,991 --> 00:40:16,351
Of course I--

401
00:40:16,911 --> 00:40:19,031
Who said you can talk back to me?

402
00:40:21,031 --> 00:40:22,591
Can't you let me finish?

403
00:40:23,431 --> 00:40:27,031
I was saying I know I'd only be
with Shancai in this life.

404
00:40:28,431 --> 00:40:30,831
So I'm willing to wait no matter
how long it takes.

405
00:40:33,151 --> 00:40:34,471
Good!

406
00:40:35,271 --> 00:40:37,351
You're really my brother.

407
00:40:37,951 --> 00:40:38,951
Zhuang.

408
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,511
Can't you hit your brother
a little bit softer?

409
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:44,631
Lower your voices.
The bodyguards are outside.

410
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:50,551
I can't believe you'd choose to stay here.

411
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:53,671
What a good idea.

412
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:55,791
Leave the bodyguards to me.

413
00:40:56,591 --> 00:40:57,911
You two...

414
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:01,191
can continue.

415
00:41:22,911 --> 00:41:24,311
Shancai.

416
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:31,311
When can we go further?

417
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:37,711
-In five years.
-Five...

418
00:41:39,511 --> 00:41:40,431
years?

419
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,151
Are you kidding me?

420
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:49,191
Fine.

421
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:53,791
I'll wait.

422
00:41:58,711 --> 00:42:00,591
<i>Daoming Si has a lot of sides to him.</i>

423
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:04,351
<i>The childish side. The adolescent side.</i>

424
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:07,071
<i>The gentleman side.</i>

425
00:42:08,911 --> 00:42:12,151
<i>I'll work hard to accept
all his different sides.</i>
