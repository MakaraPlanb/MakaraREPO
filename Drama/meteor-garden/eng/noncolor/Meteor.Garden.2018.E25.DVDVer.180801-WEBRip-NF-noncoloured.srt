EPISODE 25

3
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:41,803
Good morning, Ms. Zhou.

4
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:44,323
Good morning, Mr. Lu.

5
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:45,563
Why are you...

6
00:01:46,203 --> 00:01:50,123
I'm going to the school library
for my graduation project.

7
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:51,603
I have to go.

8
00:01:54,163 --> 00:01:56,563
Mr. Lu, I have a question.

9
00:01:56,643 --> 00:01:57,603
Go ahead.

10
00:01:57,763 --> 00:02:01,683
Did something happen
when I got home last night?

11
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:07,323
Last night, you were carried home
by two people.

12
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:10,083
You looked very happy.

13
00:02:10,403 --> 00:02:11,603
You were jumping and dancing.

14
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:15,243
I gave you a towel to wipe your face.

15
00:02:15,443 --> 00:02:17,283
You took it and jumped up and down.

16
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:20,123
I'm old. I don't get it.

17
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:24,203
Were you dancing a famous dance?

18
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,163
All right.

19
00:02:26,243 --> 00:02:27,843
All right, Mr. Lu. I've got to go.

20
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:33,963
CHANGTAI WEST COUNTRYSIDE VILLA

21
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:38,403
Hello?

22
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:39,323
Meizuo.

23
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:40,683
I want to ask you.

24
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:43,003
Do you know what happened
to me last night?

25
00:02:49,683 --> 00:02:52,003
He was the boyfriend I met
while traveling?

26
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:53,763
I really said that?

27
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,763
Yes.

28
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:57,203
You also said

29
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,563
that you and Terence
fell in love at first sight.

30
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:02,243
-You--
-Stop.

31
00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:04,803
I said that?

32
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:09,163
And right in front of him?

33
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:17,443
That's so embarrassing.

34
00:03:18,563 --> 00:03:20,003
Was I crazy?

35
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,043
Goodness...

36
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:22,283
What's the matter?

37
00:03:22,963 --> 00:03:24,283
You're worried about this?

38
00:03:26,003 --> 00:03:27,403
Actually, I think it's fine.

39
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:31,563
You said you regretted it anyway.

40
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:33,403
You left him the next day.

41
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,043
But Caina,

42
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:46,083
who exactly is that Terence guy

43
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:47,883
anyway?

44
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,763
I don't even know his name.

45
00:03:54,683 --> 00:03:57,403
I met him while traveling in Yunan.

46
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:01,923
Since you're only her friend,

47
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:04,923
that means I can pursue her, right?

48
00:04:12,443 --> 00:04:14,243
You didn't even ask his name.

49
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:17,963
Does that mean you're not interested
in him anymore?

50
00:04:18,963 --> 00:04:19,883
Of course.

51
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:22,523
I was just playing around.

52
00:04:54,243 --> 00:04:55,443
Why are you smiling like that?

53
00:04:57,323 --> 00:04:58,603
But seriously,

54
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,883
did you two brought me home
together last night?

55
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:07,323
When I woke up this morning...

56
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:09,123
Look.

57
00:05:09,203 --> 00:05:10,803
My face is bruised and it's swollen.

58
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:12,923
My whole body hurts.

59
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:14,803
What happened last night?

60
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:17,643
Well...

61
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:21,643
Let's drink.

62
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,043
I don't want to go home.

63
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:25,563
I'm not going home.

64
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:27,563
Listen, man.

65
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:29,243
I brought Caina here.

66
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:30,763
I should take her home.

67
00:05:31,403 --> 00:05:32,763
Do you know where she lives?

68
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:34,843
She'll tell me.

69
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:37,283
How will she do that when she's so drunk?

70
00:05:37,643 --> 00:05:39,043
I brought her here.

71
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:40,163
So?

72
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,643
Can you hold her properly?

73
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:47,723
-You let go first.
-It was you.

74
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:48,803
It was you.

75
00:05:53,843 --> 00:05:55,283
Cut it out. Let's go.

76
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,563
Do you know where she lives?

77
00:05:57,723 --> 00:05:58,643
No.

78
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:01,363
Then where are you taking her?

79
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:07,523
It's because

80
00:06:08,283 --> 00:06:10,683
you didn't want to go home last night

81
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:13,603
and I couldn't hold you by myself--

82
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:14,523
Stop.

83
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:16,403
Don't say anything anymore.

84
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:19,283
Did I do any other stupid thing?

85
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:21,603
I promise.

86
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,443
I've already told you everything.

87
00:06:27,843 --> 00:06:29,003
I knew it.

88
00:06:29,603 --> 00:06:30,923
I shouldn't drink.

89
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:34,323
I still reeked of alcohol
when I woke up this morning.

90
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:44,203
My goodness.

91
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,123
You even have a Chanel perfume with you.

92
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:49,843
I prepared that for you, okay?

93
00:06:56,843 --> 00:06:59,403
Then remind me next time
not to drink again.

94
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:06,003
Actually, I was really happy
with what happened yesterday.

95
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:11,283
Look.

96
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:42,443
Ms. Zhang, are you all right?

97
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:45,283
I'm fine. I just have a bad cold.

98
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:46,883
I don't want to make you sick too.

99
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:48,523
You don't look good.

100
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:51,403
Go and rest. I can manage here.

101
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:53,123
How can I do that?

102
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:54,523
You have your own tasks.

103
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:56,563
And you still have class today, right?

104
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:59,443
It's fine. My class is at 9:00 a.m.
I can still make it.

105
00:07:59,523 --> 00:08:01,443
But you haven't had breakfast yet.

106
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:03,883
I'm on a diet.

107
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:05,883
Just go. Take care of your health.

108
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:06,803
Go.

109
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:08,723
Shancai.

110
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:10,963
You're so nice.

111
00:08:11,643 --> 00:08:13,003
You're Si's girlfriend.

112
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:15,203
But you still insist
on doing these things.

113
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:17,763
Ms. Zhang, we're just the same.

114
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:19,283
We should help each other.

115
00:08:20,403 --> 00:08:21,283
Go.

116
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,843
CHOOSE CONTACT: SHANCAI

117
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:29,083
IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH SHANCAI

118
00:08:29,163 --> 00:08:30,043
POST

119
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:39,803
Look.

120
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:50,523
Class, let's begin.

121
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:55,563
I'm nearly done
with your thesis evaluations.

122
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:56,883
They don't look very good.

123
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,763
You've studied for one semester already.

124
00:09:00,363 --> 00:09:05,243
Can someone summarize
what the core of this class is?

125
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:13,883
Professor.

126
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:17,723
The core of sales and marketing
is exchange, of course.

127
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:21,843
-Yes.
-It's exchange.

128
00:09:21,923 --> 00:09:22,883
Daoming Si.

129
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:23,843
Very good.

130
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:25,683
Of course.

131
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:27,043
And Professor.

132
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:29,803
If you've carefully evaluated
all the thesis,

133
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,163
you'll realize that this class
has a lot of talent.

134
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:38,763
All right. Let's start class.

135
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:39,683
Let's begin.

136
00:09:41,523 --> 00:09:42,523
It's so strange.

137
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:45,203
He hasn't interacted
with the professor much before.

138
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:48,443
Since when did he become so assertive?

139
00:09:49,163 --> 00:09:50,123
For the first time...

140
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:54,203
The big bad wolf became a sheep.

141
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:57,763
Love is so powerful.

142
00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:10,523
I'm so worried for Qinghe.

143
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:13,483
Seeing that professor's face,
I don't think there's much hope.

144
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:14,803
Yes, I agree.

145
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:16,203
It's entirely hopeless.

146
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:17,803
Chen Qinghe.

147
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:21,883
If you don't study hard,
you're wasting your own life.

148
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:27,003
But Shancai, you did so well earlier.

149
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,723
You handled it with ease. You were fine.

150
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:30,403
I was so nervous.

151
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:32,483
-No, I think--
-Dong Shancai.

152
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:36,123
You have such an incredible
boyfriend to help you.

153
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,083
Of course you'd be well-prepared.

154
00:10:38,163 --> 00:10:39,523
What do you mean?

155
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:44,963
Look. Daoming Si and Dong Shancai
are in a relationship.

156
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:47,003
Why are you feigning innocence?

157
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:51,683
That's right.

158
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:53,483
We're in a relationship.

159
00:10:53,563 --> 00:10:55,883
And it's going very well.

160
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:57,363
Thanks for your concern.

161
00:10:57,443 --> 00:10:58,683
-I...
-You...

162
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:01,523
Let's go.

163
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:04,163
It's fine, Shancai. Don't mind them.

164
00:11:04,883 --> 00:11:05,963
Shancai.

165
00:11:07,523 --> 00:11:08,763
Are you really dating him?

166
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:10,763
I'm so furious.

167
00:11:11,723 --> 00:11:12,603
Shancai.

168
00:11:17,003 --> 00:11:20,083
Why am I so unlucky today?

169
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:25,923
Daoming Si.

170
00:11:27,123 --> 00:11:28,643
What does your relationship status
post mean?

171
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:30,043
Which one?

172
00:11:31,443 --> 00:11:34,363
The one that says we're in a relationship.

173
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:35,803
Is there a problem?

174
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:37,763
Isn't that a fact?

175
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:41,363
I guess so.

176
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:44,043
Since it's a fact, why do you mind?

177
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:48,843
It's not something
worth telling everyone about.

178
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:50,163
Why not?

179
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:52,203
I have a girlfriend.

180
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:54,323
I liked her for a long time.

181
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:56,163
Now she finally said yes.

182
00:11:56,643 --> 00:12:00,323
The most important thing is
nobody can steal her from me.

183
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:04,163
And now I'm feeling happy every day.

184
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:05,643
I'm improving a lot.

185
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:08,563
Earlier, our professor
even complimented me.

186
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:11,763
The professor who had a 60 percent
chance of failing you?

187
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:13,163
How's that possible?

188
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:14,483
How's that impossible?

189
00:12:14,723 --> 00:12:16,963
As long as I'm happy,
everything is possible.

190
00:12:17,243 --> 00:12:20,003
-You're the stupid one.
-No, you're the stupid one.

191
00:12:20,203 --> 00:12:22,603
I passed my exam earlier, okay?

192
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:24,683
That's all because of me.

193
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,763
Have you forgotten
who sacrificed sleeping at night

194
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:31,003
-and helped you study?
-Never mind. Let's just go.

195
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,083
Let's go.

196
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:35,363
Yes.

197
00:12:35,563 --> 00:12:36,563
Thank you.

198
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,203
But didn't I also help you
with social anthropology

199
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:40,923
and sales and marketing?

200
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:42,123
I wanted to thank you for it.

201
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:46,483
But you came and blamed me
about posting our relationship status.

202
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:50,403
Sorry.

203
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:52,603
If apologies worked,
why would we need the police?

204
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:55,683
Then what do you want?

205
00:12:56,283 --> 00:12:57,203
Go on a date with me.

206
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:03,243
Why are you laughing?
Do you want to come along?

207
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:18,843
Daoming Si.

208
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:22,043
Where do you want to go
after you graduate?

209
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,043
I thought you didn't care.

210
00:13:28,403 --> 00:13:29,443
After I graduate,

211
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,283
I'll go back to London, I guess.

212
00:13:35,843 --> 00:13:37,283
Back to London?

213
00:13:38,323 --> 00:13:39,243
For a vacation?

214
00:13:40,203 --> 00:13:41,203
Of course not.

215
00:13:41,483 --> 00:13:42,963
I'll help with my family's business.

216
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:45,723
Then are you still coming back?

217
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:52,443
If I don't, would you be sad?

218
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:54,203
Of course.

219
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:57,363
Won't it be hard to see you then?

220
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:00,883
Why don't you

221
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:03,203
beg me?

222
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:06,723
Beg me and I'd consider staying
in Shanghai for you.

223
00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:09,883
Really?

224
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,043
You'll stay if I beg you?

225
00:14:12,923 --> 00:14:14,003
Will you beg me or not?

226
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:15,963
Will you die if you do that?

227
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:17,643
Of course I won't die.

228
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:21,643
But just stay if you want to stay.

229
00:14:21,723 --> 00:14:22,963
Why do I need to beg you?

230
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:24,763
You silly girl.

231
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,403
Why are you so stupid?

232
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:27,683
You want me to say everything.

233
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:29,523
You're stupid.

234
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:31,363
What do you want me to stay?

235
00:14:31,923 --> 00:14:32,803
You should say,

236
00:14:34,483 --> 00:14:36,043
"Can you not go to London?

237
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:38,643
Can you go to graduate school
and wait for me to graduate?

238
00:14:38,723 --> 00:14:40,563
Can you stay with me forever
after I graduate?"

239
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:43,683
Couldn't you say that?

240
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,203
Really?

241
00:14:50,163 --> 00:14:51,723
You're going to graduate school here

242
00:14:52,363 --> 00:14:53,763
so you can graduate with me?

243
00:14:56,123 --> 00:14:57,163
Daoming Si.

244
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:58,083
What?

245
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:00,443
I'm so happy!

246
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:04,483
Seeing you smile so cheerfully,

247
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:06,043
I'm so happy too!

248
00:15:09,603 --> 00:15:10,763
How silly.

249
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:28,283
Why are you here?

250
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:32,363
I'm waiting for you.

251
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:34,643
For me?

252
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:37,883
You're free, right?

253
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:41,563
I'm not.

254
00:15:42,283 --> 00:15:44,483
I have a date with Meizuo.

255
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:45,923
A date?

256
00:15:46,523 --> 00:15:48,083
Then why are you coming home?

257
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:51,443
I left earlier.

258
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:53,483
Then I realized I forgot something.

259
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:55,443
So I came back.

260
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:57,843
And I'm leaving now.

261
00:15:59,283 --> 00:16:00,283
I'm not the police.

262
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:01,483
I'm not interrogating you.

263
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:03,043
Why give such a detailed explanation?

264
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:06,203
I...

265
00:16:07,003 --> 00:16:08,243
I want to tell you something.

266
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,443
I'm in a hurry. Maybe next time.

267
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:13,803
Meizuo's waiting for me.

268
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:15,363
I'll drive you.

269
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:18,843
But...

270
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:21,323
Weren't you in a hurry?

271
00:16:22,283 --> 00:16:24,003
And I know Meizuo too.

272
00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:44,563
<i>-Hello?
</i>-Hello? Meizuo.

273
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:45,763
Where are you?

274
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:46,883
At my friend's house.

275
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:48,923
Can you come over now?

276
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:50,163
<i>I need you.</i>

277
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,483
Okay. Right away.

278
00:16:57,963 --> 00:17:00,003
Guys, I need to go somewhere.

279
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:01,843
We just arrived.

280
00:17:02,203 --> 00:17:03,163
What's the matter?

281
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:06,443
It's an emergency.

282
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:10,523
Have some fruit.

283
00:17:12,003 --> 00:17:13,523
Shancai's still living here?

284
00:17:14,203 --> 00:17:15,643
Where else should she live?

285
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:20,163
I mean, she can handle your mom
and stay here.

286
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:21,803
She's so brave.

287
00:17:22,763 --> 00:17:23,723
It's true.

288
00:17:23,803 --> 00:17:26,483
I shiver every time I hear his mom's name.

289
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:28,963
Is his mom that scary?

290
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,283
Oh please.

291
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:32,723
Because of her,
many of her business rivals

292
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:35,083
went bankrupt and homeless.

293
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:39,523
If she dislikes someone,
she'll ruthlessly eliminate him.

294
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:42,403
Stop it.

295
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:47,483
You even called her an "old hag."

296
00:17:47,563 --> 00:17:48,763
I...

297
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,363
Did I say that?

298
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:53,443
Why don't I remember that?

299
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:55,843
We all heard it.

300
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:01,603
Don't think you could bully me
just because I'm young,

301
00:18:01,683 --> 00:18:02,603
you old hag!

302
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:05,483
What did you say?

303
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:06,643
Say it again.

304
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:08,443
Old hag!

305
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:10,443
Yes, I'm calling you that.

306
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:12,603
You're not welcome in my world.

307
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:14,403
Get out.

308
00:18:17,683 --> 00:18:19,003
I said leave!

309
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:26,763
When she comes home

310
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:29,043
and discovers that person
is living in her house

311
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:31,363
and dating her son,

312
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:33,123
can you guess

313
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,123
what she'd do?

314
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:38,483
Si, what's your plan?

315
00:18:38,563 --> 00:18:40,803
She's my mom. What can I do?

316
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:43,323
But if she threatens Shancai,

317
00:18:43,403 --> 00:18:45,883
I'll stand in front of her
and protect her.

318
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:50,723
My mom just comes home a few times a year.

319
00:18:51,283 --> 00:18:53,363
I'm sure I'll think of something
before she comes back.

320
00:19:09,723 --> 00:19:10,683
Meizuo.

321
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:12,243
What took you so long?

322
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,683
-Do you miss me that much?
-Listen to me.

323
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:17,403
When we walk to the bar there,
we have to pretend to be very sweet.

324
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:20,283
Then you have to say that we have a date,
but you're late.

325
00:19:20,363 --> 00:19:21,243
All right?

326
00:19:21,323 --> 00:19:22,323
Who should I say that to?

327
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:24,123
To that guy you met before.

328
00:19:24,203 --> 00:19:25,123
Him again.

329
00:19:25,203 --> 00:19:26,083
Why?

330
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:27,203
Don't ask.

331
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:28,443
Hurry. I'll tell you later.

332
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:30,603
Sorry.

333
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,003
I'm late.

334
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:33,603
That's fine.

335
00:19:36,803 --> 00:19:38,403
You're even late on dates.

336
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:41,163
What a good boyfriend.

337
00:19:41,643 --> 00:19:42,843
Why do you say that?

338
00:19:42,923 --> 00:19:44,363
I respect girls.

339
00:19:44,443 --> 00:19:45,483
I'm never late.

340
00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:47,403
Then why was today an exception?

341
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:48,563
Because...

342
00:19:49,283 --> 00:19:50,603
Because of me.

343
00:19:51,363 --> 00:19:52,843
He's never late.

344
00:19:52,923 --> 00:19:55,923
But because he's younger than me,
I don't mind even if he's late.

345
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:57,043
Right?

346
00:19:57,123 --> 00:19:58,923
What do you mean?

347
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:00,563
All right. Never mind.

348
00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:02,803
Since we're here to drink,

349
00:20:02,883 --> 00:20:04,523
let's order, okay?

350
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,443
You can't drink. Don't drink anymore.

351
00:20:07,043 --> 00:20:08,963
Then I'll order soda.

352
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:12,043
You guys can drink.

353
00:20:12,323 --> 00:20:13,403
Okay?

354
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:15,843
I want something strong.

355
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,843
Can you drink?

356
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:18,963
You should ask if I've ever gotten drunk.

357
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:22,403
What matters is your behavior
after drinking,

358
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:23,683
not the amount you can drink.

359
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,723
What an immature thing to say.

360
00:20:27,283 --> 00:20:29,403
It's basic etiquette for a man
to behave after drinking.

361
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:30,803
Why is it even worth mentioning?

362
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,643
Fine. Since you can drink a lot
and behave very well,

363
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:36,243
it's my treat tonight.

364
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:37,163
No problem.

365
00:20:38,523 --> 00:20:39,443
Wei Xun.

366
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:40,803
Hey.

367
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:44,163
Please give this gentleman a red dynamite.

368
00:20:50,363 --> 00:20:51,243
All right.

369
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:56,003
Sir.

370
00:20:56,883 --> 00:20:59,443
Why are you here on my date with Caina?

371
00:21:00,003 --> 00:21:02,603
I'm here to talk to Caina.

372
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:06,923
Can't you see that we're on a date?

373
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:08,083
Very well.

374
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:11,883
I'll say just it in front of him
rather than behind his back.

375
00:21:12,243 --> 00:21:13,563
Makes sense. Go ahead.

376
00:21:14,203 --> 00:21:15,763
I don't want to talk about that.

377
00:21:15,923 --> 00:21:17,083
Let's talk another time.

378
00:21:17,163 --> 00:21:18,203
Why?

379
00:21:18,283 --> 00:21:19,363
Why not today?

380
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:22,003
Because I don't want
to talk about that now.

381
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,563
-What is it?
-What is it?

382
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:27,323
You know what I'm talking about.

383
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:30,043
Yes, that's the one.

384
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:33,363
So I don't want to
talk about that. Please.

385
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:37,763
Your red dynamite.

386
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:45,643
Bottoms up.

387
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:51,483
<i>Red dynamite has all kinds of liquors
mixed with chili powder.</i>

388
00:21:51,963 --> 00:21:53,283
<i>It'll knock you down afterwards.</i>

389
00:21:58,043 --> 00:21:59,283
Meizuo, did you make a mistake?

390
00:21:59,843 --> 00:22:01,763
This is a cocktail for women.

391
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:04,603
Let's give it to Caina.

392
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:09,043
-Sure.
-No, you can't drink that.

393
00:22:13,003 --> 00:22:14,043
Why?

394
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:16,163
I can handle cocktails.

395
00:22:19,723 --> 00:22:21,643
<i>This guy is so cunning.</i>

396
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:26,843
<i>You want to prank me? No way.</i>

397
00:22:27,883 --> 00:22:29,923
You won't get drunk
even if you drink this all night.

398
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:31,923
Really?

399
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:35,283
-Then let's order another one.
-That's right.

400
00:22:35,403 --> 00:22:36,803
You missed the first one.

401
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:38,883
Another red dynamite.

402
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,443
All right.

403
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:44,963
Caina ordered this for you.

404
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:53,683
<i>It should work this time.</i>

405
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:02,763
<i>Drink it. Very good.</i>

406
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:04,723
Do you like it?

407
00:23:05,803 --> 00:23:06,923
Yes.

408
00:23:07,723 --> 00:23:08,763
That's great.

409
00:23:08,843 --> 00:23:10,523
You both like it.

410
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,123
<i>Darn boy. It's so hot.</i>

411
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,603
I've decided.

412
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:16,363
It's my treat tonight.

413
00:23:16,443 --> 00:23:19,083
Wei Xun. Two red dynamites for them.

414
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:22,923
-All right.
<i>-I'll die if I have another one.</i>

415
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:26,483
Here.

416
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:27,883
Your red dynamite.

417
00:23:34,883 --> 00:23:36,163
Drink it.

418
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:37,923
Why aren't you drinking it?

419
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,723
Why not?

420
00:23:40,563 --> 00:23:41,603
Yes.

421
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:45,043
Come on, Meizuo. Cheers.

422
00:23:47,883 --> 00:23:49,003
Wait.

423
00:23:49,723 --> 00:23:51,163
What were we talking about earlier?

424
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:55,763
We were talking about what Caina
doesn't want to talk about.

425
00:23:55,843 --> 00:23:56,963
I remember now.

426
00:23:57,483 --> 00:24:00,683
You're wondering why Caina was fine
the day before,

427
00:24:00,843 --> 00:24:02,483
but she left the next day, right?

428
00:24:02,723 --> 00:24:03,603
Yes.

429
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:05,723
What are you doing?

430
00:24:07,883 --> 00:24:09,323
I don't want to talk about it.

431
00:24:09,403 --> 00:24:11,043
Can't you guys just drink?

432
00:24:11,603 --> 00:24:12,963
Drink.

433
00:24:17,643 --> 00:24:18,763
I know!

434
00:24:19,323 --> 00:24:20,843
Isn't it obvious?

435
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:22,003
Caina doesn't like you.

436
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,923
She regretted what happened.

437
00:24:24,003 --> 00:24:25,203
So she left the next day.

438
00:24:25,323 --> 00:24:26,523
Isn't that normal?

439
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:31,963
Is that so?

440
00:24:32,563 --> 00:24:33,603
Isn't that so?

441
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:39,523
Caina, is that so?

442
00:24:40,803 --> 00:24:42,523
You were just playing around with me?

443
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:53,003
-I'll drink it if you don't.
-Hey, Caina.

444
00:24:57,043 --> 00:24:58,003
Caina.

445
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,003
Caina.

446
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:01,323
Caina.

447
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:04,123
Caina.

448
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:06,403
Hey, Caina.

449
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:07,483
Caina.

450
00:25:12,523 --> 00:25:13,523
Caina.

451
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,443
I don't want to go home.

452
00:25:22,163 --> 00:25:23,083
What are you doing?

453
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:25,923
Let go.

454
00:25:26,603 --> 00:25:27,643
You let go.

455
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:30,683
Caina's my girlfriend. Stay away.

456
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,643
-Caina.
-What are you doing?

457
00:25:34,843 --> 00:25:36,363
-What are you doing?
-What do you want?

458
00:25:39,763 --> 00:25:41,043
-Are you all right, Caina?
-Caina.

459
00:25:41,203 --> 00:25:42,283
Come on. Get up.

460
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:48,843
My head's spinning.

461
00:26:03,283 --> 00:26:04,563
It hurts.

462
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:03,203
Didn't we agree to go buy reference books?

463
00:27:03,283 --> 00:27:04,443
But...

464
00:27:05,243 --> 00:27:07,403
I want to go home and organize
my old clothes.

465
00:27:08,403 --> 00:27:09,243
Your clothes?

466
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:12,283
I want to sell them as secondhand items
at an online store.

467
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:14,163
I'll earn money
and the clothes won't go to waste.

468
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:16,883
It saves space and can help those
who need it.

469
00:27:16,963 --> 00:27:18,483
That's multiple wins. I'm smart, right?

470
00:27:20,603 --> 00:27:21,803
You're really thoughtful.

471
00:27:23,603 --> 00:27:25,763
I also need to go and clean your house.

472
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:27,123
That's what you're worried about?

473
00:27:27,243 --> 00:27:28,843
-I'll just call Mrs. Yu.
-Don't.

474
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,643
I'm a cleaner at your house.

475
00:27:32,843 --> 00:27:34,483
I don't want to have special privileges.

476
00:27:37,203 --> 00:27:39,923
All right. I'll go by myself.
Text me the books you want.

477
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:41,923
I'll send you the book list later.

478
00:27:51,563 --> 00:27:52,803
DEAL COMPLETED

479
00:27:52,883 --> 00:27:54,603
I sold them in two hours.

480
00:27:54,683 --> 00:27:56,363
This secondhand online store is great!

481
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:04,763
What's going on?

482
00:28:04,843 --> 00:28:06,003
Mrs. Daoming is coming.

483
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:11,683
<i>Why is she suddenly coming back?</i>

484
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:13,363
<i>I have to leave now.</i>

485
00:28:37,643 --> 00:28:39,683
Welcome home, ma'am.

486
00:28:48,923 --> 00:28:52,203
Nothing happened when I was away, right?

487
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:54,043
No, ma'am.

488
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:55,683
Everything's all right.

489
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:58,003
Did you prepare my bath?

490
00:28:58,283 --> 00:28:59,243
Yes.

491
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:08,723
Who allowed you to use your phones
while working?

492
00:29:10,443 --> 00:29:11,643
It wasn't me. ma'am.

493
00:29:11,723 --> 00:29:12,923
Then who was it?

494
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,003
Stop hiding. Come out.

495
00:30:02,563 --> 00:30:07,043
Aren't you Dong Shancai,
who refused the five million yuan?

496
00:30:09,923 --> 00:30:11,883
Why are you a maid at my house?

497
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:12,923
Mrs. Yu.

498
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:14,883
Can you explain it to me?

499
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:20,883
I was the one who hired Shancai.

500
00:30:22,243 --> 00:30:24,203
Based on my observation,

501
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:28,243
she works really hard
and doesn't slack off.

502
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:31,363
She does her tasks well.

503
00:30:32,403 --> 00:30:34,883
I hope she can stay here.

504
00:30:37,163 --> 00:30:42,243
I won't ever allow
this kind of inferior girl in my house.

505
00:30:45,483 --> 00:30:48,483
This kind of girl doesn't use tricks

506
00:30:48,963 --> 00:30:51,203
but relies on her hard work to survive.

507
00:30:52,003 --> 00:30:53,523
What's wrong with that?

508
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:55,003
Mrs. Yu.

509
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:57,643
Don't argue with her because of me.

510
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:00,003
I'll leave.

511
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:04,603
You're working in the Daoming household.

512
00:31:05,483 --> 00:31:06,883
You're under my authority.

513
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:08,243
You can't leave.

514
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:17,283
Ma'am.

515
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,563
Ever since she came here,

516
00:31:20,803 --> 00:31:22,483
Si studies very hard

517
00:31:23,323 --> 00:31:25,043
and his temper has been tamed.

518
00:31:26,523 --> 00:31:29,163
Shancai is a good influence on Si.

519
00:31:29,963 --> 00:31:32,923
Si is improving because of her.

520
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:35,603
So,

521
00:31:36,803 --> 00:31:40,043
can't you make considerations
for Si's sake?

522
00:31:41,643 --> 00:31:44,323
If you let Shancai take care of Si

523
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,443
and Si changes for the better,

524
00:31:48,003 --> 00:31:49,843
isn't that also good for you?

525
00:31:53,603 --> 00:31:54,603
Mrs. Yu.

526
00:31:56,523 --> 00:32:00,643
I respect you because you've stayed
in this household for 60 years.

527
00:32:01,683 --> 00:32:02,723
However,

528
00:32:03,723 --> 00:32:05,443
it doesn't mean you can do
whatever you want.

529
00:32:07,043 --> 00:32:10,323
I won't allow this girl to date my son.

530
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:21,523
I brought Zhuang and Si up

531
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:24,763
all by myself.

532
00:32:28,283 --> 00:32:31,563
I saw how you destroyed
Zhuang's happiness.

533
00:32:34,723 --> 00:32:36,603
I made a vow

534
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:41,763
to never let Si experience the same pain.

535
00:32:44,323 --> 00:32:46,483
I won't let Shancai

536
00:32:46,963 --> 00:32:48,923
leave this house.

537
00:32:50,043 --> 00:32:52,163
Why are you interfering with this?

538
00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:55,843
Let me remind you.

539
00:32:56,843 --> 00:32:59,803
I'm the master of this house,

540
00:33:00,363 --> 00:33:01,203
not you.

541
00:33:03,923 --> 00:33:04,963
Mrs. Daoming.

542
00:33:07,763 --> 00:33:09,043
Have you forgotten

543
00:33:11,003 --> 00:33:14,363
Si's grandpa's last wish?

544
00:33:17,443 --> 00:33:18,683
Then let me remind you.

545
00:33:21,203 --> 00:33:22,123
He said

546
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:26,483
that as long as I live,

547
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:29,123
I'll take charge

548
00:33:29,963 --> 00:33:31,643
of this household.

549
00:33:33,443 --> 00:33:35,563
What if I insist on sending her away?

550
00:33:37,163 --> 00:33:38,083
Then,

551
00:33:39,963 --> 00:33:41,283
please...

552
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:47,603
do it over my dead body.

553
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:03,083
When will you stop crying?

554
00:34:03,643 --> 00:34:04,963
It's so annoying.

555
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:07,403
Looking at you cry

556
00:34:08,443 --> 00:34:11,283
makes me feel like I'm dying.

557
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,043
I feel so sad.

558
00:34:18,043 --> 00:34:20,683
I'm so mad and embarrassed.

559
00:34:21,323 --> 00:34:22,403
Plus--

560
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:23,763
All right.

561
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:26,283
Drink this hot tea.

562
00:34:27,963 --> 00:34:29,323
Don't think about anything anymore.

563
00:34:40,243 --> 00:34:41,483
Thank you, Mrs. Yu.

564
00:34:42,283 --> 00:34:43,603
You protected me

565
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:45,683
and you defended me.

566
00:34:46,443 --> 00:34:48,723
I'm not sure how I can repay you.

567
00:34:51,003 --> 00:34:52,683
No, don't.

568
00:34:53,003 --> 00:34:54,083
Don't do anything.

569
00:34:54,563 --> 00:34:55,523
Don't cause any trouble.

570
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,763
I had a hard time saving you
from the lion's den.

571
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:01,883
Just stay here.

572
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:03,163
Understand?

573
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:07,003
Sorry.

574
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:11,243
I used to think

575
00:35:12,363 --> 00:35:15,123
that you're a harsh

576
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:18,083
and unreasonable old lady.

577
00:35:20,443 --> 00:35:21,963
I am.

578
00:35:23,283 --> 00:35:25,803
Look at your ugly face.

579
00:35:26,203 --> 00:35:27,363
Stop staring at me.

580
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,283
I won't look at you then.

581
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:41,563
By the way, Mrs. Yu.

582
00:35:42,563 --> 00:35:44,643
How did you end up
at the Daoming household?

583
00:35:49,723 --> 00:35:51,483
It's a long story.

584
00:35:54,243 --> 00:35:55,323
When I was

585
00:35:56,523 --> 00:35:58,083
19 years old,

586
00:36:01,363 --> 00:36:03,723
I was living alone

587
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,283
and I needed to pay off debts.

588
00:36:07,963 --> 00:36:09,563
I was in a difficult situation.

589
00:36:10,923 --> 00:36:13,203
Si's grandpa knew about my situation.

590
00:36:13,883 --> 00:36:15,363
So he paid off my debts.

591
00:36:16,403 --> 00:36:18,643
And let me work in the Daoming household.

592
00:36:19,923 --> 00:36:21,003
My life

593
00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:23,803
was saved by Si's grandpa.

594
00:36:25,323 --> 00:36:27,163
So I've decided

595
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:31,563
to take care of the Daoming family
my whole life.

596
00:36:33,923 --> 00:36:37,203
I'll use my life to repay them.

597
00:36:39,403 --> 00:36:40,523
Later,

598
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:43,203
Mr. Daoming,

599
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,843
Si's dad,

600
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:50,043
slowly grew up

601
00:36:50,603 --> 00:36:51,523
and graduated.

602
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,723
Mrs. Daoming married into the family.

603
00:36:56,563 --> 00:37:01,243
Then Zhuang and Si were born.

604
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:06,603
This family was happy for decades.

605
00:37:07,963 --> 00:37:10,883
What kind of person is Daoming Si's dad?

606
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:13,243
Mr. Daoming

607
00:37:14,243 --> 00:37:15,923
was really nice.

608
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,483
He's very smart since he was little.

609
00:37:21,883 --> 00:37:23,283
At a young age,

610
00:37:23,883 --> 00:37:25,843
he handled the Daoming family's business.

611
00:37:26,723 --> 00:37:28,163
And he didn't disappoint.

612
00:37:28,723 --> 00:37:29,883
He works very hard

613
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:31,963
all day and all night.

614
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:36,563
I often told him
to take care of his health.

615
00:37:37,363 --> 00:37:38,683
Don't wear himself out.

616
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:42,563
But he said, "I can't.

617
00:37:43,443 --> 00:37:45,923
The company's employees
are depending on me.

618
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:48,283
How can I be lazy?"

619
00:37:52,923 --> 00:37:55,123
He's really an outstanding person.

620
00:37:56,123 --> 00:37:58,243
Indeed.

621
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:04,243
But I

622
00:38:06,403 --> 00:38:09,723
would have wanted him to slack off a bit

623
00:38:11,603 --> 00:38:13,203
and worry less.

624
00:38:17,603 --> 00:38:19,883
I think I've heard Daoming Si mention

625
00:38:21,763 --> 00:38:24,683
that his dad already passed away.

626
00:38:30,363 --> 00:38:32,723
When Si was in high school,

627
00:38:34,003 --> 00:38:35,363
he got liver cancer

628
00:38:36,843 --> 00:38:37,963
and passed away.

629
00:38:39,763 --> 00:38:41,203
What happened afterward?

630
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:46,203
After Mr. Daoming passed away,

631
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:52,083
Mrs. Daoming handled the Daoming Group.

632
00:38:54,603 --> 00:38:55,723
This family

633
00:38:58,283 --> 00:39:01,003
changed as a result.

634
00:39:03,763 --> 00:39:05,563
They weren't happy anymore.

635
00:39:08,483 --> 00:39:10,123
It slowly became cold.

636
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:13,563
Zhuang

637
00:39:14,723 --> 00:39:16,883
really grew up

638
00:39:17,443 --> 00:39:19,083
to be a kind girl indeed.

639
00:39:22,563 --> 00:39:24,243
But Si's temper

640
00:39:25,403 --> 00:39:28,683
cannot be controlled by anyone.

641
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:36,843
<i>When Si was in high school,</i>

642
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:41,003
<i>he'd always come home with wounds.</i>

643
00:39:42,643 --> 00:39:45,243
<i>We only found out
when the school notified us</i>

644
00:39:46,403 --> 00:39:48,563
<i>that he'd been getting into fights.</i>

645
00:39:51,763 --> 00:39:54,043
<i>Mrs. Daoming was worried,</i>

646
00:39:56,843 --> 00:39:58,923
<i>but because she was busy with work,</i>

647
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:00,923
<i>she didn't have much time.</i>

648
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:04,163
<i>So she hired a tutor to discipline him.</i>

649
00:40:05,243 --> 00:40:07,563
Si, you're home.

650
00:40:10,003 --> 00:40:11,763
-Your face--
-You're so annoying!

651
00:40:12,563 --> 00:40:13,803
<i>But it was useless.</i>

652
00:40:14,523 --> 00:40:18,483
<i>More incidents kept on happening.</i>

653
00:40:21,923 --> 00:40:25,083
<i>I was worried and sad
about what was happening.</i>

654
00:40:26,163 --> 00:40:28,443
<i>I really didn't know what to do.</i>

655
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:37,843
I've always been worried about Si.

656
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:45,483
After you came here,

657
00:40:46,683 --> 00:40:47,723
I realized

658
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,843
that Si has changed.

659
00:40:53,643 --> 00:40:54,963
Did he?

660
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:57,003
I didn't do anything.

661
00:40:58,603 --> 00:40:59,843
I only...

662
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,723
Initially, I really hated him.

663
00:41:05,203 --> 00:41:07,163
Whenever I don't agree with his ways,

664
00:41:07,443 --> 00:41:08,963
I would beat him up.

665
00:41:09,283 --> 00:41:10,483
Like this.

666
00:41:11,123 --> 00:41:12,403
That's what I did.

667
00:41:13,603 --> 00:41:14,763
That's right.

668
00:41:16,803 --> 00:41:18,963
After Zhuang got married,

669
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:23,163
nobody here would dare to do that to him.

670
00:41:26,203 --> 00:41:27,203
No.

671
00:41:28,563 --> 00:41:32,043
The first time when I beat him up,
I also risked my life to do it.

672
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,043
It's scary when I think about it now.

673
00:41:35,723 --> 00:41:38,403
If you ask me to beat him up now,
I wouldn't dare.

674
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:42,923
Shancai.

675
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:46,163
You can't leave this house.

676
00:41:47,043 --> 00:41:48,083
I, Mrs. Yu,

677
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,923
would risk my life to protect you.

678
00:41:56,643 --> 00:41:58,523
How's that possible?

679
00:41:59,163 --> 00:42:00,403
Don't worry.

680
00:42:01,803 --> 00:42:06,363
I've got a great plan.

681
00:42:08,283 --> 00:42:09,443
A plan?

682
00:42:12,603 --> 00:42:14,243
Mrs. Yu, I think it's quite late.

683
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,643
-I'll go ahead.
-You can't go.

684
00:42:17,523 --> 00:42:19,083
If you dare to leave,

685
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:22,643
the next time you see me
would be at my funeral.

686
00:42:30,403 --> 00:42:31,483
Mrs. Yu.

687
00:42:32,043 --> 00:42:34,123
How can you threaten me that way?

688
00:42:36,003 --> 00:42:38,203
All right. Tell me your plan.

689
00:42:42,723 --> 00:42:44,203
My plan

690
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:46,563
is called...

691
00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:50,723
the act first, report later, undercover,
secret, shotgun wedding plan.

692
00:42:52,563 --> 00:42:53,563
Do you understand?

693
00:42:56,683 --> 00:42:58,283
You spoke too fast.

694
00:42:58,523 --> 00:42:59,883
I didn't hear you clearly.
