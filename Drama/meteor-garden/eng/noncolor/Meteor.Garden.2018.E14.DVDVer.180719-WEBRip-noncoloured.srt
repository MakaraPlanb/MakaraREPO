00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:39,998
<i>Next, can we please give
a round of applause</i>

00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:41,638
<i>and welcome the ten contestants.</i>

7
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:55,758
Shancai, you can do it!

8
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:04,918
The contestants will first present
their dishes for the stir fry round.

9
00:02:17,278 --> 00:02:18,198
Now, our judges

10
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:21,758
are carefully tasting each dish
our contestants carefully prepared.

11
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:24,918
We can see the unique and thoughtful
expressions on their faces.

12
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:28,038
How do the dishes prepared
by our contestants taste like?

13
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:30,838
Can it entice our judges' appetite?

14
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:52,838
Shancai should be fine, right?

15
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:54,998
Of course.

16
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:57,878
If she can't qualify, who else can?

17
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:14,998
Next, the judges would be tasting

18
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:17,318
the contestants' broiled dishes.

19
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:00,678
This round is coming to an end.

20
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:02,798
Who will continue standing on this stage?

21
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:04,238
Who will be eliminated?

22
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:08,118
May we please have our judge,
Tu Xiaowen, announce the results.

23
00:04:11,278 --> 00:04:12,478
I'm announcing the results.

24
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:14,398
Dai Jingjing.

25
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:16,198
Gao Xinting.

26
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:18,638
Zao Xiaoyang.

27
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:19,878
And...

28
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:21,678
Lin Wenjiao.

29
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:24,958
I'm sorry, you are eliminated
for this round.

30
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:26,838
The competition ends here for you.

31

FIRST ROUND EVALUATION RESULTS

32
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:36,478
<i>Shancai qualified for the next round.
That was close.</i>

33
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:46,718
Hey.

34
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:48,078
I can't believe it.

35
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:50,438
Little Ms. Flying Kick,
who kicked you in the hallway before

36
00:04:50,518 --> 00:04:52,318
is now a very skillful cook.

37
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:54,878
Do you have an eye for talent

38
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,958
or is this all due to
your sister's strict training?

39
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,278
Whatever it is,

40
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:01,878
Shancai has unique determination

41
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:03,598
that can accomplish the impossible.

42
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:09,438
After the first round of elimination,
we still have six contestants left.

43
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:12,438
These six contestants would enter
the next phase of the competition,

44
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:14,278
which is the pastry round.

45
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:17,118
Next, may we please request our judge,
Miss Tang Jingmei,

46
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:18,718
to discuss the criteria for judging.

47
00:05:20,078 --> 00:05:22,038
SECOND ROUND, CHINESE PASTRY

48
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:24,958
Pastries were initially made
to reward soldiers when at war.

49
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:27,918
It's also the essence
of our Chinese food culture.

50
00:05:28,558 --> 00:05:29,598
In this round,

51
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:32,198
the contestants need to choose
a flower as a key ingredient.

52
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:35,078
Infuse the flower's flavor
into the pastry,

53
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:37,758
present a visually enticing
and tasty course and create

54
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,238
a unique pastry that stands out
in color, fragrance, and taste.

55
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:41,838
Everyone, please do your best.

56
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:49,518
So what are our contestants waiting for?
Please go to your stations immediately.

57
00:05:49,638 --> 00:05:51,238
CHINESE CUISINE CULINARY COMPETITION

58
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:53,598
Next, let's see

59
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:56,318
the cooking process of each contestant
in the kitchen.

60
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:01,198
The time limit for the second round,
the pastry round, is one hour.

61
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,998
At the end of this round,
we'll select four out of six contestants.

62
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:31,758
What is Shancai doing?

63
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,318
I don't get it as well.

64
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:35,478
It's good that you don't get it.

65
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:38,358
If you knew what it was,
it wouldn't be amazing.

66
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:09,678
Only one minute left.
Let's start the countdown.

67
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:16,318
All right. Time's up.

68
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:19,398
Now, the contestants
have completed their dishes.

69
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:22,118
Whose dish will move people's hearts?

70
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:24,798
Please bring your dishes in.
Judges, please get ready.

71
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,118
All right. Next, we'll ask our contestants
to present their dishes.

72
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:58,598
Now, our judges are carefully tasting
each pastry our contestants made.

73
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:04,278
So what do our judges think
about the pastry they've tasted?

74
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:06,918
This Lotus Flower Cake
is very interesting.

75
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:08,838
From its physical appearance,

76
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:10,518
it looks like

77
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:12,278
lotus flowers known as flower fairies.

78
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,438
As for its taste,

79
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:15,358
it's soft, fluffy and sweet.

80
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:17,278
It's very flavorful.

81
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:18,278
Very good.

82
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,198
Thank you.

83
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:22,638
It's so beautiful.
Its fragrance is very inviting.

84
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:24,838
It delights the heart
and refreshes the mind.

85
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:26,198
I want to have another piece.

86
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:28,358
This is the natural fragrance
of lotus flowers.

87
00:08:28,438 --> 00:08:30,078
I preserved its natural state.

88
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:38,358
I like this girl.

89
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:41,118
No way.

90
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:43,118
Are you falling for Caina?

91
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:49,758
Now, the judges are holding
Miss Dong Shancai's Plain Flower Candy.

92
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,278
It tastes delicious.

93
00:09:07,638 --> 00:09:09,478
Should I say

94
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:10,998
that it's grayish

95
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:12,598
or yellowish?

96
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:22,278
Do you know what's
the most important thing

97
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:24,358
required to win this competition?

98
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:33,518
This pastry is called

99
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:37,078
"Dong Xiaowan's Blooming Beauty,
Exquisite Elegance,

100
00:09:37,158 --> 00:09:39,078
Delicate Grace and Golden Age."

101
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,278
Wow, is that a tongue twister?

102
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:49,358
I want to hear more about it.

103
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:55,158
Dong Xiaowan is a famous chef in history.

104
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:58,158
She especially likes
to use flowers in cooking.

105
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:00,878
That's why she made this pastry.

106
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:03,878
Many years ago,

107
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:07,598
her husband, Mao Xuejiang, fell sick.

108
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:11,558
In order to make her husband
recover quickly

109
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:13,118
and take up his sword,

110
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:16,398
she made this pastry herself

111
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,638
and named it Plain Flower Candy.

112
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:21,838
Even though this is just a simple pastry,

113
00:10:22,678 --> 00:10:25,318
but it comes from
a very beautiful love story.

114
00:10:29,638 --> 00:10:31,918
There are very few people
who know how to make this pastry,

115
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,598
especially young girls like her.

116
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:35,758
-That's not easy.
-Yes.

117
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:39,238
You know quite a lot.

118
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:44,878
All right. Thank you, Dong Shancai,
for your Plain Flower Candy.

119
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:47,038
Next, we'll go to our next round.

120
00:10:47,118 --> 00:10:49,478
Who will continue standing on this stage?

121
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:52,398
We'll find out after the commercial.

122
00:10:55,838 --> 00:10:57,478
CHINESE CUISINE CULINARY COMPETITION

123
00:10:58,038 --> 00:10:59,918
After a heated discussion
among our judges,

124
00:10:59,998 --> 00:11:02,238
we have the results of the second round.

125
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:05,678
Four contestants will enter the final
battle between the East and the West.

126
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:08,518
Can we have our judge,
Tang Jingmei, to announce the results.

127
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:10,398
Who are the final four contestants?

128
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:17,238
After careful deliberation
from the judges' panel,

129
00:11:17,598 --> 00:11:20,598
the following will be able
to enter the final deciding round

130
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:23,198
of the Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition.

131
00:11:24,758 --> 00:11:25,598
Miss Zhou Caina.

132
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:27,918
SECOND ROUND EVALUATION RESULTS

133
00:11:31,438 --> 00:11:32,758
Miss Luo Qianni.

134
00:11:33,638 --> 00:11:34,838
Miss Ling Chenxi.

135
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,398
And last but not the least...

136
00:11:42,998 --> 00:11:44,038
Maybe

137
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,518
this is a little unexpected.

138
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:51,758
Congratulations, Miss Dong Shancai.

139
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:55,158
-Shancai! You did it!
-Hey!

140
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:56,398
-Si.
-Si.

141
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:58,278
-Shancai! Well done! Shancai!
-Calm down, Si.

142
00:11:58,358 --> 00:12:00,758
-Did I hear it correctly?
-All right. Miss Dong, step forward.

143
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:06,758
-Yes!
-Yes!

144
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:08,198
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

145
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:09,998
She's great!

146
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,278
That's great!

147
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,558
The Budding Beauty, Elegance...

148
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:19,638
-No, Exquisite Elegance.
-Your tongue is all tied up.

149
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:22,278
Anyway, Dong Shancai's
Plain Flower Candy is the best!

150
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:23,318
-Come on.
-Come on.

151
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:24,478
Yes!

152
00:12:25,918 --> 00:12:26,758
Let's watch more.

153
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:33,838
I'm so tired.

154
00:12:34,478 --> 00:12:35,758
Why is this cooking competition

155
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,318
more tiring and nerve-wracking
than when I competed?

156
00:12:48,798 --> 00:12:49,998
All right. Thank you, judges.

157
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:52,998
This year's Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition's champion

158
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:54,718
will be chosen
from these four contestants.

159
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:04,998
Congratulations again
for advancing to this round.

160
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:06,958
Please return backstage and take a rest.

161
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:10,758
Please look forward
to the final deciding round.

162
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:15,158
I'm furious!

163
00:13:15,638 --> 00:13:16,518
I'm so unlucky!

164
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,838
It doesn't matter if I lost to Caina.

165
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:21,718
But I couldn't even beat Dong Shancai.

166
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:23,158
It's so infuriating!

167
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:27,798
Hey, did you bribe the judges?

168
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:29,198
That's right.

169
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:30,118
I...

170
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:31,638
It's a fact that you lost to her.

171
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:34,238
You can't lift yourselves up
by putting others down.

172
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,438
It would just show
how unsportsmanlike you are.

173
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:42,518
Shancai.

174
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:45,118
Drink something warm and relax.

175
00:13:45,878 --> 00:13:46,718
Thank you.

176
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:49,278
Miss Zhou Caina.

177
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:51,598
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

178
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:52,958
I'm so nervous.

179
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:55,158
I'm not sure what the challenge is
for the next round.

180
00:13:55,238 --> 00:13:56,278
You can do it.

181
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:58,638
-Thank you.
-This is for you.

182
00:14:01,598 --> 00:14:03,518
I'm Meizuo. Nice to meet you.

183
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,078
Excuse me. I still have work to do.

184
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:10,518
Si, aren't you going to encourage her?

185
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:12,518
That's right, Si.

186
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:14,198
You were so excited earlier.

187
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:16,198
Why aren't you encouraging her now?

188
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:23,078
Come on. The competition
is about to start again.

189
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:24,598
Well...

190
00:14:26,758 --> 00:14:29,398
You...

191
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:31,638
What?

192
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:33,918
-What?
-Good.

193
00:14:36,238 --> 00:14:37,278
What do you mean "good"?

194
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:40,358
You did well earlier.

195
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:43,238
Keep up the good work.
Keep getting great results.

196
00:14:51,718 --> 00:14:54,118
Why are you laughing?
Didn't you ask me to encourage her?

197
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:04,678
Hi, all.
Chinese Cuisine Culinary Competition

198
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:08,398
is brought to you by High-End
Smart Kitchen Electronics.

199
00:15:08,478 --> 00:15:09,918
Can we have our judge, Jang Jinbao,

200
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:11,518
to discuss the criteria for this round.

201
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:14,958
Unique traits of a local place
give special features to its people.

202
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:17,518
Our hometown flavors
always carry us away, lost in reverie.

203
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,158
In the last round,

204
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:22,518
the contestants will be accepting
the most rigorous challenge.

205
00:15:22,598 --> 00:15:24,518
Listen carefully. For this round,

206
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:26,638
you have to prepare a special
dish from your hometown

207
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:27,838
<i>within 45 minutes.</i>

208
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:29,558
Everybody can make their hometown dishes.

209
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:31,998
But in just 45 minutes...

210
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:34,598
Can they make it in time?

211
00:15:35,158 --> 00:15:35,998
That's right.

212
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:37,718
The dishes we taught Shancai

213
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:40,118
would take at least two hours to prepare.

214
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:45,358
Forty-five minutes is very tight.

215
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:47,998
What are you waiting for?
Aren't you rushing over to your stations?

216
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,678
Zhou Caina is really good.

217
00:16:47,398 --> 00:16:48,958
In such a short amount of time,

218
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:51,358
she was able to sculpt
a chrysanthemum from a cabbage.

219
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:52,758
And she looks so confident.

220
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:56,438
Zhou Caina's flower looks really good.

221
00:16:57,718 --> 00:16:58,558
Hey.

222
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,798
You're not going to the cemetery.
Why do you need a chrysanthemum?

223
00:17:02,558 --> 00:17:03,758
-Si.
-What?

224
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:06,678
This is not a sculpting competition.
This is a cooking competition.

225
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:09,478
I think Shancai is having a hard time.

226
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:11,038
Look.

227
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,318
<i>This is so hard.</i>

228
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:21,958
<i>A hometown dish in 45 minutes.</i>

229
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:25,398
<i>The Shanghai dishes I've learned, such as
egg white-topped fried crab on a shell,</i>

230
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:28,918
<i>salted pork with bamboo shoots soup,
braised Mandarin fish with white sauce,</i>

231
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:30,598
<i>"Eight Treasure Duck."</i>

232
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:32,398
<i>They all need a lot of time to make.</i>

233
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:35,558
<i>Unless, fried river prawn.</i>

234
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:37,278
<i>No.</i>

235
00:17:37,838 --> 00:17:40,238
<i>Okay. Now we can see
the three contestants have selected</i>

236
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:42,278
<i>their ingredients
and went back to their stations.</i>

237
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:45,598
Only Dong Shancai's basket
is still empty until now.

238
00:17:46,158 --> 00:17:47,878
Stupid girl, why are just standing there?

239
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:49,918
There's not enough time. Move it!

240
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:55,598
Hey, relax.

241
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:57,278
Shancai must still be thinking.

242
00:17:57,998 --> 00:17:59,518
You'll only make her panic even more.

243
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:09,998
-What is he doing?
-Where are you going?

244
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:11,958
-What's going on?
-What's happening?

245
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:48,918
Sir, please leave the recording room.

246
00:18:52,238 --> 00:18:54,598
Sorry, sir, we're filming right now.
Please leave.

247
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:00,798
What are you doing?

248
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:02,558
Hey.

249
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:05,318
Shancai.

250
00:19:06,998 --> 00:19:08,078
Shancai.

251
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:09,358
Everyone, we apologize.

252
00:19:09,438 --> 00:19:10,598
There's been a minor hiccup.

253
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:13,038
Maybe Miss Shancai's fan
is too passionate.

254
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,958
He went to the cooking stations.

255
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:16,518
Shancai.

256
00:19:17,598 --> 00:19:18,598
-Shancai!
-Please leave.

257
00:19:18,678 --> 00:19:19,958
Shancai!

258
00:19:20,838 --> 00:19:22,358
-Shancai.
-All right.

259
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:26,598
<i>I know you're reminding me
that I have to win.</i>

260
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:28,758
<i>My dad has a one million yuan debt to pay.</i>

261
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:30,238
<i>I can't just give up.</i>

262
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,238
-Sir, please leave.
-Please go.

263
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:56,798
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

264
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,118
<i>What should I do?</i>

265
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,158
<i>My brain is completely blank.</i>

266
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,958
<i>Stupid girl.
Go and choose your ingredients.</i>

267
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:10,718
<i>Stupid boy. What should I choose?</i>

268
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,718
<i>Stupid girl. Is your brain damaged?
Think about what you should do.</i>

269
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:16,838
<i>Stupid boy.</i>

270
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,438
<i>It would be good if I know what to do.</i>

271
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:20,798
<i>Stupid girl.</i>

272
00:20:21,598 --> 00:20:23,278
<i>It doesn't matter
if you forget everything.</i>

273
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:28,798
<i>Shancai! Release your fighting spirit.</i>

274
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:32,678
Yes, I have to win.
I have to release my fighting spirit.

275
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:33,998
I can do it.

276
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,638
Sorry, sir. Please leave.

277
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:11,878
-Pineapple?
-Pineapple?

278
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,158
Shancai is so interesting.

279
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:16,878
Shancai.

280
00:21:16,998 --> 00:21:18,798
You have to believe your strong genes.

281
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:21,638
The blood of a chef is in you.

282
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:26,478
Shancai looked so cute
when she closed her eyes.

283
00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:27,438
Cute?

284
00:21:27,638 --> 00:21:28,998
I was terrified for her earlier.

285
00:21:29,158 --> 00:21:29,998
Me too.

286
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:32,358
I don't know what Shancai
will make with pineapples.

287
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:34,158
My brother is too involved.

288
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:36,198
He looked so cute when he barged in.

289
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:38,238
He really thinks he's her knight
in shining armor.

290
00:21:42,078 --> 00:21:43,878
But I think Shancai has to relax.

291
00:21:44,998 --> 00:21:48,238
Maybe she'll really lose this round.

292
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:17,558
Shancai, you're going
to lose to me this time.

293
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:19,798
Why?

294
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:22,198
Because I know how delicious
a dish would taste

295
00:22:22,398 --> 00:22:23,598
just by looking at it.

296
00:22:27,198 --> 00:22:30,758
I already feel very lucky for being able
to stay in the competition until now.

297
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:34,518
Maybe I can depend on my luck
to keep winning.

298
00:22:35,158 --> 00:22:36,798
Luck will not always be on your side.

299
00:23:06,358 --> 00:23:07,198
<i>All right.</i>

300
00:23:07,398 --> 00:23:10,158
<i>The last round of our Chinese
Cuisine Culinary Competition,</i>

301
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:12,878
<i>Hometown Dish, only has two minutes left.</i>

302
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,398
<i>Time's up.</i>

303
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:28,918
<i>Please stop cooking
and get ready to present your dishes.</i>

304
00:23:31,518 --> 00:23:32,798
DONG SHANCAI

305
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:33,678
ZHOU CAINA

306
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:34,558
LUO QIANNI

307
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:35,798
LING CHENXI

308
00:23:36,358 --> 00:23:39,158
All right. We're going into the very
intense part of our competition.

309
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,038
Our judges are already
starting to taste the dishes

310
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:44,278
prepared by our contestants.

311
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,358
What surprised me

312
00:23:57,918 --> 00:24:00,598
was that Wenchang Chicken
usually needs to be soaked in broth

313
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:01,878
for at least three hours

314
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:03,998
before it can produce such rich flavor.

315
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:06,158
Miss Zhou Caina, may I ask

316
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,038
how did you use 45 minutes
to complete this dish so beautifully?

317
00:24:10,478 --> 00:24:11,598
It's easy.

318
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:14,118
I used chicken bones and a large
amount of chicken wings.

319
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:17,318
I also added onions,
mushrooms, potatoes and cooked them all

320
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:19,038
at the right temperature.

321
00:24:19,118 --> 00:24:22,798
That way, the soup cooked in 20 minutes
can also have a rich taste.

322
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:25,358
Just the way the chicken was cut

323
00:24:25,718 --> 00:24:27,318
is already very impressive.

324
00:24:27,878 --> 00:24:29,638
How did you achieve
such good cutting skills?

325
00:24:30,438 --> 00:24:31,798
When I studied abroad,

326
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:33,918
I didn't want my family
to pay for my living expenses.

327
00:24:33,998 --> 00:24:35,358
I always went to the market

328
00:24:35,438 --> 00:24:37,358
-and bought the chicken bones.
-Who wants to listen

329
00:24:37,438 --> 00:24:39,278
-to her nonsense?
-After a long period of time,

330
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:41,318
-I cut all the meat
-If Shancai's the one talking,

331
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:42,718
-from the bones
-he won't be mad.

332
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:45,478
and made Kung Pao Chicken for my friends.

333
00:24:46,358 --> 00:24:48,558
This dish is quite excellent.

334
00:24:55,718 --> 00:24:58,198
-Luo Qianni's stewed pigeon
-She is so perfect to receive

335
00:24:58,438 --> 00:25:00,558
-has a nice flavor.
-such praises from Mingde's alumni.

336
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:01,918
The Chinese Yam is so soft.

337
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:04,718
-Can you tell us how you made the pigeon
-You're exaggerating.

338
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,078
-so flavorful in such a short time?
-I'm not.

339
00:25:07,158 --> 00:25:08,878
-Not at all.
-Covering the bowl with salt...

340
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,518
If I were the judge, I'll choose her now.

341
00:25:11,598 --> 00:25:12,878
We're in sync, all right.

342
00:25:13,358 --> 00:25:15,118
The pigeon meat
would be even more delicious.

343
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:18,718
Next, judges, please taste the dish
prepared by our last contestant,

344
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:20,398
Dong Shancai.

345
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:32,558
May I ask what this is?

346
00:25:32,638 --> 00:25:34,558
This is "Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles."

347
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:39,398
Why are you laughing?

348
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:42,278
Didn't they tell her to make
famous hometown dishes?

349
00:25:43,158 --> 00:25:45,718
Because "Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles"
is too common.

350
00:25:49,638 --> 00:25:52,798
Didn't Shancai train at Daoming Si's
house for a long time?

351
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,318
Why did she make such a common dish?

352
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:56,638
Yes.

353
00:26:00,238 --> 00:26:01,078
Dear,

354
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:03,878
did you teach her how to make
this "Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles"?

355
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:05,518
No.

356
00:26:12,598 --> 00:26:14,798
Why did she think of making this dish?

357
00:26:15,438 --> 00:26:16,478
Are you from Shanghai?

358
00:26:17,238 --> 00:26:18,078
Yes.

359
00:26:18,518 --> 00:26:20,118
I grew up in Shanghai.

360
00:26:20,678 --> 00:26:23,078
Every time I got sick and had no appetite,

361
00:26:23,678 --> 00:26:25,238
I would gain my appetite back

362
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:27,918
after I ate
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles."

363
00:26:29,078 --> 00:26:31,478
However, other contestants

364
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:34,358
prepared well-known dishes
that are hard to make.

365
00:26:35,078 --> 00:26:36,798
Yet you made this snack.

366
00:26:37,758 --> 00:26:39,878
Aren't you afraid of losing?

367
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:43,238
I am. Of course I am.

368
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:45,318
But I feel

369
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,638
that regardless
if it's a hard or easy dish,

370
00:26:49,478 --> 00:26:51,238
it would be able to rise up
to the challenge

371
00:26:51,598 --> 00:26:53,078
as long as it has its unique quality.

372
00:26:55,998 --> 00:26:57,158
There's a reason why

373
00:26:57,278 --> 00:26:59,598
you won't get tired of eating
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles"

374
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:01,358
even if you eat it every day.

375
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:04,558
I think the flavor is quite unique.

376
00:27:05,078 --> 00:27:06,918
Did you add pineapples?

377
00:27:06,998 --> 00:27:08,278
Yes.

378
00:27:09,078 --> 00:27:10,118
You added pineapples?

379
00:27:12,518 --> 00:27:13,678
How did you think of that?

380
00:27:29,518 --> 00:27:30,958
Based on my personal experiences.

381
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:34,998
Apparently, Miss Shancai's experiences
are different from others.

382
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:37,678
Maybe someone in her family
plants pineapples.

383
00:27:40,718 --> 00:27:42,318
You were the one who inspired her, right?

384
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:44,518
Who knows?

385
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:46,958
I just wanted to encourage her.

386
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:49,678
Who knew she wouldn't be able
to contain her inspiration

387
00:27:49,838 --> 00:27:51,038
when she saw me?

388
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,278
What? Isn't that possible?

389
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,238
Of course it is.

390
00:27:56,638 --> 00:27:58,478
Of course, nobody can beat true love.

391
00:28:02,638 --> 00:28:04,438
Even though that's a very honest answer,

392
00:28:05,238 --> 00:28:07,438
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles"

393
00:28:08,878 --> 00:28:11,798
might be her dad's provided work meal.

394
00:28:14,758 --> 00:28:16,478
Look at the expression
on the judges' faces.

395
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:20,038
Would they be convinced by her?

396
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:26,998
The results will be announced soon.
I'm so nervous.

397
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,038
Don't worry.

398
00:28:29,118 --> 00:28:31,318
Shancai would surely win.

399
00:28:34,918 --> 00:28:36,478
Don't look at me that way.

400
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:40,798
Because I'll vomit.

401
00:28:45,118 --> 00:28:47,238
All right. Can we have
our judges come to the stage

402
00:28:47,318 --> 00:28:49,438
to comment on the performance
of today's contestants

403
00:28:49,518 --> 00:28:51,518
and award the winner.

404
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:04,878
The result is in my hands.

405
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:08,038
I'm as excited as you all are
at this very moment.

406
00:29:08,438 --> 00:29:10,518
Because the four contestants
all performed very well,

407
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:12,478
especially two of them,

408
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:15,238
let me just provide some simple comments.

409
00:29:15,598 --> 00:29:17,398
Earlier, Qianni's Huangshan Stewed Pigeon

410
00:29:17,878 --> 00:29:18,958
was a very refreshing soup.

411
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:21,238
It's such a shame
that the meat was too tough.

412
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:22,638
For Chenxi,

413
00:29:23,238 --> 00:29:25,838
it's really hard for her to make

414
00:29:26,318 --> 00:29:27,918
Buddha's Temptation in such a short time.

415
00:29:28,158 --> 00:29:30,158
Too bad that the cooking temperature
was not right.

416
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:32,998
That Hainan Wenchang Chicken dish

417
00:29:33,478 --> 00:29:35,678
prepared by Miss Zhou Caina earlier

418
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:37,238
is perfect in every way,

419
00:29:38,158 --> 00:29:39,958
including her cooking skills.

420
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:44,518
The plating, the substance
and flavor of the dish.

421
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:49,158
Miss Dong Shancai's performance

422
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:51,558
is also remarkable, right?

423
00:29:52,198 --> 00:29:53,478
Yes.

424
00:29:53,638 --> 00:29:56,998
She put pineapples into the most common
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles" dish,

425
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:59,558
that reduced the spiciness
for those who don't like spicy food.

426
00:30:00,118 --> 00:30:02,358
It's a very creative move.

427
00:30:04,198 --> 00:30:05,398
Hey.

428
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:07,918
-Why can't she be direct?
-Miss Shancai was able to get rid of

429
00:30:07,998 --> 00:30:10,238
the old idea and focus on
the uniqueness of common dishes.

430
00:30:10,318 --> 00:30:12,438
She embodies the creative spirit
of our Chinese Cuisine.

431
00:30:14,758 --> 00:30:15,598
Thank you.

432
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:18,798
Next, our judges will announce

433
00:30:18,878 --> 00:30:21,638
today's winner.

434
00:30:30,638 --> 00:30:32,278
-Why can't you watch it?
<i>-Now, the winner</i>

435
00:30:32,358 --> 00:30:33,638
-I can't.
<i>-of the Chinese Cuisine</i>

436
00:30:33,718 --> 00:30:35,438
<i>-Culinary Competition is chosen.</i>
-Watch it.

437
00:30:35,518 --> 00:30:38,238
<i>Who will win the one million yuan
cash prize?</i>

438
00:30:44,878 --> 00:30:45,718
Ms. Zhuang.

439
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:48,518
Based on overall performance,

440
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:51,078
Shancai's chances of winning are not high.

441
00:30:52,878 --> 00:30:54,598
It doesn't matter
whether she wins or loses.

442
00:30:54,878 --> 00:30:56,678
My brother obviously likes this girl.

443
00:30:56,798 --> 00:30:58,038
I have to acknowledge her too.

444
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:04,278
Regardless of who wins or loses tonight,
we have to celebrate.

445
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:10,158
The winner...

446
00:31:15,718 --> 00:31:17,478
It's Miss Zhou Caina.

447
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,758
All right. Congratulations, Caina!

448
00:31:20,318 --> 00:31:21,998
Caina, please step forward.

449
00:31:22,078 --> 00:31:23,958
CHAMPION ZHOU CAINA

450
00:31:25,478 --> 00:31:26,878
You're not allowed to clap for her.

451
00:31:29,478 --> 00:31:31,398
Next, can we have the judges

452
00:31:31,478 --> 00:31:33,958
to award the trophy
and prize money to Caina.

453
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,678
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

454
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:39,558
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

455
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:40,478
Thank you.

456
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:44,798
Thank you to all the judges.

457
00:31:44,878 --> 00:31:47,038
And thank you to everyone
for liking my dishes.

458
00:31:47,678 --> 00:31:50,918
Actually, the contestants in this
cooking competition are all exceptional.

459
00:31:51,478 --> 00:31:54,718
But I still believe that I'll be
the champion for the whole competition

460
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:58,198
because I believe
that as long as I work hard,

461
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:00,118
my dream will come true.

462
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:02,558
Again, thank you, everyone.

463
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:06,398
All right, up next,

464
00:32:06,478 --> 00:32:09,678
we'll request Mingde University's
most beautiful alumni, Tang Jingmei,

465
00:32:09,758 --> 00:32:12,598
to announce
the Special Prize winner today.

466
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:19,078
We especially made an exception this time

467
00:32:19,198 --> 00:32:20,678
to select a special prize winner,

468
00:32:20,758 --> 00:32:22,558
who will get 500,000 yuan cash prize,

469
00:32:23,918 --> 00:32:25,878
in order to serve as encouragement

470
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,958
for her persistent
and outstanding performance.

471
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:29,758
And she's also my junior in school,

472
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:32,238
Miss Dong Shancai.

473
00:32:32,358 --> 00:32:33,398
Congratulations!

474
00:32:33,478 --> 00:32:35,878
SPECIAL PRIZE, DONG SHANCAI

475
00:32:38,118 --> 00:32:39,278
Dong Shancai, well done!

476
00:32:39,598 --> 00:32:40,878
-I knew you could do it!
-Hey.

477
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:42,438
You're acting nuts!

478
00:32:42,518 --> 00:32:44,558
-Good job, Shancai!
-Now, we'll award Shancai

479
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:45,878
the prize money and certificate.

480
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:48,798
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

481
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:52,158
Shancai, say a few words.

482
00:32:57,078 --> 00:32:57,918
Actually,

483
00:32:59,598 --> 00:33:01,398
I never thought

484
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:03,838
that I can compete together

485
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:06,518
with such outstanding contestants,

486
00:33:08,078 --> 00:33:09,238
Zhou Caina.

487
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:12,438
She really deserves to win.

488
00:33:18,158 --> 00:33:18,998
I...

489
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:22,238
In receiving this award,

490
00:33:23,238 --> 00:33:24,358
I would like to thank

491
00:33:24,678 --> 00:33:26,078
all the people that have helped me.

492
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:28,638
Thank you to Ms. Zhuang.

493
00:33:30,238 --> 00:33:31,838
Thank you to all my good friends.

494
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:34,638
Ten days ago,

495
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:36,838
I still wasn't brave enough
to accept this challenge.

496
00:33:39,078 --> 00:33:40,758
I was afraid that I would lose.

497
00:33:41,238 --> 00:33:42,438
It would be too humiliating.

498
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:49,438
Thankfully, there's someone

499
00:33:50,318 --> 00:33:51,518
who always encouraged me

500
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:53,798
and supported me

501
00:33:55,238 --> 00:33:56,758
without expecting anything in return.

502
00:34:00,158 --> 00:34:00,998
Thank you.

503
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:07,838
All right. Congratulations, Shancai.

504
00:34:13,158 --> 00:34:15,558
Next, we'd like to invite our ambassadors

505
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:17,958
to present flowers
to these two contestants.

506
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:23,718
All right, Shancai!

507
00:34:25,198 --> 00:34:26,118
Cheer for her.

508
00:34:27,238 --> 00:34:30,518
All right. Thank you to the brilliant
performance of all our contestants.

509
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:33,958
And thank you to all the judges
for their amazing support.

510
00:34:34,558 --> 00:34:36,758
This year's Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition

511
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:38,278
has now ended.

512
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:40,358
Let's keep promoting
the spirit of Chinese cuisine

513
00:34:40,438 --> 00:34:43,598
so that it would spread throughout
all of China and the whole world.

514
00:34:43,678 --> 00:34:44,998
We'll see you again next time.

515
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:49,238
Shancai.

516
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:50,398
Good job!

517
00:34:50,678 --> 00:34:52,558
I knew you could do it!

518
00:34:54,478 --> 00:34:56,078
Shancai, well done!

519
00:35:06,878 --> 00:35:07,878
She won!

520
00:35:08,038 --> 00:35:09,438
-That's great!
-Shancai is the best!

521
00:35:11,518 --> 00:35:13,158
Our daughter won the special prize.

522
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:14,398
She earned a lot of money!

523
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:15,318
Yes.

524
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:18,198
Hello?

525
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:22,158
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles"?

526
00:35:22,638 --> 00:35:23,558
Yes.

527
00:35:23,758 --> 00:35:26,878
You mean the noodles
my daughter cooked earlier, right?

528
00:35:26,998 --> 00:35:28,278
Of course we have it.

529
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:30,878
Let me tell you,
I taught her how to cook that.

530
00:35:31,318 --> 00:35:32,158
Yes.

531
00:35:33,158 --> 00:35:34,238
When can we sell it?

532
00:35:34,318 --> 00:35:36,478
Tomorrow is fine. We'll sell it tomorrow.

533
00:35:37,038 --> 00:35:38,158
But you have to be quick.

534
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:39,838
This dish is limited edition.

535
00:35:40,878 --> 00:35:41,718
You...

536
00:35:41,798 --> 00:35:42,638
All right.

537
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:44,998
-Somebody just ordered it?
-Yes.

538
00:35:46,158 --> 00:35:46,998
Dear.

539
00:35:47,198 --> 00:35:50,038
Do you think we should give
this special noodle dish a powerful name?

540
00:35:50,118 --> 00:35:50,958
Yes.

541
00:35:51,118 --> 00:35:52,598
-It should be popular right away.
-Yes.

542
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:54,638
We'll call it Powerful Noodles.

543
00:35:55,198 --> 00:35:57,118
It's too short. It's not powerful enough.

544
00:35:59,638 --> 00:36:01,078
Then we can name it something longer.

545
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:03,798
I know.

546
00:36:04,798 --> 00:36:08,038
We'll call it Dong Shancai Chinese Cuisine

547
00:36:08,158 --> 00:36:09,198
Special Prize

548
00:36:09,278 --> 00:36:10,798
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles."

549
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:12,598
That's so powerful!

550
00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:14,518
Dear, I knew you were smart.

551
00:36:16,238 --> 00:36:17,558
This name is so great!

552
00:36:18,078 --> 00:36:19,638
-I've forgotten it now.
-Dong Shancai.

553
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:21,958
Dong Danian's daughter.

554
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:22,958
-No.
-Isn't the name--

555
00:36:23,038 --> 00:36:25,358
Dong Shancai Chinese Cuisine Special Prize

556
00:36:25,478 --> 00:36:27,958
-"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles."
-"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles."

557
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,678
This is the "Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles"
that I prepared.

558
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:36,198
Si, you inspired me to make this dish.

559
00:36:36,518 --> 00:36:37,798
Do you want to try it first?

560
00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:38,798
That's right.

561
00:36:38,878 --> 00:36:40,838
How can we dare eat it
if you haven't tried it?

562
00:36:56,998 --> 00:36:57,958
Shancai.

563
00:36:58,038 --> 00:36:58,998
Shancai.

564
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:07,358
What you just said is as hilarious
as your pineapple head.

565
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:09,958
Based on my personal experiences...

566
00:37:13,158 --> 00:37:14,998
We told you to eat.
What are you waiting for?

567
00:37:15,078 --> 00:37:16,118
All right. I'll eat it.

568
00:37:32,478 --> 00:37:33,358
It's a bit spicy,

569
00:37:36,158 --> 00:37:38,238
but it's quite good.

570
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:43,798
This flavor should be paired
with red wine.

571
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:46,638
It's delicious.
I like this level of spiciness.

572
00:37:48,398 --> 00:37:50,758
The pineapple's sweetness
balanced the grease of the noodles.

573
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,358
Well...

574
00:37:57,998 --> 00:37:58,838
Actually,

575
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,758
I'm very thankful
for the experiences I gained

576
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:03,838
from the preparation
until the actual competition.

577
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:06,118
Thank you for helping me, Ms. Zhuang

578
00:38:06,198 --> 00:38:07,838
and everyone.

579
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:09,438
So thank you to all of you.

580
00:38:15,718 --> 00:38:16,798
<i>It's so strange.</i>

581
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:19,358
<i>Why am I more nervous now
with that guy staring at me</i>

582
00:38:19,438 --> 00:38:21,438
<i>than when I was at the competition?</i>

583
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,998
Come with me for a while.
I want to tell you something.

584
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:31,558
You don't need to leave. We'll leave.

585
00:38:31,638 --> 00:38:32,638
Come. Follow me.

586
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:34,678
Ms. Zhuang, are we going to buy some wine?

587
00:38:34,758 --> 00:38:36,878
Enough talking. Let's just go.

588
00:38:37,438 --> 00:38:38,758
-Okay.
-You all don't need to go.

589
00:38:39,398 --> 00:38:40,798
I'll say it in front of all of you.

590
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:46,198
Shancai.

591
00:38:47,238 --> 00:38:49,758
Spend the day with me tomorrow.

592
00:38:56,878 --> 00:38:59,998
Who asks someone out on a date
in front of everyone?

593
00:39:00,078 --> 00:39:01,718
Why should we date in secret?

594
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:04,238
Didn't you want to thank me?

595
00:39:05,118 --> 00:39:06,398
If you really want to thank me,

596
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:08,998
then spend the day with me.

597
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:15,678
All right. Let's all spend
the day together.

598
00:39:20,198 --> 00:39:22,038
My schedule is full tomorrow.

599
00:39:22,118 --> 00:39:24,438
I have a tea ceremony tomorrow morning.

600
00:39:24,638 --> 00:39:27,718
At night, I have to discuss
some things with Ella,

601
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:29,638
Selina, and Hebe.

602
00:39:32,558 --> 00:39:34,398
I have to set up our exhibit
tomorrow morning.

603
00:39:34,478 --> 00:39:36,158
Then I have a date at night.

604
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:39,278
Huaze Lei, you're always free, right?

605
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:42,038
He's going shopping with me tomorrow.

606
00:39:46,998 --> 00:39:47,838
See?

607
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:50,838
I'm the only one available to go
on a date with you.

608
00:39:54,198 --> 00:39:55,798
All right. Let's not talk about it first.

609
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:58,238
I'll make a toast first

610
00:39:58,918 --> 00:40:01,118
to thank everyone for supporting me.
Bottoms up.

611
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:04,278
Hey, Shancai.

612
00:40:05,118 --> 00:40:06,598
That alcohol is really strong.

613
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:14,318
You're sober now?

614
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:16,318
Check it out. What do you think?

615
00:41:18,718 --> 00:41:19,638
What is this?

616
00:41:19,718 --> 00:41:21,318
DONG SHANCAI EIGHT TREASURE SPICY NOODLES

617
00:41:22,278 --> 00:41:23,158
That's right.

618
00:41:23,638 --> 00:41:26,998
It's honorably named as Dong Shancai
Chinese Cuisine Special Prize

619
00:41:27,078 --> 00:41:29,318
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles."

620
00:41:29,518 --> 00:41:32,838
Please validate
the Dong Shancai authenticity logo.

621
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:36,198
Where did you find such an ugly picture?

622
00:41:36,278 --> 00:41:37,118
Is it ugly?

623
00:41:37,398 --> 00:41:39,078
It's so pretty! I even edited it.

624
00:41:39,158 --> 00:41:41,038
-See how small your face is.
-That's right.

625
00:41:41,798 --> 00:41:42,638
Come on.

626
00:41:42,998 --> 00:41:44,558
-Help me record it.
-Come on.

627
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:46,758
-Record what?
-Advertisement.

628
00:41:46,998 --> 00:41:48,918
Your mom and I practiced
the whole morning.

629
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:49,838
Record it properly.

630
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:55,358
Can we start?

631
00:42:00,438 --> 00:42:03,078
When people become old,

632
00:42:03,518 --> 00:42:06,598
they often have no appetite
and have poor digestion.

633
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,078
Sea cucumber, abalone, lobster

634
00:42:09,158 --> 00:42:10,598
are not appetizing to them.

635
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:16,238
Dear.

636
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:17,758
Guess what I made for you?

637
00:42:20,718 --> 00:42:23,798
Could it be Dong Shancai Chinese
Cuisine Special Prize

638
00:42:23,878 --> 00:42:25,518
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles"?

639
00:42:26,238 --> 00:42:27,078
That's right.

640
00:42:27,158 --> 00:42:30,278
After eating Dong Shancai Chinese
Cuisine Special Prize

641
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:33,198
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles",
your back would not ache,

642
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:34,478
your legs would not cramp up

643
00:42:34,598 --> 00:42:35,998
and your memory will improve.

644
00:42:36,078 --> 00:42:37,758
It'll help you pass the English exam.

645
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:40,678
Your mom wouldn't need to worry
about your studies anymore.

646
00:42:42,398 --> 00:42:45,158
Dong Shancai
Chinese Cuisine Special Prize,

647
00:42:45,238 --> 00:42:46,518
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles."

648
00:42:46,638 --> 00:42:49,038
Awaken your sleeping taste buds.

649
00:42:49,238 --> 00:42:50,278
A gentle reminder.

650
00:42:50,478 --> 00:42:52,438
Please eat the noodles in a civilized way.

651
00:42:52,758 --> 00:42:54,078
Don't slurp it up.

652
00:42:57,438 --> 00:42:59,038
-How is it?
-How is it?

653
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:01,958
-All right. I have to go.
-Let me see.

654
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,838
The orders will start coming in
at 10:00 a.m.

655
00:43:04,118 --> 00:43:06,438
What? It's 10:00 a.m.?

656
00:43:12,878 --> 00:43:13,958
Sorry.

657
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,078
Are you hurt, kid?

658
00:43:16,398 --> 00:43:18,238
I'm a man. I don't get hurt that easily.

659
00:43:20,078 --> 00:43:20,918
Little boy,

660
00:43:21,718 --> 00:43:23,318
what are you doing in front of my house?

661
00:43:31,678 --> 00:43:32,718
"Mrs. Dong,

662
00:43:32,798 --> 00:43:34,238
I'm Mrs. Wang from next door.

663
00:43:34,638 --> 00:43:36,998
The company suddenly asked me
to do overtime work tonight.

664
00:43:37,118 --> 00:43:38,598
I can't take care of my kid.

665
00:43:38,678 --> 00:43:39,798
The nanny is not here either.

666
00:43:40,238 --> 00:43:41,878
Please help me take care of him today.

667
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:43,278
His name is Xiao Long.

668
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:44,398
He's very nice. Thank you."

669
00:43:48,438 --> 00:43:50,438
So you're Mrs. Wong's kid from next door.

670
00:43:51,558 --> 00:43:52,438
Who are you?

671
00:43:54,158 --> 00:43:56,038
I'm Mrs. Dong's daughter.

672
00:43:56,558 --> 00:43:57,718
You can call me Shancai.

673
00:43:58,718 --> 00:44:00,918
Shancai, bring me home.

674
00:44:05,078 --> 00:44:06,678
I'm busy.

675
00:44:07,518 --> 00:44:09,598
My parents went to Hangzhou
to buy something.

676
00:44:09,678 --> 00:44:14,558
Think. Do you know any other neighbors?

677
00:44:15,558 --> 00:44:16,558
No.

678
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,718
It's fine. Nobody cares about me anyway.

679
00:44:23,798 --> 00:44:24,958
It's best if I get lost.
