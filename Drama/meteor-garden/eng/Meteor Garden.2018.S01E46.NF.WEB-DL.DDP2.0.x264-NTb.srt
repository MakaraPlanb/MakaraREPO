A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 46

3
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,080
-Where are we going?
-Up to you.

4
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,480
Can we go see a movie?

5
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Or have afternoon tea?

6
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,680
Or we can just keep
walking around like this.

7
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,800
Was anyone around?

8
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,920
No.

9
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,640
That's good.

10
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,320
Daoming Si from F4 can be seen
tripping on the street like this.

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
It would be too humiliating.

12
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,920
Of course it would be.

13
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,280
You're not elegant enough.

14
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,040
I didn't mean to do it.

15
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920
Of course you'd trip in those shoes.

16
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,400
How did you survive until today
if you're this clumsy?

17
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,240
Let's go.

18
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,240
-Where are we going?
-Where else?

19
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,840
A movie? Afternoon tea?

20
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,160
Let's buy some shoes first.

21
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,520
What?

22
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,120
Jump on. What else?

23
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,440
Do you want to trip again?

24
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,440
You're too heavy. I can't catch you.

25
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,600
Hold this.

26
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,440
I guess I'll have to take care of you
for a lifetime.

27
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,560
Don't...

28
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,680
LEFT FOOT, RIGHT FOOT

29
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,400
Shancai?

30
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,680
Gosh, I haven't seen you for so long.

31
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,440
Come. Let me see you.

32
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,680
Gosh, you're so pretty now.

33
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,840
You buy shoes from this shop?

34
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,480
Of course.

35
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,480
She's been coming here
since she started school.

36
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,840
She's like our brand spokesperson, right?

37
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,560
No wonder--

38
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,480
Shancai.

39
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,240
Those shoes on that shelf
have all the discounts.

40
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,200
New arrivals are over here.
Please have a look.

41
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,880
Choose the best shoes for her.

42
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,240
Goodness.

43
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Is he your boyfriend?

44
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,400
He's so nice to you.

45
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,960
I'll get a pair for you to try on.

46
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,120
Okay.

47
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,720
TRENDING RIGHT NOW, 199 YUAN

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,240
They look great.

49
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,320
It's like they were made for you.

50
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,880
What do you think?

51
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,960
Surprisingly good.

52
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,600
Stop giggling. Come home with me now.

53
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,280
What are we doing?

54
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,560
Don't think you can get your way
just because we're getting married.

55
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,080
Mrs. Yu will take
measurements for your dress.

56
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,680
What were you thinking?

57
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,320
Look at your figure.

58
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,360
No normal person would be interested.

59
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,480
Shut up.

60
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
<i>Shancai, you're here.</i>

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,440
You've been eating well, haven't you?

62
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,840
You're gaining weight
in all the right spots.

63
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,160
Mrs. Yu, you're saying
that I've gained weight.

64
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,360
No.

65
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,480
You look great like this.

66
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,040
You seem to have a lot of energy.

67
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,280
I'll make you the best dress ever.

68
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,000
So that you can be

69
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,560
the center of attention

70
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,160
at your engagement and wedding.

71
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,800
Thank you, Mrs. Yu.

72
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,400
I know I can trust you.

73
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,640
You know,

74
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,640
I've been waiting for you to come.

75
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,920
I like it when you are here in this house.

76
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,680
Thank you.

77
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,400
I'll have to learn about everything
in this household.

78
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,440
You'll have to help me with that.

79
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,920
I'm actually grateful to you.

80
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,240
Only you can control Si.

81
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,680
By the way, it's getting late now.

82
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,840
You should just stay here after dinner.

83
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,600
You can stay in Si's room.

84
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,840
Mrs. Yu.

85
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,520
How can a nice old lady like you

86
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,240
say something like that?

87
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,880
This is totally natural, isn't it?

88
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,320
Why are you so shy?

89
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,320
Also, don't call me an old lady.

90
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,840
You silly child.

91
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,600
Are you guys done yet?

92
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,920
We are.

93
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,720
Si.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,560
You can take her away now.

95
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,400
Come on.

96
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,280
What?

97
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,200
Hey!

98
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,320
No questions asked.

99
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,160
-Come on.
-You...

100
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,840
Did you set this up together? Hey!

101
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,480
Ximen, I have a gift for you.

102
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
A special gift?

103
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,680
Not really.

104
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,800
I just wanted to have it with you.

105
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,920
A cake?

106
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,720
Yes, it's really good.

107
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,280
You girls love to have things like this.

108
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,640
Us girls?

109
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,360
Xiaogeng likes cakes too.

110
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,280
What? Are you mad?

111
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,200
No.

112
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,320
It's silly to be jealous of exes.

113
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,640
Right now, it's about us.

114
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,360
We're having cake together now.

115
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,400
I don't really like sweet things.

116
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,880
But I like you,

117
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,400
so I'll try it.

118
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,080
This cake is like us.

119
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,080
It's not too sweet.

120
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,680
What about you?

121
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,720
Do you have a gift for me?

122
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
No.

123
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,160
Well, I didn't want anything.

124
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,720
That's not what I meant.

125
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,720
I'm happy just to be here with you.

126
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,000
Really happy.

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,840
Okay.

128
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,400
-Xiaoyou?
-Yes?

129
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,280
This is our first date.

130
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,440
I want it to be a special memory.

131
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,920
It was special.

132
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,040
I'll never forget tonight
because I was with you.

133
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,600
Ximen, what's going on?

134
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,440
You seem flustered.

135
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,240
My dad texted me. I need to call him.

136
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,720
Wait for me right here.

137
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,400
I'll be right back, okay?

138
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,240
<i>-Hello?
</i>-Qinghe.

139
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,960
Why didn't it light up?

140
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,400
<i>Did it not?</i>

141
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,080
<i>It's probably not connected.</i>

142
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,360
<i>Or the wire might be broken.</i>

143
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,200
The wire is broken?

144
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,360
<i>No.</i>

145
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,040
<i>I was wrong. Nothing's wrong.</i>

146
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,960
Install the controller onto the switch.

147
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,760
Turn on three from the 36th to 16th floor.

148
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,680
Turn on four above the 26th floor.

149
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,760
Turn on everything apart from the far
left and far right above the 40th floor.

150
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,080
Set the time and go. Is it that hard?

151
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,440
If you can't even do this,
how can you be a part of F4?

152
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,720
Chen Qinghe, I'm telling you,

153
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,760
I, Ximen Yan,

154
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,400
am the perfect boyfriend.

155
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,080
But you ruined my date tonight.

156
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
You're an idiot!

157
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,480
Ximen, you seem distracted.

158
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,680
Are you okay?

159
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,600
I'm fine. They took care of it.

160
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,480
That's good.

161
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,160
I can't even do this small task.

162
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,240
What's wrong with me?

163
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,600
I knew it.

164
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,360
Perhaps God didn't want Ximen to succeed.

165
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,880
They're a couple. What's wrong with that?

166
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,440
They have flowers over there.
I'll buy some for you.

167
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,360
Ximen.

168
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,880
No need.

169
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,600
Tonight was wonderful

170
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,720
because I'm happy just to be with you.

171
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
I never thought I would be so happy.

172
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,240
To be able to hold your hand tonight

173
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,280
is everything I want.

174
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,160
Xiaoyou.

175
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,760
Wow!

176
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Ximen, look! It's so beautiful!

177
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,000
It must be a surprise for a girl
from her awesome boyfriend.

178
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,160
That's so creative and sweet.

179
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,440
It's amazing.

180
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,880
Wow.

181
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,800
That's so romantic.

182
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,760
Nice job, Ximen.

183
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,120
Yeah.

184
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,840
Ximen.

185
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,080
It's okay.

186
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,920
Even though you didn't get me a gift,

187
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,920
we saw such a beautiful sight

188
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,440
thanks to somebody else.

189
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
How lucky!

190
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,360
Somebody else?

191
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,880
Yeah.

192
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,320
Let's take a photo.

193
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,360
Don't open your eyes.

194
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,320
Okay.

195
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,760
Three,

196
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,160
two,

197
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,880
one.

198
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,480
It's so beautiful.

199
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,920
How's that?

200
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,880
Do you remember when
we were watching meteors together?

201
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,320
I found it. Come and see it.

202
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,880
-See what?
-Come and take a look.

203
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,120
Do you see it?

204
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,120
Yes. It's so beautiful.

205
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,080
It'd be nice if I can see it every day.

206
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,840
Then close your eyes and make a wish.

207
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,320
Maybe it'll come true.

208
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,480
How would you know if you don't try?

209
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,360
All right.

210
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,360
This gift has a special meaning.

211
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,640
Because you're the only one I'm willing
to trade all the meteors in the sky for.

212
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,640
Before we get married,
I want to give you some special memories.

213
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,400
You're so bad.

214
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,120
Why?

215
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,880
I won't be able to forget this.

216
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,440
So I guess I'll have
to follow you forever.

217
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,440
Where else would you go?

218
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,080
You can only be with me.

219
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,200
I survived with all my strength.

220
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,240
We can't let ourselves down.

221
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,920
Don't forget.

222
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
I'll be a good guy to you.

223
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,880
I'll listen to you.

224
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,240
Really?

225
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Of course.

226
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,240
But I also want you
to do something for me.

227
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,680
Of course, there's a catch.

228
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I knew it.

229
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,720
What's the catch?

230
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,640
The catch is that

231
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,760
you have to be with me

232
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,600
for the rest of your life.

233
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Guess what?

234
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,480
This is the happiest
I've been in this lifetime.

235
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,840
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

236
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,520
<i>Your Peach Red Royale.</i>

237
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,960
-Thank you. Come again.
-Okay, thanks.

238
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,320
Xiaoyou, Talent's Tea Shop
is doing better and better.

239
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,920
We're going to open more chain stores.

240
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,800
-That's great.
-You've been a hard worker.

241
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,760
I want you to take care of this store.

242
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,920
You'll be the manager. Would that be okay?

243
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Really?

244
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,680
Thank you so much. You can count on me!

245
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
Good luck.

246
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,440
PLEASE TAKE A LOOK, FRIENDS

247
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,440
WE'RE HIRING, BENEFITS INCLUDED

248
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,680
Your drinks are ready. Come again.

249
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,760
Thank you.

250
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,800
All of you are here.

251
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,720
Ximen, you're here.

252
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
This is Xiaoyou's first day
as the manager.

253
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,520
Ximen wanted us all to come support you.

254
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
He also said

255
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,040
we have to break the sales record today.

256
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,880
Thank you, guys. Thanks, Ximen.

257
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,040
We're about to order now.

258
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,640
Remember Talent's Tea Shop's
signature drink?

259
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
-White Jasmine Dew.
-Peach Red Royale.

260
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,040
Talent's Tea Shop

261
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,200
-is the best tea in town!
-Is the best tea in town!

262
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,360
Ximen reminded us countless times.

263
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,880
All right.

264
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,640
Let's find a seat then.

265
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,080
Xiaoyou was awesome.

266
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,240
It was her first day
and sales reached more than 20,000 yuan.

267
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,240
Applause, please.

268
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,000
Thank you, guys.

269
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,440
This is my treat.

270
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,480
-For Meizuo.
-Thanks.

271
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,640
Daoming Si.

272
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,640
Here.

273
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,400
To Xiaoyou's first
successful day as a manager.

274
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,360
Cheers.

275
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,960
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

276
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,920
I invented this new milk tea
using the best tea leaves.

277
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,720
Can you guys guess
what kind of tea leaves I used?

278
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,080
Lei, you first.

279
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,480
Mine is Moqi. It's really good.

280
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,600
Yes.

281
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,200
Meizuo.

282
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,480
This is Tungting Kiwi.

283
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,640
You're right.

284
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,320
This is probably Four Seasons Green Tea.

285
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,520
No.

286
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,280
Shancai, try it for me.

287
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,840
It's green tea with Yakult.

288
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,720
Shancai got it.

289
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,400
Shancai is an expert.

290
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,400
She managed to win Si's heart over.

291
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,600
Who would've thought that

292
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,400
the big-eyed, stubby girl with no grace

293
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,240
would look so pretty and cute now?

294
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,040
I wish I could kiss her.

295
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,840
I won't be able to see
Shancai anymore abroad.

296
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Are you jealous?

297
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,040
Yes.

298
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,880
I am jealous.

299
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,480
Especially of you.

300
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,960
Then I have to kiss her.

301
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,240
Hey! Watch it!

302
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
-Lei!
-Calm down.

303
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,520
-What's your problem?
-It was just a kiss.

304
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,720
It's fine.

305
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,000
Then I'll kiss Xiaoyou then!

306
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,640
Come here, Xiaoyou.

307
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,760
Calm down.

308
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Stop it!

309
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,960
-Come here, Xiaoyou!
-That's enough! Cut it out!

310
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,760
-Come here!
-Daoming Si!

311
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,640
Look at that.

312
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,720
What are you doing, dear? You're so slow.

313
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,160
I haven't worn a suit in so long.

314
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,640
I can't get this tie right.

315
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,160
It's either too long or too short.

316
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,520
-Come here.
-It's crooked.

317
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,520
Let me help you.

318
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,560
-The food is ready.
-That's good.

319
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,040
It smells amazing.

320
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,080
-We have a lot of food.
-That's a lot.

321
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,800
-Nice.
-Mom, I made your signature dish,

322
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,000
sweet and sour pork ribs.

323
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,640
When Daoming Si gets here,
he'll start drooling.

324
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,800
Dear, our Shancai is wonderful.

325
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,600
She's pretty, obedient, has good grades

326
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,080
and is really good at cooking.

327
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,840
How lucky are we?

328
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
How lucky are we?

329
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,680
I think the Daoming family is lucky.

330
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,280
What's wrong?

331
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,200
My precious daughter is getting married.

332
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,000
She won't be at home anymore.

333
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,600
I won't see her anymore.

334
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,760
I feel sad whenever I think of that.

335
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,560
There, there.

336
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,640
Mom, you'll see me all the time.

337
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,480
Even if I get married,

338
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,680
I'll always be by your side,
forever and ever.

339
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,400
You're my dearest mom.

340
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,200
Aren't you moving to London
after you get married?

341
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,520
I haven't graduated yet.

342
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,760
Before I do, I'll be in Shanghai.

343
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,720
Even if I do go to London,

344
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,240
I'll tell Daoming Si
that we shouldn't live there.

345
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,000
We should live here with you.

346
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,520
-Okay.
-Don't be silly.

347
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,480
When you're married,
you can't live wherever you want.

348
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,480
Of course I can.

349
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,320
Daoming Si told me that
he would do whatever I want him to do.

350
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,680
I can get him to do whatever I want.

351
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,240
Even if he picks on me,

352
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,840
I'll do what I did when I first met him.

353
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,200
I'll knock him down.

354
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,760
That's nice.

355
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,680
See our daughter? She's just like you.

356
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,800
Well, I'm not surprised that she is.

357
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,480
-You're the best mom ever.
-You're the best wife ever.

358
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,680
That's more like it.

359
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,920
It's already 12:30 p.m.

360
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,160
Why aren't Daoming Si
and his mom here yet?

361
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,080
It's hard to park in front of our house.

362
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,840
We should've told our neighbors

363
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,920
and just had them park
in front of their house.

364
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,360
This is my fault.

365
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,560
-All my fault.
-It's not.

366
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,200
They have a driver.
They don't drive themselves.

367
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,600
That's true. I totally forgot.

368
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,280
Did they forget
the directions to our house?

369
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,880
That's impossible.

370
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,080
-His mom came last time.
-Yeah.

371
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,080
It's fine. I'll call him now.

372
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,640
-Just ask him.
-Okay.

373
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,840
Hey, don't eat just yet.

374
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
We won't.

375
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,840
We're just checking them out.

376
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,440
So much food.

377
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,600
Hello? Daoming Si?

378
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,280
<i>It's not Daoming Si. It's me.</i>

379
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,920
Mrs. Daoming.

380
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,600
-Mrs. Daoming?
-I just wanted to know

381
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,000
if you're almost here.

382
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,280
My parents and I are waiting for you.

383
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,280
I'm busy today. I won't be going.

384
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,280
But we agreed to it.

385
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,080
You and Daoming Si were coming today.

386
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,560
<i>I just said that</i>

387
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,800
because Si was with you.

388
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,960
I was worried he would be tricked

389
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,560
into having a wedding
and doing something he would regret.

390
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,520
<i>Now, Si is back with me.</i>

391
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,520
<i>I've talked some sense into him.</i>

392
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,120
<i>He won't be so impulsive anymore.</i>

393
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,800
<i>After listening to me,</i>

394
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,240
<i>he decided to go back to London with me.</i>

395
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,080
<i>He'll never come back to Shanghai again.</i>

396
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
<i>Dong Shancai,</i>

397
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,960
<i>you should give up on Si.</i>

398
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,760
<i>It'll never happen.</i>

399
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
What is it, Shancai? What happened?

400
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,080
Mom.

401
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,080
Mrs. Daoming said

402
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,640
she won't be coming today.

403
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,920
That day,

404
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,800
she tricked us.

405
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
What?

406
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,360
She lied to us?

407
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,240
She won't be coming?

408
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,440
That's so rude. What is that witch doing?

409
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Shancai cooked so much food for them.

410
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,880
And they're not coming?

411
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,720
I'm just furious.

412
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,480
What is she thinking?

413
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,880
Does she think we're stupid?
That our daughter is stupid?

414
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,840
I have to go talk to her.
I have to set things straight.

415
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,280
Shancai, let's go to their house.

416
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,200
-Come on.
-Let's go.

417
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,520
Dad, Mom.

418
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,320
I'm sorry.

419
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,360
Why are you sorry?

420
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,240
They're the ones at fault.
What are you sorry for?

421
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,200
Because of our relationship,

422
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,840
you've been worried and angry.

423
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,320
But it's not your fault, right?

424
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,040
Dad, Mom.

425
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,520
Promise me one thing.

426
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,400
From now on,

427
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,240
let me deal with problems

428
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,960
concerning Daoming Si and I alone.

429
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,360
No matter what happens between us,

430
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,040
I never want you
to be insulted like this again.

431
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,080
No matter what Mrs. Daoming
does to separate us,

432
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,920
I'll be brave and deal with it.

433
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,840
Who came up with this stupid idea?

434
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,680
It was Meizuo.

435
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,800
He said that it was a hat party

436
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,920
and we should wear hats
to give Si our blessing.

437
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,000
But these dog hats are hideous.

438
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,680
This is a bachelor party hat, okay?

439
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,840
I think I'm so creative.

440
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,640
Who would know that

441
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,280
Si would be the first to get married?

442
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,240
If you're jealous, cheer up a bit.

443
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,000
Stop being sad about your breakup, okay?

444
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,600
Is Meizuo really sad?

445
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,360
This is called putting on a brave face

446
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,600
and crying at home when I'm alone.

447
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,160
Breakups are really sad.

448
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,200
You should save your tears.

449
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,240
Cry when Si gets here.

450
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,880
All right.

451
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,880
But why isn't Si here yet?

452
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,920
Shancai?

453
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,840
Shancai, what's wrong?

454
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,120
Daoming Si...

455
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,280
He won't be coming.

456
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,040
You mean,

457
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,320
Si and his mom didn't go to your house
to talk about your marriage?

458
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,640
No.

459
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,360
They said they would come this noon.

460
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,800
We prepared lunch.

461
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,880
But they didn't come at all.

462
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,200
I called Daoming Si and his mom picked up.

463
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,080
She said that...

464
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,760
she never wanted us to get married.

465
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,160
She's sending Daoming Si to London.

466
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,040
He's never coming back.

467
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,200
I'll call him.

468
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,480
Did Si already go to London?

469
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,960
No.

470
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,400
<i>Hello?</i>

471
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,800
Mrs. Yu? It's me, Ximen.

472
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,560
Why is it you who picked up the phone?

473
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,880
Si is too busy to pick up.

474
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,960
Mrs. Yu, what are you talking about?

475
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,600
We're holding him a bachelor party
and waiting for him to come.

476
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
I'm telling you one more time.

477
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,320
We're busy.

478
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,200
Si is busy.

479
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,000
<i>He can't pick up.</i>

480
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,960
Stop calling us.

481
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,600
Hello? Mrs. Yu?

482
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,920
Hello?

483
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,360
Starting today,

484
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,040
if anyone asks about Si,
don't say anything.

485
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,840
Don't pick up any phone calls.

486
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,960
Let the secretary do it.

487
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,360
Yes, ma'am.

488
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,560
Mrs. Daoming.

489
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Aren't you worried about Si?

490
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,880
Mrs. Yu sounded weird.

491
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,480
She didn't go to Shancai's house today.

492
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,800
That's her way of stalling.

493
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,640
She's stalling for time.

494
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,040
Stalling for time?

495
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,680
What is she trying to do?

496
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,240
Regardless, the most important thing is

497
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,320
to find Si.

498
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,000
How do we do that?

499
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,600
Mrs. Yu gave us a hint.

500
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,520
Si is at home.

501
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,920
What should we do?

502
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,880
We should go there to check it out.

503
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,520
I'll go with you.

504
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,240
We have to sneak in.

505
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,840
You shouldn't come.

506
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,840
When we find him, we'll let you know.

507
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,480
What should we do?

508
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,640
Same as usual. Go in from the back door.

509
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,560
Who is it?

510
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,240
What took you so long?

511
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,880
I knew it was Mrs. Yu.

512
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,800
We bumped right into her.

513
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,840
I distracted the security guards with tea.

514
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,760
I've been waiting for hours.

515
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,520
Come with me.

516
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,600
What happened to Si?

517
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,640
She locked him up.

518
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,760
Come on.

519
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,120
I thought that
since you have all graduated,

520
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,400
you wouldn't be so stupid.

521
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,000
Yet, you're sneaking into our house again.

522
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,400
Why does Si have
terrible friends like you?

523
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,960
Mrs. Daoming,

524
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,360
even if we're terrible,

525
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,160
we would never hurt our family members.

526
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,120
You're saying

527
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,640
that I'm hurting Si?

528
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,880
What are you doing right now then?
Are you pretending to be a nurse?

529
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,680
When can you finally grow up
and think like adults?

530
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,640
If you see us as adults,

531
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,520
you should respect Si and accept Shancai.

532
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,520
Do you respect me?

533
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,080
I couldn't let Si

534
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,800
be with someone whose background,
intelligence, and appearance

535
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,120
are so clearly beneath him.

536
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,480
I think Xiaozi is the best match for him.

537
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,960
Xiaozi, this one looks nice.
Do you want to try it?

538
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,840
Mom.

539
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,360
Why are we still trying on dresses?

540
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,920
I told you.

541
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,160
He doesn't like me.

542
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,120
It's Shancai that he likes.

543
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,080
There's no love between us.

544
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,680
How would we get married?

545
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,760
Xiaozi, you're both young.

546
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,800
But you can't be too impulsive.

547
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,040
The situation right now

548
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,760
is that you're both the successors
of huge business empires.

549
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,440
If you two get married,

550
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,200
it'll bring benefits to our families.

551
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,720
Is that all your care about?

552
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,520
Don't you like Si?

553
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,240
I do like him.

554
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,800
But he doesn't like me.

555
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,200
Xiaozi.

556
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,200
If you like Si,

557
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,400
this is your best chance.

558
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,800
What do you mean?

559
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,600
If this happened a few years earlier,

560
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,440
Daoming Feng wouldn't even
consider our family.

561
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,360
But now it's different.

562
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,120
For the past two years,
her hotel hasn't been doing well.

563
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,440
She needs your dad to save her business.

564
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,320
Your dad also needs this opportunity

565
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,880
to get more resources from Daoming Feng.

566
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,440
But what if I said

567
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,200
I don't like Si anymore?

568
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,840
Xiaozi.

569
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,760
-Don't lie.
-I'm not lying.

570
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,680
I just don't understand.

571
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,520
If working together benefits both parties,

572
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,280
why is marriage the only solution?

573
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,080
Why can't we just work together?

574
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,600
Because we can't trust Daoming Feng.

575
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,000
We can't trust her?

576
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,680
Daoming Feng has a very aggressive style.
She has many enemies in the market.

577
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,200
Why should we help her
without getting anything in return?

578
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,960
But if Si is part of our family,

579
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,720
it would be a different story.

580
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,240
Xiaozi.

581
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,360
if you don't want to marry him,

582
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,600
I won't force you to.

583
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,120
If Daoming Group goes out of business,

584
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,680
to our family,

585
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,840
it would just be a small hit.

586
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,680
Your dad has been doing
very well these years.

587
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,000
He can find other business partners
to work with.

588
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,520
But if Daoming Group crumbles,

589
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,360
Daoming Si will have nothing left.

590
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,680
He'll be just another guy.

591
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,120
Could you let that happen to him?

592
