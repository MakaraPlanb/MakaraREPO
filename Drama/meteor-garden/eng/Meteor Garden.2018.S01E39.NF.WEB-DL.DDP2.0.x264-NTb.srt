A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 39

3
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,160
This steak is so delicious.
How can it be this good?

4
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,040
I'm so happy today.

5
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,920
Every time I see you eat,
I feel like the food tastes even better.

6
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,520
They really taste good.

7
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,840
Out of all the girls I know,

8
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,440
nobody is as lively as you are
when they're eating.

9
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,600
Not my mom, my sister or Jing.

10
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,800
That's because you eat
on a really long table.

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Everybody just focuses on eating.
You can't see each other's expressions.

12
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,200
Of course it's not lively.

13
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,680
Then how should we eat?

14
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,120
The most ideal situation is
when eating the Chongqing hot pot.

15
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,160
Everyone surrounds the pot.

16
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,880
The food is just within reach.

17
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,520
Everyone's faces are so red and happy.

18
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,320
That sounds interesting.

19
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,760
Haven't you had hot pot before?

20
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,560
Nonsense. Of course I have.

21
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,800
But we each had our own pot.

22
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
Let's go eat hot pot next time.

23
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,600
Sure.

24
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,360
Are you full?

25
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,400
Yes.

26
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,680
Bill, please.

27
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,160
Please wait a moment.

28
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,800
Daoming Si.

29
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll pay for my share.

30
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,000
What are you talking about?
I'm treating my girlfriend.

31
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,960
Please enter your password.

32
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,680
Sorry, sir. Can you try again?

33
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,680
Sorry, sir. It still doesn't work.

34
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,920
Does your machine have a problem?

35
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,560
I have a suggestion.

36
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,760
We have an Ultimate Friday promo
for BOCOM credit cards.

37
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,800
Do you have one?

38
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,320
BANK OF COMMUNICATIONS

39
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,360
Let me pay.

40
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,960
Use mine.

41
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,280
PAY MERCHANT

42
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,840
All right.

43
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,080
She has started to take action.

44
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,880
My mom has started to take action.

45
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,960
Mobile payment doesn't work.
My credit cards might not work either.

46
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,000
This is not right.

47
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,320
It's impossible as well.

48
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,320
<i>The look on Daoming Si's face
completely changed.</i>

49
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,560
<i>But I won't take a step back this time.</i>

50
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,560
<i>I've made my decision.</i>

51
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,040
<i>No matter what happens,
I have to bravely move forward.</i>

52
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,080
Daoming Si.

53
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,560
No matter what happens after this,

54
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,960
I just want to treasure
every moment with you.

55
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,240
I won't be shaken by your mom.

56
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,920
Si's funds have been cut.

57
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,600
-Where are they now?
-We're not sure yet.

58
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,520
-Look for them immediately.
-Yes, ma'am.

59
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,960
-We're here.
-Yes.

60
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,280
Shoot.

61
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,760
-It's so much fun.
-Are you happy?

62
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,800
I haven't had so much fun in a long time.

63
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,520
It's good that you're happy.

64
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,720
It's getting late. I should go.

65
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
I'll take you home.

66
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,240
What should I make for lunch tomorrow?

67
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,160
I always have a hard time deciding.

68
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,960
You still make your own lunch?

69
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,080
Yes.

70
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,720
I'm used to eating something
I make myself.

71
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,240
By the way, should I cook for you too?

72
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,240
Sure. If you want to.

73
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,640
I'm used to eating
bad tasting food anyway.

74
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,400
Does the food I make taste bad?

75
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,520
All right.

76
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,360
See you at lunchtime
in the bridge room tomorrow.

77
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,200
I'll go inside.

78
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,960
Shancai.

79
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Kiss me.

80
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,800
Kiss you?

81
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,200
Now?

82
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,400
There's nobody here. Why not?

83
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,600
I'll do it next time.

84
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,200
Sometimes, there are no next times.

85
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,680
Why are you saying
something so unfortunate?

86
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,200
Okay, fine.

87
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,760
See you tomorrow.

88
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,880
Come out.

89
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,800
You don't seem to be
the usual bodyguards at my house.

90
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,280
CALLING: LEI

91
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
It's Si.

92
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,560
Hello?

93
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,120
<i>Please come with us.</i>

94
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,600
<i>This is your mother's command.</i>

95
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,880
DAOMING SI

96
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,920
<i>All right. I'll go with you.</i>

97
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,720
<i>But if you dare to hurt Dong Shancai,</i>

98
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,120
<i>I'd surely make you pay for it.</i>

99
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,280
<i>Shancai.</i>

100
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,920
Kiss me.

101
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,080
What should I make for Daoming Si's lunch?

102
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,400
I know.

103
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,240
I'll make him the Squid King's
grilled squid.

104
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,560
Why am I so clumsy?

105
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,000
<i>What's going on?</i>

106
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,120
<i>Didn't we agree to have lunch together?</i>

107
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,240
<i>It's already 12:30 p.m.</i>

108
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,440
Ximen?

109
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,960
Why are you here in school?

110
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,120
Why are you all here?

111
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,440
Did something happen?

112
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,800
Si temporarily left Mingde.

113
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,200
Left Mingde?

114
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,520
Yesterday, we still...

115
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,880
We think his mom found out about you two.

116
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,360
The reason why we came here is because Lei
received a strange phone call yesterday.

117
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,960
What kind of phone call?

118
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,360
Si called him yesterday
but didn't say a word.

119
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,120
We heard him telling someone
not to hurt you.

120
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,880
So we know something happened to Si.

121
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,680
DAOMING SI

122
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,040
<i>Please come with us.</i>

123
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,680
This is your mother's command.

124
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,040
All right. I'll go with you.

125
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,040
But if you dare to hurt Dong Shancai,

126
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,360
I'd surely make you pay for it.

127
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,360
Si must have called Lei
to let us know he's gone.

128
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,800
After this happened, I went to Si's house.

129
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,040
They said

130
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,480
that Si already went back to London.

131
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,040
<i>Went back to London?</i>

132
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
<i>Why did this happen?</i>

133
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,640
<i>Everything was fine yesterday.</i>

134
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,640
See you tomorrow.

135
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,080
I'll try calling Ms. Zhuang again.

136
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,440
I haven't been able
to reach her all morning.

137
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,200
If Ms. Zhuang knows what's happening,

138
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,720
she would've immediately
tried to contact us.

139
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,360
You know their family situation.

140
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,880
Ms. Zhuang cannot change
whatever Si's mom has decided.

141
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,920
Shancai.

142
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,880
So...

143
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,240
what do you plan to do?

144
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,920
Every single time,

145
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,000
it's Daoming Si
who has been protecting me...

146
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,160
and loving me.

147
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,520
I never did anything for him.

148
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,000
This time,

149
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,680
I won't just wait for him.

150
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,480
I'm going to London...

151
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,560
to fulfill our promise to each other.

152
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,520
Are you sure?

153
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,200
This is serious.

154
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,720
You're going to face Daoming Feng.

155
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,720
She can deport you from England
with a flick of her finger.

156
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,920
No one would be able to help you.
It might end badly for you.

157
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,000
I need to see Daoming Si
no matter what happens.

158
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,440
You're all here.

159
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
-Did you bring your passport?
-Yes.

160
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,360
Have you booked a place to stay?

161
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,280
I booked it in Airbnb.

162
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,240
I've already contacted the landlady.
It will be fine.

163
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,880
Shancai.

164
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,720
We came to see you off in person,
aren't we nice?

165
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,480
Meng Jiangnü brought down
the Great Wall with her tears.

166
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,840
You traveled a thousand miles
to look for your boyfriend.

167
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,200
What a nice tale.

168
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,000
Bring down the Great Wall with tears?

169
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Daoming Si's still alive.

170
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,200
By the way, Shancai,

171
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,960
we'll take care
of Xiaoyou and Qinghe's families.

172
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,880
No need to thank me.
I'm just naturally nice.

173
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,280
Don't use this chance
to take advantage of Xiaoyou.

174
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,160
All right.

175
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,000
My ride is here.

176
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,720
I need to get to the airport.

177
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,320
Thanks for coming.

178
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,560
Shancai.

179
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,520
Call us when you arrive.

180
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,720
Call us when you reach the place
you're staying at.

181
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,400
Also, call us when you see Si.

182
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,760
Okay.

183
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,240
Just try it.
How do you know it's not good?

184
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,840
Hurry up. My arm is aching.

185
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,560
You're so pushy.

186
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,200
Beg me.

187
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,280
Beg me and I'd consider staying
in Shanghai for you.

188
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,040
You'll stay if I beg you?

189
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,760
You silly girl.

190
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,720
Why are you so stupid?
You want me to say everything.

191
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,120
You're the stupid one here.

192
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,920
What do you want me to say?

193
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,320
You should say,

194
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,680
"Can you not go to London?

195
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,400
Can you go to graduate school
and wait for me to graduate?

196
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,600
Can you stay with me forever
after I graduate?"

197
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,840
Sleep beside me like this.

198
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,280
-What are you doing? Let go.
-No.

199
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,680
-Let go.
-No.

200
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,040
<i>If you want to run away,
I'll chase after you.</i>

201
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,400
<i>If you run to Mars,</i>

202
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,440
<i>I'll go there too.</i>

203
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,600
<i>I'm also thinking why loving someone
has to be so hard.</i>

204
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,320
<i>Why should I torture myself this way?</i>

205
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,960
<i>However...</i>

206
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,800
<i>Your determination
and perseverance moved me.</i>

207
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,720
<i>I'm not able to hate you.</i>

208
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
<i>This time,</i>

209
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,360
<i>I should also be ready
to fight for my future.</i>

210
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,360
<i>Now, it's my turn. Even if you go to Mars,</i>

211
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,040
<i>I'd surely come and find you.</i>

212
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,520
I must find Daoming Si.

213
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,640
Please let me find him.

214
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,640
Hello? Lei, I've already arrived.

215
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,800
I'm going to the rental home later.

216
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,840
Do you have all your luggage?

217
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,920
Yes. I checked before I left the airport.

218
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,920
How about your wallet?

219
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,160
It's in my bag. It's just within reach.

220
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,040
Also, don't lose your passport.

221
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,560
I placed my passport
in the inner part of my luggage.

222
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,760
Don't worry.

223
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,480
I'm afraid you'll get lost
before you even find Si.

224
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,840
Call me when you get
to the place you're staying.

225
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,080
The landlady already sent me the map.
I'll let you know when I get there.

226
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,320
Hey!

227
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,200
Stop!

228
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,480
Thief!

229
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,280
Hey!

230
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,080
Stop right there!

231
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,360
Hey!

232
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,720
Thief, stop!

233
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,080
Stop!

234
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,440
Hey!

235
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,320
Stop running!

236
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,480
Hey!

237
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,920
Hey!

238
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,240
Thief!

239
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,400
<i>What should I do?</i>

240
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,360
<i>Without the navigation map,</i>

241
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,720
<i>I won't be able to find
the place I'm staying at.</i>

242
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,600
LONDON CHINATOWN

243
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,480
EIGHT TREASURES SPICY NOODLES

244
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,600
For how many people?

245
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,680
I...

246
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,200
I...

247
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,080
Can you give me some water?

248
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,000
Of course. Yue, come here.

249
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,040
Please give this cute girl some water.

250
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,080
All right.

251
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,960
Be careful. It's hot.

252
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,360
-Thank you.
-Be careful. It's hot.

253
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,120
Drink slowly.

254
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,200
Are you all right?

255
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,400
Yes.

256
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,560
You look so pale.

257
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,000
One more, please.

258
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,600
What's your name?

259
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,680
My name is Dong Shancai.

260
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,880
Dong Shancai?

261
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
Yes.

262
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,600
What a familiar name.

263
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,040
Dong Shancai.

264
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,760
Because there was a very
popular series before.

265
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,520
The female lead's name was Shancai.

266
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,960
She lived happily ever after.
So my mom named me Shancai too.

267
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,200
I knew it. I saw that series too.

268
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,920
It was so popular then.

269
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,240
And many people told me
that I look like that female lead's mom.

270
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,720
What do you think?

271
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,800
Did you come to London alone?
For vacation?

272
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,320
No.

273
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,880
I came to look for someone.

274
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,880
Your boyfriend?

275
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,480
Yes.

276
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,160
He must be a very nice boy.

277
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,800
He is.

278
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,080
Sometimes, he's so nice
that I feel like I don't deserve him.

279
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,360
Goodness.

280
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,880
Why would you say that?

281
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,520
You look like a nice girl.

282
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,720
You also deserve to be happy.

283
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,240
Thank you, ma'am.

284
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,920
But why are you selling
Eight Treasures Spicy Noodles here?

285
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,760
Because I have a friend who likes it.

286
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,600
So I tried to make it for him.

287
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,760
I never thought my customers
would like it too.

288
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,080
So it became our signature dish.

289
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,280
Do you want some?

290
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,080
I do.

291
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
But...

292
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,720
But I...

293
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,240
Shancai.

294
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,880
Thomas.

295
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,840
Shancai.

296
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,440
Is he your friend? Your boyfriend?

297
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,600
Just a friend.

298
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,920
-I'll just go there, ma'am.
-Okay. I'll make it for you then.

299
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,960
All right.

300
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,240
Shancai. Why are you here?

301
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,040
It's such a coincidence.

302
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,600
Come here.

303
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,920
-Come here.
-Okay.

304
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,720
-You look really hungry.
-Yes.

305
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,640
Here.

306
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,720
This is our signature dish.

307
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,280
Eight Treasures Spicy Noodles.

308
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,480
-And some Yakult.
-Thank you.

309
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,160
Thank you, ma'am.

310
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,920
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

311
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,960
Everybody calls me Ms. Yue.

312
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,480
Just call me Ms. Yue.

313
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,120
Thank you, Ms. Yue.

314
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,480
Enjoy.

315
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,960
So you're here to look for Daoming Si?

316
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,000
Why did he just disappear
and stopped contacting you?

317
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,560
In Shanghai, he told me so fiercely,

318
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,920
"This is my woman."

319
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,880
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

320
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,280
<i>She's my woman. Don't touch her.</i>

321
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,480
I'm not sure either.

322
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,440
That's why I came to look for him.
I want to ask him face to face.

323
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,040
But...

324
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,560
my phone and my wallet
got stolen when I arrived.

325
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,720
I don't have any money with me.

326
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,680
It'll be all right.
What's important is that you're safe.

327
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,040
Good thing I saw you here.

328
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,840
Something came up
and my friends couldn't come.

329
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,280
But it's really good to see you.

330
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,240
Don't worry.

331
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,160
Calm down. Eat first.

332
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,960
Stay at my place tonight.

333
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,200
I'll help you look for Daoming Si.

334
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,520
You know where Daoming Si lives?

335
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,720
After I came here, I found out

336
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,800
that Daoming Si and his family
are very popular here.

337
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,520
We'll surely find him.

338
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,880
Thank you.

339
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,640
It's quite messy here.

340
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
I hope you don't mind.

341
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,840
This is where you live?

342
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,680
Yes.

343
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,720
I'm not sure who left
this old warehouse empty.

344
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,920
My musician friends and I
don't have money so we stayed here.

345
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,680
We don't need to pay rent.

346
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,200
It's quite nice.

347
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,840
Hey.

348
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,240
Can you lend me your laptop for a while?

349
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,160
I have to contact my friends in QZone.

350
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,400
Sure, no problem. Wait a moment.

351
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,840
-Feel free to use it.
-Thank you.

352
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,160
I forgot to pay the internet bill.

353
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,520
Goodness.

354
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,680
Then I've really lost contact
with the world.

355
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,920
-My housemates are here.
-Beer.

356
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,880
Shancai.

357
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,680
Hey!

358
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,720
You thieves!

359
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,080
Hey, stop!

360
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,480
They stole my wallet!

361
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,120
They said they already sold your phone

362
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,120
and bracelet.

363
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,800
They sold them?

364
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,600
But they bought beer and food.

365
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,000
Where's my wallet?

366
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,040
Your wallet's here.

367
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,920
This is what's left.

368
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,240
We'll think of something.

369
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,200
Don't be mad, Shancai.

370
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,560
Shancai.

371
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,360
-Shancai.
-Shancai. Hey.

372
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,160
-Shancai.
-Shancai.

373
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,640
Shancai.

374
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,480
<i>The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.</i>

375
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,240
<i>Please try again later.</i>

376
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,520
We lost contact with Shancai
after her message this afternoon.

377
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,760
She probably saw Si already.

378
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,840
Si must have been so touched.

379
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,080
Shancai, why are you here?

380
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,840
Si, I missed you so much.

381
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,640
I'd surely be with you
no matter where you go.

382
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,120
I have a bad feeling.

383
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,760
Don't worry.

384
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,040
Believe in the fighting spirit
of the weed.

385
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,520
Why does it feel like
the calm before the storm?

386
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,520
It seems Si's mom
had everything figured out.

387
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,600
So it went without a glitch this time.

388
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,680
I hope...

389
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,640
Si can come back safely.
