00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 24

3
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,280
All right. I'll stop laughing.

4
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,600
You're still laughing. Stop already.

5
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,600
Daoming Si.

6
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,680
Did you hear what one tourist said?

7
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,400
They said someone got scared
by the female ghost

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,800
and almost knocked her out.

9
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,240
Daoming Si.

10
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,400
You might've just topped
the Weibo's search hotlist.

11
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,240
What are you doing?

12
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,200
Shancai.

13
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
I'm a bit thirsty.
Should we buy some drinks?

14
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,600
Sure.

15
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,800
How about some cold beer?

16
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,880
Wait.

17
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,360
A goody-two-shoes like you
wouldn't drink beer, right?

18
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,120
Are you even old enough to drink beer?

19
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,840
I don't drink beer.

20
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
I'll have juice.

21
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,080
I'll buy it.

22
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,280
Let me do it.

23
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,640
A boy that eats a kid's meal

24
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,240
and can't drink beer

25
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,520
might just get lost.

26
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,440
I'll be back.

27
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,440
I'm going to the bathroom.

28
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,920
Sorry, Shancai.

29
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
It got kind of awkward.

30
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
It's okay.

31
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,000
He gets riled up easily.

32
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,720
But

33
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,440
you two were...

34
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,440
Well, ladies. It's on.

35
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,800
-See you at the bar tonight.
-Sure, I'll be there.

36
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,200
-Okay?
-See you there.

37
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,280
I'll make sure to dress up.

38
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,600
Do you see that guy?

39
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,840
-That's my lackey.
-So handsome.

40
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,320
-He came with me.
-So handsome.

41
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
All right, I'll talk to you again.
See you.

42
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,280
-Okay.
-Okay.

43
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,040
Do you think he'll come tonight?

44
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,560
-So handsome.
-Hey.

45
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,440
I got to meet those two ladies
in the queue.

46
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,360
They're pretty hot, right?

47
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
What are you saying?

48
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,280
I asked them out to the bar tonight.

49
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,520
Do you want to come?

50
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,840
You look pretty good.

51
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,760
How about I show you a good time?

52
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,240
I know what you're thinking.

53
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,800
The other two are so boring.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,320
We can just leave them.

55
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,920
What do you mean?

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,920
Wait.

57
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,400
Does your brain work?

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,320
Or does it not?

59
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,200
Don't you understand what I mean?

60
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,120
Do you know who you're talking to?

61
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,520
Dong Shancai's boyfriend.

62
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,880
Don't tell me you're going
to stick with one tree.

63
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,760
There's a whole forest out there.

64
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,680
You know what?

65
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,400
Your girlfriend is pretty pathetic.

66
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,440
When I first met her, I held her hand.

67
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,840
She was pretty excited about it.

68
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,880
Are you okay?

69
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,200
What's wrong with you?
Why did you hit him?

70
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,720
He got on my nerves.

71
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,000
If this is the date you wanted,

72
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
I'm never coming back.

73
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,280
And you.

74
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,720
Why did you pick a boyfriend
from the trash?

75
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,360
What is his deal?

76
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,240
Sorry.

77
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,560
That's the way he is.

78
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,320
His temper gets the better of him.

79
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,080
Easy for you to say.

80
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,440
He just hit me.

81
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,000
Keep your crazy boyfriend in check
instead of standing there.

82
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,400
That's enough.

83
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,600
Bullshit.

84
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,800
Where are you going?

85
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,360
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,080
Daoming Si.

87
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,520
Where is Daoming Si?

88
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,720
In the shower.

89
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,720
Hey, he's...

90
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Are you dumb?

91
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,880
She heard you and left.

92
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,160
Hey!

93
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,880
Hey.

94
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,440
You're the peeping Tom.

95
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,720
Stop playing the victim.

96
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,480
You better apologize.

97
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,360
To who?

98
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,200
Xiaoyou's boyfriend.

99
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,280
Why should I?

100
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,000
Why did you hit him then?

101
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,480
I hit him

102
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,320
because I was doing service
for his mother.

103
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,000
I went easy on him.

104
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,080
Why do I feel like something is off?

105
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,520
I thought they just had a date.

106
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,840
That was quick.

107
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,640
What did you say?

108
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
Only four days.

109
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,760
They haven't split yet.

110
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,280
What exactly happened?

111
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,920
I'm not going to tell you.

112
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,560
Can you be more reasonable?

113
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,360
I was furious.

114
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,240
So I hit him. Satisfied?

115
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,640
I'm angry.

116
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,960
Can I hit you?

117
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,240
That Xiaoqi is annoying.

118
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't like him either.

119
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,560
But you're not any better.

120
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,720
No matter what it is,

121
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,280
it's wrong to hit another person.

122
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,160
You need to apologize
for what you've done.

123
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,120
What have I done?

124
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,800
Did they break up?

125
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,000
That'd be great.

126
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,960
You really are a jerk.

127
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,240
I'm sick of you.

128
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,640
-You're unreasonable.
-You don't love me anymore.

129
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,280
Explain to me why you did it.

130
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,400
Listen to me.

131
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,960
I won't. You're just a liar.

132
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,520
-Fine then.
-I'm leaving.

133
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,840
-I'll kill you if you leave.
-Go ahead!

134
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
What are you guys doing?

135
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,640
Experiencing life.

136
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,760
Whatever.

137
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,520
Let me make it clear.

138
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,040
I've broken up with that jerk, Daoming Si.

139
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,920
Shancai.

140
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,000
Shancai.

141
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,000
What's wrong? Are you sick?

142
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,360
I'm fine.

143
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,240
Okay.

144
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,160
Let's go back to the passage.

145
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,840
Xiaoqi didn't come to school today.

146
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,160
Shouldn't you call him?

147
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
I did.

148
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,680
Nobody answered.

149
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,000
It's my fault.

150
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,320
I caused the rift between you two.

151
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I don't blame you.

152
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,680
If things got bad between us
only because of this,

153
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,560
our relationship won't last long.

154
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,520
Actually,

155
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,120
you also think that Xiaoqi
isn't a good guy, right?

156
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,040
I like him
so I make the effort to compromise.

157
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,520
I kind of let things pass.

158
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,760
Am I too blinded by love?

159
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,840
But I think
you should work hard with Daoming Si.

160
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,200
Actually,

161
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,760
Daoming Si and I

162
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,280
are pretty much over.

163
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Why?

164
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,400
He did hit Xiaoqi

165
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,680
and still seems hard to get along with.

166
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,760
But I can tell he really likes you.

167
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,000
I mean, he still came

168
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,480
even though he didn't want to.

169
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,280
He tried hard to be a part of us.

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,600
You've been in a bind over him,
haven't you?

171
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,440
Daoming Si is driving me crazy.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,600
Because of him,

173
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,880
I got pissed at the teacher
and students in class.

174
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,320
I don't feel like myself.

175
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,640
You're not yourself because of love.

176
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,040
Xiaoqi.

177
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,400
Stop it, Xiaoqi.

178
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,880
There are people here.

179
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,400
I don't see anyone.

180
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,880
There's nobody. You can come to my house.

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,400
-Come.
-Can I?

182
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,080
Won't your girlfriend be unhappy?

183
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,760
I don't care about her.

184
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,720
Listen.

185
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,960
Do you know how boring it is
to date a goody-two-shoes?

186
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,880
Every day, it's going to the library,

187
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,640
or visiting the park.

188
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,880
It's like watching paint dry.
Boring as hell.

189
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,320
Really?

190
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,440
Xiaoyou!

191
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,080
Zhang Ziqi.

192
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,600
Stop right there.

193
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,400
Wait for me at the store.

194
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,240
-Okay.
-I'll find you when I'm done.

195
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,120
-Zhang Ziqi.
-What?

196
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,400
What did you mean by that?

197
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,600
Who is Xiaoyou to you?

198
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,160
I was just being honest.

199
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,000
Any normal guy

200
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,960
would be tired of that pathetic girl.

201
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,480
It's been a week.

202
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,080
She wouldn't even let me kiss her.

203
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,640
Your boyfriend, Daoming Si,
is a weirdo too.

204
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,440
I introduced some pretty women to him
and he shot me down.

205
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,680
What I'm saying is,

206
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,640
it gets really tiring to be
with such rigid people.

207
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,320
If you're bored, come and find me.

208
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Trash.

209
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,880
You'd better stay away from Xiaoyou.

210
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,280
Otherwise, you'll be given
more than a mere beating.

211
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,680
Crazy woman.

212
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
You and your boyfriend are both crazy.

213
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,000
Xiaoyou.

214
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,720
This is Lavender Dingxiang Tea.

215
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
It will calm you.

216
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
How embarrassing.

217
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,920
I cried my eyes out
at the side of the road

218
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,480
and you saw me.

219
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
It's okay.

220
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,800
This is my house.

221
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,840
You can cry whenever you want.

222
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
No one's going to laugh.

223
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,800
Or maybe

224
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,120
you rather tell me what happened?

225
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
I'm sorry.

226
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,840
My luck has been terrible lately.

227
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,040
So terrible.

228
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,920
Is it because of your boyfriend?

229
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,440
I heard

230
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,480
that he had some beef with Si.

231
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,840
Today, I saw him with another girl.

232
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
He said

233
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,320
it was so boring to be with me.

234
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,560
It was like watching paint dry.

235
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,720
How could he say that about a cute girl?

236
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,000
He's awful.

237
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,320
No.

238
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,040
I think he's right.

239
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,320
The girl I saw today

240
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,080
is much prettier than me.

241
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,160
She's got a nicer voice.

242
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,560
She was all dressed up.

243
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,120
She has a nice body.

244
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,600
Chin up. Look at me.

245
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,240
Don't make such a terrible comparison.

246
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,920
You need to know that
you've got your own lovable traits.

247
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,320
You'll find someone better.

248
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,640
I have my own lovable traits.

249
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,960
I will find someone better.

250
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,000
See? How lovable.

251
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,840
Freshen up. Let's go.

252
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,000
It's okay. I can go back on my own.

253
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,720
I'm not taking you home.

254
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,880
I'm taking you to the piece of shit.

255
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,920
What are you going to do?

256
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Since he was so generous
to give you such a horrible experience,

257
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,400
we should teach him a lesson.

258
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,720
A guy like him has no respect for women.

259
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,320
Are you going to hit him?

260
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,240
If you want me to,

261
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,000
I can.

262
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,600
No. It's okay.

263
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,520
He must be taught a lesson
for what he's done.

264
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,160
Do we have to?

265
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,160
Even if you're breaking up,

266
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,680
you'll be the one smiling at the end.

267
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,840
Where does he usually go at this time?

268
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,840
He likes to go to a bar
called Guinness 288.

269
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,840
We're here.

270
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,040
Are you going to be okay?

271
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,080
Ximen, maybe we should forget about it.

272
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,480
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
when I see him.

273
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,680
I should leave.

274
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,320
He dumped you like it was nothing.

275
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Are you okay with that?

276
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,360
Of course I'm not.

277
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,320
It makes me so angry.

278
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,680
It's not healthy to keep
such pent-up frustration.

279
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,440
Let's go and take it all out.

280
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,200
Hello, Si.

281
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,720
There's someone here
who has no respect for women.

282
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,120
Do you want to meet him?

283
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,320
Hey, Qinghe.

284
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,360
Have you seen Xiaoyou?

285
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,000
No?

286
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,160
Okay.

287
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,560
It's nothing.

288
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,280
<i>Xiaoyou was never confrontational
even since in high school.</i>

289
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,520
<i>She always held it in
and let things passed.</i>

290
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,760
<i>I've never seen her angry.</i>

291
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,800
<i>I'm such a terrible friend.</i>

292
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,120
<i>I didn't like that guy very much.</i>

293
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,800
<i>I should've told her sooner.</i>

294
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,360
<i>Shancai.</i>

295
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,040
<i>I just saw your missed call.</i>

296
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,280
<i>I'm fine.</i>

297
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,280
<i>I'm at the bar on Julu Road.</i>

298
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,240
Do you see him?

299
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,800
He's there.

300
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,200
Hi.

301
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,400
Hi, hello.

302
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,120
-Who are you?
-You don't know him?

303
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,440
It's Ximen.

304
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,600
-Who?
-One of the F4 members of Mingde.

305
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,160
F4?

306
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,400
You don't know?

307
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,840
F4 is made up of four tall, handsome

308
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,120
and smart sons of business elites.

309
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,040
It has been a while.

310
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,240
It's crowded here,
but you caught my eye immediately.

311
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,080
It has been a while, Ximen.

312
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,200
Why didn't you call me again

313
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,040
after we met the last time?

314
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,600
I've been busy.

315
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,440
This plain-looking, squinty-eyed guy

316
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,040
isn't your boyfriend, is he?

317
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,520
-Of course not.
-No?

318
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,400
Why are we out on a date then?

319
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,720
You were pestering me to go out with you.

320
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,840
Oh, well.

321
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,160
My girlfriend is so much cuter and nicer.

322
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
You have a girlfriend?

323
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,760
Why? Do you have a problem with that?

324
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,800
Are you going to hit me?

325
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,200
You better not be rash.

326
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,920
Just try and hit me.

327
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,480
Ximen.

328
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,880
Should we go somewhere else?

329
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,520
Pretty girl, if you don't mind,

330
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,160
I'm going to take my girlfriend

331
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,120
and we can all go to a nice,
more high-end place.

332
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
No way.

333
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,680
Ximen has a girlfriend?

334
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,000
Xiaoyou?

335
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,920
What are you doing here?

336
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,360
She's my girlfriend.

337
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,600
Cute, isn't she?

338
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Why?

339
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Do you know him?

340
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,480
No, I don't.

341
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,840
I think he's from our school.
I've seen him around.

342
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,040
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

343
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,520
I came to find Xiaoyou.

344
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,840
I came to find Ximen.

345
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,400
Why are they together?

346
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,480
How should I know?

347
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,080
He's your friend, right?

348
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,480
She's your friend, no?

349
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,800
I get it.

350
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,080
This old-fashioned, stupid girl got dumped

351
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,200
and felt bad.

352
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,000
So you got someone to prank me?

353
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,280
You better take back what you said

354
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,720
and apologize to my girlfriend.

355
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,040
Apologize?
She should be the one apologizing.

356
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,440
Who's the one who organized

357
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
a double date.

358
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,080
She invited a good-for-nothing
lackey called Daoming Si.

359
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,640
He hit me.

360
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,160
Now she's got this mama's boy to show off.

361
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,560
You so-called F4

362
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,480
are just pathetic losers.

363
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,720
Who did you call a pathetic loser?

364
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,680
That's right, you.

365
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,440
And you.

366
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,280
Thanks.

367
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,440
This is a special Ballantine's Blast
for you.

368
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,200
I'm sorry about today.

369
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,120
Well? Feel better now?

370
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,000
Yes, much better.

371
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,560
I have no idea what I saw in him.

372
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,160
Thanks, guys.

373
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,520
You're welcome.

374
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,600
He didn't know his place.

375
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,080
How dare he provoke you guys?

376
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,440
Daoming Si gave him a good beating.

377
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,800
I didn't hit him.

378
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,000
I only gave him a massage.

379
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,840
When I saw him fooling around
with another girl,

380
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,880
I go so pissed that I hit him too.

381
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,960
Who was the dumb girl yesterday that said,

382
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,200
"No matter what,
it's wrong to hit another person."

383
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,760
-That's because...
-Now you're going to justify it?

384
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,160
That's because you wouldn't say anything.

385
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,960
So you're putting all the blame on me?

386
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,840
How dare you.

387
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,280
I don't understand those two.

388
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,280
They don't seem to be getting anywhere.

389
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,040
But I think
that Daoming Si likes Shancai a lot.

390
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,120
Let's go. We shouldn't bother them.

391
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,800
Hey.

392
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,920
Where are you two going?

393
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,120
Take care.

394
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,760
Ximen is probably taking Xiaoyou home.

395
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,160
Will it be okay?

396
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,520
Don't worry.

397
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,280
Ximen is not interested
in naive, cute girls.

398
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,440
-Really?
-He likes to go for hot girls.

399
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,200
Straight-forward girls
without much intelligence.

400
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,000
But Xiaoyou is very gullible.

401
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,160
I'm worried.

402
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,760
You're only concerned about others.

403
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,160
When are you going
to be concerned about us?

404
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,800
We're...

405
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,720
What about the dating time limit?

406
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,640
One month will be over soon.

407
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,320
It's not a month yet.

408
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,240
You know what?

409
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,080
There's an umbrella rental company.

410
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,760
The company invested
in an umbrella-sharing model.

411
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,520
It rented out 300,000 umbrellas.

412
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And after one month,

413
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,920
none of them came back.

414
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,480
You're still joking around.

415
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,520
To be honest,

416
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,920
I'm very anxious.

417
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,600
Since I got to know you,

418
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,240
despite countless confessions,

419
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,080
you never once gave me a definite answer.

420
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,160
Sometimes, even I wonder

421
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,520
if it's over between us.

422
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,720
Daoming Si.

423
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,120
I'm sorry.

424
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,840
I wrongly accused you.

425
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,560
I want to tell you

426
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,840
that I'm really thankful.

427
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,240
Daoming Si.

428
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,680
Let's make our relationship official.

429
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,120
I'm going to test you now.

430
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
What's the most important nutrient
needed by humans?

431
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,800
-Water.
-Reason?

432
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,240
Water helps maintain temperature.
It's the best solvent.

433
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,400
It has strong adhesion,

434
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,640
it maintains water...

435
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,240
Electrolyte balance.

436
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,520
Not bad.

437
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,200
My turn.

438
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,160
You're testing me?

439
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,640
Miss.

440
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,400
Don't forget I'm a top student.

441
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,760
Wow.

442
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,360
This topic seems really hard.

443
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,560
I'll pick this question.

444
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,480
What is the principle of Schumpeter theory
of creative destruction?

445
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,840
In an entrepreneurial life cycle,
one doesn't always remain an entrepreneur.

446
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,560
Unless he continues to evolve

447
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,600
and create new formations,

448
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,080
which means to destroy the old,
creating the new.

449
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,280
Because with every depression,

450
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,480
there's a possibility to gain new skills.

451
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,720
It becomes a new product, skill,

452
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,320
or business model

453
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,840
to bring the most benefit.

454
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,880
Wow.

455
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,720
You're incredible.

456
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,200
Not bad, right?

457
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,960
Since I did so well,

458
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,880
do I get any reward?

459
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,760
What do you mean?

460
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,320
What kind of reward?

461
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,240
What reward can you give me?

462
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,200
Are you asking for a free meal?

463
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,520
Okay. I'll take you to Rabbit Hole.

464
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,080
Rabbit Hole?

465
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,480
With rabbit meat?

466
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,640
Of course not.

467
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,520
It's my favorite snack shop.

468
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,960
What a lousy reward. No thanks.

469
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,840
Come on.

470
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,320
How about...

471
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,160
this kind of reward?

472
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,640
No.

473
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,040
Go read your book.

474
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
All right.

475
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,640
What a coincidence.

476
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,600
What a surprise to see you here.

477
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,160
I'm surprised you like Li Quan's recital.

478
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,120
I should be asking you.

479
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,240
How did you end up in the seat
right beside mine?

480
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,520
I don't think it was a coincidence.

481
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,760
It wasn't?

482
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,640
Let me ask you.

483
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,840
Where did you get your ticket?

484
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,320
My ticket?

485
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,000
I asked a friend who helped
get me the good seat.

486
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,080
You?

487
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
Not me.

488
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,840
I got my ticket from the pianist.

489
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,080
You know Li Quan?

490
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,480
Of course.

491
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,880
My family organized this recital.

492
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,680
We have connections.

493
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm going to look for my old friend.

494
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,040
See you.

495
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,880
Hey! Wait.

496
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,040
What is it?

497
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,240
Can you take me with you?

498
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,480
Miss.

499
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,560
You're asking me to take someone

500
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,040
who is suspicious of me
to see an old friend.

501
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,840
Isn't that unreasonable?

502
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,800
Well...

503
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,840
Sorry.

504
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,800
What did you say?

505
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,080
I didn't hear you.

506
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,440
I'm sorry.

507
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,440
Meizuo.

508
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,760
Why isn't Huaze Lei here?

509
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,760
Hi, sir.

510
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,320
Huaze Lei is busy preparing
for the Juilliard exam.

511
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,800
Sir.

512
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,280
Can I introduce you to a friend?

513
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,360
This girl here really loves your music.

514
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,320
Hi, Mr. Li Quan.

515
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,720
I'm honored to meet you.

516
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,440
I've been a great fan of your music.

517
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,840
Thanks.

518
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
Is she...

519
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
your girlfriend?

520
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,840
Well...

521
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,720
Yes. She's my girlfriend, Zhou Caina.

522
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,360
Thank the teacher.

523
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,320
Thank you, sir.

524
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,200
Sir,

525
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,240
my girlfriend has been a long-time fan.

526
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,640
It's so rare for you to have
a performance here,

527
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,920
so she's been bugging me
to let her meet you.

528
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,400
Yes.

529
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,200
Mr. Li Quan, can I take a photo with you?

530
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,480
Sure.

531
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,000
I'll take it.

532
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,080
Hey, girlfriend, come closer.
You're blocking the teacher.

533
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,360
You did that on purpose, right?

534
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,720
If I brought some random girl
to see Mr. Li,

535
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,360
he'd probably think
I'm being disrespectful.

536
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,080
Anyway, thank you.

537
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,520
-Remember to send me the photos.
-Okay.

538
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,240
Does that mean you're going
to add me on WeChat?

539
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,600
Adding you on WeChat
is not a big deal, right?

540
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,840
So you're telling me not to overthink.

541
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
What could a little boy think about?

542
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,400
This little boy is different from others.

543
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,280
First, he's a joker
and he'll make you laugh.

544
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,840
No matter where, he'll protect you.

545
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,920
In addition,

546
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,680
he's can talk to you about anything,
including music,

547
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,920
food or other interests.

548
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,040
Most importantly,

549
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,920
this little boy is very handsome.

550
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,680
So why don't you consider

551
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,560
being this little boy's girlfriend?

552
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,880
Don't turn me down so quickly.

553
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,920
I'm giving you time to think.

554
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,440
In the Bible, it's stated that

555
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,560
people who are destined to be together

556
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,000
will not be kept apart.

557
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,680
Which scripture is that?

558
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,040
Additional scripture.

559
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,040
All right.

560
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,320
It's a coincidence that we met today.

561
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,880
If we meet again,

562
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,320
I'll believe in destiny.

563
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,200
UNNUMBERED SEAT NAME LIST

564
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,600
"Zhou Caina."

565
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,320
Switch this Zhou Caina

566
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,640
to the best seat in the VIP zone.

567
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,960
Okay.

568
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,960
Why wait for next time?

569
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,400
Leaving straight away after taking a photo

570
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,960
is a little rude, right?

571
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,240
You should at least treat me to a drink.

572
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,920
If you can return this favor
with a glass of wine,

573
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,280
then sure.

574
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,480
I never ask for much.

575
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Why aren't you drinking?

576
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,760
No need to be shy.

577
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,600
I'm not.

578
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,640
-I'm just...
-Just what?

579
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,760
Okay.

580
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,320
I'll tell you a little secret.

581
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,800
I kind of lose my mind whenever I drink.

582
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,480
The next day,
I wake up not remembering anything.

583
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,280
Is that why you're worried?

584
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,600
Just drink.

585
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,840
If you get drunk,

586
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,000
I'll be a gentleman
and take you back safely.

587
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,200
-You promise?
-I promise.

588
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,560
I'll drink then.

589
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,520
One more glass.

590
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,360
Me too.

591
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,000
All right.

592
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,120
Do you know which letters
of the 26 English alphabet

593
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,600
is my favorite?

594
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,760
You better not tell me

595
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,720
that you like "u" and "i" the most.

596
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,960
That's such an old Internet gag.

597
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,680
I just wanted to hear it

598
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,640
from your own mouth,

599
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,040
"I like you and I."

600
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,080
That's all.

601
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,680
You really are adorable.

602
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,760
Cheers.

603
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,280
There won't be any "better you and I."

604
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,280
Because I'm going back to the States.

605
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,840
But you just got back.

606
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,520
I don't really have a reason to stay.

607
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,600
Can I be the reason for you to stay?

608
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,360
A young man is giving his commitment?

609
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,200
No matter what,

610
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,080
meeting me is the start of your happiness.

611
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,760
To your future.

612
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,640
Cheers.

613
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,760
I like it.

614
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,320
Meeting you is the start of my happiness.

615
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,160
Let's toast to our future.

616
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,160
Do you dance a lot back in the States?

617
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,080
Sure. I'm a good dancer.

618
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,480
-Come, let's dance.
-No, you go ahead.

619
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,600
Are you drunk?

620
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,080
-I'll take you home.
-I'm not drunk.

621
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,280
Show me five fingers.

622
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,560
-Your five fingers.
-Five.

623
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,760
Am I right?

624
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,800
Five fingers.

625
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,480
That's the most magical number right now.

626
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,840
Why is five the most magical number?

627
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,800
Do this and the magic will come.

628
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,920
It has been a while, Caina.

629
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Hi.

630
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,280
It has been a while.

631
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,440
-Is he someone you know?
-Yes.

632
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,320
Your friend?

633
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,920
My friend.

634
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,400
I'm Meizuo.

635
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,400
And you are?

636
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,480
Terence.

637
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,040
Terence.

638
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,840
Caina, is this old man your friend?

639
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,640
Him?

640
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,720
He was a summer-break boyfriend.

641
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,080
Summer-break boyfriend?

642
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,880
Weixun.

643
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,440
Give me more wine.

644
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,600
-More wine.
-Okay.

645
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,480
Listen, man.

646
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,400
I promised Caina to take her home.

647
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,560
Allow me.

648
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,920
-Do you know where she lives?
-I...

649
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,480
She'll tell me.

650
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,880
How will she do that when she's so drunk?

651
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,120
I brought her here.

652
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,800
So? Are you two close?

653
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,160
It's none of your business.

654
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,960
It hurts.

655
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,320
It hurts.

656
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,200
Sir!

657
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,560
Your coconuts!

658
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,880
Sir, you dropped your coconuts!

659
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,280
Sir, your coconuts fell off.

660
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,560
It's you again.

661
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,960
A sad face.

662
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,480
Hey.

663
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,040
Weixun.

664
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,640
Give me more wine.
