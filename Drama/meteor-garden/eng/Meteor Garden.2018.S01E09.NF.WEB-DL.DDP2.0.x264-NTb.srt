A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 9

3
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,720
Impossible.

4
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,840
Why would Lei be with Shancai?

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,240
Si must have misunderstood
and gotten angry.

6
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,200
We're buddies.

7
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,160
Why don't we ask Lei about it?

8
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,240
That may solve everything.

9
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,800
Everyone,

10
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,240
take out the lecture notes
for HR management.

11
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,440
Let's start the class.

12
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,320
Where is Daoming Si?

13
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,080
He isn't feeling well today,
so he's absent.

14
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,760
The notes last time...

15
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,920
Oh, sure. You can borrow it.

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,320
-Okay, thanks.
-No worries.

17
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,440
Lei.

18
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,680
-Let's talk.
-It's Lei.

19
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,240
You know something?

20
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,560
He's seeing Shancai.

21
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,920
-Really?
-Yeah.

22
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,720
Lei.

23
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,280
You know Si likes Shancai a lot, right?

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I know.

25
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,240
What is there to talk about?

26
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,160
Huaze Lei.

27
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,600
What is going on?

28
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,640
Are you really dating Shancai?

29
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,600
No way, right?

30
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,720
You wouldn't do something
to hurt your friend.

31
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,520
Lei, have you lost your mind
after losing Jing?

32
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,800
You could've gotten any another girl.

33
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,480
-You know Shancai is Si's--
-Ximen!

34
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,800
Si.

35
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,320
Lei, listen carefully.

36
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,480
From today onward,
you are no longer my friend!

37
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,480
Si.

38
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,080
Are you really going to kill
our friendship over a girl?

39
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,400
I'm not the one who killed our friendship.

40
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,120
It was Huaze Lei.

41
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Si, don't do this.

42
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,640
Hey, did you have notes
from our last class?

43
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,560
Yes.

44
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,400
Can I take a look at it?

45
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,560
I was busy with work.

46
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,520
Sure, no problem.

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,120
What's wrong with Daoming Si?
Did you two have a fight?

48
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,560
Let's go.

49
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,120
-Want some?
-Sure.

50
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,080
Here.

51
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Daoming Si.

52
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,880
It looks like him, right?

53
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,240
That must be how he's looking right now.

54
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,320
No.

55
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,040
I think something is missing.

56
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,120
His eyebrows are thicker, like earthworms.

57
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,960
Not to mention,
he must be so angry right now.

58
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,480
We need to make him look fierce.

59
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,000
That looks like him.

60
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,440
What can I say?

61
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,600
I know his angry face all too...

62
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,560
Sorry.

63
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,480
Why are you sorry?

64
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,600
If I didn't go looking for you
on the beach,

65
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,760
none of this would've happened.

66
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,480
You and Daoming Si would still be friends.

67
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,560
It's all my fault.

68
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,240
I kissed you because I wanted to.

69
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,400
So, it's my fault.

70
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,440
Let's go on a date on Sunday.

71
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,520
A date?

72
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,920
Honey.

73
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,720
I'm struggling to make a decision.

74
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,120
Should I use the whitening one
or the moisturizing one?

75
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,800
Is this worth struggling over?

76
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,840
Use the whitening product
during daytime for glowing skin.

77
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,080
Use the moisturizing product at night
to replenish moisture.

78
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,320
Good idea. I'll use this.

79
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,080
Shancai, you look nice today.
Are you going on a date?

80
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,040
I'm going out with a friend.

81
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,400
Is it Daoming Si?

82
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,520
No.

83
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,480
Who is it then?

84
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,720
A guy or a girl? How old?
Are they from your school? Which year?

85
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,720
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

86
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,840
Try us.

87
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,280
We'll know once you tell us.

88
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,520
You're right.

89
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,080
Follow me.

90
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,440
I'm coming.

91
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,920
You are...

92
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,880
Sir, ma'am. Nice to meet you.
I'm Huaze Lei.

93
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,120
Shancai's schoolmate.

94
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,200
This boy looks so adorable.

95
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,000
He has such fair skin, big eyes,
double eyelids, and a sharp nose.

96
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,760
You don't look like a typical Chinese guy.

97
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,560
I wonder how your parents look.

98
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,200
He's got such delicate features.

99
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,000
A lot like me when I was younger.

100
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,320
It's getting late. We need to go.

101
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,760
Bye, sir, ma'am.

102
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,680
Bye.

103
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,720
Go.

104
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,200
Hurry up.

105
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,720
Our daughter is just like me.

106
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,560
She's attracting all the right men.

107
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,800
One seems like a domineering CEO,
Daoming Si.

108
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,960
The other, a pretty and gentle boy,
Huaze Lei.

109
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,080
They're both great options.

110
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,040
Sure.

111
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,920
You attracted all the right men.

112
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,160
That's why you got me.

113
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,200
You were the least among all my options.

114
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
Sorry about that.

115
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,360
My parents are overly friendly.

116
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,680
I hope they didn't scare you.

117
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,160
Not at all. I think they're very cute.

118
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,160
You're dressed a little differently today.

119
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,320
Is it weird?

120
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,720
No, you look good.

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,360
I overslept today,
so I just put these on and ran out.

122
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,240
Where do you want to go?

123
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,680
Any place in mind?

124
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,720
I don't know. How about you?

125
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,200
I don't know either.

126
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
How about...

127
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,040
this restaurant I always go to?

128
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,280
Let's go eat.

129
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,800
Okay. Fine with me.

130
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,080
Whatever you want.

131
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
<i>Oh no.</i>

132
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,960
<i>This is so awkward.</i>

133
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,920
<i>Huaze Lei isn't saying anything.</i>

134
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,360
<i>Should I think of a topic to discuss?</i>

135
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,760
Huaze Lei.

136
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,960
Do you remember that spot?

137
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,120
Jing's poster was there before.

138
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,520
You were looking at Jing so intently.

139
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,440
-And then--
-Shancai.

140
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Don't talk about Jing.

141
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,520
Sorry. I shouldn't have brought her up.

142
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,800
It's okay. Let's go.

143
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
<i>Dong Shancai, you're an idiot.</i>

144
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,640
<i>Huaze Lei is obviously trying hard
to forget about Jing.</i>

145
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,680
<i>Why did you have to bring her up?</i>

146
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
Shancai.

147
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,360
This is the first time I'm on
a real date with a girl.

148
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,120
If I make you bored, I apologize.

149
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,040
Now that I think about it,

150
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,200
apart from Si and the guys,

151
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,880
I don't have many friends.

152
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,080
I guess I'm a social outcast.

153
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,160
I don't think so.

154
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
I think

155
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,080
you have the best personality
among the F4 guys.

156
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,760
Besides,

157
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,320
you're cool and laidback.

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,560
So if you wanted to,

159
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,640
you'd make many new friends.

160
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,720
Wasn't that funny?

161
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,640
It was a pun.

162
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,360
You know, you're "laid" back.

163
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,040
Like Lei. Laid.

164
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,200
Never mind. I guess it wasn't funny.

165
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,600
I like hearing you say my name.

166
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,040
Lei.

167
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,000
Lei.

168
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,440
Lei.

169
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
Lei...

170
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,360
Sorry.

171
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,960
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

172
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,000
Why are you panting?

173
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,920
No reason.

174
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,280
No reason.

175
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,520
It's spicy.

176
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,720
This Thai restaurant is good and cheap.

177
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,640
Especially this dish,
the Thai-style beef salad.

178
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,000
Do you want to try it?

179
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,480
You don't like Thai food?

180
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,360
I can't really eat spicy food.

181
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,840
I'm sorry.

182
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,000
I should've been more considerate.

183
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,160
I should've asked you
what you like to eat.

184
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,960
It's okay. As long as you like it.

185
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,160
Why don't we order something less spicy?

186
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,000
It's okay. I'm not that hungry.

187
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,560
It's really spicy.

188
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,760
Shancai.

189
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,240
That's for washing your hands.

190
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,040
You're so funny.

191
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,680
Are you still hungry?

192
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,160
Here, you can have mine too.

193
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,360
Here you go.

194
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,800
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

195
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,760
What?

196
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,160
That's how the date ended?

197
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,080
Yeah.

198
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,360
It was almost time for work,
so I hurried over here.

199
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,520
My goodness.

200
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,680
What kind of a date was that?

201
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,080
It doesn't sound romantic at all.

202
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,440
I know.

203
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,040
Weirdly enough, it was so awkward.

204
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,200
I get so nervous
when I'm around Huaze Lei.

205
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,880
I become so self-conscious.

206
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,000
How about Si?

207
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,320
Him?

208
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,320
You two dated before, right?

209
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,680
Do you get self-conscious around him?

210
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,400
We weren't dating.

211
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,480
But...

212
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,520
Now that you mention it,

213
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,080
I think I am more myself
when I'm with him.

214
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,040
But that's because
I don't have feelings for him.

215
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,280
That's why we're always arguing.

216
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,000
He's so self-centered
and always pissing people off.

217
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,480
I don't have time to worry about
looking stupid or lame.

218
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,000
Which means,

219
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,640
you feel more self-conscious
when you're with Huaze Lei.

220
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,960
That's because...

221
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,760
It's because I want to show him
the best side of me.

222
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,520
That's why I'm self-conscious.

223
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,240
The more I care, the more nervous I get.

224
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,600
The more nervous I am,
the more anxious I get.

225
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,920
When you like someone,
is feeling attracted to them so important?

226
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,040
Isn't feeling at ease around them
more important?

227
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,600
Next time you give me your clothes,
at least make it an expensive one.

228
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,760
It's getting cold. Put it on.

229
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,040
No.

230
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,320
Calm down.

231
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,800
The one I like is Lei, not Si.

232
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
Hey!

233
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,280
-Watch out.
-Ma'am.

234
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,760
Watch where you're going! Are you blind?

235
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,760
Hey!

236
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,080
How unreasonable can you get?

237
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,520
Watch where you're going!

238
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,080
You knocked her down.

239
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,200
Take her to the hospital.

240
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,720
What the hell?

241
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,640
It's not my problem that she can't see.

242
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,840
Stay right there!

243
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,720
-Take her to the hospital.
-Get off me!

244
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,640
Hey.

245
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,520
-You're asking for it.
-You don't scare me.

246
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,520
How dare you pick on a girl?

247
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,200
You call yourself a man?

248
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,320
Go and apologize!

249
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,760
-Take her to the hospital, do you hear me?
-Okay, I will.

250
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,560
Sorry about that. Are you okay?

251
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,240
We're going. Bye.

252
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,440
Are you okay?

253
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,760
I'm fine. Thank you.

254
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,880
Your hand is bleeding. How is this fine?

255
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,680
Let's get it treated at my house.

256
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,920
It's okay. I can clean the wound myself.

257
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,840
No.

258
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,080
-This is bad. Come to my house.
-It's really okay.

259
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,200
Hush.

260
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,680
We'll treat it at my house.

261
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,680
This is bad. You can't do it yourself.

262
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,440
<i>Why did this lady bring me to Si's house?</i>

263
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
<i>What's her relationship with him?</i>

264
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,840
<i>Oh no. If I see Daoming Si here...</i>

265
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,320
Miss, this is just a small wound.

266
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
-I can treat it myself.
-No.

267
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,840
It's not fine. It's still bleeding.

268
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,720
Don't worry.

269
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,280
Make yourself comfortable.

270
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,480
I'm Daoming Zhuang.

271
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,800
Just call me Ms. Zhuang.

272
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,520
<i>She's Daoming Si's older sister?</i>

273
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,240
You look pale.

274
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,440
We need to get this treated.

275
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,840
Mr. Liu, I'm back.

276
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,720
Ms. Zhuang, welcome back.

277
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,320
Ms. Shancai?

278
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,120
You know her?

279
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,320
Ms. Shancai goes to the same school as Si.

280
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,520
What a coincidence.

281
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,800
No need to be so awkward then.

282
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,840
Mr. Liu, bring me the first aid kit.

283
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,240
-And call Si to come greet her.
-Okay.

284
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,200
Wait!

285
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,960
Ms. Zhuang.

286
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,800
I just remembered
I've got something to do.

287
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,920
-I need to--
-No.

288
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,680
Mr. Liu, clean her wound.

289
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,800
You don't seem to understand my orders.

290
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,720
This way.

291
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,320
<i>Maybe I should sneak out right now.</i>

292
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,400
Daoming Si.

293
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,600
Why are you here?

294
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,040
This is just a coincidence.

295
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,040
Coincidence?

296
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,200
Did you come to brag
about your new boyfriend?

297
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,520
No, I'm not.

298
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,360
Don't get me wrong.

299
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,840
Stop pretending, Shancai.

300
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Who do you think you are?

301
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,280
I'm not sad at all.

302
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,080
I'm already over you.

303
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,720
You're hurting me.

304
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,440
Is that how you speak to a girl?

305
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,520
You're embarrassing our family.

306
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,400
Are you okay?

307
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,960
I'm fine.

308
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,640
Zhuang, when did you come back?

309
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,240
What? Can't I come home?

310
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,520
You haven't seen me in a while.
Didn't you miss me?

311
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,480
I did. I video call you
all the time, don't I?

312
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,960
You only tell me useless stuff.

313
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,360
So what?

314
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,480
I'm going to treat this girl's wound.

315
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,320
Wait...

316
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Not bad, right?

317
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,160
-Thanks, Ms. Zhuang.
-You're welcome.

318
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,480
Si used to get into fights
and got injured all the time,

319
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,000
and I'd treat his wounds.

320
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Why am I not surprised?

321
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,600
You must be hungry.

322
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,000
Stay for dinner.

323
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,000
No, I don't want to trouble you.

324
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,000
What do you mean?

325
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,800
If I say we're having dinner,
that's what we'll do.

326
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,360
<i>This family produces domineering children</i>

327
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,400
<i>like a production line.</i>

328
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,280
<i>They're exactly the same.</i>

329
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,680
Si said he has an important report
to finish for school,

330
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,120
so he went out.

331
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,880
Did I hear correctly?

332
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,320
He isn't going to eat with me?

333
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,600
He's going to get a beating
when he gets home.

334
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,160
You may leave.

335
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,640
Shancai.

336
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,720
Drink with me.

337
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,920
I...

338
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,280
Okay. I'll drink a little bit.

339
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,320
Just this glass. Come on.

340
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,680
Ms. Zhuang.

341
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,640
There's something

342
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,160
-I want to tell you.
-Go ahead.

343
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,600
Actually,

344
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,520
not long ago,

345
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,200
Daoming Si asked me out.

346
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,520
I did something

347
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,400
very terrible.

348
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,480
I hurt him.

349
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,640
I caused him to turn against Huaze Lei.

350
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,120
It's fine that he's angry with me.

351
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,560
It's my own fault.

352
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,040
I'm the one to blame.

353
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,400
That's why

354
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,880
I feel really terrible

355
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,160
that I'm sitting here.

356
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,240
Huaze Lei?

357
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,240
Yes.

358
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,720
-I really--
-Hey. Speak up. I can't hear you.

359
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,960
I really don't want to see
Daoming Si sad and hurt.

360
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,440
A person like me...

361
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,200
is no good to begin with.

362
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,200
That stupid girl.

363
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,840
She didn't learn her lesson
after getting drunk last time.

364
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,440
Si.

365
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,040
Is she your girlfriend?

366
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,160
A schoolmate.

367
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,640
This schoolmate of yours
is pretty special.

368
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,720
She's got a sense of justice like I do.

369
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,160
An old lady was being bullied.

370
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,720
She and I stood up to the man
that was bullying her.

371
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,120
She's a loser herself,

372
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,880
but she fights for others.

373
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,360
Who?

374
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,200
Her, of course.

375
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,440
Zhuang, your kicks hurt, okay?

376
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,240
Do you miss the days
when I used to beat you up?

377
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,800
Why would I?

378
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,680
By the way,

379
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,320
how's her hand?

380
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,480
Why? Are you concerned?

381
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,560
Of course not.

382
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,520
I don't care at all.

383
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,280
Si.

384
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,960
Carry her to the guest room.

385
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,760
No! Why should I carry her?

386
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,240
You brought her here.

387
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,920
Just do as I say.

388
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,720
You can't expect me to carry her.

389
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,880
This is an order.

390
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,320
Zhuang.

391
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,800
<i>She's as heavy as a pig.</i>

392
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,680
<i>What a pain.</i>

393
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,880
<i>How can she fall asleep right now?</i>

394
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,480
That's what happened with Shancai.

395
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,160
I see.

396
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,480
So she's the reason
Si looks like a zombie.

397
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,560
Why does he always make people worry?

398
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,760
Here.

399
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,840
The honey water will help your hangover.

400
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,080
Thanks, Ms. Zhuang.

401
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,880
Sorry. I always fall asleep
when I'm drunk.

402
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,480
-It's okay. You can sleep if you want.
-No.

403
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,400
Shancai.

404
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,280
I hope you'll reconsider Si.

405
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,800
-Ms. Zhuang. You must be mistaken.
-I know.

406
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,000
-You know?
-Yes.

407
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,240
Mr. Liu told me.

408
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,280
I could guess your relationship.

409
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,800
You know what?

410
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,480
You're the first girl Si brought home.

411
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,680
You must think that Si's a playboy,

412
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,920
but he's actually clueless about love.

413
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,840
I know he's a snob.

414
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,320
That's because our parents
were always busy running the business.

415
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,960
They had no time to teach Si and me.

416
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,960
We got to do whatever we wanted.

417
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,920
When we're mad, we vent at other people.

418
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,200
That's why the two of us are so obnoxious.

419
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,160
Other than Ximen,

420
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,400
Meizuo, Huaze Lei,

421
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,560
Si has never made other friends.

422
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,920
I'll give you these if you play with me.

423
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,200
I'll give you these if you play with me.

424
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,760
Play with me and each of you gets a ball.

425
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,240
For free.

426
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,680
You must be dumb, Daoming Si.

427
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,640
<i>To be frank, he didn't know
how to interact with people.</i>

428
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,960
<i>The more people avoided him,
the more he acted out in anger.</i>

429
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,280
I was much too young then.

430
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,520
I didn't know how to teach him
apart from scolding and hitting him.

431
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,960
Shancai.

432
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,840
Si is actually a kind person.

433
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,040
He's not mean at all.

434
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,880
He just doesn't know
how to express himself.

435
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,240
Actually, he's just a big kid
that wants to be loved.

436
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,200
<i>I'm not trying to force you two together.</i>

437
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,840
<i>But I can tell</i>

438
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,240
<i>that you do care about him.</i>

439
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,320
<i>So I hope</i>

440
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,720
<i>you'd think about it some more.</i>

441
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,240
Lei.

442
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,520
Who said you could talk to him?

443
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,120
Si.

444
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,040
How long are you going to keep this up?

445
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,160
Yeah, Si. Stop with the grudge.

446
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,240
We can't just disband F4 like this.

447
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,200
Shancai!

448
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,080
Shancai.

449
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,440
Shancai, I brought some bananas from home.

450
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,120
What's wrong?

451
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,400
I didn't bring extra for you guys.

452
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,840
Who said the F4 is disbanding?

453
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,840
He'll be the new F4 member.

454
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,000
What?

455
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,160
Shancai.

456
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,840
Did you hear what Si just said?

457
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,440
I'm going to be part of F4.

458
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,040
Also,

459
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,320
you're forbidden to talk to them.

460
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,400
That's impossible.

461
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,080
Shancai is my best friend.

462
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,440
She's a friend of F4 too, right?

463
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,320
Si.

464
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,800
How could you be so heartless?

465
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,360
What?

466
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,160
I'm going to do everything I can
to make them suffer.

467
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,480
That's what they get for hurting me.

468
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,680
Si, if you go on like this,
our friendship will go up in smoke.

469
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,960
I couldn't care less.

470
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,480
What kind of friendship is this?

471
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,440
Since no one cares, let's just disband.

472
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,880
Si.

473
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,560
Are you done?

474
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,960
I'm disappointed in you.

475
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,880
You people have made me more disappointed.

476
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,760
Stop it, you guys.

477
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,080
The friendship between the four of us
should outweigh everything.

478
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,800
Why has it come to this?

479
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,080
Why?

480
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,760
Is it my fault?

481
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,120
It's your fault, Lei.

482
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,240
Si.

483
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,920
Just deal with me alone.

484
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,800
Very well.

485
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,440
I will.

486
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,280
Wait.

487
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,040
I'll say two things.

488
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,760
And then I'll go.

489
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,280
You have one left.

490
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,200
What happened is my fault.

491
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,400
It's fine if you won't forgive me,

492
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,760
but I will still apologize.

493
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,960
I'll take responsibility.

494
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,760
But you and Lei
have been friends since childhood.

495
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,760
I hope you won't give up
on your friendship because of me.

496
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,960
You were bullied many times,

497
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,960
but you never backed down.

498
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,400
Yet you're apologizing to me
because of him.

499
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,800
Do you care that much about him?

500
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,160
Fine.

501
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,240
You want to take responsibility?

502
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,920
Yes.

503
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,800
As long as you let Lei go.

504
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,320
Daoming Si.

505
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,200
If you want to punish someone,

506
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,280
punish me.

507
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,280
Lei.

508
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,160
If you say so.

509
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,640
I'll give you what you want.

510
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,760
Let's play for it.

511
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,280
Don't sit there.

512
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,440
It's okay. Sit.

513
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,520
That's Lei's spot.

514
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,440
Lei is no longer a part of the F4.

515
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,840
That seat belongs to you now.

516
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,760
Sit.

517
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,960
Si, can you stop fooling around?

518
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Grow up, will you?

519
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,200
Can't we just talk this out?

520
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,560
What?

521
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,960
Why are you so angry with Lei?

522
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,560
Aren't you all friends?

523
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,640
It's because he's my friend

524
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,640
that I can't forgive him.

525
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,840
Do you guys really think
Huaze Lei likes Shancai?

526
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,600
The only girl he likes is Jing.

527
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,560
But Jing is getting married
so he's using Shancai to get over her.

528
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,400
That stupid girl can't see that.

529
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,040
So,

530
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,320
are you still going to defend
that selfish bastard?

531
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,600
Are you saying that Lei
is playing with Shancai?

532
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,600
Is that it?

533
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,880
Is it?

534
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,600
You know what?

535
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,960
-That Shancai is so annoying.
-She should hide somewhere.

536
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,360
Every day, she's...

537
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,280
She's right there. Did you see her?

538
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,200
HUAZE LEI AND DAOMING SI
ARE NO LONGER FRIENDS.

539
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,160
IT'S SHANCAI'S FAULT.

540
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,320
EVEN HER NAME ANNOYS ME.

541
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,960
Shancai!

542
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,360
Shancai, what happened
to you and Daoming Si?

543
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
It's my fault.

544
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,720
To be fair, they aren't wrong.

545
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,840
Daoming Si and Huaze Lei
are fighting because of me.

546
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,520
Shancai.

547
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,120
I really don't get it.

548
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,920
Daoming Si treats you so nicely.
Why did you choose Huaze Lei?

549
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,640
I'm not sure.

550
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,000
So if you and Huaze Lei win,
what are you going to ask for?

551
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,360
Me?

552
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,440
I will just ask Daoming Si and Huaze Lei
to rekindle their friendship.

553
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,880
But friendship isn't something
you can salvage like that.

554
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,920
Then I hope...

555
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,680
that Daoming Si will forgive me.

556
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,960
<i>Everyone was having fun together</i>

557
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,760
<i>during the break.</i>

558
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,240
<i>Why did it suddenly</i>

559
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,720
<i>become like this?</i>

560
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,080
Ms. Shancai, Si is not back yet.

561
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,360
-Is Ms. Zhuang in?
-Yes.

562
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,320
Ms. Zhuang,
you have to think of something.

563
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,280
This is the Red Robe tea.

564
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,760
It's famous in Mount Wuyi.

565
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,000
I bought it specially from Ximen's family.

566
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,960
I'll get Mr. Liu to pack some
for you if you like it.

567
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,760
Try those snacks too.

568
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,360
I can't finish them alone.

569
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,720
Ms. Zhuang,
are you listening to me at all?

570
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,040
I heard you.

571
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,120
Si sent you a Joker card.

572
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,480
Huaze Lei received it too.

573
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,200
So, you have to help me talk to Si.

574
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,480
How did Si and Lei end up like this?

575
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,240
It was me.

576
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,840
Then what good will I do?

577
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,960
You're his sister.
I'm sure he'll listen to you.

578
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,800
If you're the cause,
you should be the one to solve it.

579
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,920
So you mean

580
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,360
I should leave,
and Huaze Lei will be okay?

581
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,280
I thought you're a smart girl.
Why don't you figure it out?

582
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,520
I'm saying only you can change Si's mind.

583
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,640
Only you can end this cold war.

584
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,160
Only I can change his mind?

585
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,120
So you want me to challenge
Daoming Si in poker and win?

586
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,080
That's impossible.

587
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
No!

588
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,160
You must use this.

589
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,520
The heart?

590
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Huaze Lei.

591
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,840
Teach me poker.

592
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,640
I'll do my best to learn.

593
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,320
Listen up, Daoming Si.

594
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,880
Don't assume that I'm scared.

595
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,760
I didn't come here to surrender.

596
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,280
I've made up my mind.

597
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,280
I'll team up with Huaze Lei
and play poker with you.

598
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,920
I might not know how to play now,

599
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,720
but...

600
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,240
Maybe after some lessons,
I'll turn into a dark horse in poker.

601
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,840
Ms. Zhuang also agreed

602
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,000
that I might succeed

603
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,320
as long as I do my best.

604
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,240
Why aren't you saying anything?

605
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,120
I hope you're not...

606
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,320
Just say you like me

607
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,960
and I'll cancel the bet with Huaze Lei.

608
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,560
Just say it, okay?

609
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,960
Say it.

610
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,880
Let me go. You're hurting me.

611
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,080
Say it. Say you like me!

612
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,840
Stop it.

613
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,080
Do you hate me that much?

614
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,160
<i>Why are you asking a question
I have no answer to?</i>

615
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,600
Why must it be Lei?

616
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,040
Why did it have to be my friend?

617
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,240
I must be stupid.

618
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,800
Why do I have to like you?

619
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,360
You're so old-fashioned and ugly.

620
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,200
You have a huge face,
no figure, and no brain.

621
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,800
Are you sure you and Lei
want to challenge me?

622
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,960
Yes.

623
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,560
-I'm willing to accept the consequences.
-What if you lose?

624
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,840
I will do my best to beat you.

625
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,600
You'd better not regret it later.

626
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,400
And...

627
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,160
I'm not going to go easy on you.

628
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,360
Just so you know.

629
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,640
Daoming Si!

630
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,720
I'm not going to back down.

631
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,720
I won't regret it either.

632
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,240
That's the Shancai I know.

633
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,200
<i>There may come a time</i>

634
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,920
<i>when I will regret what I did today.</i>

635
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,760
<i>But right now,</i>

636
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,120
<i>I don't want Huaze Lei to face this alone.</i>
