00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 12

3
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,120
Si, how are you doing in London?

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
<i>I'm bored to death here.</i>

5
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,920
How is that possible?

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,320
There must be
a lot of pretty girls over there.

7
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,960
I don't see any.

8
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,080
Oh, please. How can you live abroad
with that kind of negative attitude?

9
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,960
Why don't you just come back here?

10
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,080
We also lack one member for Bridge.

11
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,880
Now you realize how important I am, right?

12
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,920
You've always been important.

13
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,560
Please.

14
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,520
We haven't found any place
with bigger space

15
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,840
and privacy than your house.

16
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,200
Hey, you guys are so sensible.

17
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,960
<i>Daoming Si, that's your only role.</i>

18
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,800
Cut the nonsense. Where's Lei?

19
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,880
Lei, Si is looking for you.

20
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,440
What's up?

21
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,680
What do you mean, what's up?

22
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Tell me clearly.

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,560
Why am I the one whom Shancai likes?

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,160
Can't you figure it out yourself?

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,800
<i>If I can do that on my own,
why do I need to ask you?</i>

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,000
Then come back and find out for yourself.

27
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,680
Have you seen her lately?

28
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
How is she?

29
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,200
I haven't seen her much.

30
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,840
When I see Qinghe,

31
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,760
he said that when Shancai is not
in school, she's at her part-time job.

32
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
You still remember?

33
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,640
Have you forgotten who I am?

34
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,280
-I see Shancai now.
-Where? Now? Let me see her.

35
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,080
SHEN NONG VILLAGE, PLANTS

36
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,000
Grandma.

37
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,640
This is the list of herbs I want to buy.
Thank you.

38
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,560
Oh, sure. Let me see it.

39
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,200
ID CARD, DONG SHANCAI

40
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,840
-"Shenwei leaf."
-Grandma.

41
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,520
What's up with this ID card?

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,720
That day, a young girl left her ID card
here because she didn't have enough money

43
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,080
to pay for the Shenwei leaf.

44
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,040
-Do you know her?
-She's our kitchen assistant.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,400
So you're her friend who participated
in the chef qualification exam.

46
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,440
Yes.

47
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,520
In order to save your Shenwei leaf,
she even got into an accident.

48
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,040
Tian Ye, why are you still here?

49
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,080
This is yours.

50
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,080
ID CARD, DONG SHANCAI

51
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,800
Why is it with you?

52
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,800
Why are you so careless?

53
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,880
Even if you were anxious
to get me the Shenwei leaf,

54
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,080
you must be careful too.

55
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,240
If I knew that would happen,
I'd have just taken the exam next year.

56
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,360
It's fine.

57
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,720
It didn't hurt at all.

58
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,000
All right.

59
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,680
Actually, it's all my fault.

60
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,640
I was the one who ruined the ingredients.
And I even scolded you.

61
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,400
But Shancai,

62
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,320
I really want to thank you.

63
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,160
Let me buy you dinner.

64
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,120
Sure.

65
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,240
Congratulations on becoming a chef!

66
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,560
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

67
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,360
Why do you look happier than me?

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,200
Of course I'm happy.

69
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,520
Your parents must even be happier
to have such a talented son like you.

70
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,760
My mom passed away when I was very young.

71
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,400
My dad actually doesn't want me
to become a chef.

72
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,720
Why?

73
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,000
I know he has his reasons.

74
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,360
However,

75
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,840
I won't easily give up
on something I really like to do.

76
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,760
Yes, I would do the same if I were you.

77
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,840
What kind of life do you want to live?

78
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,920
I want to live a simple life.

79
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,920
Then have my own dream.

80
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,280
And work hard
to make the people around me happy.

81
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,040
-Shancai.
-Yes?

82
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,960
I think we're so alike.
And we have a pre-destined connection.

83
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,480
Are we so alike?

84
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,840
Yes.

85
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,640
You mean we're both very frugal
and work very hard, right?

86
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,720
We're both fighting for survival.

87
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,320
I really hope I can be as brave as you.

88
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,840
You? You can definitely do it.

89
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,080
All right. My house
is just straight ahead.

90
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,480
Let me walk you there.

91
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,640
There's no need. I'll just go by myself.

92
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,320
Then...

93
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,520
Shancai.

94
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,680
No matter what happens in the future,

95
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,760
I hope that you can be beside me
whenever I'm cooking.

96
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,520
I'm your kitchen assistant, right?

97
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't worry.

98
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,920
I won't just quit
and work in another place.

99
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
That's not what I meant.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,840
-I mean--
-What he means

101
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,200
is that he wants you
to become his girlfriend,

102
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,680
and not a poor kitchen assistant.

103
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,840
Daoming Si?

104
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,760
What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be in London?

105
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Because I went to London,
you went on a date with this liar?

106
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,000
What are you talking about? What liar?

107
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,920
He's been deceiving you
from the very start.

108
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,560
Why is Tian's Chinese Medicine's successor

109
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,320
pretending to be poor
and doing a part-time job?

110
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,200
How is that possible?

111
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,480
He obviously lied to you.

112
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,680
You can't even be honest with her,

113
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,760
yet you want her to become
your girlfriend?

114
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,080
Maybe you've misunderstood.

115
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,520
I didn't misunderstand anything.
You were deceived.

116
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,680
TIAN'S CHINESE MEDICINE SUCCESSOR
TIAN YE TO INHERIT FAMILY BUSINESS

117
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,320
Tian Ye,

118
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,840
is that really you?

119
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,240
Shancai. Listen to me.

120
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,520
You're rich,

121
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,760
yet you told me

122
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,080
that we're both fighting for survival.

123
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Do you take me for a fool?

124
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
No, Shancai.

125
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,520
I meant that I need to fight my family.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,880
I really respect you as my colleague.

127
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,200
Actually,

128
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,880
it doesn't matter
whether you tell me the truth or not.

129
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
I just feel

130
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
that you didn't treat me as a real friend.

131
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,040
No, Shancai.

132
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,160
-Let me explain--
-Hey.

133
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,880
You're so full of it.

134
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Shancai.

135
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,160
Are you stuttering?

136
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,200
I'll go first.

137
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,600
You're a stupid girl. If I'm not here,
you'd be easily tricked by guys.

138
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,640
-How can you believe someone so easily?
-I was born this way.

139
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,640
-So what?
-That's why I said you're stupid.

140
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,040
I'm stupid?

141
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,840
Don't feel too good about yourself.
Do you think you're that smart?

142
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,520
If I wasn't there earlier,
you could've been tricked by that guy.

143
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,760
Fine. Even if that happens,
it has nothing to do with you.

144
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,080
-Can you just mind your own business?
-No.

145
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,480
Now it has nothing to do with me?

146
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,480
Why does it matter?

147
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,000
Didn't you go to London
and never plan to come back?

148
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,160
Why are you here now?

149
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,440
I...

150
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,200
I miss my country, my friends,
my hometown. Am I not allowed to be here?

151
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,880
Daoming Si, you're here.

152
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,360
Shancai and I missed you.

153
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,000
Who missed him?

154
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,640
Why are you here?

155
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,400
Didn't you open the door for me
to come inside?

156
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,320
-I--
-Hey. Where are your manners?

157
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,880
Daoming Si can come here if he wants to.

158
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Daoming Si, welcome.

159
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,920
It has been a while.

160
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,240
Hi, ma'am.

161
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,640
Why do you look so pale? Are you sick?

162
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,400
I just came back from London.
I still have jet lag.

163
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,560
London?

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,320
That's so far.
You must not be feeling well.

165
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,880
Come here and have a seat first.

166
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,800
Have a seat.

167
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,600
Sit down and rest here for a while.

168
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,040
You rude girl.
Why are you just standing there?

169
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,840
Get him some water.
Can you get some fruit for him?

170
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,560
I'll get some tiger balm for you.
Sit and rest here first, okay?

171
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,040
So you were abroad.

172
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,160
That makes me feel better.

173
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,440
I thought you had a fight with Shancai.

174
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,480
Are you two all right?

175
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,520
Mom, what are you saying?

176
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,960
Fine. I won't keep asking you.
I'll just talk about something else.

177
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,560
Daoming Si,
what do you want to specialize in?

178
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,160
Dear, why are you asking him that?

179
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,240
Can't I ask about that?

180
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,600
He's rarely here.

181
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,600
What did you do in London?

182
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,960
-Strolling around.
-Strolling around?

183
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,200
-Where did you go for a stroll?
-At home.

184
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,960
At home...

185
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,640
Dear, it's really late.

186
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,440
Daoming Si has been yawning
all this while.

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,720
Maybe he wants to rest now.

188
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,640
Are you sleepy?
Do you want to rest already?

189
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,120
I wish there's a bed
I can lie down on right now.

190
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,400
Then just spend the night here.

191
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,440
Okay.

192
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,600
You...

193
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,440
Hey.

194
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,360
Get lost! Your bed is over there.

195
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,560
Get over there.

196
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,680
You're so strange.

197
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,760
-Why are you sleeping in my room?
-Because you have to take care of me.

198
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,000
-I--
-What if I feel thirsty

199
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,280
in the middle of the night?

200
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,120
I'm not your maid.

201
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,440
Why are you laughing?

202
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,320
Your dad's legs are so short.

203
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,680
Just pretend it's a pair of capri pants.

204
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,840
What else can I do? My handsome self
just needs to deal with it.

205
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,120
I think the person
Shancai really likes is you.

206
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,160
-Hey, Shancai.
-Hey.

207
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,280
What are you doing?
My parents are just in the next room.

208
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,360
Don't think of doing anything.

209
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Oh, please.

210
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,960
You should refrain
from doing anything to me.

211
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,880
Hey.

212
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,600
If I didn't come back, can you imagine
how Tian Ye would have tricked you?

213
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,640
Did you come back
just to expose Tian Ye's lie?

214
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,000
Of course not. I have better things to do.

215
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,640
Did you go on a date today?

216
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,560
Why are you even nosier than my mom?

217
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,360
Did you two hold hands?

218
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,760
Or kiss?

219
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,160
No.

220
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,920
Is that true?

221
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
Never mind if you don't believe me.

222
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,840
How have you been for these past few days?

223
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,760
What did you think
about me not being here?

224
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,680
What do you mean?

225
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,240
Did you feel more carefree

226
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,640
or a bit sad?

227
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,320
Never mind.

228
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,040
I don't care what you think.

229
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm going to sleep.

230
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,040
Good night.

231
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,840
Hey! Why didn't you knock?

232
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,760
-Sorry.
-Why aren't you dressed?

233
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,400
My clothes are dirty.

234
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,920
I'll ask my dad to give you
something to wear.

235
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,320
Never mind. I don't think I can carry
the uncle-style clothes your dad wears.

236
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,200
But you can't go out
without your shirt on.

237
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,000
Why not?

238
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,720
My perfect abs cannot be seen
just by anyone.

239
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,880
You don't have abs.

240
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,840
Hey.

241
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,360
Come here. Look clearly.

242
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,800
-Aren't these abs?
-You--

243
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,440
Sorry to bother the two of you.

244
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,640
It's so nice to be young.

245
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,040
Get out!

246
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,600
Close the door!

247
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,400
Isn't that Daoming Si?

248
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,800
It's really him.

249
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,920
-You...
-He isn't in London?

250
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,080
Weren't you in London?

251
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,720
I only asked for a few days leave.
Should I report that to you?

252
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,880
Also, I was afraid this stupid girl
couldn't live without me. So I came back.

253
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,520
Who couldn't live without you?

254
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,840
Last night,

255
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,720
-I slept together with Shancai.
-What?

256
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,120
You slept together with Shancai?

257
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,880
No. Yesterday, my mom wanted him
to stay over at my house.

258
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,880
Your mom already agreed?

259
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,040
Aren't you going too fast?

260
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,840
Li Zhen, let's go.

261
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,280
-Zao Yue.
-Present.

262
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,600
-Liu Bozhen.
-Present.

263
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,200
-Jin Jinqiao.
-Present.

264
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,760
-Zhang Chi.
-Present.

265
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,560
Chen Qinghe.

266
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,320
-Qinghe.
-Isn't Chen Qinghe present?

267
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,240
Qinghe.

268
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,800
-Yang Yang.
-Present.

269
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,760
-Hey, your name is being called.
-Li Zhen.

270
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
-Present.
-Present.

271
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,520
-Zao Bowen.
-Present.

272
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,840
-Huang Mongtian.
-Present.

273
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,120
-Zhang Yawen.
-Present.

274
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,160
Hello, Ximen? Where did you three go?

275
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,360
<i>Si, we came to London to see you.</i>

276
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,240
<i>We just landed. Where are you?</i>

277
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,520
What? I came back to Shanghai.
Come back here.

278
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,120
<i>We can't. Because of you,
we enrolled in a school in London.</i>

279
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
<i>-We already paid the tuition fees.</i>
-I don't care. Come back here.

280
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,280
<i>No.</i>

281
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,360
<i>Lei said that he's not coming back anymore
if you're not talking to him.</i>

282
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,520
Who says I'm not talking to him?
I have a lot of things to tell him.

283
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,560
Ask Lei to come back.

284
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,840
What do you want to tell me?

285
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,400
So it's a prank?

286
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,960
So what do you want to tell me?

287
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,400
Lei.

288
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,240
What happened before...

289
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,760
Which one?

290
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,520
Regarding the Spiderman.

291
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,720
I don't mind.

292
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,800
However, I think you still owe me
an official apology.

293
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Si, you're my good friend.

294
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,800
But you should really
apologize to Lei for that.

295
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,680
I want to film this historic moment
where Daoming Si apologizes.

296
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,240
Go away.

297
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,560
Lei.

298
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,560
Regarding Spiderman

299
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,000
and me forcing you to go away,

300
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,280
they're all my fault.

301
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,600
I'm officially apologizing to you.

302
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,360
-He's bowing.
-What are you doing?

303
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm not dead yet.

304
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,640
This moment is so precious.

305
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,560
I want to post this.

306
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,040
-It'd surely be a hit.
-Definitely.

307
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,280
Hey, don't you dare.

308
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Stand properly.

309
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
I want to officially apologize to you.

310
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,080
-Okay.
-Hey, don't go too far.

311
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,120
I'm telling you. Don't go there.

312
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,360
-Come on. Delete all of it.
-I don't want to.

313
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,680
Qinghe, what's wrong with you?

314
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
You haven't been paying attention
at all today.

315
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,120
How is Daoming Si better than me?

316
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,720
Originally, Shancai's parents said
she and I were made for each other.

317
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,200
We're like a nutritious
and delicious dish combined together.

318
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,360
Why did they choose
a different son-in-law?

319
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,160
I feel like a battery pack
without any juice.

320
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,240
A balloon with a hole.

321
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,360
A dried up cactus.

322
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,640
My world is full of darkness.

323
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,240
I'm dying.

324
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,120
Do you know how Daoming Si
is better than you?

325
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,800
He doesn't act like he's dying like you.

326
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
You're right.

327
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,960
I can't let Daoming Si see me like this.

328
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,800
Shancai isn't married yet.

329
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
I still have a chance.

330
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,200
I especially liked
Professor Tian's class today.

331
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,000
Meizuo, how about you?

332
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,520
Are you talking about the topic
"the most irresponsible company

333
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,000
treats its employees leniently"?

334
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,520
Yes. I think he really
made a lot of sense.

335
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,000
If a company wants to improve,
it must be strict with its employees.

336
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,640
I think it depends on the situation.

337
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,040
As long as they have a common goal,
the employee can work hard to achieve it.

338
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
Lei, what do you think?

339
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,600
Me?

340
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,120
I think it's creativity.

341
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,200
Only creativity is irreplaceable.

342
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,320
-Si, what about you?
-Me?

343
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,680
Determination.

344
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,840
Regardless of what anyone says.
Once you're determined to do something,

345
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,760
you have to stick with it
no matter what happens.

346
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,880
You're talking about your feelings, right?

347
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,080
It's the same thing.

348
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,920
Oh, no! It's my sister.
My sister is calling me! Quick!

349
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,160
-Let me do it. I like Ms. Zhuang.
-Help me.

350
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Hi, Ms. Zhuang.

351
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,040
<i>Ask my brother to talk to me.</i>

352
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,000
He says he's not here.

353
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,320
<i>Stop it. I know he's right beside you.
Ask him to talk to me.</i>

354
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,560
No. He's really not here.

355
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,040
Do you want to leave any message?

356
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,480
You can talk to me first, or Lei,

357
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,760
-Hi.
-or Ximen.

358
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,120
Hello, Ms. Zhuang.

359
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,360
<i>All right. You're not letting him
talk to me, right?</i>

360
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,760
Then I'll sing.

361
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,680
<i>The most beautiful woman in the world
Is named Daoming Zhuang</i>

362
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,840
-Si suddenly appeared.
-Hey.

363
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,440
-We'll get going first.
-<i>...narcissist</i>

364
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,440
-You can do it.
-<i>Ms. Zhuang</i>

365
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,480
Hi.

366
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,560
<i>Are you tired of living?</i>

367
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,520
<i>Do you want me come and beat you up?</i>

368
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,680
<i>You went back to Shanghai
without telling us.</i>

369
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,160
<i>Do you know how mad Mom is?</i>

370
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,560
All right.

371
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,160
I'm sorry.

372
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,360
It's not a big deal.

373
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,040
-Why are you so mad?
-<i>Do you think I want to be mad?</i>

374
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,800
<i>I was worried about you.</i>

375
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,080
Worried?

376
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,360
I'm not a kid anymore.

377
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,040
What's there to be worried about
even if I come home by myself?

378
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,000
And I need to go to my classes, right?

379
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,320
<i>All right. I have something to tell you.</i>

380
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,560
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

381
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,680
<i>Inhale deeply and exhale
three times first. Come on.</i>

382
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,080
Okay.

383
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,440
<i>Mom will be back in Shanghai
for your birthday this year.</i>

384
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,960
What?

385
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,840
<i>You know what I mean, right?</i>

386
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,320
<i>What do you plan to do with Shancai?</i>

387
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,840
<i>You should know
that Mom wouldn't like her.</i>

388
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,120
Then tell me.
What type of girl does Mom like?

389
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,520
<i>Somebody like Teng Tangjing or me.</i>

390
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,120
Then what type is that?

391
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,120
<i>Elegant, classy, smart, talented.
Someone who shines when she's outdoors.</i>

392
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,680
<i>Someone who's virtuous when she's indoors.
Someone well-mannered.</i>

393
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,040
<i>Shouldn't you start thinking
about what you should do?</i>

394
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,800
Si, what are you so busy with?

395
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,480
It's almost the end of the year.
Didn't we say we'll practice

396
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,560
for next year's
Asian Games Bridge Competition?

397
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,760
Wait. I'll be right there.

398
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,680
What are you doing?

399
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,080
I'm looking for something
for Shancai's makeover.

400
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,640
-Shancai's makeover?
-Why a makeover?

401
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,360
Because I want to turn her
into a girl that suits me.

402
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,560
Haven't you two always been a good match?

403
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,160
Shancai, it's time.

404
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,640
Let me do it.

405
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,880
Shancai, I'm sorry.

406
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,640
I know you're still mad.

407
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,640
But I really don't want to lie to you.

408
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,960
Tian's Chinese Medicine
is indeed my family's business.

409
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,320
I didn't think that was important to you.

410
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,160
Because I'm still me.

411
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,320
I didn't tell you before

412
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,400
because I didn't want to get
special treatment at work.

413
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,440
I want to make friends
with people for who I am.

414
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,440
I overreacted.

415
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
Thank you for being honest with me.

416
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,720
Then you're not mad anymore?

417
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,200
Yes.

418
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,840
Dad, Mom, what happened?

419
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,640
Mom, why are you crying?

420
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
Ask your dad.

421
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,920
He did something wrong and he even
threw a fit when he got home.

422
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,960
Dad.

423
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,800
What's the matter?

424
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,120
Your dad

425
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,400
lost one million yuan.

426
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
One million yuan?

427
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,960
He earned some money with the investment.

428
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,920
So he put in the company's money as well.

429
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,640
He lost everything in the end.

430
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,040
Now we have to return the money
to them immediately.

431
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,880
Dad.

432
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,800
Is this true?

433
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,520
Say something.

434
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,920
Shancai.

435
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,080
I was blinded by greed.

436
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,760
I shouldn't have been too greedy.
I wanted to get rich overnight.

437
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,400
Dad, how can you do that?

438
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,160
Dear.

439
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,200
I'm sorry.

440
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,040
I just want to let you have a chance
to wear nicer clothes,

441
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,560
to live in a bigger house.

442
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,160
I did everything in order
to make you live a happier life.

443
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,240
Don't say anything anymore.

444
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,240
Let's get divorced.

445
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,600
Mom.

446
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,560
Dong Danian.

447
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,240
I'm really disappointed in you.

448
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,960
You don't understand me at all.

449
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,720
Even if you have money,

450
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,840
I won't let you buy me a big house
or a nice car.

451
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,880
I love you for who you are.

452
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,760
Because you're kind and honest.
You have a sense of responsibility.

453
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,840
But today, just for a little profit,
you committed such a big mistake.

454
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,680
I want to get a divorce!

455
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,000
Mom! Calm down!

456
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,040
Dear, I didn't do it on purpose.

457
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,680
I'm sorry.

458
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
Shancai.

459
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,240
It's my fault.

460
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,640
I'm sorry.

461
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Dear.

462
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,080
I'll do anything you want.

463
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,960
If you really want to get a divorce,

464
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,920
I'll grant you that.

465
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,840
Dad!

466
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,680
Who wants to divorce you?

467
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,280
Just promise me
you won't ever do it again.

468
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,440
I won't. I promise I won't do it anymore.

469
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,080
I know I was wrong. I won't do it again.

470
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,960
But what do we do now?

471
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,960
We have to return so much money
to the company.

472
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,520
We might only have one or two
hundred thousand yuan altogether.

473
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,480
What do we do?

474
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Don't worry.

475
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,040
Let me think of something.
I'll think of something.

476
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
Daoming Si.

477
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,800
What happened?

478
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,640
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

479
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,440
My husband is so embarrassing.

480
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,440
-I'm sorry about that.
-Mom, stop it.

481
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,600
Daoming Si, go home first.

482
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,600
We have a lot of things to settle.

483
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,160
BANK OF COMMUNICATIONS

484
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,360
This card has one million yuan.
The password is six zeroes.

485
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,520
You can use it first.

486
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,800
What are you doing?

487
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,560
How can we use your money?

488
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,280
Dad, Mom.

489
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,280
-We can't accept it.
-Why not?

490
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,720
I earned this money
from the stock market on my own.

491
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,080
Would it be a problem if I lend it to you?

492
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,840
I don't want to take advantage of you.

493
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,800
Use it first. Just pay me back later.

494
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,200
What other options does your dad have?
He might go to jail for this, you know?

495
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,280
Take it.

496
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,680
Daoming Si, well...

497
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,280
Thank you so much for helping us.

498
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,400
How should I pay the money back to you?

499
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Come to my house
after school tomorrow, okay?

500
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,440
What?

501
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,520
See you tomorrow. Bye.

502
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,040
Ma'am, sir, I'll take my leave.
Get a good rest tonight.

503
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,040
All right.

504
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,200
Hey.

505
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,320
Daoming Si!

506
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,320
<i>What?</i>

507
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,640
<i>What did he mean by that?</i>

508
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,560
Daoming Si.

509
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,920
Thank you.

510
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,160
Even though I don't have
enough money to pay you back now,

511
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,640
but I'll think of something.
I'll earn money and pay it back to you.

512
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,640
I have an idea for you
to pay the money back sooner.

513
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,040
What do you want to do?

514
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
Guess.

515
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,160
I'm warning you.

516
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,560
I rather eat slippers.

517
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,600
There's a competition.

518
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,120
The winner can get one million yuan.

519
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,160
One million yuan?

520
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,680
-How is that possible?
-What?

521
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,120
It's fine if you're not interested.

522
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,280
Think of your own way
to pay the money back to me.

523
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,440
Wait.

524
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,200
What kind of competition is it?
Let me see.

525
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,920
What kind of competition is it?

526
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,160
This one.

527
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,920
Let me see it again.

528
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,840
-You can't.
-I just want to look at it.

529
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,440
Let me see it.

530
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,440
"The Chinese Cuisine Cooking Contest

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,840
integrates the essence of Chinese culture

532
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,320
and creates a new attitude for food."

533
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,720
It sounds really difficult.

534
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,240
But it looks interesting.

535
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
I can try it.

536
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,080
Are you joining this contest?

537
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,400
You...

538
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,840
I can get the prize and learn
new things at the same time.

539
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,280
I'll try my best.

540
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,320
That's the Dong Shancai I know.

541
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,000
Is there anything else?

542
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,800
If not, I'll get going.

543
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,280
Wait.

544
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,160
-What about the interest?
-What?

545
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
The interest?

546
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,960
You're ridiculous.
Of course there's interest fee.

547
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,480
How much do you want?

548
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,480
What do you want?

549
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,920
The interest is a kiss on my cheek.

550
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,080
Are you a person of integrity or not?

551
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,120
<i>What?</i>

552
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,240
You want Shancai to join
the Chinese Cuisine Cooking Competition?

553
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,000
-The competition sponsored by your mom?
-That's right.

554
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,600
-Si, are you serious?
-Of course.

555
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,520
The inspiration came from my sister.

556
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
And Jing.

557
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,840
But this competition
is only done once in three years.

558
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,680
If she wants to win,
she must have exceptional cooking skills

559
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,040
and she needs to have
a famous chef's recommendation.

560
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,160
Shancai doesn't seem qualified
to participate in it.

561
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,440
I'll find a famous chef to test her.

562
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,440
Is it that hard?

563
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,400
So you want to use this opportunity
to train Shancai?

564
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,360
I want to use this opportunity

565
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,560
to let Shancai improve
and also to let my mom accept Shancai.

566
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,560
Isn't this killing two birds
with one stone?

567
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,360
That's a good idea.

568
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,600
Even so,

569
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,560
the competition would be fierce.
Aren't you afraid she'll be humiliated?

570
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,400
That's not a problem for Shancai.

571
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,560
You don't know how fierce she is.

572
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,920
She can make the impossible possible.

573
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,720
But we have less than a month
before the competition.

574
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,760
Do you have enough time?

575
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,360
How would we know if we don't try?

576
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,960
Hello?

577
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,360
Yes, I'm Shancai.

578
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,760
May I ask who's calling?

579
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
Ms. Zhuang?

580
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,680
<i>How unfortunate I am.</i>

581
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,560
<i>I have such a stupid brother.</i>

582
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,960
He begged me to come back
and help you with your training.

583
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,600
So you came back just for me?

584
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,480
Yes. What do you think?
How would you prepare for the competition?

585
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,160
I'm not sure where to start.

586
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,680
I don't think I'll succeed.

587
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,720
Let me tell you.

588
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,960
I hate those people
who think that they'll lose

589
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,560
even before they enter the competition.

590
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,760
That kind of people
would never succeed no matter what.

591
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,120
But a great teacher can produce
a brilliant student.

592
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,000
If someone great like me teaches you,
as long as you're not too bad yourself,

593
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,760
you can still win the competition.

594
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,200
I'll do everything I can to help you.

595
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,480
-Thank you, Ms. Zhuang.
-Okay.

596
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,200
Let me hear about your skill level first.

597
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,640
What's your specialty?

598
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,160
-I can cook sweet and sour pork.
-What else?

599
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,960
Kung Pao chicken, shredded pork
with dried bean curd,

600
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,760
Napa cabbage with dried shrimp,
shrimp with green peas.

601
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,880
Stir-fried tomatoes with egg.

602
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,360
Boiled Chinese Broccoli.

603
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,800
These dishes are basic!

604
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,640
I think a lot of people
don't know how to cook them.

605
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,920
Do you know

606
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,280
that you're joining an international-scale
Chinese cuisine cooking competition?

607
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,480
It's not a competition
where you compete with your relatives.

608
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,280
Then I'm doomed to fail?

609
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,400
Do you know
what's the most important factor

610
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,080
required to win this competition?

611
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,400
Do you know how I won
the competition before?

612
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,040
How?

613
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,840
It has the essence of Dong Xiaowan's
hair and posture, graceful and elegant.

614
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,400
Fragrant, flavorful, enticing,
and gold in color.

615
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,000
That sounds incredible.

616
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,040
-What is it?
-Silly girl.

617
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,160
-It's a pumpkin pie.
-What?

618
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,680
-Pumpkin pie?
-That's right.

619
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,480
How small of a bowl is it?

620
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,840
Stupid girl.

621
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,480
Dong Xiaowan is a woman, not a bowl.

622
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,720
Then how did you think
of cooking such a thing?

623
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,160
There was a reason, of course.

624
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,960
-Did you fight with someone again?
-Why do you care?

625
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,640
Stupid boy.

626
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,000
I need to discipline you.

627
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,040
<i>As a big sister, I had to take on
the role of disciplining Si</i>

628
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,680
<i>since my parents were not around.</i>

629
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,720
Hey, what are you doing?

630
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,960
Hey.

631
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,240
I'm invincible. How can I lose to you?

632
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,440
What are you doing?

633
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,080
<i>I know he hates
the flavor of pumpkins the most.</i>

634
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,720
<i>So I intentionally learned how to make
pumpkin pies to punish him.</i>

635
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,560
That's your punishment.

636
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,560
So what happened?

637
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,080
What happened was Si didn't want
to come home anymore.

638
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,880
And even our helpers ended up
eating pumpkin pies every day.

639
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,960
I'll get rashes whenever I see
pumpkin nowadays.

640
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,160
What does that have to do
with the competition?

641
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,960
We're talking about feelings.

642
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,600
Not really.

643
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,800
Do you know why I seem
so sensible and full of substance?

644
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,520
And so ahead of the times?

645
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,080
That's because I've always
read about Chinese history

646
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,320
and understood food very well.

647
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,040
So when they a presented pumpkin pie
as the topic in the competition,

648
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,840
I can use a completely different
point of view to win the competition.

649
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,400
Really?

650
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,240
I want to do that too.

651
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,480
Think about it.

652
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,640
The pumpkin pies made by those girls

653
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,280
didn't contain any cultural heritage
in the flavors they presented.

654
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,720
Unlike mine,

655
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,360
it was full of international charm
and elegance.

656
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,920
So who else could the winner be, but me?

657
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,160
-I need to be like you too.
-Of course.

658
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,160
-Are you feeling more confident now?
-Yes.

659
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,920
Thank you for your pointers.

660
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
-I'll work extra hard.
-Very good.

661
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,680
<i>THE BOOK OF SONGS</i>

662
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,720
Here. Read <i>The Book of Songs</i> first.

663

00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,480
