4
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,343
<font color="#ffff00">Where is he?</font>

5
00:01:38,863 --> 00:01:39,983
<font color="#ffff00">What? Are you looking for me?</font>

6
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:41,183
<font color="#ffff00">In your dreams.</font>

7
00:01:41,383 --> 00:01:43,503
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, who are you looking for then?</font>

8
00:01:43,943 --> 00:01:44,783
<font color="#ffff00">Go and sit.</font>

9
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:45,983
<font color="#ffff00">I'm...</font>

10
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:47,623
<font color="#ffff00">You look pretty nice today.</font>

11
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:49,543
<font color="#ffff00">Sit down.</font>

12
00:01:53,183 --> 00:01:54,103
<font color="#ffff00">What do you want?</font>

13
00:01:54,183 --> 00:01:55,223
<font color="#ffff00">I ordered too much. Eat.</font>

14
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:56,743
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not hungry.</font>

15
00:01:58,343 --> 00:02:00,423
<font color="#ffff00">I don't care. You can only go
after you finish eating.</font>

16
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:02,703
<font color="#ffff00">You're too skinny.
I'm going to make you fatter.</font>

17
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,983
<font color="#ffff00">Why do you want to do that? I'm not a pig.</font>

18
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:07,223
<font color="#ffff00">Are you sure you're not?</font>

19
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:08,583
<font color="#ffff00">You're the pig.</font>

20
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,983
<font color="#ffff00">I wish someone would make me
fat like a pig.</font>

21
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:16,503
<font color="#ffff00">That's right. I've known you forever,
but never saw you so considerate.</font>

22
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:18,343
<font color="#ffff00">Shut up, you two.</font>

23
00:02:19,103 --> 00:02:20,063
<font color="#ffff00">Eat up.</font>

24
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,303
<font color="#ffff00">All right. I'll just eat the ribs.</font>

25
00:02:23,663 --> 00:02:25,743
<font color="#ffff00">How much was the jacket?
I'll pay you back.</font>

26
00:02:26,223 --> 00:02:27,463
<font color="#ffff00">What are you talking about?</font>

27
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:30,183
<font color="#ffff00">I was never taught to ask the girl to pay.</font>

28
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:40,103
<font color="#ffff00">Shancai still doesn't admit
that Daoming Si is his boyfriend?</font>

29
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,423
<font color="#ffff00">She says one thing, but does another.</font>

30
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:44,463
<font color="#ffff00">Do you believe her?</font>

31
00:02:49,743 --> 00:02:51,983
<font color="#ffff00">Who knows what's on her mind?</font>

32
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:55,543
<font color="#ffff00">What? You're not hungry? Look at you.</font>

33
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:57,783
<font color="#ffff00">Slow down.</font>

34
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:05,303
<font color="#ffff00">-Hello?
-<i>Where are you?</i></font>

35
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:07,423
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I'm near the cafeteria. I'll come up.</i></font>

36
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:08,623
<font color="#ffff00">No!</font>

37
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,303
<font color="#ffff00">Don't come here. I'll go to you.</font>

38
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:22,303
<font color="#ffff00">Was that a guy or a girl?</font>

39
00:03:22,383 --> 00:03:23,343
<font color="#ffff00">None of your business.</font>

40
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:25,663
<font color="#ffff00">I'm warning you.</font>

41
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:29,303
<font color="#ffff00">You're dead meat
if you do anything with another guy.</font>

42
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:34,343
<font color="#ffff00">I'm full. I have to go.</font>

43
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:36,143
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, where are you going?</font>

44
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:46,303
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, Shancai.</font>

45
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:47,823
<font color="#ffff00">Shancai, I'm--</font>

46
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:49,303
<font color="#ffff00">-Come with me.
-Where to?</font>

47
00:03:52,823 --> 00:03:53,663
<font color="#ffff00">Hey.</font>

48
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:56,343
<font color="#ffff00">Isn't that Thomas from last night?</font>

49
00:03:56,943 --> 00:03:58,263
<font color="#ffff00">He came to school.</font>

50
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:01,183
<font color="#ffff00">A minute ago,
she was eating with Daoming Si.</font>

51
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:03,823
<font color="#ffff00">Now, she's going on a date with Thomas.</font>

52
00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:06,783
<font color="#ffff00">That Shancai sure is something.</font>

53
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:15,783
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, why did you come to our school?</font>

54
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:19,463
<font color="#ffff00">You called me,
but didn't finish what you were saying.</font>

55
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:21,023
<font color="#ffff00">I was worried something had happened.</font>

56
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:24,463
<font color="#ffff00">Did you do something bad to me?</font>

57
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:27,143
<font color="#ffff00">-Of course I did.
-What?</font>

58
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:31,183
<font color="#ffff00">You puked everywhere.</font>

59
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:32,903
<font color="#ffff00">You were filthy.</font>

60
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:36,063
<font color="#ffff00">I cleaned you up
and let you rest on the bed.</font>

61
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:37,663
<font color="#ffff00">And?</font>

62
00:04:39,223 --> 00:04:42,463
<font color="#ffff00">And then, I left the hotel.</font>

63
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:44,823
<font color="#ffff00">Really?</font>

64
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:46,423
<font color="#ffff00">Really.</font>

65
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,543
<font color="#ffff00">All right. That's good then.</font>

66
00:04:51,863 --> 00:04:53,103
<font color="#ffff00">-I need to go.
-Hey.</font>

67
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:54,223
<font color="#ffff00">Wait, Shancai.</font>

68
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:57,623
<font color="#ffff00">You put your head on my shoulder
that day and said</font>

69
00:04:58,223 --> 00:04:59,263
<font color="#ffff00">that you like me.</font>

70
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:00,983
<font color="#ffff00">Is it true?</font>

71
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:08,463
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry. I got confused.</font>

72
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:10,703
<font color="#ffff00">I like you too.</font>

73
00:05:11,943 --> 00:05:14,423
<font color="#ffff00">Why don't you go out with me?</font>

74
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:18,103
<font color="#ffff00">I mistook you for someone else that day.</font>

75
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:19,223
<font color="#ffff00">What are you two doing?</font>

76
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:23,383
<font color="#ffff00">Daoming Si.</font>

77
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:31,663
<font color="#ffff00">Who is this guy?</font>

78
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:39,183
<font color="#ffff00">I'm warning you.</font>

79
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:42,583
<font color="#ffff00">You're dead meat
if you do anything with another guy.</font>

80
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:45,783
<font color="#ffff00">He's...</font>

81
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:50,183
<font color="#ffff00">He's just asking for directions.</font>

82
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:55,943
<font color="#ffff00">Directions?</font>

83
00:05:56,463 --> 00:05:58,223
<font color="#ffff00">Why did he grab your shoulders?</font>

84
00:05:58,863 --> 00:05:59,703
<font color="#ffff00">I'll ask him.</font>

85
00:06:10,023 --> 00:06:10,863
<font color="#ffff00">Hello.</font>

86
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:12,783
<font color="#ffff00">I was asking her for directions.</font>

87
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,543
<font color="#ffff00">Listen carefully.</font>

88
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:17,023
<font color="#ffff00">She's my woman. Don't touch her.</font>

89
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,223
<font color="#ffff00">So this pretty girl
already has a boyfriend.</font>

90
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:28,063
<font color="#ffff00">That's too bad.</font>

91
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:30,023
<font color="#ffff00">What's too bad?</font>

92
00:06:32,943 --> 00:06:34,263
<font color="#ffff00">I'm warning you.</font>

93
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,703
<font color="#ffff00">Stay away from her.</font>

94
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:39,623
<font color="#ffff00">I'm going.</font>

95
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,663
<font color="#ffff00">Hey.</font>

96
00:06:49,303 --> 00:06:50,143
<font color="#ffff00">Daoming Si.</font>

97
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:52,303
<font color="#ffff00">What language were you two using?</font>

98
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:53,503
<font color="#ffff00">French.</font>

99
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,303
<font color="#ffff00">You actually know French?</font>

100
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:56,383
<font color="#ffff00">What's so surprising?</font>

101
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,543
<font color="#ffff00">As the heir of the Daoming Group,
it's normal to know many languages.</font>

102
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:00,943
<font color="#ffff00">Really?</font>

103
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:02,143
<font color="#ffff00">Then...</font>

104
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:03,783
<font color="#ffff00">What were you two talking about?</font>

105
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:07,063
<font color="#ffff00">I told him you're my girlfriend
and asked him to get lost.</font>

106
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,183
<font color="#ffff00">What? Why are you making up stories?</font>

107
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,103
<font color="#ffff00">He's obviously taking advantage of you
and pretending to be lost.</font>

108
00:07:12,343 --> 00:07:13,943
<font color="#ffff00">You're so naive. How silly!</font>

109
00:07:14,023 --> 00:07:15,103
<font color="#ffff00">You're the silly one.</font>

110
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:17,583
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not dating you.
Why do you keep butting in?</font>

111
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,343
<font color="#ffff00">We're not going out?</font>

112
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:40,663
<font color="#ffff00">Hey!</font>

113
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,823
<font color="#ffff00">What the hell?</font>

114
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:46,623
<font color="#ffff00">He's making me feel guilty.</font>

115
00:07:47,823 --> 00:07:48,663
<font color="#ffff00">MINGDE UNIVERSITY POKER CLUB</font>

116
00:07:48,743 --> 00:07:50,943
<font color="#ffff00">What? This is unbelievable.</font>

117
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:51,943
<font color="#ffff00">What is it?</font>

118
00:07:53,543 --> 00:07:55,023
<font color="#ffff00">-My gosh.
-Hey, did you guys see?</font>

119
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:56,143
<font color="#ffff00">-Yes.
-Wow.</font>

120
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:57,783
<font color="#ffff00">I can't believe she did that.</font>

121
00:07:57,863 --> 00:07:58,703
<font color="#ffff00">Look.</font>

122
00:07:58,783 --> 00:07:59,943
<font color="#ffff00">That's her.</font>

123
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:01,303
<font color="#ffff00">Isn't that her?</font>

124
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:02,863
<font color="#ffff00">I don't believe it.</font>

125
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:04,303
<font color="#ffff00">Isn't that her?</font>

126
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:05,263
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

127
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:06,903
<font color="#ffff00">-It's her.
-It's her.</font>

128
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:11,983
<font color="#ffff00">-Yes.
-It's her.</font>

129
00:08:12,063 --> 00:08:13,023
<font color="#ffff00">Don't be ridiculous.</font>

130
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:14,983
<font color="#ffff00">Shancai would never do that.</font>

131
00:08:15,263 --> 00:08:16,183
<font color="#ffff00">We're not making it up.</font>

132
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,703
<font color="#ffff00">She really did lean
on the foreigner that day.</font>

133
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:22,463
<font color="#ffff00">Yes. I even have a photo of her
dancing with Thomas.</font>

134
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,463
<font color="#ffff00">See?</font>

135
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,903
<font color="#ffff00">You're lying.</font>

136
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:30,183
<font color="#ffff00">That's not Shancai.</font>

137
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:31,583
<font color="#ffff00">The photo is fake.</font>

138
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:34,303
<font color="#ffff00">There's the girl we're talking about.
Ask her yourself.</font>

139
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,503
<font color="#ffff00">Dong Shancai.</font>

140
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:44,383
<font color="#ffff00">You spent the night with Thomas, right?</font>

141
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,943
<font color="#ffff00">Look at this.</font>

142
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:50,103
<font color="#ffff00">UGLY DUCKLING DONG SHANCAI
CHEATS ON DAOMING SI</font>

143
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:51,343
<font color="#ffff00">AND SPENDS A NIGHT WITH A FRENCH GUY?</font>

144
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:53,983
<font color="#ffff00">See?</font>

145
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:55,703
<font color="#ffff00">She's not denying it.</font>

146
00:08:55,783 --> 00:08:58,023
<font color="#ffff00">You're the only one
who still thinks she's innocent.</font>

147
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,383
<font color="#ffff00">Why did you two set me up?</font>

148
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:03,743
<font color="#ffff00">Shancai, we're not the ones
who posted the photos.</font>

149
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:05,503
<font color="#ffff00">Don't yell at us.</font>

150
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:06,583
<font color="#ffff00">Right.</font>

151
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:08,743
<font color="#ffff00">You're responsible for your own actions.</font>

152
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:11,023
<font color="#ffff00">I can't believe you did that
to Daoming Si.</font>

153
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,903
<font color="#ffff00">Stop harassing her!</font>

154
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:14,623
<font color="#ffff00">Shancai.</font>

155
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:16,863
<font color="#ffff00">This is a misunderstanding, right?</font>

156
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:20,983
<font color="#ffff00">Just explain it to them.</font>

157
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:22,703
<font color="#ffff00">Shancai!</font>

158
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:54,063
<font color="#ffff00">Hello. Do you know the long-haired
pianist named Thomas?</font>

159
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:55,623
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know where he is?</font>

160
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:57,143
<font color="#ffff00">-Thomas?
-Yes.</font>

161
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,183
<font color="#ffff00">That foreigner just filled in for the day.</font>

162
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:00,543
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not sure where he is.</font>

163
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:24,463
<font color="#ffff00">Isn't Si acting weird?</font>

164
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:27,583
<font color="#ffff00">He's been swimming
back and forth for an hour.</font>

165
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:31,903
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not surprised.</font>

166
00:10:32,103 --> 00:10:34,383
<font color="#ffff00">He must have been annoyed
by Shancai again.</font>

167
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,623
<font color="#ffff00">I thought Si would've gotten Shancai
in the elevator that night.</font>

168
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:42,423
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't think he'd drag it out like this.</font>

169
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:45,623
<font color="#ffff00">Logically speaking,</font>

170
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:49,503
<font color="#ffff00">any girl who has gone out with an F4
would always call back.</font>

171
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:51,703
<font color="#ffff00">They'd ask when the second date is.</font>

172
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:54,183
<font color="#ffff00">-How many girls called you today?
-Do you want to see?</font>

173
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:01,863
<font color="#ffff00">No way.</font>

174
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,543
<font color="#ffff00">-What?
-Look at this.</font>

175
00:11:58,463 --> 00:12:01,823
<font color="#ffff00">What the hell is wrong with you?
We're too old for pranks like that.</font>

176
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:06,703
<font color="#ffff00">Where's my phone?</font>

177
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,743
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Sorry.</i></font>

178
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:21,463
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The person you have reached
is unavailable.</i></font>

179
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:24,343
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Please try again later.</i></font>

180
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:30,303
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Sorry.</i></font>

181
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:32,023
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The person you have reached...</i></font>

182
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:35,063
<font color="#ffff00">What is the photo about?</font>

183
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:36,783
<font color="#ffff00">Why did you frame me?</font>

184
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:56,103
<font color="#ffff00">Shancai. We saw the photo.</font>

185
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:58,263
<font color="#ffff00">What happened
between you and that foreigner?</font>

186
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:01,543
<font color="#ffff00">It's not true.</font>

187
00:13:01,943 --> 00:13:02,943
<font color="#ffff00">It's a misunderstanding.</font>

188
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:05,983
<font color="#ffff00">That night,</font>

189
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:09,143
<font color="#ffff00">Xinhui, Baihe, and Li Zhen</font>

190
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:11,183
<font color="#ffff00">went out for a ladies' night.</font>

191
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:13,663
<font color="#ffff00">I did dance with that guy.</font>

192
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,143
<font color="#ffff00">But nothing else happened.</font>

193
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,063
<font color="#ffff00">So what's the photo about?</font>

194
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:23,663
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not sure.</font>

195
00:13:28,863 --> 00:13:29,783
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Sorry.</i></font>

196
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:35,223
<font color="#ffff00"><i>The person you have reached
is unavailable.</i></font>

197
00:13:35,343 --> 00:13:37,623
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Please try again later.</i></font>

198
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,983
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Why would Daoming Si fall
for a shameless girl like her?</i></font>

199
00:14:00,063 --> 00:14:01,943
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Dong Shancai,
you should be ashamed of yourself.</i></font>

200
00:14:02,023 --> 00:14:03,303
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You've embarrassed Mingde.</i></font>

201
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:05,623
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Dong Shancai, whom are you really dating?</i></font>

202
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:08,303
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Do you like Daoming Si or that foreigner?</i></font>

203
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,623
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I wonder what Daoming Si sees in you.</i></font>

204
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:12,703
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Poor Si. I can't believe he likes you.</i></font>

205
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:14,503
<font color="#ffff00"><i>How did it end up like this?</i></font>

206
00:14:24,503 --> 00:14:25,543
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I must not run.</i></font>

207
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:26,863
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Running away means I'm guilty.</i></font>

208
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:29,863
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I didn't do anything wrong.
Why should I hide?</i></font>

209
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:06,343
<font color="#ffff00">-It's her.
-Yes. Ignore her.</font>

210
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:08,623
<font color="#ffff00">-How dare she show up?
-Right?</font>

211
00:15:08,703 --> 00:15:10,063
<font color="#ffff00">Excuse me.</font>

212
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,583
<font color="#ffff00">She's sitting in front.</font>

213
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:18,143
<font color="#ffff00">She's really sitting here.</font>

214
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:19,543
<font color="#ffff00">-Should we move?
-Gosh.</font>

215
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:21,303
<font color="#ffff00">-Let's go.
-Come on.</font>

216
00:15:27,063 --> 00:15:28,103
<font color="#ffff00">-Let's go.
-Let's go.</font>

217
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,143
<font color="#ffff00">Go.</font>

218
00:15:38,623 --> 00:15:41,063
<font color="#ffff00">Damn you. Why won't you answer my calls?</font>

219
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:42,263
<font color="#ffff00">Are you hiding from me?</font>

220
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:44,503
<font color="#ffff00">Why did you post that photo online?</font>

221
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:48,103
<font color="#ffff00">Face me in person
instead of playing dirty!</font>

222
00:15:48,183 --> 00:15:49,863
<font color="#ffff00">What kind of a man are you?</font>

223
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:53,063
<font color="#ffff00">REENACTING ENGLISH SCENARIO</font>

224
00:15:54,743 --> 00:15:58,143
<font color="#ffff00">Let's have two students come up
for an impromptu session.</font>

225
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:02,583
<font color="#ffff00">You should call up Shancai.
Her English is excellent.</font>

226
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:03,623
<font color="#ffff00">-Okay.
-Right?</font>

227
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:06,223
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, her English is outstanding.</font>

228
00:16:06,303 --> 00:16:07,623
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, let her do it.</font>

229
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:09,063
<font color="#ffff00">She knows a lot of foreigners.</font>

230
00:16:09,143 --> 00:16:10,463
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sure she learned something.</font>

231
00:16:10,543 --> 00:16:12,263
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, stop making up stories, okay?</font>

232
00:16:12,343 --> 00:16:13,463
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't make it up.</font>

233
00:16:14,823 --> 00:16:15,983
<font color="#ffff00">Did I make it up?</font>

234
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:29,703
<font color="#ffff00">Let's go.</font>

235
00:16:47,143 --> 00:16:50,103
<font color="#ffff00">So I don't think Thomas lives in Shanghai.</font>

236
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,023
<font color="#ffff00">He's probably gone back to France.</font>

237
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:58,143
<font color="#ffff00">I think one of Thomas' friends
shared the photos,</font>

238
00:16:58,823 --> 00:17:00,423
<font color="#ffff00">and they were set up.</font>

239
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:03,503
<font color="#ffff00">I wonder</font>

240
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,183
<font color="#ffff00">who's trying to hurt Shancai.</font>

241
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,463
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, you two.
When can I get my phone back?</font>

242
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,583
<font color="#ffff00">It's still being repaired.</font>

243
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:19,303
<font color="#ffff00">You don't have class this afternoon.</font>

244
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:21,503
<font color="#ffff00">Why? I can't come if I don't have class?</font>

245
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:24,543
<font color="#ffff00">Sure, you can.</font>

246
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:27,823
<font color="#ffff00">Hey.</font>

247
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:29,503
<font color="#ffff00">What were you two looking at?</font>

248
00:17:29,663 --> 00:17:30,663
<font color="#ffff00">You're being so secretive.</font>

249
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,423
<font color="#ffff00">We were watching a romantic action movie.</font>

250
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:36,463
<font color="#ffff00">-You won't like it.
-Romance action.</font>

251
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,903
<font color="#ffff00">Liars.</font>

252
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:39,983
<font color="#ffff00">I doubt you were watching a movie.</font>

253
00:17:40,263 --> 00:17:42,143
<font color="#ffff00">-Show me. I want to see.
-Hey!</font>

254
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:44,463
<font color="#ffff00">Si!</font>

255
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:52,303
<font color="#ffff00">What do we do?</font>

256
00:17:57,223 --> 00:17:58,863
<font color="#ffff00">UGLY DUCKLING DONG SHANCAI
CHEATS ON DAOMING SI</font>

257
00:18:03,303 --> 00:18:04,463
<font color="#ffff00">Who is this guy?</font>

258
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:08,103
<font color="#ffff00">He's just asking for directions.</font>

259
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:19,663
<font color="#ffff00">I get it now.</font>

260
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:21,543
<font color="#ffff00">They lied to me.</font>

261
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:24,343
<font color="#ffff00">Asking for directions? Directions, my ass.</font>

262
00:18:28,663 --> 00:18:29,503
<font color="#ffff00">-Hey, Si.
-Si.</font>

263
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,423
<font color="#ffff00">-Calm down. Shancai is actually--
-Get off!</font>

264
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:33,663
<font color="#ffff00">Si.</font>

265
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:38,183
<font color="#ffff00">-What now?
-Let's go after him.</font>

266
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,143
<font color="#ffff00">Take this to the classroom first
and then the rest.</font>

267
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:03,663
<font color="#ffff00">Are you okay?</font>

268
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:05,583
<font color="#ffff00">I'm fine.</font>

269
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:06,823
<font color="#ffff00">We're sorry.</font>

270
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,263
<font color="#ffff00">Isn't she...</font>

271
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:13,743
<font color="#ffff00">Let's go.</font>

272
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:35,343
<font color="#ffff00">Daoming Si.</font>

273
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:39,503
<font color="#ffff00">That foreigner wasn't asking
for directions, was he?</font>

274
00:19:41,543 --> 00:19:42,383
<font color="#ffff00">He's...</font>

275
00:19:44,823 --> 00:19:46,943
<font color="#ffff00">You two went to a hotel, didn't you?</font>

276
00:19:49,783 --> 00:19:50,623
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

277
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:52,543
<font color="#ffff00">Nothing happened with him.</font>

278
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:55,543
<font color="#ffff00">Those photos on Weibo
are a misunderstanding.</font>

279
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:58,063
<font color="#ffff00">Then why did you lie to me?</font>

280
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:05,783
<font color="#ffff00">I did lie about who he was,</font>

281
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:08,863
<font color="#ffff00">but there's nothing between us.</font>

282
00:20:12,663 --> 00:20:14,783
<font color="#ffff00">I don't care if everyone
believes the rumors</font>

283
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:17,103
<font color="#ffff00">and nobody believes me.</font>

284
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:19,463
<font color="#ffff00">It's fine with me.</font>

285
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:22,503
<font color="#ffff00">As long as...</font>

286
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:26,783
<font color="#ffff00">As long as you still trust me.</font>

287
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:33,423
<font color="#ffff00">We've been sitting here for three hours.</font>

288
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,783
<font color="#ffff00">How long are we going to wait?</font>

289
00:21:37,823 --> 00:21:41,143
<font color="#ffff00">I think all my blood will be sucked dry
by the mosquitoes.</font>

290
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,703
<font color="#ffff00">I'll be a master mosquito killer
before the night ends.</font>

291
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:54,423
<font color="#ffff00">Si must be outraged.</font>

292
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:57,023
<font color="#ffff00">The girl who the almighty Daoming Si likes</font>

293
00:21:57,303 --> 00:21:59,223
<font color="#ffff00">has become the girl
everyone hates and criticizes.</font>

294
00:22:00,103 --> 00:22:01,103
<font color="#ffff00">You know what?</font>

295
00:22:01,183 --> 00:22:03,423
<font color="#ffff00">-If it happened to us--
-No way.</font>

296
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,063
<font color="#ffff00">We'd never like a girl to that extent.</font>

297
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,023
<font color="#ffff00">Or we should say</font>

298
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:10,423
<font color="#ffff00">there is no girl that we can't handle.</font>

299
00:22:10,903 --> 00:22:11,743
<font color="#ffff00">You're right.</font>

300
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,303
<font color="#ffff00">But why must three people suffer</font>

301
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,983
<font color="#ffff00">when only one person is broken-hearted?</font>

302
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:30,623
<font color="#ffff00">Lei is so lucky he isn't here.</font>

303
00:22:38,903 --> 00:22:41,703
<font color="#ffff00">I think we won't get through
to Si right now.</font>

304
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,223
<font color="#ffff00">There are two options.</font>

305
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:48,183
<font color="#ffff00">One, get him drunk and drag him home.</font>

306
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:50,983
<font color="#ffff00">Two, knock him out and drag him home.</font>

307
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:53,503
<font color="#ffff00">This is all the alcohol left.</font>

308
00:22:54,463 --> 00:22:55,863
<font color="#ffff00">We'll have to use force then.</font>

309
00:22:56,063 --> 00:22:56,983
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, I'll do it.</font>

310
00:22:57,063 --> 00:22:57,903
<font color="#ffff00">-I'll do it.
-Let me.</font>

311
00:22:57,983 --> 00:22:58,823
<font color="#ffff00">-I'll do it.
-Me...</font>

312
00:22:58,903 --> 00:22:59,743
<font color="#ffff00">-I'll...
-Let me.</font>

313
00:23:00,703 --> 00:23:01,703
<font color="#ffff00">Where's Si?</font>

314
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,423
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, why are you standing here?</font>

315
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:05,103
<font color="#ffff00"><i>-Si.</i>
-Si.</font>

316
00:24:06,983 --> 00:24:09,023
<font color="#ffff00"><i>-Why are you sitting here?</i>
-Why are you sitting here?</font>

317
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:45,383
<font color="#ffff00">Shancai.</font>

318
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:47,863
<font color="#ffff00">Why?</font>

319
00:24:49,143 --> 00:24:50,503
<font color="#ffff00">Why did you lie to me?</font>

320
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:53,703
<font color="#ffff00">You want me to trust you, right?</font>

321
00:24:53,983 --> 00:24:56,063
<font color="#ffff00">Why did you lie then?</font>

322
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:10,183
<font color="#ffff00">You're awake.</font>

323
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:16,183
<font color="#ffff00">Where am I?</font>

324
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,023
<font color="#ffff00">My house.</font>

325
00:25:19,743 --> 00:25:20,783
<font color="#ffff00">How did I get here?</font>

326
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:22,943
<font color="#ffff00">You were drunk last night.</font>

327
00:25:23,343 --> 00:25:24,823
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't know where to take you.</font>

328
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:26,623
<font color="#ffff00">I'm going then.</font>

329
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:29,623
<font color="#ffff00">I made breakfast.</font>

330
00:25:30,183 --> 00:25:31,903
<font color="#ffff00">-Have some before you go.
-It's okay.</font>

331
00:25:33,943 --> 00:25:35,583
<font color="#ffff00">-I'll help you.
-Get off.</font>

332
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:39,583
<font color="#ffff00">Daoming Si.</font>

333
00:25:40,183 --> 00:25:41,623
<font color="#ffff00">Do you really hate me that much?</font>

334
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:46,063
<font color="#ffff00">Can you at least tell me</font>

335
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:47,983
<font color="#ffff00">why you hate me?</font>

336
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:52,543
<font color="#ffff00">I don't hate you. I just don't care.</font>

337
00:25:56,383 --> 00:25:57,743
<font color="#ffff00">How am I different from Shancai?</font>

338
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:02,583
<font color="#ffff00">We are both from an average family.</font>

339
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:04,623
<font color="#ffff00">We're both plain-looking.</font>

340
00:26:05,423 --> 00:26:07,703
<font color="#ffff00">We are girls that blend
into the background.</font>

341
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:09,783
<font color="#ffff00">Why do you like Shancai</font>

342
00:26:10,463 --> 00:26:11,983
<font color="#ffff00">but not even notice me?</font>

343
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:12,903
<font color="#ffff00">Shut up.</font>

344
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:17,263
<font color="#ffff00">I know.</font>

345
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:20,223
<font color="#ffff00">You like girls like Shancai,</font>

346
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:22,143
<font color="#ffff00">who look innocent and naive,</font>

347
00:26:22,223 --> 00:26:24,583
<font color="#ffff00">but jump on a guy any chance she gets.</font>

348
00:26:25,303 --> 00:26:28,223
<font color="#ffff00">If that's the case, I can do it too.</font>

349
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:37,543
<font color="#ffff00">-Take your hands off or I'll make you.
-I won't.</font>

350
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:40,583
<font color="#ffff00">If that's what you want,
I can be like Shancai too.</font>

351
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:44,183
<font color="#ffff00">I can be loud and bold,
pretending to be strong.</font>

352
00:26:45,263 --> 00:26:46,903
<font color="#ffff00">I can do everything you want.</font>

353
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:49,303
<font color="#ffff00">I'll become whatever you want me to be.</font>

354
00:26:54,983 --> 00:26:56,423
<font color="#ffff00">Don't compare yourself to Shancai.</font>

355
00:26:56,503 --> 00:26:58,903
<font color="#ffff00">-She's not like you.
-How?</font>

356
00:27:00,503 --> 00:27:02,303
<font color="#ffff00">Shancai would never do that.</font>

357
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:11,983
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Who on earth posted those photos?</i></font>

358
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:14,743
<font color="#ffff00">Why did that Thomas suddenly disappear?</font>

359
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:16,743
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know.</font>

360
00:27:19,383 --> 00:27:20,743
<font color="#ffff00">So what are you going to do now?</font>

361
00:27:21,063 --> 00:27:24,303
<font color="#ffff00">Aren't you going to clear your name?</font>

362
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:28,783
<font color="#ffff00">I know I didn't do anything wrong.</font>

363
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:32,223
<font color="#ffff00">I believe that justice will prevail.</font>

364
00:27:34,823 --> 00:27:37,063
<font color="#ffff00">I believe the truth will be revealed soon.</font>

365
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:38,783
<font color="#ffff00">Hang in there.</font>

366
00:27:40,863 --> 00:27:41,863
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

367
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:00,583
<font color="#ffff00">I don't give a damn.</font>

368
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:01,543
<font color="#ffff00">Well?</font>

369
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:04,143
<font color="#ffff00">You can't have me even
if you give me everything in the world.</font>

370
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:06,143
<font color="#ffff00">If I were you,</font>

371
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:08,463
<font color="#ffff00">I would feel very lonely.</font>

372
00:28:08,783 --> 00:28:10,303
<font color="#ffff00">I would probably become rebellious.</font>

373
00:28:11,383 --> 00:28:13,183
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I don't care if everyone
believes the rumors</i></font>

374
00:28:13,263 --> 00:28:14,743
<font color="#ffff00">and nobody believes me.</font>

375
00:28:15,623 --> 00:28:16,903
<font color="#ffff00">It's fine with me.</font>

376
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:18,863
<font color="#ffff00">As long as...</font>

377
00:28:21,663 --> 00:28:23,183
<font color="#ffff00">As long as you still trust me.</font>

378
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:25,863
<font color="#ffff00">What am I doing?</font>

379
00:28:26,543 --> 00:28:27,903
<font color="#ffff00">How could I do this to her?</font>

380
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:37,503
<font color="#ffff00">TALENT'S TEA SHOP</font>

381
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:45,943
<font color="#ffff00">Hey.</font>

382
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:48,383
<font color="#ffff00">Doesn't she look familiar to you?</font>

383
00:28:48,863 --> 00:28:51,823
<font color="#ffff00">Isn't she the girl we met
in the alley that day?</font>

384
00:28:55,223 --> 00:28:57,263
<font color="#ffff00">-Come here.
-Hey, what are you doing?</font>

385
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,063
<font color="#ffff00">Let me go!</font>

386
00:28:59,623 --> 00:29:01,263
<font color="#ffff00">Let me go! Let go!</font>

387
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:04,223
<font color="#ffff00">Let me go!</font>

388
00:29:04,463 --> 00:29:05,383
<font color="#ffff00">Let go!</font>

389
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:06,863
<font color="#ffff00">Let me go!</font>

390
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,023
<font color="#ffff00">Miss, we meet again.</font>

391
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:12,183
<font color="#ffff00">Stay away.</font>

392
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:27,223
<font color="#ffff00">You bit me!</font>

393
00:29:32,023 --> 00:29:35,023
<font color="#ffff00">You bastards will get
what's coming for you!</font>

394
00:30:22,023 --> 00:30:24,623
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry, I'm late.</font>

395
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:31,383
<font color="#ffff00">Do you believe me?</font>

396
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,143
<font color="#ffff00">If you say you didn't do it,
I believe you.</font>

397
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,063
<font color="#ffff00">-Mr. Liu, prepare a bath.
-Okay.</font>

398
00:31:28,743 --> 00:31:30,783
<font color="#ffff00">It hurts! Can you be more gentle?</font>

399
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:35,343
<font color="#ffff00">I'm treating your wound.
There's no need to yell.</font>

400
00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:37,503
<font color="#ffff00">People would think I'm hurting you.</font>

401
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:44,223
<font color="#ffff00">Who told you to go to my house</font>

402
00:31:44,823 --> 00:31:46,743
<font color="#ffff00">and ask my mom where I work?</font>

403
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:49,783
<font color="#ffff00">Who would've saved you
if I hadn't gone to the shop?</font>

404
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:55,383
<font color="#ffff00">But you shouldn't have told them
that I'm staying at your place.</font>

405
00:31:56,103 --> 00:31:57,263
<font color="#ffff00">They may get the wrong idea.</font>

406
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:58,343
<font color="#ffff00">I saved you.</font>

407
00:31:58,663 --> 00:31:59,903
<font color="#ffff00">I'm letting you stay here.</font>

408
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:02,863
<font color="#ffff00">But instead of thanking me,
you're complaining?</font>

409
00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:06,863
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks.</font>

410
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:09,223
<font color="#ffff00">What? I can't hear you.</font>

411
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,543
<font color="#ffff00">There's no need to yell.</font>

412
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:14,943
<font color="#ffff00">Hey.</font>

413
00:32:15,423 --> 00:32:18,103
<font color="#ffff00">Nothing happened between you
and that foreigner, right?</font>

414
00:32:19,623 --> 00:32:20,663
<font color="#ffff00">You're an idiot.</font>

415
00:32:21,383 --> 00:32:25,423
<font color="#ffff00">I barely knew him.
Why would I do anything with him?</font>

416
00:32:28,023 --> 00:32:29,063
<font color="#ffff00">That had better be true.</font>

417
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:30,863
<font color="#ffff00">I'm so angry, I could kill him.</font>

418
00:32:33,423 --> 00:32:34,863
<font color="#ffff00">Why are you so pissed off?</font>

419
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:38,183
<font color="#ffff00">-Are you jealous?
-Yes, I am.</font>

420
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,223
<font color="#ffff00">I'm really jealous!</font>

421
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:58,663
<font color="#ffff00">Because I like you.</font>

422
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:03,583
<font color="#ffff00">You...</font>

423
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:07,463
<font color="#ffff00">Wait.</font>

424
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:09,623
<font color="#ffff00">Not even for 0.5 seconds.</font>

425
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:24,863
<font color="#ffff00">I'm going to sleep.</font>

426
00:33:41,663 --> 00:33:42,623
<font color="#ffff00">Hey.</font>

427
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:45,423
<font color="#ffff00">Where's the guest room?</font>

428
00:33:46,183 --> 00:33:47,543
<font color="#ffff00">The third room on the right.</font>

429
00:33:48,223 --> 00:33:49,303
<font color="#ffff00">-Okay.
-Shancai.</font>

430
00:33:52,303 --> 00:33:53,423
<font color="#ffff00">I mean it.</font>

431
00:33:53,863 --> 00:33:54,703
<font color="#ffff00">Think about it.</font>

432
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:27,983
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I don't believe it.</i></font>

433
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:30,143
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Daoming Si actually likes me?</i></font>

434
00:34:35,703 --> 00:34:37,943
<font color="#ffff00"><i>And I didn't stop him from kissing me.</i></font>

435
00:34:39,263 --> 00:34:40,703
<font color="#ffff00"><i>What is wrong with me?</i></font>

436
00:35:09,383 --> 00:35:10,223
<font color="#ffff00">Yes?</font>

437
00:35:10,703 --> 00:35:11,543
<font color="#ffff00">Come with me.</font>

438
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,423
<font color="#ffff00">She's in there.</font>

439
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,103
<font color="#ffff00">What's going on?</font>

440
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:34,103
<font color="#ffff00">The person who posted
those photos is inside.</font>

441
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:36,223
<font color="#ffff00">See for yourself.</font>

442
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:48,143
<font color="#ffff00">Li Zhen?</font>

443
00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:49,583
<font color="#ffff00">Shancai.</font>

444
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,063
<font color="#ffff00">Why are you guys here?</font>

445
00:35:55,383 --> 00:35:56,223
<font color="#ffff00">Come in.</font>

446
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,423
<font color="#ffff00">My place is a bit messy.
I hope you don't mind.</font>

447
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:03,783
<font color="#ffff00">Have a seat.</font>

448
00:36:05,023 --> 00:36:07,143
<font color="#ffff00">It looks like someone
is still feigning innocence.</font>

449
00:36:11,263 --> 00:36:13,703
<font color="#ffff00">What do you mean?</font>

450
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:17,063
<font color="#ffff00">I think you made a mistake.</font>

451
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:21,263
<font color="#ffff00">Li Zhen can't be the one who set me up.</font>

452
00:36:23,623 --> 00:36:24,703
<font color="#ffff00">Li Zhen.</font>

453
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:28,303
<font color="#ffff00">You went to high school with Shancai
and attended Mingde University too.</font>

454
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:31,703
<font color="#ffff00">Thomas left and couldn't be reached,</font>

455
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:33,663
<font color="#ffff00">but we did some digging.</font>

456
00:36:33,743 --> 00:36:36,583
<font color="#ffff00">The Weibo user that posted
those defamatory photos</font>

457
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:38,063
<font color="#ffff00">was you.</font>

458
00:36:39,023 --> 00:36:40,023
<font color="#ffff00">Spit it out.</font>

459
00:36:40,623 --> 00:36:41,463
<font color="#ffff00">Why did you do it?</font>

460
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:44,383
<font color="#ffff00">Why?</font>

461
00:36:45,143 --> 00:36:46,183
<font color="#ffff00">Well...</font>

462
00:36:46,343 --> 00:36:48,703
<font color="#ffff00">Perhaps you prefer to settle it in court.</font>

463
00:36:49,423 --> 00:36:50,383
<font color="#ffff00">I'll call the lawyer.</font>

464
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,783
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

465
00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:00,223
<font color="#ffff00">Fine. I admit it.</font>

466
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:04,183
<font color="#ffff00">I posted those photos online.</font>

467
00:37:09,503 --> 00:37:11,863
<font color="#ffff00">So you set me up with Thomas?</font>

468
00:37:13,383 --> 00:37:14,503
<font color="#ffff00">Then how did you get the photos?</font>

469
00:37:17,623 --> 00:37:18,543
<font color="#ffff00">That night,</font>

470
00:37:19,143 --> 00:37:20,423
<font color="#ffff00">Thomas invited you to dance.</font>

471
00:37:22,263 --> 00:37:24,023
<font color="#ffff00"><i>You two were having so much fun.</i></font>

472
00:37:25,983 --> 00:37:28,023
<font color="#ffff00">I could tell he was interested in you.</font>

473
00:37:36,383 --> 00:37:37,223
<font color="#ffff00">Hi.</font>

474
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:39,103
<font color="#ffff00">-I feel sick. I need to go.
-Hey.</font>

475
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:42,383
<font color="#ffff00">-Can you look after my friend for me?
-All right.</font>

476
00:37:43,903 --> 00:37:46,943
<font color="#ffff00">Can you send me a photo
wherever you go later?</font>

477
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:48,383
<font color="#ffff00">Just so I'd know she's safe.</font>

478
00:37:48,463 --> 00:37:49,423
<font color="#ffff00">All right.</font>

479
00:38:07,223 --> 00:38:10,303
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Don't worry. I dropped your friend off
at the hotel safely.</i></font>

480
00:38:30,823 --> 00:38:31,783
<font color="#ffff00">The next day,</font>

481
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:34,783
<font color="#ffff00">Thomas called me to say he likes you
and wanted to see you.</font>

482
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:37,263
<font color="#ffff00">I saw you two looking
really friendly on campus.</font>

483
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:39,423
<font color="#ffff00">But then...</font>

484
00:38:39,503 --> 00:38:40,583
<font color="#ffff00">-Daoming Si.
<i>-I saw you and Daoming Si</i></font>

485
00:38:40,663 --> 00:38:42,143
<font color="#ffff00"><i>arguing by the school entrance.</i></font>

486
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:44,303
<font color="#ffff00">Who is this guy?</font>

487
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:45,823
<font color="#ffff00">He's just asking for directions.</font>

488
00:38:47,143 --> 00:38:48,423
<font color="#ffff00">Why did he grab your shoulders?</font>

489
00:38:48,503 --> 00:38:49,383
<font color="#ffff00">I'll ask him.</font>

490
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:51,863
<font color="#ffff00">Listen carefully.</font>

491
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:53,063
<font color="#ffff00">She's my woman.</font>

492
00:38:53,183 --> 00:38:54,223
<font color="#ffff00">Don't touch her.</font>

493
00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:56,383
<font color="#ffff00">So this pretty girl
already has a boyfriend.</font>

494
00:38:56,863 --> 00:39:00,903
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I was furious as I looked at the photo
Thomas had sent.</i></font>

495
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:02,543
<font color="#ffff00"><i>So I shared it.</i></font>

496
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:07,383
<font color="#ffff00">POST TO WEIBO</font>

497
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,223
<font color="#ffff00">I don't understand.</font>

498
00:39:13,343 --> 00:39:14,903
<font color="#ffff00">Aren't we good friends?</font>

499
00:39:15,743 --> 00:39:16,823
<font color="#ffff00">Why were you furious?</font>

500
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:18,463
<font color="#ffff00">Good friends?</font>

501
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:20,463
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry,</font>

502
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,703
<font color="#ffff00">but that's too big of a burden for me.</font>

503
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:24,463
<font color="#ffff00">What do you mean?</font>

504
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:26,543
<font color="#ffff00">What "good friends"?</font>

505
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:30,223
<font color="#ffff00">Did you think about me when Qinghe</font>

506
00:39:30,303 --> 00:39:32,983
<font color="#ffff00">-invited you to Sanya with F4?
-Qinghe was the one who invited me.</font>

507
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:36,343
<font color="#ffff00">At the time, I didn't know
F4 was going to be there.</font>

508
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:39,623
<font color="#ffff00">What about lying to me
about Jing's birthday party</font>

509
00:39:39,703 --> 00:39:42,423
<font color="#ffff00">and then embarrassing me
by not picking up my call?</font>

510
00:39:43,143 --> 00:39:46,743
<font color="#ffff00">My phone was dead at Jing's party.</font>

511
00:39:46,823 --> 00:39:48,503
<font color="#ffff00">I called you after that, didn't I?</font>

512
00:39:49,023 --> 00:39:50,943
<font color="#ffff00">You said you couldn't come
because you were busy.</font>

513
00:39:51,023 --> 00:39:52,383
<font color="#ffff00">I wasn't busy.</font>

514
00:39:52,783 --> 00:39:54,023
<font color="#ffff00">I couldn't get in.</font>

515
00:39:54,383 --> 00:39:55,583
<font color="#ffff00">You couldn't get in?</font>

516
00:39:58,463 --> 00:40:00,703
<font color="#ffff00">I wore an expensive dress</font>

517
00:40:01,503 --> 00:40:03,663
<font color="#ffff00">that cost three times
my monthly living expenses.</font>

518
00:40:04,743 --> 00:40:06,543
<font color="#ffff00">I stood at the door of Jing's house.</font>

519
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,583
<font color="#ffff00">I called you many times,
I couldn't get through.</font>

520
00:40:12,983 --> 00:40:14,583
<font color="#ffff00"><i>While you guys were having fun inside,</i></font>

521
00:40:15,103 --> 00:40:17,583
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I stood out in the rain
and denied entry by the guards.</i></font>

522
00:40:18,063 --> 00:40:20,143
<font color="#ffff00">They wouldn't let me in
no matter what I said.</font>

523
00:40:20,263 --> 00:40:21,543
<font color="#ffff00">Did you consider how I felt?</font>

524
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:24,903
<font color="#ffff00">-I did call you!
-Don't you get it?</font>

525
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,783
<font color="#ffff00">Jing's invitation</font>

526
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:30,543
<font color="#ffff00">was meant for you.</font>

527
00:40:32,183 --> 00:40:34,143
<font color="#ffff00">It was for Dong Shancai.</font>

528
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:38,703
<font color="#ffff00">It didn't matter
that my dress cost 6,000 yuan.</font>

529
00:40:40,503 --> 00:40:42,383
<font color="#ffff00">I'm just a supporting character.</font>

530
00:40:43,743 --> 00:40:44,983
<font color="#ffff00">Your accessory.</font>

531
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:47,743
<font color="#ffff00">Nobody pays attention to me.</font>

532
00:40:50,063 --> 00:40:51,503
<font color="#ffff00">I could attend the party</font>

533
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:55,823
<font color="#ffff00">because I'm Shancai's friend,
not because I'm Li Zhen.</font>

534
00:40:57,103 --> 00:40:58,503
<font color="#ffff00">Why would you think that?</font>

535
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:00,103
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not imagining things.</font>

536
00:41:00,943 --> 00:41:02,303
<font color="#ffff00">It's the truth.</font>

537
00:41:03,783 --> 00:41:04,943
<font color="#ffff00">That's the saddest part.</font>

538
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:07,823
<font color="#ffff00">If you really believed that,</font>

539
00:41:08,623 --> 00:41:10,463
<font color="#ffff00">why didn't you tell me how you felt?</font>

540
00:41:11,223 --> 00:41:13,303
<font color="#ffff00">Because I have my pride too, okay?</font>

541
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:14,543
<font color="#ffff00">You're just jealous of Shancai.</font>

542
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:16,783
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, I admit it.</font>

543
00:41:19,423 --> 00:41:20,423
<font color="#ffff00">That day,</font>

544
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:23,463
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I realized while walking home in the rain.</i></font>

545
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:26,583
<font color="#ffff00"><i>No matter how hard I try,</i></font>

546
00:41:26,663 --> 00:41:29,463
<font color="#ffff00">or how much effort I put in
to please others, it won't matter.</font>

547
00:41:31,063 --> 00:41:32,703
<font color="#ffff00">I should learn from you.</font>

548
00:41:34,023 --> 00:41:36,063
<font color="#ffff00">Have a pair of innocent-looking eyes.</font>

549
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:38,303
<font color="#ffff00">Pretend to be nice.</font>

550
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:42,783
<font color="#ffff00">Play hard to get with guys.</font>

551
00:41:43,783 --> 00:41:45,023
<font color="#ffff00">After hurting someone,</font>

552
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,463
<font color="#ffff00">just brush it off
by saying it wasn't intentional.</font>

553
00:41:47,663 --> 00:41:49,063
<font color="#ffff00">Even if that were true,</font>

554
00:41:50,023 --> 00:41:53,183
<font color="#ffff00">you shouldn't have done what you did
to defame and hurt me!</font>

555
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:55,623
<font color="#ffff00">You made people turn on me.</font>

556
00:41:57,183 --> 00:41:58,743
<font color="#ffff00">That's because I wanted you to know</font>

557
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,783
<font color="#ffff00">how it felt to be hated.</font>

558
00:42:01,303 --> 00:42:02,183
<font color="#ffff00">Get off.</font>

559
00:42:02,663 --> 00:42:04,143
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Just like what I've had to endure.</i></font>

560
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,583
<font color="#ffff00">Don't compare yourself to Shancai.</font>

561
00:42:07,663 --> 00:42:08,863
<font color="#ffff00">She's not like you.</font>

562
00:42:16,823 --> 00:42:17,703
<font color="#ffff00">Li Zhen.</font>

563
00:42:19,343 --> 00:42:20,983
<font color="#ffff00">I am so disappointed in you.</font>

564
00:42:22,503 --> 00:42:24,703
<font color="#ffff00">I can't believe
this is what you thought of me.</font>

565
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:30,183
<font color="#ffff00">If you're unhappy with me, just tell me.</font>

566
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:34,623
<font color="#ffff00">Why did you have to resort to that
and stab me in the back?</font>

567
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,663
<font color="#ffff00">You don't deserve to be my friend.</font>

568
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:41,423
<font color="#ffff00">Whatever.</font>

569
00:42:42,223 --> 00:42:43,063
<font color="#ffff00">The point is,</font>

570
00:42:43,703 --> 00:42:45,183
<font color="#ffff00">I don't need a friend like you either.</font>

571
00:42:46,383 --> 00:42:47,383
<font color="#ffff00">I no longer care.</font>

572
00:42:53,423 --> 00:42:54,943
<font color="#ffff00">I'm really sad.</font>

573
00:42:57,703 --> 00:42:59,823
<font color="#ffff00">So sad that I wish I could
hit you and scold you.</font>

574
00:43:03,463 --> 00:43:05,303
<font color="#ffff00">But I have nothing to say to you.</font>

575
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:16,743
<font color="#ffff00">Li Zhen.</font>

576
00:43:17,623 --> 00:43:20,143
<font color="#ffff00">There are many things
that are unfair in this world.</font>

577
00:43:21,343 --> 00:43:24,103
<font color="#ffff00">But that doesn't mean
you should treat yourself unfairly.</font>
