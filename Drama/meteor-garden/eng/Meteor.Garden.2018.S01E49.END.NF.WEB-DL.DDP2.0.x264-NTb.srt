A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 49

3
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,400
I ask of the world, what is love?

4
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,760
People live and die for it.

5
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,160
I ask of the world, what is love?

6
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,960
People live and die for it.

7
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,520
Why isn't the spell working?

8
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,800
Shancai, you're not devoted enough.

9
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,840
All right.

10
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,640
If we can only conjure F3,

11
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,720
just pick one of them
to be your husband then.

12
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,040
Shancai.

13
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,240
I, Meizuo, am one of F4 members
with the longest legs, smallest face,

14
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,560
best humor, and funniest jokes.

15
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll never call you stupid or short.

16
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,880
I won't call you an idiot
or make fun of you.

17
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Meizuo, even though
you're the nicest to me in F4,

18
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,080
don't you like older women?

19
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,840
I'm younger than you.

20
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,640
I guess so.

21
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,120
Older women are more sophisticated.
They aren't too clingy.

22
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,160
I guess I'll keep going after older women.

23
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,920
Shancai.

24
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,040
I, Ximen, am one of F4 members
who knows the most about women.

25
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,160
Whenever girls are with me,

26
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,400
I can tell what they're thinking
from their movements and expressions.

27
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,920
I know what girls want.

28
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,280
You'll be very happy with me.

29
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,680
I'll cherish your every tear.

30
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,240
You should choose me.

31
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,600
XIMEN, MY BELOVED

32
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,320
Hey. Don't you have Xiaoyou already?

33
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,680
I'm warning you,

34
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,000
if you make Xiaoyou sad in any way,
I'll never forgive you.

35
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,640
You're being very annoying.

36
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,800
-I'm just kidding.
-You're not allowed to.

37
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,040
I love Xiaoyou.

38
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,880
You know that.

39
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,800
Shancai.

40
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,160
I don't need to say anything
to make you understand.

41
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,520
<i>Huaze Lei, I understand.</i>

42
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,000
<i>You look cold on the surface,
but you're very passionate inside.</i>

43
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,760
<i>You're very sincere to your friends.</i>

44
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,840
<i>Whenever I'm frustrated, sad, or angry,</i>

45
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,200
<i>you're always by my side,
giving me courage.</i>

46
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,440
<i>To me, you're like an angel.</i>

47
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,880
<i>The fact that you're going abroad
to study music makes me sad.</i>

48
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,920
<i>I'm scared that I won't see you again.</i>

49
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,680
So do you still choose Daoming Si?

50
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,640
Yes.

51
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,880
We've loved, hated and hurt each other.

52
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,240
After all that,

53
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,200
regardless of the outcome
and the challenges,

54
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,240
in every minute of my life,
I love him with all my heart.

55
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,720
All right.

56
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,640
Then we'll gather together
and summon Daoming Si for you.

57
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,720
Shancai.

58
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,080
Will you marry me?

59
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,040
Hey, Shancai.

60
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,040
You're the prettiest bride in the world.

61
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,520
You and Daoming Si
will live happily ever after.

62
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,280
Shancai, you're so pretty today.
We wish you a happy life.

63
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
I...

64
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,960
This is my 120th time giving up on you.

65
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,640
Shancai, I will always
be your best friend.

66
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,040
I wish you happiness.

67
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,960
Shancai,

68
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,640
<i>À la vôtre.</i>

69
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,920
It's so touching. All the best.

70
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,400
If Si takes good care of you,
I promise I won't beat him up.

71
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,080
Shancai, if you have babies,
I can be your nanny.

72
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,480
Is...

73
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,120
Is this a dream? Or is this real?

74
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,160
Shancai, you really are an idiot.
You're so easy to fool.

75
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,040
She's so silly.

76
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,520
Si, you can still call it off now.

77
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,160
Shancai.

78
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,320
You and Si were made for each other.

79
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,920
You guys lied to me?

80
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,480
-Daoming Zhuang!
-That's enough!

81
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,480
Are you getting married or not?

82
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,520
Yes.

83
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Daoming Si.

84
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,000
Do you take Shancai
to be your wedded wife?

85
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,080
Do you promise to love her,

86
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,160
comfort her, honor and keep her
for better or for worse,

87
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,560
for richer or for poorer,
in sickness and in health,

88
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,120
and forsaking all others,

89
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,280
to be faithful to her,
so long as you both shall live?

90
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,360
I do.

91
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,840
Dong Shancai.

92
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,960
Do you take Si to be your wedded husband?

93
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,560
Do you promise to love him, protect him,

94
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,280
comfort him, and support him

95
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,240
so long as you both shall live?

96
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,880
I do.

97
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,480
We are here to celebrate

98
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,400
this couple who has gone through

99
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,640
challenges and hardships together.

100
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,280
And they still remain true to each other.

101
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,480
I...

102
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,120
now officially pronounce you
husband and wife.

103
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,600
<i>Someone who's very important to me</i>

104
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,400
<i>is called Dong Shancai.</i>

105
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,040
<i>She's the girl that I like.</i>

106
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,680
<i>I hope you can also accept her.</i>

107
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,360
<i>I'll make the decisions for my life.</i>

108
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,400
<i>Why are you talking about your life to me?</i>

109
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
<i>Nonsense.</i>

110
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,720
<i>My life is you.</i>

111
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,400
You're going to graduate school here
so you can graduate with me?

112
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,920
I'm so happy!

113
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,240
I'm so happy too!

114
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,480
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

115
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,040
<i>It has nothing to do with you
being a superwoman or not.</i>

116
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,640
<i>I know this doesn't make me cute at all.</i>

117
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,720
<i>I'm stubborn and unreasonable.</i>

118
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,160
<i>But I hope you can accept the way I am.</i>

119
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,480
<i>Didn't I tell you before?</i>

120
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,240
<i>No matter what happens,
I need to know where you are.</i>

121
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,640
From now on,
I will do my best to protect you.

122
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,920
You're finally in my arms.
I'll never let go.

123
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,040
Daoming Si.

124
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,400
Let's make our relationship official.

125
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,120
<i>This is the happiest
I've been in this lifetime.</i>

126
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,920
<i>It would be nice</i>

127
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,000
<i>if we can spend our lives like this.</i>

128
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,320
<i>Then let's make a deal.</i>

129
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,960
<i>We'll spend each day like this
in our next lifetime.</i>

130
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,280
<i>Okay?</i>

131
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,000
Daoming Si, do you smell
something burning?

132
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,040
I think I do.

133
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,240
Mom, what are you doing?

134
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,360
I'm making breakfast.

135
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,920
Why didn't you ask me to do it?

136
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,480
-I can do it.
-Why?

137
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,200
Do you think I can't even make breakfast?

138
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,280
But I guess,

139
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,160
in the past years,

140
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,360
I've been a successful businesswoman.

141
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,040
I am lacking some daily life skills.

142
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,400
Mother, don't say that.

143
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,040
You're doing very well.

144
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,600
Look at you,

145
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,440
you're smart, intelligent, and capable.

146
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,400
Even your face and body
can't be compared to anyone.

147
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,920
You're doing better than everyone else.

148
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:27,160
All you did was burn the toast and fish.

149
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,160
You don't need to say that.

150
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,120
I actually wanted to tell you something.

151
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,200
This was going to be the last breakfast
I made for you before I leave.

152
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,240
Wait.

153
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,760
Leave? Where are you going?

154
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,480
I think I need to learn
how to be independent now.

155
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,800
Mom, do you think you're not independent?

156
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,280
I'm not independent enough.

157
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,560
In the past years,

158
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,880
I've been too dependent
on my company and my job.

159
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,160
Sometimes I think,

160
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,000
if I don't have my job,

161
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,200
what will I have left?

162
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,880
That's why I decided

163
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,000
that I want to take a break.

164
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,880
I want to get outside

165
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,920
and see what the world is like.

166
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,960
Are you saying...

167
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,520
Yes.

168
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,200
I want to travel alone.

169
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,040
I want to learn how to make breakfast
and take care of myself.

170
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,160
I want to learn how to take the subway.

171
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
I want to learn how to take selfies.

172
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,640
I want to let go of everything.

173
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,120
I want to go see some friends
who have nothing to do with my business.

174
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,440
I want to chat with them about everything.

175
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,840
After I leave,

176
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,880
you guys can take over.

177
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,800
I wanted to make breakfast for you.

178
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,400
But I guess this breakfast...

179
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,880
is inedible.

180
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,040
I'm sorry about that.

181
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,960
Mom.

182
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,080
Are you still the Daoming Feng I know?

183
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,200
An old woman like me can still learn
and grow to be a better person.

184
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,720
Mother looks really cool.

185
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,240
<i>I believe that a lot of people
want to be like Mrs. Daoming.</i>

186
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,200
<i>Being in her shoes is not easy.</i>

187
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,080
<i>She has sacrificed a lot
to be where she is today.</i>

188
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,680
<i>And I, this ordinary girl,</i>

189
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,400
<i>am now able to start</i>

190
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,320
<i>this life that I've dreamed about.</i>

191
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,840
Hey.

192
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,440
Hey.

193
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,840
-Don't move.
-Don't do it.

194
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,800
Stop moving.

195
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,480
WIFE

196
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,680
What the hell is this?

197
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,680
I'm marking my property.
You should go out like this tomorrow.

198
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,640
Do you think I'm stupid?

199
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,680
Of course you are.

200
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,320
Why would you marry me if you weren't?

201
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,200
That's enough.

202
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,880
Now, I'll make Shancai beautiful again.

203
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,680
-I don't think you can do it.
-Does it work like this?

204
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,680
-Like this? Is this right?
-No!

205
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Is this right?

206
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,720
I'm going to make you beautiful too.

207
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,760
Here.

208
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,680
All right, that's enough.
I'm already beautiful.

209
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,240
Not enough. Let's put some more on.

210
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,560
Are you really going to wash my hair?

211
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,640
I'm warning you. I won't put up with it.

212
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,840
Don't mess around with me.

213
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,200
I'm the dandruff eliminator.
I'm not afraid of you.

214
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,480
-Get in.
-No!

215
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,320
Hey.

216
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,960
It's all right. You don't need to do this.

217
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,400
Hey.

218
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,280
Today, we're married for three months.

219
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,760
There's no greater gift that can beat
a home-cooked meal made by your husband.

220
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,480
I understand.

221
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,120
But it's just three months.

222
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,920
Can't we go to a restaurant like we did

223
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
for our first and second
month anniversaries?

224
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,400
Rejecting your husband's love is a crime.

225
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,640
Get out of the way now.

226
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,960
Just wait and see.
I'll give you a huge surprise.

227
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,840
My hand!

228
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,200
-What's wrong?
-It hurts!

229
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,960
-Don't touch it.
-What happened?

230
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,560
How did it grow out again?

231
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,080
Don't play a prank like that again.

232
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,240
Fine.

233
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,280
I apologize. I'm sorry.

234
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,800
If apologies worked,
why would we need the police?

235
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,960
What are you reading?

236
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,240
-A comic book.
-What comic book?

237
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,640
<i>My Quarter of a Boyfriend.</i>

238
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,560
They look kind of like F4.

239
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,120
But...

240
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
I'm more handsome.

241
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,080
Yes. You're more handsome.

242
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,040
-Look, it's a meteor shower.
-Put your jacket on.

243
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,680
Here.

244
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,120
His latest work
has an ink wash painting theme.

245
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,000
I think it'll work great.

246
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,040
BY CHEN FENG

247
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,440
Using Chen Feng's work
as the packaging for our new tea.

248
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,400
What a great idea.

249
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,880
Are you kidding me?

250
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,160
It's New Year's Eve,
but we're still here working.

251
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,840
Not us. Only you.

252
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,200
I made plans with Xiaoyou.

253
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,440
Bye.

254
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,120
Do you think I don't have plans?

255
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,440
I just have to wait longer.

256
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,680
-Look, a meteor shower.
-Wow.

257
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,040
Meteors!

258
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,600
Please help us sell bananas
all around the world

259
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,320
to every market that exists!

260
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,120
And, please turn me into a handsome guy,

261
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,080
so that I can get a beautiful girlfriend!

262
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,760
Don't be silly.
You can't make that many wishes.

263
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,640
There are so many of them.
I could make a dozen wishes.

264
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,000
I want to be prettier.
I want to lose weight.

265
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,360
World peace!

266
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,840
No air pollution!

267
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,760
Put this on.

268
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,280
-It's cold outside.
-Okay.

269
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,680
Look, meteors.

270
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,120
There are so many of them.

271
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,360
Make a wish.

272
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,560
Do you want to know what I wished for?

273
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,560
What?

274
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,640
It's a secret. I won't tell you.

275
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,720
That was good.

276
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,560
-Are you new here?
-New?

277
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,480
I've been singing here for over a decade.

278
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,760
I've never seen you before.

279
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,200
-Yeah.
-I've never seen you either.

280
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,680
-What's your name?
-I'm Daoming Si.

281
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,440
-Daoming Si. What about you?
-Dong Shancai.

282
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,200
That's different from what I thought.

283
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,160
I remember those names.

284
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,360
They're really familiar.

285
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,440
-What's your name?
-That's weird.

286
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,840
I'm Xiaoha.

287
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,560
-Xiaoha?
-Have you ever heard this song?

288
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,800
<i>Can't Help Falling in Love?</i>

289
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,800
-<i>Can't Help Falling in Love?</i>
-Have you heard it?

290
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,920
-No.
-That's okay. Is it good?

291
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,200
-Yes.
-Yes.

292
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,000
-Want to hear it?
-Yes.

293
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,960
Pay up.

294
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,960
-Pay?
-Yeah.

295
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,720
-Just a little.
-I don't have any. Do you?

296
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,000
-Is ten yuan enough?
-Yes.

297
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,040
Really?

298
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,360
I'm just here for fun.

299
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,920
-Clap your hands.
-Okay.

300
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,920
Here we go.

301
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,520
Keep singing. I'll help you.

302
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,280
-You know it too?
-Yes.

303
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,720
-Cool.
-My friends do too.

304
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,720
Get them up here.

305
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,760
Hey!

306
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,280
Hey, come over here!

307
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,800
Come on.

308
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,000
-Get over here.
-Let's sing.

309
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,640
Let's wave our hands.

310
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,960
Come on.

311
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,680
-Bye.
-Bye.

312
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,120
Bye!

313
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,000
Bye!

314
00:39:00,844 --> 00:39:06,118
THE END

315
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,566
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING METEOR GARDEN!
