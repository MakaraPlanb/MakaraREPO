EPISODE 18

3
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,760
Ximen.

4
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,360
Isn't pleasing girls
one of the things you do best?

5
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,560
Pleasing girls is not the same

6
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,320
as apologizing for Si.

7
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,760
Hey, guys. Are you guys looking for me?

8
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,080
-Where's Shancai?
-Shancai?

9
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,680
She didn't come to our previous class.

10
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,360
I'm not sure what happened to her.

11
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,200
She's also not answering her phone.
That's not like her at all.

12
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,840
When was the last time you saw her?

13
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,560
After class earlier,
she left with Shunping.

14
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,160
Shunping?

15
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,400
Yes. He's our high school
classmate's brother, Zhibu.

16
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,840
I see. Let us know
when Shancai comes back, Xiaoqing.

17
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,880
Sure.

18
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,360
Don't call me Xiaoqing anymore.

19
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,480
Hello?

20
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,440
<i>Qinghe, didn't I tell you to call me
when Shancai gets back?</i>

21
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
<i>I've waited all afternoon.</i>

22
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,120
I didn't forget. Shancai
didn't come to class all afternoon.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,320
And I couldn't reach her phone.
I'm not sure where she went.

24
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,280
<i>Come here now.</i>

25
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,120
Okay.

26
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I'll be right over.

27
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,120
Shancai didn't come back
the whole afternoon.

28
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,320
That's so unlike her.

29
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,160
I think something happened.

30
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,640
Do you remember who Qinghe said
Shancai left with earlier?

31
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,040
Apparently, the guy's name is Shunping.

32
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,640
I'll go ask the office about him.

33
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,800
-All right, Ximen.
-Hey.

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,320
Were you able to contact Shancai?

35
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,400
Ximen called earlier
and said that Shunping

36
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,320
has dropped out of Mingde University.

37
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,120
But he came to see Shancai this morning.

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't feel good about this.

39
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,040
You said that your high school classmate
is Shunping's brother.

40
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,160
Do you have his number?

41
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,360
Let me see.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Si's phone is turned off.

43
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,400
Yan Zhibu's phone is ringing.

44
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,280
Hello?

45
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,920
Are you Yan Zhibu?

46
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,920
-You're here.
-Mr. Liu, is Si home?

47
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,200
Si sits in the library
every time he comes home.

48
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,480
He doesn't look happy.

49
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
What does he do in there?

50
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,880
He checks the stock market

51
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,120
or reads books.

52
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,960
Or plays games or takes naps.

53
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,240
He doesn't want to speak to anyone.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,880
Boss.

55
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,480
She's awake.

56
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
What are you doing?

57
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,920
What are you doing?

58
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,320
Stop struggling.
You won't be able to escape.

59
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
Boss.

60
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,400
Let's do it.

61
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,200
Be patient. Let's take her picture first.

62
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,000
Stop moving around.

63
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,440
Boss.

64
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,320
She doesn't look pitiful enough.

65
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,280
One more shot.

66
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,760
No. I don't think
now is the best time to sell it.

67
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,320
-I still want to wait. And tomorrow--
-Si.

68
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,640
-What's up? Did something happen?
-Why won't you answer your phone?

69
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,360
I'm not in the mood. What happened?

70
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,640
Shancai's missing.

71
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,000
Boss.

72
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,040
Shunping, you're here.

73
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,080
Boss.

74
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,960
Why did you tie Shancai up?

75
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,680
Shunping.

76
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
What are you doing?

77
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,400
Shunping, we did that just in case...

78
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,120
Boss, I don't get it.

79
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,640
This was not the plan when you asked me
to approach Shancai before.

80
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,880
Boss.

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,520
Do you remember Daoming Si,
the one who broke your leg?

82
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,320
How can I forget?

83
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,960
Why? Did you see him?

84
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,920
No, my brother did.

85
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,640
He was beaten up by Daoming Si

86
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,760
at his high school reunion two days ago.
He was even hospitalized.

87
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,640
He was beaten up?

88
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,600
Why?

89
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,000
Apparently because of a girl
named Shancai.

90
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,560
She's Daoming Si's girlfriend.

91
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,880
Shunping.

92
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,000
I think you should become friends
with that girl named Shancai.

93
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,840
And convince her
not to be together with Daoming Si.

94
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,840
All right.

95
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,040
Thank you.

96
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,000
Shunping?

97
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,960
Shancai, we meet again.

98
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,520
Shunping.

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,120
What happened to your face?

100
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,040
I had an encounter with Daoming Si today.

101
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,560
Tell me about it.

102
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,600
What happened?

103
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,360
That guy is too arrogant and dominating.

104
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,920
He doesn't know how Shancai feels.

105
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,480
I couldn't contain myself
so we had a fight.

106
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,440
He was also very arrogant and dominating
when I met him before.

107
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,720
He's so annoying.

108
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,400
That kind of person
needs to be taught a lesson.

109
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,520
Shunping, can you arrange for me
to meet Shancai tomorrow?

110
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,760
Sure. But why?

111
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,480
Nothing.
I just want to have a chat with her.

112
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,680
Maybe I can convince her
to leave Daoming Si soon.

113
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,480
That's a good idea.

114
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,560
-I'll set it up.
-Okay.

115
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,240
How did Daoming Si treat boss before?

116
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,320
Have you forgotten?

117
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,040
Shunping, do you plan to betray us?

118
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,680
Of course not.

119
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,040
A person like Daoming Si

120
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,000
doesn't deserve to be forgiven.

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,320
Boss' leg

122
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,120
was crippled because of Daoming Si.

123
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,160
I've already taken a photo.
I'll send it to Daoming Si.

124
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
<i>He lied to me.</i>

125
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,480
<i>Shunping, who said he wanted
to be friends with me,</i> <i>to protect me,</i>

126
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,000
<i>lied to me.</i>

127
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,000
<i>Why did this happen?</i>

128
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,720
Boss.

129
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,520
I want to talk to her alone.

130
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,080
May I?

131
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,760
Don't worry.

132
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,280
I won't let her go.

133
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,360
Don't forget.

134
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,720
I'm on your side.

135
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,720
Sure.

136
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,320
Don't take too long.

137
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,960
Okay.

138
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,480
Why?

139
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,920
Why?

140
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,440
For what?

141
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,200
Why are you doing this?

142
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,560
I trusted you.

143
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,720
Why?

144
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,600
Liar.

145
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Jerk!

146
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,160
Scum!

147
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,400
Say whatever you want.

148
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,560
If that makes you feel better,

149
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,880
do it.

150
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,040
Why are you doing this?

151
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,080
I think boss wants to use you
to deal with Daoming Si.

152
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,480
Daoming Si crippled his leg.

153
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,120
He needs to pay for it.

154
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,680
When I was in junior high school,

155
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,480
I didn't like to be in school.

156
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,880
I didn't like being with that stupid Zhibu
at home even more.

157
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,840
So I went out and did some part-time job.

158
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,080
But I also got into a lot of trouble.

159
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,760
I met boss at a bar later on.

160
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,240
He helped me with my problems.

161
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,840
And he even convinced me
to go back to school.

162
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,960
And then one day,

163
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,160
that arrogant guy, Daoming Si,

164
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,920
argued with boss at a bar.

165
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,040
He said boss is a rascal
and that he's useless.

166
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
Boss and his men got mad
and had a fight with Daoming Si.

167
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,880
But Daoming Si went crazy

168
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,400
and beat everyone up.

169
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,840
He also broke...

170
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,600
Boss' leg.

171
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,920
Because of that,

172
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,840
everyone got arrested by the police,

173
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,160
even Daoming Si.

174
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,240
But boss's leg

175
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,520
would never ever recover.

176
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,880
Shouldn't Daoming Si
take responsibility for this?

177
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,040
Shunping.

178
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,160
What you're doing is against the law.

179
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,320
You'll be expelled by the school.
Do you know that?

180
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,040
Even though I got into Mingde University,

181
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,320
I couldn't take
the pressure of the competition.

182
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,480
It seems like everyone is doing better

183
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,960
than me.

184
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,040
That's why I dropped out a long time ago.

185
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,880
So you approached me on purpose

186
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,960
in order to avenge boss?

187
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,760
I don't understand.

188
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,560
Why would a nice girl like you

189
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,920
be with a bum like Daoming Si?

190
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,000
A person like you

191
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
even dare to call Daoming Si a bum?

192
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,000
Even though Daoming Si seems overbearing,

193
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,680
he's not the person you say he is.

194
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,920
You saw boss's leg.

195
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,800
Isn't the truth right in front
of your eyes?

196
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
If you want her to live,

197
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
come alone to this place immediately.

198
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,960
What is it? Is there any update on her?

199
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,080
"If you want her to live,
come alone immediately--"

200
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
Don't follow me.

201
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,240
Actually, I feel sorry for you.

202
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,440
Because when people get acquainted
with Daoming Si,

203
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,000
that is the beginning of their bad luck.

204
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,320
My bad luck is not because of Daoming Si.

205
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,520
It's because I trusted you.

206
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,720
Your hypocrisy makes me sick.

207
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,920
I thought you would understand me.

208
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,880
Turns out, I was wrong.

209
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,600
Don't worry.

210
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,040
After boss deals with Daoming Si,

211
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,800
he'll let you go.

212
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,920
You won't succeed with your plan.

213
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,720
Because Daoming Si won't come.

214
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,000
He will.

215
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,800
He'll come here.

216
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,160
He confessed his feelings
for you that way yesterday.

217
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,280
So he'll surely come.

218
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,320
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

219
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,880
<i>Please don't come.</i>

220
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,840
<i>This is my karma</i>

221
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,080
<i>because I didn't believe Daoming Si.</i>

222
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,440
Shunping, why did you remove the tape?

223
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,040
What if she screams?

224
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,840
Nobody would come to such a remote place.

225
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,080
Don't touch me!

226
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,800
Watch it.

227
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,840
If not for Shunping,

228
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,920
we would have already beaten you up

229
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,960
and broadcasted you crying live
to Daoming Si.

230
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,960
I won't let you see me cry.

231
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,720
You despicable people.

232
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,320
You're quite tough.

233
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,480
Speaking of being despicable,
your man is even more despicable than us.

234
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,680
Last time, he beat us up
until we passed out at the bar.

235
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,160
I thought you had a big feud.

236
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,200
He beat you up until you passed out?

237
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,720
That's because you people were useless.

238
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,080
Can't you win over Daoming Si
if you don't use such despicable tricks?

239
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,920
Bitch! Shut up!

240
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,040
Scalawag.

241
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,880
Scumbag.

242
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,640
You already lost to Daoming Si

243
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,520
when you used such dirty tricks.

244
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
I'm telling you.

245
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,080
Daoming Si won't come here.

246
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,000
Then we'll just kill you!

247
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,760
-We'll see if he comes--
-Wait. Boss.

248
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,120
The goal is not to harm her.

249
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,320
The goal is to lure Daoming Si here.

250
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,960
I'm not Daoming Si's girlfriend.

251
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,280
If you don't believe me,

252
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,720
then just wait here until you die

253
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,240
with those hilarious expressions
on your ugly faces.

254
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,680
This wench's mouth is quite tough.

255
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,400
If you dare kick her,

256
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,840
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

257
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,960
All right.

258
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,480
Let's do this right now.

259
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,880
Stupid boy.

260
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,560
Why did you come here?

261
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,120
Foolish guy.

262
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,920
Stupid boy.

263
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,320
You can choose to fight back,
but I think you shouldn't.

264
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,240
You wouldn't want...

265
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,720
to see her get hurt, right?

266
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,360
Don't look at me with your filthy face.

267
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,680
Close your eyes.

268
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
What are you waiting for?

269
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,760
Kill him!

270
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,480
Aren't you stupid?

271
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,800
Don't you fight at all?

272
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,320
Fight back.

273
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,920
Fight back!

274
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,920
I don't feel anything at all.

275
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,600
Is that all you got?

276
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
Don't you have anything more powerful?

277
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,960
Beat him up!

278
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,760
Stop!

279
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,480
Stop it!

280
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,440
Stop it!

281
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,600
Daoming Si!

282
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,040
Daoming Si.

283
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,360
Where are you going?
It's dangerous over there.

284
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
Daoming Si!

285
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,920
You hate me, right?

286
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,720
I don't hate you.

287
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,040
Whether you like me or hate me,

288
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,360
it doesn't matter anymore.

289
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,480
Bye.

290
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,360
Daoming Si!

291
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Wait!

292
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,080
It's all my fault! Don't go!

293
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,640
Don't go!

294
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,240
Daoming Si!

295
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,120
Don't...

296
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,000
Don't go!

297
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,400
-She's awake.
-She's awake.

298
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,320
-Shancai.
-You scared us to death, Shancai.

299
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,400
Shancai.

300
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,920
-Hurry.
-Come on.

301
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,080
Come on.

302
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,200
Dad.

303
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,040
Mom. Where am I?

304
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
You're at the hospital.

305
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,840
The police called and said that

306
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,840
you and Daoming Si were found
at an old warehouse behind the school.

307
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,040
You both were hurt
and were sent to the hospital.

308
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,760
Tell me. Who beat you up?

309
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,880
I'll take care of him!

310
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,880
What are you doing?
She just woke up. Why are you yelling?

311
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,200
-Tell me.
-Shancai, tell me.

312
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,720
Who beat you up? I'll take care of him!

313
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,080
Daoming Si.

314
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,440
-Daoming Si?
-Where's Daoming Si?

315
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,160
-Shancai.
-Shancai.

316
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,280
Stupid boy.

317
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,960
Why did you come here?

318
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,480
All right.

319
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,080
Let's do this right now.

320
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,040
Don't look at me with your filthy face.

321
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,320
Close your eyes.

322
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,320
Please don't run in the hallways.

323
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,080
Huaze Lei.

324
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,400
Huaze Lei. Where's Daoming Si?

325
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,560
<i>Someone who never got beaten up
by anyone before.</i>

326
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,840
<i>Someone who could fight really well.</i>

327
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,760
<i>Someone who could win
even if a lot of people ganged up on him,</i>

328
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,880
<i>why didn't he fight back</i>

329
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,080
<i>because of me?</i>

330
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,000
Stop!

331
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,400
Stop it!

332
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,400
<i>You stupid boy!</i>

333
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,960
Why didn't you fight back?

334
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,640
If I fought back,

335
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,120
<i>then I would really lose.</i>

336
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,840
Daoming Si!

337
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,960
Wake up, Daoming Si!

338
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,960
<i>Come on. Wake up, Daoming Si!</i>

339
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,160
<i>Help!</i>

340
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,640
<i>Help!</i>

341
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,080
It's too late.

342
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,480
Si passed very peacefully.

343
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,160
I never thought
that Si passed away just like that.

344
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
No.

345
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,480
Daoming Si, I won't allow you to die!

346
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,320
Wake up!

347
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,840
I haven't even apologized to you!

348
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,160
Even though you have a bad temper,

349
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,920
I still...

350
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,400
I still hope that you'd be alive.

351
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,040
Daoming Si!

352
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,400
Wake up!

353
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,440
You did so many bad things to me.

354
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
I haven't dealt with you yet!

355
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,160
Wake up!

356
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,840
What are you talking about?

357
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,280
Is this how you treat a patient?

358
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,800
Did you see Shancai's expression earlier?
I almost couldn't contain myself.

359
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,200
"No. I don't want you to die!"

360
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,560
Daoming Si.

361
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,360
Daoming Si, you tricked me.
Do you want to scare me to death?

362
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,000
-I'm going to kill you.
-Don't do that.

363
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,800
I'm going to kill you.
You and Huaze Lei tricked me.

364
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,640
Hey, what were you thinking?

365
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,160
Is this how you treat a patient?

366
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,520
I broke three ribs.

367
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,600
I'm hurt all over.
Yet this stupid girl is sitting on me.

368
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,440
Who told you to play such a prank?

369
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,920
Miss.

370
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,520
How long will you sit on me?

371
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,160
It hurts.

372
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,920
By the way, the police are already
taking care of those gangsters.

373
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,280
I think Si has already paid
for what he did before.

374
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,320
I'm not who I was anymore.

375
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,240
What was he like before?

376
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,760
Huaze Lei. How was Daoming Si before?

377
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,400
The old Daoming Si was quite absurd.

378
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,920
Absurd?

379
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,000
Isn't he also quite absurd now?

380
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,840
Compared to how he used to be,

381
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,360
the new Si

382
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,200
is Mr. Virtue.

383
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,640
What are you looking at?
You're lucky you met the new me.

384
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,680
That's right.

385
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,560
The old Si always looked for trouble.
And he was never motivated.

386
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,760
Good thing we were able to change him.

387
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,520
We helped him study
at the library every day.

388
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,520
Good thing that he's naturally smart.

389
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,680
He got into Mingde University
with a very high score.

390
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,800
He got into Mingde University indeed.

391
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,720
But he's not naturally that smart.

392
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,600
All right.

393
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,240
Are you planning to talk
about my past all night?

394
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,760
You ungrateful guy.

395
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,920
You forgot all the times
we were with you before.

396
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,840
You...

397
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,640
Never mind. Let's go.

398
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,560
Let's give them some quality time.

399
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,480
Bye.

400
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,040
Why aren't you saying anything?

401
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,880
What's with that attitude?
Is that how you treat a patient?

402
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,560
Do you think you're so great?

403
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,320
Why was I so nosy that I risked my life

404
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,400
and got hurt all over just to save
an ungrateful and stupid girl like you?

405
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,200
You're the stupid one.
You even dare to say that to me.

406
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,960
If you didn't cause trouble before,

407
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
how would you get hurt?

408
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,680
Cut it out. Stop babbling.

409
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,640
You just know how to fight
with people all day.

410
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,400
-Don't you know how to comfort a patient?
-Because...

411
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,280
What...

412
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,680
What are you doing?

413
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,080
Because I had a dream.

414
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
I dreamt that you died.

415
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,120
Then I thought you really died.

416
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,000
I thought you wouldn't come and save me

417
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,040
because I said those things to you.

418
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,600
I never thought you'd still come.

419
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,800
And you got beaten up so badly
by those scums

420
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
and turned out this way.

421
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,680
Sorry.

422
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,160
Stop looking like that.
You're already ugly as it is.

423
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Didn't I tell you before?

424
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,000
Even if you went to Mars,
I'd still go after you.

425
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,400
You wouldn't be able to get rid
of me in this life.

426
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,440
Stop struggling for no reason.

427
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,120
Stupid boy.

428
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,560
Your face is so ugly right now.
Are you planning to laugh or cry?

429
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,040
It's none of your business.

430
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,960
It's good that they came back safely
even though they were hurt this time.

431
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,720
But it was really dangerous.

432
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,200
That's right.

433
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,760
If you think about it now,
we almost weren't able to change

434
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,360
the old Si.

435
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,440
There were times when
we almost fought with him.

436
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,080
It's good we didn't give up.

437
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,080
How could we give up on him?

438
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,960
He has helped us a lot.

439
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,840
We can't let this kind of thing
happen again.

440
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,280
Even though he's very headstrong now,
he has learned to respect himself

441
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,040
because he found someone he loves.

442
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,480
Hey.

443
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,000
Who are you?

444
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,160
I'm Shunping, the one who beat up
Daoming Si so badly.

445
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,480
What? You want me to come visit you daily?

446
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,560
-No way.
-Why not?

447
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,920
I need to work. How will I have the time?

448
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,120
You ungrateful woman.
I'll double your salary. Come here.

449
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Don't always use money to buy people.

450
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,600
You morally-corrupt bum.

451
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,240
Then how would you repay me? Tell me.

452
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,000
Shut it.

453
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,720
Lie down and rest.

454
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,600
Why are you here?

455
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,640
Haven't you done enough?

456
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,680
Why are you here?

457
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,760
Your friends are all by the door.
What can I do to you?

458
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,240
Don't worry.

459
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,680
Shancai.

460
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,720
Before I surrender myself,

461
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,200
I want to apologize to you.

462
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,400
Boss was already arrested

463
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,880
because of what we did to you.

464
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,600
I'll also surrender myself for what I did
and accept my punishment.

465
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,320
I'm really sorry.

466
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,920
It's too late to apologize now.

467
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,320
Get out.

468
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
Shancai.

469
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,480
If you're not the girl Daoming Si likes,

470
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,240
I'd hope we can become good friends.

471
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,080
It's really a shame.

472
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,720
I originally wanted to beat him up.

473
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,760
But I'm not mad anymore
after seeing his pathetic face.

474
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,040
You still want to beat people up?

475
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,640
Ouch! You violent girl.
Why did you hit me where I'm hurt?

476
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,720
Sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

477
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,240
I...

478
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,240
This is the most touching love story.

479
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,160
A firm and unyielding man like Daoming Si

480
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,240
risked his life for the woman he loves.

481
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,760
Shancai, you must've done a lot of good
in the past to get a man like Daoming Si.

482
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,240
This man is strong,
handsome and responsible.

483
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,080
What do you think, Shancai?

484
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,560
What do you mean?

485
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,480
-Why are you telling me these things?
-Shancai.

486
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,760
What do you want?

487
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,800
I mean it.
You should treat each other well.

488
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,720
You should help one another.

489
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,200
That's right.
With a manly guy like Daoming Si,

490
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,640
even if aliens came to Earth,
he would not let them hurt you.

491
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,200
And Daoming Si is not right in the head.

492
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,440
He won't look for another woman.

493
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,520
He would risk his life and save you

494
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,120
when you're in trouble.

495
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,880
Stop it.

496
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,280
I...

497
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Take this limited edition Daoming Si now.

498
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,640
Even though his brain
doesn't work that well,

499
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,200
you're not that smart yourself.

500
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,200
-I think you suit each other.
-Hey.

501
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,680
Don't come any closer.

502
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,040
Shancai, don't you like
a manly guy like Daoming Si?

503
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,680
Si is invincible.

504
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,640
Hey.

505
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm manly too.

506
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,000
And...

507
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,480
But...

508
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
Then...

509
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,280
-Daoming Si is...
-Damn girl.

510
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,760
What are you trying to say?

511
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
And...

512
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,480
But...

513
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,400
Then...

514
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,320
I think

515
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,720
of Daoming Si...

516
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,120
as a dog.

517
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,480
Lei, stop laughing.

518
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,200
But I can relate.

519
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,520
A dog?

520
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,440
Si, be strong.

521
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,200
Of course we can't evade it.

522
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,680
We have to face it head on.

523
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,440
Mr. Wu, don't think too much.

524
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,040
You won't suffer any losses.

525
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,760
We prioritize the bonuses for our members.
You can't earn less even if you want to.

526
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,960
Of course. You can find me
any time you call this number.

527
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,760
I'll help you resolve your problems.

528
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,000
That's good.

529
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,800
It seems that your job
is going smoothly lately.

530
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,600
I already have a plan.

531
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,600
When I receive my first salary,
I'll add them to the stock immediately.

532
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,000
Be careful.

533
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,960
Is she still in the bathroom
after such a long time?

534
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,480
Did you remind her not to get
her wounds wet?

535
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
I did.

536
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,520
We really have to thank
Daoming Si this time.

537
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,920
He even got his face hurt

538
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,280
to save Shancai.

539
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,600
Shouldn't they settle the things
between them already?

540
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,680
I think so too.

541
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,800
Shancai, hurry.

542
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,360
It's too humid in the bathroom.

543
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,200
It's not good for your wounds.

544
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,600
Congratulations on getting discharged.

545
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,240
Si's recovers just like a dog.

546
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,040
A dog?

547
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,120
Don't mind being called a dog.
Dogs are nice.

548
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,200
Maybe Shancai was complimenting you
for being as cute as a dog?

549
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,720
Don't let me hear you say
the word "dog" again.

550
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,920
Or else I'll kill you.

551
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,120
I think you were really traumatized.

552
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,920
How can you understand how I feel

553
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,880
when the girl I risked my life for

554
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,000
said,

555
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
"I think of Daoming Si as a dog."

556
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,920
<i>I think</i>

557
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,760
of Daoming Si...

558
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,680
as a dog.

559
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,640
She said I'm like a dog.

560
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,120
That damn girl.

561
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,960
I think Si is going to explode.

562
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,600
I told you he shouldn't
be discharged so soon.

563
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,480
I'm going to sleep.

564
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,720
But Shancai is really stubborn.

565
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,240
Innocent girls like her are annoying.

566
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,960
They have
a lot of unrealistic expectations

567
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,680
on relationships.

568
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,440
Falling in love relies on

569
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,360
that sudden feeling of love.

570
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,120
Lei, what do you think?

571
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,920
Me?

572
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,400
I don't have any feelings at all.

573
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,480
I think we're the only normal guys here.

574
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,080
There's nothing we can do.

575
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,640
We can only help Si

576
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,360
make the innocent Shancai

577
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,480
give in.

578
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,800
Didn't you just get discharged?
Have you rested enough?

579
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,640
Why are you in such a hurry
to come to school?

580
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,040
I was afraid I won't be able to catch up.

581
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,800
-I may have a lot to catch up later.
-I can lend you my notes.

582
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,560
Thank you.

583
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
But it's better for me to come to class.

584
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,560
Shancai, are you all right?

585
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,520
I wanted to visit you after class.

586
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,400
Then give you my notes
for the past two days.

587
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,760
Your notes?

588
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,800
Your notes are useless.
Nobody can understand them.

589
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,640
Shancai would be confused.

590
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,720
I wrote my notes carefully for Shancai.

591
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,240
Don't say things you don't know.

592
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,840
All right. I need both of your notes.

593
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,680
Shancai, is it okay
not to bandage your wound?

594
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,600
I think it's fine.

595
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,840
It feels fresher this way.

596
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,680
Where's Daoming Si?

597
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,440
He was discharged yesterday.
He's taking a sick day today.

598
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,080
His wounds have not fully recovered yet.

599
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,280
Right.

600
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,960
Your wound might get infected this way.

601
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,680
I don't want to be all bandaged up
like a mummy.

602
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,400
-So I...
-But your wound might get infected.

603
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,360
The air is really polluted.
What happens if it scars?

604
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,600
Do you bring this stuff
with you all the time?

605
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
Wouldn't you?

606
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,800
So Daoming Si's been discharged already?

607
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,000
That's great.

608
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,800
This is the first time
I've seen Si like that.

609
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,440
We grew up with him
and we're all so surprised.

610
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,920
We can see how much he really likes you.

611
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,880
You can see it too, right?

612
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,360
Come on. I'll put it on for you.

613
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,280
Lei.

614
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,640
I really envy you.

615
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,200
You and Jing shouldn't feel awkward
with each other now, you know?

616
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,280
But I still don't know
how to face him with confidence.

617
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,480
It seems so hard.

618
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Just take it slowly.

619
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,200
You and Si can just take it slowly.
It'll be all right.

620
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,720
Really?

621
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,720
You two seem cozy.

622
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,840
What are you doing?

623
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,000
Stupid boy.

624
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,840
He's helping me put on a Band-Aid.

625
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,600
Didn't you take a sick day?

626
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,360
I got bored sleeping at home.
So I came to school instead.

627
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,160
Your ribs haven't healed, right?
Can you move around like this?

628
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,640
So what?

629
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,920
My ability to recover is just like a dog.

630
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,240
I told you it was just a metaphor.
It's just a figure of speech.

631
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,960
An interesting figure of speech.

632
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,720
Did I ask for your opinion?

633
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,360
I'll get going then.

634
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,480
I didn't tell her what you wanted me to.

635
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,920
Just tell her yourself.

636
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,160
Hey.

637
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,800
What is it?

638
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,120
Do you know what day it is on the 31st?

639
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,400
You don't know?

640
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,320
How dare you? It's my birthday!

641
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,360
Well then.

642
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,160
Happy birthday.

643
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,040
We have a birthday party every year.
You have to bring a gift.

644
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,120
What? How can you act like this?

645
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,400
You even asked for a gift?

646
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,400
-Would you give me a gift if I didn't?
-Of course.

647
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,880
All right. Then bring it.

648
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,600
This is your fault.
You have to make it up to me.

649
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,280
By the way, my mom will be there too.
Wear something nice.

650
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,920
Your mom?

651
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,720
-Your mom would be back from overseas?
-Yes. I'll introduce you to her.

652
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,520
What?
