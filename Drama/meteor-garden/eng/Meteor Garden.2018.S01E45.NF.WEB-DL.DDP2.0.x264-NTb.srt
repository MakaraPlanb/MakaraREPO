A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 45

3
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,400
Then what happened?

4
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,080
I think she also realized

5
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,560
she doesn't like me.

6
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,240
I'm afraid to get hurt. I'm not brave.

7
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,880
I hide from the person I like.

8
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,720
Such a person doesn't deserve

9
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
to be liked.

10
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,080
Who said so? I like you the way you are.

11
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,400
Xiaoyou, you were fooled.

12
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,240
The person standing here
is not the real Ximen.

13
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,840
No.

14
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,440
Nobody's perfect.

15
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,720
I have a lot of faults too.

16
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,920
I trust people easily.
I lack good judgment.

17
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,480
So my friends always have
to clean up my mess.

18
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,640
Most of the time,
I'm self-centered and strong-willed.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,600
However, I don't think
I don't deserve to be liked

20
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,560
because of these faults.

21
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,640
Xiaoyou.

22
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,120
You always impress me.

23
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,240
Ximen.

24
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,480
Missing your "Once in a Lifetime"
is your problem.

25
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,080
But now it's our "Once in a Lifetime."

26
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,320
I don't want to miss it.

27
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,880
I'm so sleepy. I'm completely drained.

28
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,600
I can't keep my eyes open.

29
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,960
All I can think about is my bed.

30
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,840
How about we go to my room
and sleep together?

31
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,800
Jerk. Don't say these creepy things.

32
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,520
What are you thinking?
I don't mean anything by it.

33
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,720
Hit me again.

34
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,000
-Hit me again.
-So what if I hit you again?

35
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,640
So what if I hit you again?

36
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,480
Xiaoyou, Yifen wanted me
to give you this gift.

37
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,080
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

38
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,600
-What can it be?
-Open it.

39
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,960
It's a doll Xiaogeng made herself.

40
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,600
It's so cute.

41
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,880
It looks like you.

42
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,680
Is that so? It's quite cute.

43
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,840
There's a letter too.

44
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,440
<i>Xiaoyou.</i>

45
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,280
<i>Sorry for not giving you this gift myself.</i>

46
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,640
<i>I'm graduating soon.</i>

47
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,480
<i>I've already started
my post-graduation work.</i>

48
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,560
<i>Because of you,</i> <i>I met Ximen again.</i>

49
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,120
<i>It made me clearly realize what I want</i>.

50
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,080
<i>To me, that's the best
graduation present from you.</i>

51
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,440
<i>A long time ago,
I made this doll to look like Ximen.</i>

52
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,800
<i>I think it should belong to you now.</i>

53
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,720
<i>I hope you like it.</i>

54
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,280
<i>I used to think that "Once in a Lifetime"
is a romantic feeling.</i>

55
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,800
<i>Something to treasure, to take hold of,</i>

56
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,360
<i>and not let it slip away.</i>

57
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,960
Xiaogeng...

58
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,720
<i>But in this moment,</i>

59
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,480
<i>I think that it's also
an attitude towards life.</i>

60
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,640
<i>When you meet each other, treasure it.</i>

61
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,280
<i>When you missed each other,</i>

62
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,360
<i>be thankful for having it once.</i>

63
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,600
<i>This doll is more suitable for you now.</i>

64
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,160
<i>My "Once in a Lifetime"
was in another stage of my life.</i>

65
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,360
<i>That's enough.</i>

66
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,800
Welcome. What are you having?

67
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,280
Do you want some tea?
We have a special recommendation today.

68
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,200
No.

69
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,880
I don't want to drink tea.

70
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,440
-Give me some coffee.
-Okay.

71
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,560
SAN LIANGCHUN, TASTE OF OLD SHANGHAI

72
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,120
I'm not sure what happened to Xiaoyou
after that morning.

73
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,440
I want to ask but I'm embarrassed.

74
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,240
What has it got to do with you?
You're meddling too much.

75
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
If your good friend didn't go

76
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,840
and mess up Xiaoyou's life,
she'd be just fine.

77
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,920
Just like I messed up yours?

78
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,320
Aren't you quite happy now?

79
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,680
<i>Who would've thought?</i>

80
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,760
<i>This person in front of me
stirred up my peaceful life,</i>

81
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
<i>gave me the courage to overcome
so many obstacles,</i>

82
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,600
<i>and let me step closer and closer
to him until today.</i>

83
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,400
What?

84
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,840
Seeing my handsome face
made you forget to eat?

85
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,800
That's what you call a feast for the eyes.

86
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,440
Stop being so narcissistic.
Eat your wantons.

87
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,720
Shancai.

88
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,800
Let's eat all three meals together
for the rest of our lives.

89
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
What do you think?

90
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Shancai.

91
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,160
Let's get married.

92
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,840
Get married?

93
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,040
I have it all planned out.

94
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,120
Even though your looks are mediocre,
your IQ's mediocre,

95
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,880
your temper is very bad,

96
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,080
and there's a possibility of domestic
violence in our marriage...

97
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,000
Hey.

98
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,400
Okay. It's not just a possibility.
There will be violence for sure.

99
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,240
I don't mind. Shancai, let's get married.

100
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,000
-Is he proposing to her?
-What?

101
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,880
-What are they talking about?
-Really?

102
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,080
-It's so romantic.
-No way.

103
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,880
That girl is so lucky.

104
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,680
Why aren't you answering me?

105
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,720
-He's kidding, right?
-I'm so envious.

106
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,080
Who proposes at this time and place
while eating wantons?

107
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,560
I just said what's on my mind.

108
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,400
And it's almost Chinese New Year.

109
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,280
I plan to visit your parents
at the fishing village.

110
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,880
Your mom likes me so much.

111
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,960
She must be happy to marry you off to me.

112
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,040
This fast?

113
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,040
I haven't agreed yet.

114
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,720
I don't care.

115
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,920
I won't give you any reason to refuse.

116
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,320
Hey. Everyone.

117
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,960
This girl in front of me, Dong Shancai,
has agreed to marry me.

118
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,960
I hope you all can be the witnesses.
And wish us well, too.

119
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,560
Sure.

120
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,160
-All right. Sit down.
-Thanks, everyone.

121
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,640
It's my treat today.

122
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,680
<i>Let's eat all three meals together</i>

123
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,160
<i>for the rest of our lives.</i>

124
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,160
<i>What do you think?</i>

125
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,800
<i>Shancai.</i>

126
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,960
<i>Let's get married.</i>

127
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,960
<i>Am I dreaming?</i>

128
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,840
<i>Just now,</i>

129
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,320
<i>did Daoming Si really propose to me?</i>

130
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,160
Coming.

131
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,120
Miss Dong Shancai.

132
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,480
These are the 520 flowers
Mr. Daoming Si prepared for you.

133
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,560
It represents his feelings for you.

134
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,320
Please place them inside.

135
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,960
-All right.
-Over there.

136
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,440
-Thank you.
-There you go.

137
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
What a stupid boy.

138
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,400
He gave me something that's a waste
of money and cannot be kept.

139
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,320
But it smells quite nice.

140
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,800
Are there really 520 flowers?

141
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,000
Let me count them.

142
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,160
335, 336

143
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,520
337, 338, 339, 340

144
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,480
341, 342, 343, 344...

145
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,080
364, 365...

146
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,320
370, 371, 372

147
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
373, 374, 375

148
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,040
376, 377, 378

149
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,240
379. 380...

150
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,120
380, 381, 382, 383...

151
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,800
390, 391, 392, 393...

152
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,640
514, 515

153
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,160
516, 517, 518, 519.

154
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,640
Why is it still 519?

155
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,680
<i>So what do you think?
Do you like the roses?</i>

156
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,680
<i>You don't need to call and thank me.</i>

157
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,040
Daoming Si, you were supposed
to give me 520 flowers.

158
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,840
It's just 519. Where's the other one?

159
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,520
<i>No way.</i>

160
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,240
<i>Did you miscount since you're too stupid?</i>

161
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,280
How's that possible?
I counted 800 times. It's still 519.

162
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,480
<i>Eight hundred times?</i>

163
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,120
<i>Who would be so lame to count it
that many times?</i>

164
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,160
You're the lame one. I don't care.

165
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,600
I want 520 flowers.
It can't be missing one.

166
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,360
All right. Somebody's here.
I'll deal with you later.

167
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,960
Because there's another one here.

168
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,240
Why are you so lame?

169
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
You even hid one flower.

170
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,640
You dare say I'm lame?

171
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,000
See how I'll deal with you.

172
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,640
No.

173
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,800
-Don't.
-Come here.

174
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,840
I'm not going over there.

175
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,680
Come here.

176
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,720
Turns out 520 flowers are a lot.
I've never seen it with my own eyes.

177
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,920
I haven't seen it before either.

178
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,760
Daoming Si is so romantic.

179
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,240
If somebody gave me this many flowers,
I'd marry him right away.

180
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,840
You're talking about Ximen, right?

181
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,920
How are things between you two lately?

182
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,960
What does that shy look on your face mean?

183
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,440
Shancai. We're together now.

184
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,160
Together?

185
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,200
You and Ximen?

186
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,200
Yes.

187
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Wait.

188
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,520
What do you mean?

189
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,240
Do you mean that you're in a relationship?

190
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,640
Yes.

191
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,240
Does Ximen feel the same way?

192
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,600
Yes, I'm sure.

193
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,720
We're officially together.
It happened that day I went to see him.

194
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,920
Xiaoyou.

195
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,200
I have so many questions right now.

196
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,640
But seeing that you're so happy,
I won't ask you anything.

197
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,400
As long as you're happy,
everything's fine.

198
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,840
No wonder.

199
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
After you went to see Ximen,

200
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,040
you changed your new QZone profile picture
to one with a bright smile.

201
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,280
Turns out you've succeeded in love.

202
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,480
That's right. It was taken that day.

203
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,720
<i>It sounded so nice.</i>

204
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,920
When I heard the music
from outside earlier,

205
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,000
I was thinking who could play
such a nice tune in school aside from you.

206
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,800
Turns out it was you.

207
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,800
Why are you back in school today?

208
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,240
I suddenly wanted to come back
and play here.

209
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
I feel like I won't be back
for a long time.

210
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,480
Before I leave the country, I want to
reminisce about playing music here.

211
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,160
You left a lot of memories
in this music room.

212
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,320
It would surely miss you when you're gone.

213
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,040
Did you say yes to Si's proposal?

214
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,080
Yes.

215
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,400
Why does it feel like you're worried?

216
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,600
I'm not sure either.

217
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,680
I feel like

218
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,920
so many things happened between us.

219
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,840
Maybe there's more yet to come.

220
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,480
Don't worry.

221
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,360
The two of you overcame so many trials.

222
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,560
Nothing can bring you down.

223
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,080
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Dong.</i>

224
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,640
<i>-Please let Shancai marry me.
-No.</i>

225
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,560
I strongly object to this.

226
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,600
Daoming Si is so thoughtful.

227
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,920
He even brought a skin care package.

228
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,040
But this is too sudden.

229
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,680
Shancai hasn't even graduated yet.

230
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,760
Since I've decided to work
at the Daoming Group,

231
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,400
I might be traveling around a lot.

232
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm afraid I'll be too busy
and have less time to spend with Shancai.

233
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,600
Are you not confident about Shancai
or is Shancai not confident about you?

234
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,080
No.

235
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,760
Shancai and I are both very confident.

236
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,800
However...

237
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,040
However,

238
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,960
you don't want your mom
to interfere with your relationship.

239
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,480
So you're ignoring how she feels
and want to get married right away?

240
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,120
How can youngsters like you
be so impulsive?

241
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
Mom.

242
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,120
Sorry.

243
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,480
We didn't mean to make you and Dad mad.

244
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,120
We just don't want to face
the problem with his mom.

245
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,600
Daoming Si, you know
that we really like you.

246
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,000
You're very respectful and well-mannered.

247
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,280
You're an outstanding person
inside and out.

248
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,040
And we know how nice you treat Shancai.

249
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,080
But have you ever thought
about her position?

250
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,720
If you get married just like that,
how would she face your mom afterward?

251
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,320
Shancai.

252
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,480
Your mom is very traditional
and she values family and harmony.

253
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,480
Yes. Mrs. Dong is right.

254
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,680
I'll ask my mom to allow me
to marry Shancai now.

255
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,360
Now?

256
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,440
Isn't your mom overseas?

257
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,600
She should be awake by this time.

258
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,120
I'll make a video call
and tell her about this.

259
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,560
No.

260
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,200
Don't.

261
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,120
Shancai.

262
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,720
Your mom is right.

263
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,800
We need to do this sooner or later.

264
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,760
Let's not evade it.
Let's face it together.

265
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,160
CALLING MOM

266
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,320
SI CALLING

267
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,760
<i>Hello?</i>

268
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,840
Mom.

269
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,640
I'm at Shancai's house with her parents.

270
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,040
-Hi, Mrs. Daoming.
-Let's say hi too.

271
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,560
Hello.

272
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,680
Hi.

273
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,040
Mom.

274
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,920
I'm here today to ask her parents
and you to allow Shancai and I

275
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,240
to get married.

276
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,080
Si.

277
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,720
Do you know what you're doing now?

278
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,640
Yes, I do.

279
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,840
I want to marry Shancai
as soon as possible.

280
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,440
There's no other woman for me.

281
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,480
Let me say something.

282
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,560
To me, marriage is not child's play.

283
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,040
<i>It's between two families.
We can't deal with it lightly.</i>

284
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,240
<i>Both sides' parents must agree
and acknowledge it.</i>

285
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,000
<i>We can't do this rashly.</i>

286
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,040
That's right.

287
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,160
I agree with Mrs. Dong on this.

288
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,920
Mom, I really hope you can allow
Shancai and I to get married.

289
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,920
Si.

290
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,160
Marriage is not child's play.

291
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,920
<i>Even more so for the Daoming family.</i>

292
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,960
We have to plan it carefully.

293
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,160
Plan it carefully?

294
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,640
Mom.

295
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,280
-So you're agreeing.
-You...

296
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,880
I'm busy now. I don't have time to talk.

297
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
When you're back home,

298
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,120
<i>we can discuss
the marriage-related matters.</i>

299
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,400
She agreed.

300
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,600
It seems your mom is not
that firmly opposed to this marriage.

301
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,960
My mom knows me well.

302
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,920
Once I've made my decision, it won't
change no matter how she opposes it.

303
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,120
And this is

304
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,800
my marriage we're talking about.

305
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,440
-I was so scared I couldn't even breathe.
-Here.

306
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,680
Yes.

307
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,720
Daoming Si.

308
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,040
Your mom's aura is so strong.

309
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,000
Just looking at her through the screen
made my hands all sweaty.

310
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,920
Look. They're still wet.

311
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,560
So what if you've sweat a lot?
Look at me pretending to be calm.

312
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,080
Actually, I was really scared.
My heart was beating so fast.

313
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,400
It's still out of rhythm now.

314
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,240
If Mrs. Dong was not firm
on getting my mom's permission,

315
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,760
I want to marry Shancai now.

316
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
These kids.

317
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,280
If you really love each other,
does it matter if you wait a bit longer?

318
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,680
All right. Your dad and I
will go to Shanghai next week

319
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,960
and wait for your mom to discuss
your marriage, okay?

320
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,400
Okay.

321
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,360
Come on.

322
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,720
SQUID KING

323
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,760
"Squid King's signature
Eight Treasure Spicy Sauce."

324
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,160
Shancai.

325
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,640
Your Eight Treasure Spicy Sauce
is so popular.

326
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,080
That's right.

327
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,640
Shancai came up with a lot of flavors
for our neighbors and friends.

328
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,040
Lots of people are selling squid here now.
It's becoming a squid street.

329
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,200
Eight Treasure Spicy Sauce
with fresh squid.

330
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,720
What a nice idea.

331
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,840
That's right.

332
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,480
Do you know? Two days ago,

333
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,240
somebody came to discuss
franchising with us.

334
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,080
I didn't really understand it,

335
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,920
but I have my future son-in-law.
I don't need to worry.

336
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,160
Of course. I'll handle it.

337
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,480
-Mom, I'll go and make preparations.
-Okay.

338
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,480
Me too.

339
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,800
You don't have to go. You're our guest.

340
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,440
Let us do it.

341
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,200
Mother, I won't be a guest any longer.

342
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,960
We'll be family.

343
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,400
Calling me Mother feels so good.
I'm so overwhelmed.

344
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,720
Call me again.

345
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,240
Mother.

346
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,640
Go and help.

347
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,520
He called me mother.

348
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,320
<i>I can't believe I'm seeing
Daoming Si in an apron.</i>

349
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,720
<i>This really goes against his image.</i>

350
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,400
Daoming Si.

351
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,200
My room is very small.

352
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,440
Are you sure you want to sleep here?

353
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
Don't worry.

354
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,800
It's not my first time sleeping
in a so-called small room, okay?

355
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,000
But you're sleeping with my dad this time.

356
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,520
So what?

357
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,960
I'm not sure if he snores.

358
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,320
Even if there's thunder,
I'll still be able to sleep.

359
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,440
Here. A small fishing village
has no nice hotels.

360
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,760
-Thank you, Mr. Dong.
-It's fine.

361
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,360
You're so tall. It must be hard for you
to sleep in a small room.

362
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,240
Well, it'll have to do for tonight.

363
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,800
-Okay.
-Let's share the room.

364
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,840
Okay.

365
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,520
Let's sleep.

366
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,920
By the way...

367
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,400
By the way, I heard you helped out
at the store today.

368
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,040
You must be tired.

369
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,360
It's fine. I'm not tired.

370
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,040
Please take care of Shancai from now on.

371
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,760
Don't worry. I will.

372
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,800
Shancai looks like her mom
and their tempers are the same too.

373
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,000
They could be fierce.

374
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,120
Actually, they're very gentle
and kind deep inside.

375
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,040
You have to be more patient with her.

376
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,920
Yes, I know.

377
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,760
Also, you're so handsome.

378
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,920
If a girl throws herself at you
in the future,

379
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,840
you must refuse her.

380
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,320
So that you won't hurt Shancai.

381
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,000
Don't worry.
I won't be interested in other girls.

382
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,640
All right.

383
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,120
And also, some bad habits
cannot be tolerated, such as gambling.

384
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,960
Everything is over once a man gambles.

385
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,360
Mr. Dong, don't worry.

386
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,680
-I won't gamble.
-Okay.

387
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,960
You don't.

388
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,280
But sometimes, a man has to do things
for his image or to make friends, then...

389
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,240
They'll say they had no choice.

390
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,040
I was bad when I was
in senior high school.

391
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,280
But my good friends helped change me.

392
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,080
They're very good people.

393
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,520
Don't worry.

394
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,040
Yes. I...

395
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,440
Am I nagging at you?

396
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,160
I know.

397
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,360
You all come from well-known families.

398
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,720
I'm the unsuccessful one.

399
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,360
What right do I have to educate you?

400
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,240
To put it bluntly,

401
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,160
I'm just an ordinary dad
who's worried about her daughter.

402
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,680
Mr. Dong.

403
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,440
Please don't say that.

404
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,800
I was attracted to Shancai
because of her personality.

405
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,080
Her world view, her values.

406
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,200
You taught her so well.

407
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,040
You gave her so much love.
That's very incredible.

408
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,720
Really? You really think so?

409
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,080
That's great.

410
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,000
I don't need to worry about
entrusting Shancai to you.

411
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,720
It's true.

412
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,720
Shancai is really a very nice kid.

413
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,040
All right. I'll stop.

414
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,040
If I go on, I'll...

415
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,960
I'll regret marrying Shancai off so early.

416
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,040
I'll stop. Let's sleep.

417
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,280
Mr. Dong.

418
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,760
Let me take care of Shancai.

419
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,280
I won't let her down.

420
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,880
Let's sleep.
Do you want to sleep on the bed?

421
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,240
No. You go ahead.

422
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,760
Good night.

423
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,120
That's great, Shancai.
I'm so happy for you.

424
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,320
So am I the first friend to know
about your marriage?

425
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,320
Of course.

426
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,160
Goodness.

427
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,840
You're the first one to get married
in our senior high school class.

428
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,880
I can imagine the whole class
attending your wedding.

429
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,440
It would be so much fun.

430
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,960
Do you remember when Daoming Si
hit Yan Zhibu at our reunion?

431
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,760
On your wedding day,

432
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,200
those guys who wanted to pursue you
would surely get Daoming Si drunk

433
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,680
so that he won't be able
to sleep with you.

434
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,400
All right, Xiaoyou.
Aren't you getting too excited?

435
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,000
Of course I'm excited.

436
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,080
I've seen your journey with Daoming Si.

437
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,160
From initially hating each other

438
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,280
until he pursued you so relentlessly.

439
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,720
He likes you, but you didn't like him.

440
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,280
After you already liked each other,
his mom created trouble.

441
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,680
Then you two
experienced life and death together.

442
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,120
I know what happened
better than anyone else.

443
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,960
And I can relate to it better than anyone.

444
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,200
Now that I think about it,

445
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,680
if you didn't keep on advising me

446
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,880
and encouraging me

447
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,800
and served as my friend and love analyst,

448
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,160
Daoming Si and I
might have already broken up.

449
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,360
Thanks to you,

450
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,280
we're still together.

451
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,640
So it's all because of me?

452
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,880
Yes.

453
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,840
Then I'll ask for a big red envelope
from Daoming Si.

454
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,000
Sure. I'll ask him to give you a big one.

455
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,320
-Don't lie to me.
-Why would I do that?

456
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,200
Perfect timing.

457
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,080
Tomorrow, F4 will make a speech
in Mingde as outstanding graduates.

458
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,560
I'll tell him if I see him.

459
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,240
Tomorrow?

460
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,360
Why? Do you have a date?

461
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,760
I have a date with Ximen.

462
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,080
-You won't get a red envelope then.
-No way.

463
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,600
On your wedding day,

464
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,720
I'd surely ask Daoming Si
to give me a big red envelope.

465
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,600
You should be the one giving us
the red envelope then.

466
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,120
What do you mean "us"?

467
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,120
Is your heart is already one
with your husband

468
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,320
to ask me for a red envelope?

469
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,720
That's so sweet.

470
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,240
Yes. We are sweet.

471
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,640
Xiaoyou.

472
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,560
Beloved students.

473
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,560
Mingde is a university full of elites.

474
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,880
This university helped develop
many outstanding talents.

475
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,520
Among them are Mingde's
legendary students.

476
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,400
F4.

477
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,200
F4.

478
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,200
-F4
-Yes.

479
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,600
Everyone knows who I'm talking about.

480
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,440
Now, may we please invite Ximen
to come up on stage on F4's behalf

481
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,880
and say a few words.

482
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,400
Beloved teachers

483
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
and students,

484
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,520
good morning.

485
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,360
I'm Ximen Yan.

486
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,360
Today, I return to Mingde with great joy.

487
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,600
And hope to bring you some inspiration.

488
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,600
Mingde University
has the most professional courses

489
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,560
and the best teachers.

490
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,240
But friendship is the most
important lesson

491
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,160
that's not taught in books.

492
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,440
I have three important friends in my life.

493
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,320
At Mingde University,

494
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,040
we studied together and grew together.

495
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,960
Let me share our story with you.

496
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,320
This auditorium

497
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,600
is where F4 won many awards,

498
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,040
especially for the bridge competition.

499
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,120
Because of the many awards we received,

500
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,560
a lot of students came forth
to challenge us.

501
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,960
That's right. Everybody knows
and has heard rumors

502
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,680
about the bets.

503
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,720
The most ridiculous one

504
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,080
was eating slippers upon losing.

505
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,080
So, what do you want from me?

506
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,960
What do you want?

507
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,560
Treat me to dinner.

508
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,400
What did you say?

509
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,040
Yes, we all know that.

510
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,000
But we still don't know
if it's true or not.

511
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,720
All right.

512
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,600
I'll tell you the story
about eating slippers.

513
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,360
There was a student
who confidently challenged us.

514
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,520
He was sure he's going to win.

515
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,800
At the bridge table, he declared

516
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,240
that the loser would eat his own slippers.

517
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,960
He lost in the end.

518
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,280
When he stood up, we just realized

519
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,440
he was wearing slippers.

520
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,080
Of course.

521
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,720
We didn't really let him eat his slippers.

522
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,040
Later on, when we saw that student again,
we forgot his name

523
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,000
-and called him, "Eat slippers."
-I already forgot his name.

524
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,360
-Me too.
-That's how

525
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,120
the story of F4
making someone eat slippers

526
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,840
spread like wildfire.

527
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,280
This story then became
one of the legends in school.

528
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,000
In Mingde, we laughed,

529
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,400
enjoyed, cried, and suffered.

530
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,000
In life, there are always ups and downs.

531
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,880
But I'm very lucky

532
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,640
because I was not alone.

533
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,160
There were always three friends
who were with me.

534
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,520
And never left my side.

535
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,440
We're not real brothers,
but our ties are even stronger.

536
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,880
We know each other

537
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,840
more than we know ourselves.

538
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,960
The famous British philosopher
Francis Bacon once said,

539
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,560
"Friendship not only lets people overcome
feelings of resentment and depression

540
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,280
and walk towards a cloudless sky,

541
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,000
it can also rid them of dark thoughts

542
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,440
and always make them think
with light and reason."

543
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,360
That's the best way to describe F4.

544
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,680
Beloved students.

545
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,960
Mingde can be considered
a new beginning in your lives.

546
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,000
In the future,
you'll fulfill countless dreams.

547
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,280
Daoming Si.

548
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,200
Come and visit us after you graduate.

549
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,320
-Don't worry.
-Yes.

550
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,360
After I graduate, I'll come and visit.

551
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,360
He's so handsome.

552
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,920
-Really?
-You all have to miss me.

553
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,840
-You have to honor your word.
-No problem.

554
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,240
-Please sign this for me.
-Okay.

555
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,880
Can I take a picture with you?

556
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,360
Me too.

557
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,960
Here. Please sign this for me.

558
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,200
Look here.

559
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,520
He's so handsome.

560
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,200
-I want it too.
-Daoming Si.

561
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,480
Please sign this for me.

562
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,120
-Let's take a picture.
-Please sign this.

563
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,240
Please sign here.

564
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,520
-Look here.
-He's so handsome.

565
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,760
I'm so happy.

566
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,880
Hey.

567
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,520
Green shoe guy.

568
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,120
What do you want?

569
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,200
What's this?

570
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,680
A broken phone.

571
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,160
<i>Hey! I'm not done yet!</i>

572
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,840
That's enough.

573
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,680
Ximen.

574
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,640
-Can we take a picture with you?
-Just one.

575
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,160
-Look at the camera.
-Look here.

576
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,680
Huaze Lei too.

577
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,360
-He's so handsome.
-Thank you.

578
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,480
Let's take another one, okay?

579
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,080
Let's go.

580
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,520
-Bye.
-Come and visit often.

581
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,480
Green shoe guy.

582
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,800
Why did you wear that?

583
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,760
To bring back embarrassing memories
and infuriate me?

584
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,200
There are so many people here
and you're so silly.

585
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,720
I was afraid you won't be able
to find me. So I wore this.

586
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,840
Why should I go find you?
Can't you come find me?

587
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,480
Is this how a boyfriend should be?

588
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,480
You...

589
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,360
You two are really a strange couple.

590
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,200
Must fighting be your way
of communicating?

591
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,800
That's right. Isn't it good
to talk about how you really feel?

592
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,840
Shancai. Do you know?

593
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,600
When you called me "Green Shoe Guy,"

594
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,360
you've already captured my heart.

595
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,040
It hasn't changed since.

596
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,600
Si.

597
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,760
Did you know?
We'll talk about our marriage tomorrow.

598
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,680
Don't forget about me.

599
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,600
Don't let me wait all alone.

600
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,880
Ximen.

601
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,200
Just say yes to Meizuo.

602
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,960
I'll surely give you two
a big red envelope.

603
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,720
Shancai.

604
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,400
After discussing your marriage with Si,
you're already considered as Mrs. Daoming.

605
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,880
Before that happens,
we want to throw Si a bachelor party.

606
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,960
I didn't even know about that party.

607
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,760
Isn't the party organizer very rude?

608
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,680
You're too sensitive.
Aren't we telling you now?

609
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,000
We'll do it tomorrow night.

610
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,400
That's right.

611
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,680
Shancai. Tomorrow night, Si is ours.

612
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,440
Stay away.

613
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,520
All right.

614
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,480
He's all yours.

615
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,440
You can have him for tonight.

616
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,680
Don't be shy.

617
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,960
-You don't have to be shy.
-All right.

618
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,960
Let's go.

619
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,040
Honestly, I'm quite envious.

620
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,640
I'm fine.

621
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,760
There will still be trouble
whether you're in love or not.

622
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,200
I'm fine too.

623
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,840
You're just fine?
Don't you have a date tonight?

624
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,840
You're fine?
Are you purposely infuriating me?

625
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,560
Do you two have time tonight?

626
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,520
I smell something fishy.

627
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,880
What's up?

628
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,000
What else?

629
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,520
The usual antics.

630
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,040
It's been a while, okay?

631
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,800
We helped you set it up last time.

632
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,080
Tell me, are you helping out or not?

633
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,920
I'm attending
a music professor's gathering tonight.

634
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,160
Bye.

635
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,920
I have to go to an activity
for the occasion tonight.

636
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,040
Bye.

637
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,520
Hey.

638
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,400
I'll do it alone then.

639
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,480
Ximen.

640
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,240
Why are you here all alone?

641
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,480
-Your speech was great today.
-Yes.

642
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,680
I feel proud of being part of F4 too.

643
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,360
By the way, can I have the bridge room?

644
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,600
Chen Qinghe.

645
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,640
Present.

646
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,800
Are you free tonight?

647
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,320
Me?

648
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,920
Yes.
