A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 13

3
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,640
Zhou Caina is probably
Shancai's most formidable opponent.

4
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,640
They're all her opponents.

5
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,720
Junior champion
of Chinese Delicacies Competition,

6
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,480
finalist of Le Cordon Bleu
Girls Competition...

7
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,880
Even without those titles,
Shancai is nothing compared to her.

8
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,400
You're still drinking milk?

9
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,440
Are you even listening to us?

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
Do you want some? It's in the fridge.

11
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,520
Get some for yourself.

12
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,800
Is that supposed to be funny?

13
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,200
If Shancai loses,
don't come complaining to us.

14
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,880
Did you guys forget?

15
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,800
She's the only girl
that dares stand up to F4.

16
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,400
What can't she do?

17
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,320
I believe she can do it.

18
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,960
Just wait and see Shancai
surprises everyone.

19
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,080
Attitude determines everything.

20
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,480
When you're cooking in the kitchen,

21
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,880
your attitude is what's most important.

22
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,480
-Have you read the <i>Book of Songs</i>?
-Yes.

23
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,800
"The elegant virtuous maiden;
the noble person would love to marry her."

24
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,320
From now on,

25
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,600
I'll train you well
and turn you into a star chef!

26
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,240
Only when you combine
the <i>Book of Songs</i> and cuisine,

27
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,800
you will be able to make food
that has culture.

28
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,040
Those who eat the food
will experience amazement

29
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,880
deep down in their hearts.

30
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,320
Bring out the scallions.

31
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,480
Okay.

32
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,520
Why did you squeal?

33
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,400
Ms. Zhuang, you stepped on me
with your heels.

34
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,240
I'm sorry.

35
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,240
Make a pot of steaming hot soy milk

36
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,560
and instill your love
for your family in it.

37
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,400
That's what touches hearts.

38
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,520
Appetizers aren't the main course,

39
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,200
but they can complement the main course.

40
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,480
They help people build up an appetite

41
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,400
and make the meal unforgettable.

42
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,840
You and your dishes
will be engraved into their brains.

43
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,160
As long as you follow these principles,

44
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,600
you will be invincible
in the world of cuisine.

45
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,960
But, you must work hard
and practice continuously.

46
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,840
That's how you will improve.

47
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,440
I'll record everything I know

48
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,640
so you can listen
and practice at the same time.

49
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,320
Remember,

50
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,880
no slacking off.

51
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,960
Okay, Ms. Zhuang.

52
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,360
<i>BOOK OF SONGS</i>

53
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,160
"Like a gem cut and filed,
carved and polished."

54
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,760
Vertical cut, pushing cut, pulling cut,
sawing cut, rolling cut.

55
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,880
"As if at the brink of a deep abyss,
as if treading on thin ice."

56
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,000
<i>When the water boils, add some salt.</i>

57
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,680
<i>Let it boil again and add cold water.</i>

58
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,640
<i>Take out the noodles quickly
and put them in iced water.</i>

59
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,920
"The peach tree is young and elegant;
brilliant are its flowers."

60
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,440
<i>Use high heat for raw ingredients,
medium heat for cooked ingredients,</i>

61
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,080
<i>and low heat for mixing ingredients.</i>

62
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,520
<i>When the oil is about 120 degrees heated,
throw in the spices to flavor the oil.</i>

63
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,640
<i>"Blue-collared lad,
you’ve long been in my heart."</i>

64
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,560
<i>Whether it be classic plating,
free form plating,</i>

65
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,040
<i>landscape plating, or radial plating,</i>

66
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,000
<i>remember, you must treat
your food as a work of art.</i>

67
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,240
Lover ducks meeting at Magpie Bridge.

68
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Mushrooms and assorted vegetables.

69
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,040
Abalone, chicken, and pickled vegetables.

70
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,880
Steamed lobsters with garlic.

71
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,360
<i>Today, we're going
to practice cooking chicken.</i>

72
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,960
<i>We're making braised
sliced chicken with eggs.</i>

73
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
<i>Now, take out a whole chicken.</i>

74
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,000
<i>Check if all the feathers
have been plucked.</i>

75
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,800
<i>Next, marinate it in the sauce
you prepared beforehand.</i>

76
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,120
<i>Massage the chicken
and let the sauce sink in.</i>

77
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,960
Zhuang, are you doing yoga?

78
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,400
Si, good thing you're here.

79
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,960
Take a video of me
so I can show my friends in London.

80
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,280
Why are you wearing earphones?

81
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,560
I want to look professional.

82
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,320
Enough talking. Get ready.

83
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,760
-Ready?
-Yeah.

84
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,760
<i>There's skill involved
in massaging the chicken.</i>

85
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,440
Hello, Mom. I'm busy right now.
I'll call you back later.

86
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,680
<i>There's a skill involved
in massaging the chicken.</i>

87
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,600
Okay, make a circle
with your right leg three times.

88
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,400
Okay, now your left leg.

89
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,480
Now, relax your neck.

90
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,200
Turn to the right, three times.

91
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,320
Okay, let's relax your whole body.

92
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,360
Slap your body.

93
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,920
Now, put your hands up,

94
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,320
exhale.

95
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,320
<i>Repeat after me.</i>

96
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,720
<i>All right, last of all,</i>

97
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,480
lower your head between your legs.

98
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,840
<i>Go low for me, come on.</i>

99
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,520
Last three breaths. Repeat after me.

100
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,160
Zhuang,

101
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,280
why are you here?

102
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,800
-I was worried you would disturb Shancai.
-What?

103
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,200
I was just tucking her in.

104
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,400
<i>"Nights of Azure Aea and Blue Skies."</i>

105
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,120
<i>"Famed Peony, Fairest Lady in Bliss."</i>

106
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,480
-"Fine Wine in a Luminous Glass."
-"Famed Peony, Fairest Lady in Bliss."

107
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,400
"Shepherd Points
to Almond Flower Village."

108
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,440
"South of the River,
the Grass Grows High While it Rains."

109
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,240
"The Moon is Low,
Crows Caw in the Frosty Sky."

110
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,600
-"The Swallow Returns from Familiar Days."
-Wait.

111
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,960
It's just food.

112
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,560
Why are you giving the dishes
such complicated names?

113
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,560
These are all dishes inspired
by Tang poetry.

114
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,800
Shancai worked very hard on them.

115
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,920
Try the food.

116
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
They all taste great.

117
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,040
Which one is your least favorite?

118
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,240
Which one?

119
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,920
I guess, this one.

120
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,280
Improve the shepherd dish.

121
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,560
Okay.

122
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,800
Which has the worst colors?

123
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,480
-Zhuang. I don't want--
-Which one?

124
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,240
I guess, this one.

125
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,920
Improve the moon and crow dish.

126
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,360
Okay.

127
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,560
Which one is the most delicious?

128
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,840
"The Peony and Lady" one was the best.

129
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,760
That was a failed dish.

130
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,720
You probably only remember
that dish's name.

131
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,920
Nope.

132
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,440
This one was "The Bird Returns
from Familiar Days."

133
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,800
I liked this one the most.

134
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,880
It's "The Swallow Returns
from Familiar Days."

135
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,760
Don't be picky about the details.

136
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,320
You're right.

137
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,680
That chicken dish was impeccable.

138
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,120
Don't feel too proud.

139
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,480
Keep working hard.

140
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,520
Be diligent at all times.

141
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,400
-"As if at the brink of a deep abyss,
-"As if at the brink of a deep abyss,

142
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,800
-as if treading on thin ice."
-as if treading on thin ice."

143
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,400
Ice cream?

144
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Let's eat.

145
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,560
What's Shancai up to lately?

146
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,280
I think she's preparing for a competition.

147
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,360
Competition?

148
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,560
Good morning, you two.

149
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,960
I was going to class
to have you try this dessert I made.

150
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,560
Good thing I saw you here.

151
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,720
What a coincidence.

152
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,840
Please try this.

153
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,600
Let me know what you think.

154
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
This is so good.

155
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,440
Yeah, Shancai, this is amazing.

156
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,600
What is it?

157
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,720
"The Chinese Courtesan,

158
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,400
The Beautiful, Youthful,
Sweet-scented Dong Xiaowan."

159
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,760
It's just a sesame ball.

160
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,680
Normal sesame balls don't have culture.

161
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,720
This is different.

162
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,760
By the way, what is Dong Xiaowan?

163
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,400
Well, Dong Xiaowan was a person.

164
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,760
I guess you didn't know that.

165
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,880
Who's Dong XIaowan?

166
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,520
She was one of
the Eight Beauties of Qinhuai.

167
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,720
An outstanding cook as well.

168
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,360
Do you understand now, dear sir?

169
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,080
Shancai, what did you just call me?

170
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,960
Dear sir.

171
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,600
Li Zhen, what's wrong with her?

172
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Ms. Zhuang said...

173
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,440
Ms. Zhuang said
I need to be lady-like at all times.

174
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,960
That's how I can be more elegant.

175
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,080
By doing so in daily life,

176
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,160
I can be more natural
during the competition.

177
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,040
Is this what you call natural?

178
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,160
It sounds like you're a machine.

179
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,240
You were cuter the way you were.

180
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Really?

181
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,200
Did I go too far?

182
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,840
It's not like you're in a play.

183
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,520
It's not weird when Ms. Zhuang does it.

184
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,640
Why is it so weird when I do it?

185
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,680
It's fine. Shancai, just keep trying.

186
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,640
What competition were you talking about?

187
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,400
Chinese Cuisine Culinary Competition.

188
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,480
I'm participating in the contest
so I can pay Si back with the prize money.

189
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,200
My fair lady, I'm sure you'll win.

190
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,280
-Qinghe.
-Yes?

191
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,680
What did you just call me?

192
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,920
Gosh,

193
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,280
Shancai influenced me.

194
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,840
Now I'm talking weird.

195
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,360
You must work hard, my lady.

196
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,160
I will.

197
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,600
Why are you participating
in the cooking competition?

198
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,120
I saw your name online.

199
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,160
Because I need money.

200
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,080
Did you know there's
a contestant called Zhou Caina?

201
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,120
-Zhou Caina?
-Yes.

202
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,640
Her dad is the founder
of Double-X Real Estate Group.

203
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,000
My dad wants me to marry her.

204
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,640
She must be good then.

205
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,840
If I'm not mistaken,

206
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,240
she's competing because of me.

207
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,240
Why?

208
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,320
She knows I like cooking.

209
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,440
She wants to prove that she has
the same hobby as I do.

210
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,320
It's not just because
our families arranged it.

211
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,640
She's trying very hard. Do you like her?

212
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,840
She's very pretty,

213
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,760
elegant, and talented.

214
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,000
But I don't like her.

215
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,480
The person I like...

216
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,360
You know about that.

217
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,160
So, you're trying to tell me

218
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,920
I might be beaten
by your childhood friend?

219
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,240
I'm suggesting that you give up.

220
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,520
You won't win the prize.

221
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,160
Zhou Caina was a finalist
in Le Cordon Bleu Girls Competition.

222
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,120
She's going to win the competition.

223
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,840
Shancai, I know your capability.

224
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,120
There's a huge difference between you two.

225
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,800
If you compete with her,
you'll embarrass yourself.

226
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,360
THE EXTRAORDINARY ZHOU CAINA

227
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,360
<i>Zhou Caina was a finalist
in Le Cordon Bleu Girls Competition.</i>

228
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,640
<i>She's going to win the competition.</i>

229
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,280
She's so talented.

230
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,520
Even if I don't eat, drink, sleep,

231
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,680
and just study
for three years straight, I can't win.

232
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,760
How can I win?

233
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,760
I'm going to embarrass myself.

234
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,200
No.

235
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,480
I should go tell Ms. Zhuang
that I'm quitting.

236
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,000
Let me tell you.

237
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,320
I hate those people
who think that they'll lose

238
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,000
even before they enter the competition.

239
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,280
That kind of people
would never succeed no matter what.

240
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,800
Never mind.

241
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,480
Ms. Zhuang would beat me to death.

242
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,560
I'll just secretly leave

243
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,720
and explain everything to her later.

244
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,840
Are you running away?

245
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,280
I'm going to find a way to pay you back.

246
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,400
I thought you were a special girl.

247
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
But you're just another coward

248
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,400
who runs away when things get tough.

249
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,520
If I can't win, why should I compete?

250
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,680
You're so weak.

251
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,240
I'm not weak.

252
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,640
But how am I supposed
to compete with someone

253
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,160
who competed in Le Cordon Bleu
Girls Competition in high school?

254
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,200
-I don't want to disappoint everyone.
-What about disappointing me?

255
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,920
I'm sorry.

256
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,760
I'm sorry I let you down.

257
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,480
You're being ridiculous.

258
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,600
This isn't the Dong Shancai I know.

259
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,080
You don't have the right to say that.

260
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,240
You've never failed
in your whole life growing up.

261
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,040
Do you know how much stress I'm under?

262
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,440
Why do you care about what people think?

263
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,240
Just do what you want to do.

264
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,040
There's always a chance.

265
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,120
Why aren't you being mean anymore?

266
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,440
Why are you being so gentle?

267
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,400
Come to my room.

268
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,880
What are we doing?

269
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,880
Sleep. What else would it be?

270
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,160
Hurry up. I don't want you
to worry too much.

271
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,680
Your room is so big.

272
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,560
I'm kind of thirsty.

273
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,600
Do you want some water?

274
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,720
Here.

275
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
Are you tired?

276
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,080
Then...

277
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,480
Do you want to play?

278
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,520
You're very bold.

279
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,560
You tricked me!

280
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,480
I won't go easy on you.

281
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,600
One, two, three, four, five.

282
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,000
You didn't want me
to make it easy for you.

283
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,480
I won.

284
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,800
You cheated.

285
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,840
Hey, don't be a sore loser, okay?

286
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,280
-No.
-No?

287
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,080
You already got away with it a few times.

288
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,720
We're going through with it this time.

289
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,080
Don't make me look ugly.

290
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,680
Don't move. Or it'll ruin my masterpiece.

291
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,720
What are you drawing?

292
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,440
You'll see later.

293
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,400
Aren't you getting up yet?

294
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,920
Or, do you want
to play rock-paper-scissors?

295
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,280
Sure.

296
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,240
I won't lose this time.

297
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,520
Do you want to win so much?

298
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,640
Of course.

299
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,560
It'll be embarrassing if I lose again.

300
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,640
How about you take that spirit
and use it during the competition?

301
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,960
Do you think rock-paper-scissors
is the same as the competition?

302
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,080
Rock-paper-scissors is about pure luck.

303
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,280
The cooking competition is about skill.

304
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,720
Shancai,

305
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,720
I believe in you. You can do it.

306
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,760
You should believe in yourself too.

307
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,240
You're actually pretty cute up close.

308
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,760
I rarely compliment people.

309
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,360
You should be proud.

310
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,880
Let's play again.

311
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,760
Give it your best.

312
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,920
<i>Daoming Si, thank you.</i>

313
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,680
<i>I'll try my best.</i>

314
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,760
What? Shancai disappeared?

315
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,440
-Yes.
-Did you look for her?

316
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,840
I did.

317
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,480
I called the school and her family.

318
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,760
But, the weird thing is,

319
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,600
Shancai's luggage is in the hall.

320
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,640
Where's Si?

321
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
He's sleeping.

322
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,160
I didn't want to disturb him.

323
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,040
Shancai's gone and he's sleeping?

324
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,360
Hey, Daoming Si!

325
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,160
Who said you could take
these ugly pictures of me?

326
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,200
What? I think they're cute.

327
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,480
Cute? They're hideous.

328
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,680
Hey, what are you doing?
You can't rip them up.

329
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,680
They're mine.

330
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,560
It's my face.
I didn't give you permission.

331
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,680
Hey!

332
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,600
Calm down!

333
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,520
Hey!

334
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,120
-Calm down?
-Hey!

335
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,280
I won't!

336
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,640
-Hey!
-Hey!

337
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,120
So, Si, how's Shancai doing?

338
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,400
It's going great.

339
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,360
My sister and I are very confident.

340
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
Really?

341
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,560
Ms. Zhuang thinks she'll win?

342
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,720
Especially that dish called

343
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,040
"The Bird Returns from Familiar Days."

344
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,000
It's better than any dish I've ever had
made by famous cooks.

345
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,040
Isn't it "The Swallow Returns
from Familiar Days"?

346
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,120
It's a famous poem by Yan Shu.

347
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,360
Whatever.

348
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,720
It's just chicken.

349
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,880
I don't understand
what the fancy name is for.

350
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,440
Food is not just for the taste buds,
it's a form of cultural exchange.

351
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,880
Shancai has really improved.

352
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,160
But, even if she cooked rat poison,

353
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,640
Si would gobble it up right away.

354
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,560
Shut up.

355
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,120
I'm very objective, okay?

356
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,920
It's really tasty.

357
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,480
Here. This is tasty too.

358
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,080
More importantly, this Zhou Caina

359
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,120
seems to be the most likely to win.

360
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,600
I read about her.

361
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,400
She's smart, pretty, and elegant.

362
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,040
I wonder if she has a boyfriend.

363
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
Just wait and see.

364
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,560
I don't care if she's Caina, Lina, Xiena,

365
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,800
or even Madonna.

366
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,520
Shancai's cooking skills

367
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
will not disappoint you guys.

368
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,680
Let's hope the judges
will be able to see her true talent

369
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,720
and appreciate her for being different.

370
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,800
Who said she's different?

371
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,080
Bye.

372
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,320
<i>The competition is starting soon.</i>

373
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,800
I don't know if Shancai has a chance.

374
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,160
Honestly, Chinese cuisine
is deep and profound.

375
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,280
It's not something she can master
in a short time.

376
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,280
<i>But I think her basic skills
are very solid indeed.</i>

377
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,400
<i>Shancai's dishes are very natural</i>

378
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,120
<i>and they're free
from excessive processing,</i>

379
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,680
<i>which is a lot like her personality.</i>

380
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,880
Maybe during the competition,
she'll be able to find her niche.

381
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,080
<i>"Like a gem cut and filed,
carved and polished."</i>

382
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,040
<i>"As if at the brink of a deep abyss,
as if treading on thin ice."</i>

383
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,800
<i>"The peach tree is young and elegant;
brilliant are its flowers."</i>

384
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,720
<i>"Blue-collared lad,
you’ve long been in my heart."</i>

385
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,360
QINGHE HAS SENT YOU A QQ MESSAGE

386
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,080
<i>Shancai, what are you doing after class?</i>

387
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,960
<i>I need to practice cooking.</i>

388
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,040
Done.

389
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,080
"The Swallow Returns
from Familiar Days," version two.

390
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,120
Please enjoy.

391
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,640
What's this dish called?

392
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,040
"The Return of the Double Swallows."

393
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,800
There's only one chicken. Why double?

394
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,160
Ms. Zhuang, you'll know once you try it.

395
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,840
This chicken...

396
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,480
It's magnificent.

397
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,880
One side tastes sweet and sour,
one side has the fragrance of oranges.

398
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,240
It's too special!

399
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,120
Shancai,

400
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,680
how did you come up with this idea?

401
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,200
My mom's signature dish
is sweet and sour pork ribs.

402
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,920
I dedicate this dish to her.

403
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,280
There's a lot of vitamin C in oranges.

404
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,880
They're healthy and nutritious.

405
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,440
I want to share this dish with everyone
to help people eat healthier.

406
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,880
Shancai, you're very smart.

407
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,800
After using the orange juice,
you didn't throw them out.

408
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,000
You used them as decorations.

409
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,600
I really think you can go
to the competition now.

410
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,680
<i>Shancai, are you busy?</i>

411
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,960
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said that yesterday.

412
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,680
I know deep down that I'm not good enough.

413
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,920
So I never thought that
I would be able to enter the competition.

414
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,920
But, I want to seize this opportunity.

415
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,680
I don't want to let down
the people who helped me along the way.

416
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,400
Is one of them Daoming Si?

417
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,400
He's one of them.

418
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,240
I never would've guessed.

419
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,280
I thought you didn't like him.

420
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,560
I don't know.

421
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,680
In the beginning, I really hated him.

422
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,480
Sometimes I still want to punch him.

423
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,200
But, he's always been by my side

424
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,200
in a very peculiar way

425
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,760
and I couldn't help but notice him.

426
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,480
When I want to run away,

427
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,360
one look at him gives me courage.

428
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,600
I don't know how this happened.

429
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,360
Shancai,

430
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,600
you can probably tell
that I like you, right?

431
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,000
I think we'd be great together

432
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,960
if Si didn't exist in this world.

433
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,480
I hate to admit that

434
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,240
I lost to a guy like that.

435
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,880
Tian Ye,

436
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,880
I wish you all the best.

437
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,080
In the future, you'll become a great chef.

438
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,600
You'll own a fantastic restaurant

439
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,960
and meet a wonderful woman.

440
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,800
For real. Because you're
a wonderful person, too.

441
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,760
Thank you.

442
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,080
Shancai,

443
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,560
I hope you'll find happiness.

444
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,840
All right, I have to go now.

445
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,760
Shancai, you can stay here.

446
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,480
Leave after I'm out the door.

447
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,880
Because I don't have money for the bill.

448
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,360
Just kidding.

449
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,000
I just don't want to watch you leave.

450
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,080
Bye.

451
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,200
<i>What?</i>

452
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,640
You're competing in
Chinese Cuisine Culinary Competition?

453
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,440
No wonder you've been so busy lately.

454
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,600
Shancai, that's awesome!

455
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,480
Who's your teacher?
The restaurant you work at?

456
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,960
No, it's Daoming Si's sister.

457
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,720
She and her chef have been teaching me.

458
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,920
That's great.

459
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,720
She seems to be very nice.

460
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
How kind of them.

461
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,160
Next time, invite her to our house.

462
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,880
Your mom will cook them some food.

463
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,040
I can't do that.

464
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,840
They're professionals.

465
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,400
My food could never satisfy them.

466
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,440
That's not true.

467
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,920
My mom's cooking

468
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,920
-is the best in the world.
-That's right.

469
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,320
My wife's cooking
is healthy and delicious.

470
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,680
-Really?
-Yes.

471
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,880
All right, Shancai,
do your best at the competition today.

472
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,920
Dad and I will watch it on the TV.

473
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,040
-All right?
-Okay.

474
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,800
-Go!
-Go!

475
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,600

00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,840
<i>I'm...</i>

506
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,160
<i>Hi, I'm Dong Shancai.</i>

507
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,440
-It's Shancai.
-Shancai!

508
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,640
-Shancai!
-Shancai!

509
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,240
-We're here. Shancai!
-Shancai!

510
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,360
Go, Shancai!

511
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,320
Shancai!

512
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,360
What are you doing?

513
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,560
-Go!
-Go!

514
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,840
-What are you doing?
-Look.

515
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,200
<i>Mom, Dad, I'm on TV!</i>

516
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,720
Shancai!

517
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,840
Hey, look!

518
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,680
-It's our daughter!
<i>-Shancai said she's on TV.</i>

519
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,880
<i>What a cute girl.</i>

520
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,640
<i>Now, we'll hand it over
to today's host for the competition.</i>

521
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,560
We've introduced all our contestants.

522
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,160
I'm sure our viewers have a good idea
of who all our chefs are.

523
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,240
Going into commercials now

524
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,080
and then we'll see who gets a head start.

525
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,360
That Dong Shancai is so funny.

526
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,640
She's such a dork.

527
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,880
In my opinion, the organizers
wanted someone funnier

528
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,600
so the audience would feel entertained.

529
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,360
Hello, I'm Zhou Caina.

530
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,560
Hello.

531
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,200
I know about you. You're famous.

532
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,640
I'm Dong Shancai.

533
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,920
I know you too.

534
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,840
-You're famous too.
-Me?

535
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,920
That's impossible.

536
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,280
We have a mutual friend, don't we?

537
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,320
I've heard Tian Ye say
that you're very special.

538
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,520
No, that's not true.

539
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,160
It's all right. Good luck.

540
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,640
Don't get eliminated in the first round.

541
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,160
Compared to those showoffs,
I like opponents like you more.

542
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,880
What the hell?

543
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,480
There are so many commercials.

544
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,040
Si, the official competition
hasn't started yet.

545
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,240
Just be patient.

546
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,960
It's been forever.

547
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,560
It's been like one hour, right?

548
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,080
It's only been five minutes, okay?

549
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,840
He's in love. Days feel like years to him.

550
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,480
That Caina looks even better in person.

551
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,080
You're watching someone else?

552
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,880
Si's going to beat you up.

553
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,160
I now announce

554
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,760
that the sixth Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition starts now.

555
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,640
CHINESE CUISINE COOKING COMPETITION

556
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,320
<i>The first round of this competition
is stir-frying and slow stewing.</i>

557
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,440
<i>The contestants can pick
any ingredients they need</i>

558
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,720
<i>and complete their dishes
within two hours.</i>

559
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,960
<i>Four contestants will be
eliminated in this round.</i>

560
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,880
<i>We can see that our contestants
have chosen their ingredients.</i>

561
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,080
<i>They will have to work fast.</i>

562
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,880
<i>The main criteria for cutting
is to cut cleanly and precisely.</i>

563
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,200
<i>This can help the ingredients
suit the method of cooking.</i>

564
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,400
<i>The ingredients should be
of the same thickness and length.</i>

565
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,840
<i>This will ensure that the ingredients
will be cooked thoroughly</i>

566
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,040
<i>at the same time.</i>

567
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,520
<i>It seems like our contestants</i>

568
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,840
<i>have all decided to start
with the stewing part.</i>

569
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,840
<i>Zhou Caina is making a duck dish.</i>

570
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,040
<i>The duck is placed downwards in the pot.</i>

571
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,480
<i>Jinhua ham is used to give it flavor.
This should be a very healthy duck soup</i>

572
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,120
<i>with handmade fish balls.</i>

573
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,000
<i>Dong Shancai is now
frying the meatballs she just made.</i>

574
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,920
<i>She's probably making braised pork balls.</i>

575
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,680
Shancai's making my signature dish!

576
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,120
When did you ever make that?

577
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,720
Once or twice.

578
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,960
<i>The contestants are putting their pots
on the stove to stew.</i>

579
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,360
<i>They need to constantly check
the heat and be patient.</i>

580
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,400
<i>The first round has a two-hour time limit.</i>

581
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,840
<i>They have only 15 minutes left.</i>

582
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,760
Excuse me.

583
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,160
<i>Dong Shancai has finally moved
her pot to the stove.</i>

584
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,560
<i>Will her dish be done
within the time limit?</i>

585
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Excuse me.

586
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,000
Thank you.

587
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,400
I'm telling you, Shancai is only
using 50 percent of her skills now.

588
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,600
-Wait and see.
-What about Zhou Caina?

589
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,400
She's going to get eliminated for sure.

590
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,560
<i>While waiting for the pot to heat up,</i>

591
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,840
<i>the contestants are now
starting to make their stir-fry dish.</i>

592
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,800
<i>Stir-frying is an important skill
in Chinese cuisine.</i>

593
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,160
<i>It is essential to control the heat,
mix the ingredients,</i>

594
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,400
<i>and add everything in the right sequence.</i>

595
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,400
<i>This affects the taste of the dish
and shows the contestant's skills.</i>

596
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,600
<i>We can see Dong Shancai's ingredients.</i>

597
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,640
<i>She's going to make crystal prawn balls,
a Shanghai cuisine.</i>

598
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,080
<i>On the other side,
Zhou Caina is placing crab into the wok.</i>

599
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,760
<i>She's making a Cantonese dish,
fried crab with chili.</i>

600
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,360
<i>Fried crab with chili may seem simple,
but it's hard to get right.</i>

601
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,720
Zhou Caina is really something.

602
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,200
Shancai's crystal prawn balls
look so good!

603
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,440
I'm starting to drool.

604
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,280
<i>Who will be able to advance
to the next round?</i>

605
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,760
<i>We are about to find out.</i>
