00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,160
EPISODE 44

3
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,960
This is a day
that's worthy of a celebration.

4
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,640
Even the King of Hell hates Daoming Si,

5
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,360
the immortal monster.

6
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,640
So the monster kicked Daoming Si out
and made him return.

7
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,200
Let's celebrate.

8
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,680
Bottoms up.

9
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Wait a minute.

10
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Daoming Si hasn't fully recovered yet.

11
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,040
Are you guys really his friends?
I think you're a bunch of scoundrels.

12
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,000
A shot of alcohol is nothing
to the undefeatable Daoming Si.

13
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,440
We need to confirm
if he has really recovered.

14
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,600
If he finishes this shot
and he's still completely fine,

15
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,920
then we don't need to worry.

16
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,360
I'll drink this then.

17
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,120
This is

18
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,360
so bitter, spicy, and salty.

19
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,160
How can you drink this?

20
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,080
You're an idiot.

21
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,640
That's not how you do it.

22
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,680
Watch and learn.

23
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,360
Hey.

24
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
Hey.

25
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,720
Don't cause us any trouble.

26
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,440
I think you're the troublemaker.

27
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,800
If you get admitted again,
I won't take care of you anymore.

28
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,800
Hey.

29
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,920
Have you forgotten
how you should treat your boyfriend?

30
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,080
That's enough. Can you not be
so openly affectionate here?

31
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,600
All right.

32
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,160
Thank you, everyone.

33
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,120
I'll live well to repay you all.

34
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,920
Even though we've already graduated,

35
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,160
I believe our friendship wouldn't change.

36
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,720
Let's toast to our friendship.

37
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,880
To friendship.

38
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

39
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,880
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

40
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,200
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

41
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,000
Drink this. It's good.

42
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Okay. Thanks.

43
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,400
Sorry about the last time.

44
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,120
You went to the Way of Tea Museum.

45
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,400
And I was busy.

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,720
Sorry that I couldn't go there with you.

47
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,640
No. I went there without notice.
I should apologize to you.

48
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,080
Then, we're still friends.

49
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,600
Yes. It's good to be friends.

50
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,000
I suddenly realized
how cute you still are.

51
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,800
I wonder what Ximen
is talking about with Xiaoyou.

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,200
It's none of our business.

53
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,120
How come?

54
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
I don't want to meddle
in other people's business.

55
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,640
Shancai.

56
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,760
I just want to be with you.

57
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,560
Let's leave.

58
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,760
Leave?

59
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,920
This is a party
to celebrate your recovery.

60
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,400
How can you leave?

61
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,040
Since it's my party,

62
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
I can call it a day and leave
whenever I want.

63
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,560
Are we really leaving?

64
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
Where are we going?

65
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,720
Somewhere where
there will just be the two of us.

66
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,920
This is where you belong.

67
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,960
An exclusive place for my girlfriend.

68
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,200
Dong Shancai's Love Corner.

69
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,280
From now on,

70
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,600
this is where you shield yourself
from the storm.

71
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,400
No need to worry
and don't handle everything by yourself.

72
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,120
Hearing your heartbeat like this
is so nice.

73
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,880
To know that you're alive

74
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,480
is so nice.

75
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Daoming Si.

76
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
I was really,

77
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,120
really scared.

78
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,200
I'm really the biggest idiot
in the whole universe.

79
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,000
Why did I only realize how much I love you

80
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,440
when you almost died?

81
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,560
I don't want to lose you anymore.

82
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,000
You think too highly of yourself.

83
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,080
I mean

84
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,320
I'm the only one worthy of the title,
"The Biggest Idiot

85
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,400
in the Whole Universe."

86
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,440
You are only

87
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,480
-in the minor category of a stupid girl.
-Stop teasing me.

88
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,960
What's the matter?

89
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,160
Are you all right?

90
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,720
Does it hurt? Did you tear your wound?

91
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,040
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

92
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
Are you really all right?

93
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
It won't be all right
if you keep touching me.

94
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,040
Can you be more serious?

95
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Can't you stay and let me hug you
a little longer?

96
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,080
I'm not sure why,

97
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,240
but I feel like I owe you something.

98
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Really? You don't.

99
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,080
You told me before

100
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
that you've climbed more stairs
than I could imagine.

101
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,360
Actually, I knew
even if you didn't tell me.

102
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,680
You climbed

103
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,520
so many flights of stairs
in the middle of the night

104
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,440
just to find the answer for me.

105
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,320
I'm really moved.

106
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,920
I wanted to know the answer myself.
Don't feel like you owe me anything.

107
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,120
All right then.

108
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,480
To show my gratitude,

109
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,840
tell me what I can do for you.

110
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,960
The full package?

111
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,040
What?

112
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,920
Just kidding.

113
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,760
All right.

114
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,200
I joined my school's Way of Tea Club.

115
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,200
Originally, I joined
to understand you better.

116
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,960
But now, I realized
the world of tea is quite interesting.

117
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,480
So can you do me a favor?

118
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,840
It's great for you
to come and teach this class.

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,200
Everyone is excited
about the new instructor for the club.

120
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840
By the way,
the girls in our club are very friendly.

121
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,440
They'll be really happy to see you.

122
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,400
This way.

123
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,600
That's strange.

124
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,160
Where did everybody go?

125
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,840
It's all right.

126
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,040
Even if all the girls in your club
are invisible,

127
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,160
I can still teach the class.

128
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,360
Yifen, can we finish all these junk food?

129
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,200
Everyone takes these junk food
all the time.

130
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,600
Sometimes they're not even enough.

131
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,560
Girls always have room
for junk food and sweets.

132
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,440
-Hi.
-Hi.

133
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,400
We're back.

134
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,320
-Hi.
-Hi.

135
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,200
Xiaoyou.

136
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,200
Who's this handsome guy?

137
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,520
He's the instructor I told you about.
He's also my friend. His name is Ximen.

138
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,880
Is he the boyfriend you said
you were going to introduce to Yifen?

139
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,520
-What's going on?
-I'm not sure.

140
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,800
Xiaogeng.

141
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,760
It has been a while.

142
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,160
Xiaogeng?

143
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,000
Yes.

144
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
It has been a while.

145
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,640
So Yifen already knows

146
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,760
this handsome guy
who knows about the Way of Tea.

147
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,040
That's why she couldn't
fall for other guys.

148
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,000
Over 1,000 years ago, the Japanese
people loved the Tang Dynasty culture.

149
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,680
So they sent envoys to learn the culture

150
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,080
of supplying and serving tea
and bring it back to Japan.

151
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,880
<i>Turns out Yifen is Xiaogeng.</i>

152
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,600
Supplying and serving tea mean

153
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,320
providing tea leaves in pavilions
on the side of the road

154
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,760
for passersby to quench their thirst
and make friends.

155
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,520
It symbolizes
sharing good tea with strangers.

156
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,960
It can be considered a state of mind.

157
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,120
Okay. Now I'm going to demonstrate
how to make tea.

158
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,920
Who wants to be my assistant?

159
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
-Me.
-Me.

160
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,760
Let me do it. I'm sitting closest to you.

161
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,080
<i>She's considerate and funny.</i>

162
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,600
<i>And cute too.</i>

163
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,040
<i>No wonder Ximen can't forget her.</i>

164
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,320
Me. Pick me.

165
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,880
-Pick me.
-Me.

166
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,480
<i>I brought Ximen</i>

167
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,800
<i>back to Xiaogeng.</i>

168
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,240
<i>Did I already have
some sort of premonition?</i>

169
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,880
<i>Geng Yifen, take a deep breath.</i>

170
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,680
<i>Learn how to let go and turn away.</i>

171
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,680
<i>Don't think about someone
who doesn't love you.</i>

172
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
<i>After all these years,</i>

173
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,160
<i>you've already moved on.</i>

174
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,640
<i>After all these years...</i>

175
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,600
<i>Why?</i>

176
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,440
<i>Why do I still like you so much?</i>

177
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,200
The Chinese tea culture
is broad and profound.

178
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,920
Instead of understanding it,
just try and taste a cup of good tea.

179
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,160
Everyone, please enjoy.

180
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,960
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

181
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,400
What do you think? Is it good?

182
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,400
-So handsome.
-So handsome.

183
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,440
He's asking if it's good.
What do you mean "handsome"?

184
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,040
These three people.

185
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,200
-He's really handsome.
-That's right.

186
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,240
Yifen.

187
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,240
It turns out you're Xiaogeng.

188
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,040
I heard about you from Ximen.

189
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,760
He must have been laughing
at my ugly past.

190
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,320
No, actually Ximen--

191
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,800
Xiaogeng, I'm really glad to see you.

192
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,120
Yes.

193
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,560
It has been a while.

194
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,120
Do you still have class later?

195
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,160
Let's go out and talk.

196
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,720
Xiaoyou should come with us too.

197
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,320
Xiaoyou too?

198
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,400
I still have class. You two go ahead.

199
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,600
Are you really not coming?

200
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,400
Yes. I want to, but maybe next time.

201
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,560
We'll go ahead then.

202
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Okay. Bye.

203
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,040
Bye.

204
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,400
It's been a while
since we walked together on this street.

205
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,040
Now, I can walk by myself.

206
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,640
There were no street lamps before.

207
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,760
Every time we finished late at school,
you'd always go home with me.

208
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,040
And you even told me that

209
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,320
you were trying to protect me.

210
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,080
You were afraid of the dark yourself.

211
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,240
Are we talking about our ugly past now?

212
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,400
I remember someone wanted
to pick fruits from the rooftop

213
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,000
and fell from so high up...

214
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,680
But didn't even get a scratch.

215
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,280
Actually, I know.

216
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,000
The reason why I was miraculously safe

217
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,560
was because you were protecting me.

218
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,000
I really regretted

219
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,080
asking you to go to that rooftop.

220
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,080
And saying goodbye

221
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,680
to you when you didn't go.

222
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,080
I was such a coward,

223
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,720
but I was greedy.

224
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,000
I couldn't bear to hear your answer.

225
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,160
I'm the one who should apologize.

226
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,280
If I went there

227
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,160
that day,

228
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,120
things between us...

229
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,680
wouldn't have turned out like this.

230
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,080
Xiaogeng.

231
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,920
Can you give me a chance
to make up for it?

232
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,240
Let's go to that rooftop again.

233
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,000
Can we start over again?

234
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,960
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

235
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,840
Is something on your mind?

236
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,680
Yes.

237
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,080
I think I did something really bizarre.

238
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,960
I helped Ximen find his first love.

239
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,600
And I helped them reunite.

240
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,560
Does your foot hurt?

241
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,800
Didn't you just drop a rock
on your own feet?

242
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,840
I'm already miserable. Stop teasing me.

243
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
All right.

244
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,120
Don't be sad.

245
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,800
You'll surely find someone better,

246
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,320
more outstanding
and someone who's perfect in the future.

247
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,040
No.

248
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,120
Ximen is the perfect one.

249
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Mrs. Yu.

250
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,360
How is Si doing?

251
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,520
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

252
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,840
<i>Si is recovering at the hospital.</i>

253
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,200
<i>But he still needs more time.</i>

254
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
Don't worry.

255
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,080
He's recovering quickly.

256
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,720
The doctor said
he'll be in good health soon.

257
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,040
<i>This child</i>

258
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,600
<i>has always been healthy
ever since he was little.</i>

259
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,840
Okay.

260
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,680
All right then.

261
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,560
<i>Can you give me a chance
to make up for it?</i>

262
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,680
Xiaoyou, what time
will you be working today?

263
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,480
Do you have time to meet me?

264
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,680
Xiaogeng, why did you
suddenly come and see me?

265
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,760
Ximen asked me to go
to that rooftop with him today.

266
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,160
That's great.

267
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,480
Why are you telling me this?

268
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,920
Because I can tell
that you like Ximen too.

269
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,800
So I feel that I have to tell you this.

270
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,840
Is that so?

271
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,800
Xiaoyou.

272
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,640
Thank you.

273
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,760
I'll work hard to make up

274
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,960
for what Ximen and I have missed.

275
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,400
Do you still have to work later?

276
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,960
I won't disturb you then.

277
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,040
I'll get going.

278
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,840
-Okay.
-Bye.

279
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,720
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

280
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,040
Xiaoyou.

281
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
What's the matter?

282
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,200
Why did Xiaogeng come to see you?

283
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,840
Shancai.

284
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,360
Remember that time we went shopping

285
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,680
and the saleslady told me

286
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,160
my eyebrows look sad

287
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,040
and I should draw a different shape?

288
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,560
What are you talking about?

289
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,240
My eyebrows do make me look sad.

290
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,960
This eyebrow shape is not good.

291
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,200
Even though I'm happy,

292
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,880
I still look sad.

293
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,120
Your eyebrows don't look sad.

294
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,600
What happened?

295
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,560
Xiaogeng told me

296
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,800
that she'll go with Ximen
to that building tomorrow.

297
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,600
Ximen has always been the man of my dream.

298
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,880
A dream I don't want to wake up from.

299
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,120
So Shancai,

300
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,000
if I look really sad,

301
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,840
it must be because of my sad eyebrows.

302
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,360
Please don't worry about me.

303
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,160
It's fine.

304
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,760
Hey.

305
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,360
-You scared me.
-What is it?

306
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,360
You told me to come here so urgently.

307
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,480
Do you want to see my singing talent?

308
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,520
It's Xiaoyou.

309
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,320
She's already inside.

310
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,160
This is about Ximen again?

311
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,560
When will she ever learn?

312
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,640
Let's go.

313
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,320
So, you're joining us for real?

314
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,080
You're so worried about her.

315
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,920
That means she's not doing very well.

316
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,200
So I should support you and stay with her.

317
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,960
What are you doing?

318
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,960
Daoming Si.

319
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,920
You're so reliable
when I need you the most.

320
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,960
Nonsense.

321
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,400
I'm the successor of a business empire.

322
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,600
Being reliable is a basic requirement.

323
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,520
You're such a good guy.

324
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,680
You're better than a best female friend.

325
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,680
And you just realized that now?

326
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,880
Wait a minute.

327
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,720
You called me your best female friend?

328
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,960
Shancai, why did you call me
your best female friend?

329
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,840
Hey.

330
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,400
Are you sure she's broken-hearted?

331
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,280
I'm not really sure now.

332
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,680
Are you really not singing?

333
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,280
Is it okay to keep the mic to myself?

334
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,840
It's fine. Just sing your heart out.

335
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,040
Xiaoyou.

336
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,360
You already sang that song
so many times in one hour.

337
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,640
Aren't you tired?

338
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
I'm not.

339
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,560
I'm very excited.

340
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,120
Can you help me choose more songs?

341
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,520
I'm glad you guys came with me today.

342
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,840
I don't think I can sleep at home.

343
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,520
Xiaoyou.

344
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,200
Just let her get it all out.

345
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Then she can sleep when she's tired.

346
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,720
She'll get over it soon.

347
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,120
Go and choose some songs for her.

348
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,400
Okay.

349
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,280
<i>I think Xiaoyou will be fine.</i>

350
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,720
<i>The night will be over soon.</i>

351
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,520
<i>A new day will come.</i>

352
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,680
Good morning.

353
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
Why are you so early?

354
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,520
You're early too.

355
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,240
You couldn't sleep
so you came here this early?

356
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,920
You're talking about yourself.

357
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,360
Busted.

358
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,800
Let's go.

359
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,120
I'm running out of energy.

360
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,240
Well, that went on for quite a while.

361
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,280
I wish I had that energy too.

362
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,760
Tell me. Do you think they've already met?

363
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,440
Do you regret it?

364
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,720
No, I don't.

365
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,600
My heart is just aching.

366
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,440
I'm not sure when the pain would stop.

367
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,440
Stop thinking about things
you're not sure about.

368
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,320
Hey, you don't have to say anything.

369
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,800
That's how I did it.

370
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,240
No one knows what'll happen in the future
no matter how much we think about t.

371
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,680
Just treasure each moment.

372
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,280
Your heart is aching.

373
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,200
That means you're still alive.

374
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,240
What's the matter?

375
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,040
Nothing.

376
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,720
I'm just a little tired.

377
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,200
Probably because
I didn't sleep well last night.

378
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,040
You've always been weak
since you were little.

379
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,160
Yes.

380
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,160
When you were little,

381
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,560
you kept playing nonstop.

382
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,160
You know your body couldn't take it.

383
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
But you still kept going.

384
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,360
You slept when you were tired.

385
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,400
You ate when you woke up.

386
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,800
Then your stomach hurt when you were full.

387
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,800
Why do you make me

388
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,040
sound like an animal?

389
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,200
In my loneliest, saddest time,

390
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,480
your innocence saved me.

391
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,560
Thank you.

392
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,640
Ximen.

393
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,320
Do you know I've always loved you?

394
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,040
Yes.

395
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,600
You knew?

396
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,920
You're so easy to read.

397
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,600
And you're so difficult
for me to figure out.

398
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,240
Ximen.

399
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,960
Have you realized

400
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,600
after we met again

401
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,320
that we've always...

402
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,560
Always what?

403
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,000
Nothing.

404
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,520
It's almost time. Let's go.

405
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,320
Okay.

406
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,680
The sun is so bright.

407
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
It's 8:00 a.m. It should be bright.

408
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,400
Shancai, Daoming Si, thank you.

409
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,880
It's good that it's the weekend.
We can catch up on some sleep.

410
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,840
Xiaoyou, will you be able to sleep?

411
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,000
Yes.

412
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,280
Hello? Xiaogeng?

413
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,320
<i>Can you come to the rooftop?</i>

414
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,320
What? Now?

415
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,200
Okay.

416
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,120
It's so strange.

417
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,800
Isn't Xiaogeng supposed to be with Ximen?

418
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,440
Why did she ask me to come?

419
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,080
Are you going to see Ximen?

420
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,760
Do you want me to drive you?

421
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,960
I...

422
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,560
But...

423
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,640
But what?

424
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,200
You'll find out if it's good or bad
once you get there.

425
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,520
It's nearby. I'll go there myself.

426
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,600
Shancai, Daoming Si, thank you.

427
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,760
<i>Xiaoyou.</i>

428
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,200
<i>You can do it.</i>

429
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,800
Ximen.

430
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,080
You're here.

431
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,160
Why is the sign gone?

432
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,280
Where's Xiaogeng?

433
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,160
She left.

434
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,240
Did she leave because the sign is gone?

435
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,600
But that sign no longer matters.

436
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,480
-What's important is that you're here.
-Xiaoyou.

437
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,240
It's over between me and Xiaogeng.

438
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,720
Over?

439
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,640
What does that mean?

440
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,160
We still missed it.

441
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,080
Ximen.

442
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,120
Don't you think that this is a sign

443
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,960
that nothing

444
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,440
would remain?

445
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Did you realize it?

446
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,320
After we met again,

447
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,080
everything we talked about

448
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,360
was our past.

449
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,760
And it can only stay in the past.

450
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,080
We think of the past

451
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,400
because we can't go back to it anymore.

452
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,840
Is that what you're trying to say?

453
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,560
I'm sorry.

454
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,000
Five years ago,

455
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,720
that day you asked me to come here

456
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,360
was our "Once in a Lifetime" moment.

457
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,920
I missed it.

458
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,840
It's fine.

459
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,160
Some things

460
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,720
are only meaningful if they happen

461
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
right there and then.

462
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
If you missed it,

463
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,120
just move on.

464
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,480
Actually, I can tell

465
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,720
that your "Once in a Lifetime" moment

466
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,000
doesn't belong to me anymore.

467
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,760
It belongs to another girl.

468
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,600
Girls' intuition can be very accurate.

469
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,920
Xiaogeng.

470
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,240
I owe you a confession nevertheless.

471
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,680
The old me

472
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,920
really liked you.

473
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,240
Back then, you were

474
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,880
more important to me than anything else.

475
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,600
Ximen.

476
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,800
Me too.

477
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,080
I used to really like you so much.

478
