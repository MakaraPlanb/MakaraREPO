A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 31

3
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,360
Lei.

4
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,200
Why did you bring me here?

5
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,520
After experiencing so many things,

6
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,480
I think you haven't let out the feelings

7
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,560
that you have bottled up inside.

8
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,040
Don't underestimate me.

9
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,280
I'm Shancai, the weed in the garden.

10
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,560
Shancai.

11
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,080
You have to learn to express your emotions

12
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,200
in order to face reality
and make the right decisions.

13
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,320
So that you'll see things clearly.

14
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,200
I wasn't being emotional.

15
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,680
I was just--

16
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,200
When you're with me,
you don't need to hide your emotions.

17
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,840
I didn't--

18
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,320
Release your emotions.

19
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,080
Release all your sadness,
grievance, and pain.

20
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,840
Do you feel better?

21
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,080
Thank you.

22
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,040
Relax.

23
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,240
You can rest.

24
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,960
You should rest.

25
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,640
I'll always be by your side.

26
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,600
Just be yourself.

27
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,560
Lei, you've always avoided
getting involved before.

28
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,040
Why is it different this time?

29
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,080
Lei, do you know what you're doing?

30
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,080
I really don't understand you anymore.

31
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,200
Meizuo, it's not that
you don't understand me.

32
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,120
The circumstances are different this time.

33
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,480
Do you think Daoming Si and Shancai
can be together again?

34
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,800
We're not sure.

35
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,600
But since you got involved,
this matter has gotten worse.

36
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,160
There's no more room for negotiation.

37
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,160
Maybe.

38
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,360
What does Si think?

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,200
You're even smiling.

40
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,200
Do you know Si got so drunk last night?

41
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,400
He said he was celebrating
for you and Shancai.

42
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,200
What celebration?

43
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,160
Ximen and I knew
that he just wanted to escape the pain.

44
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,240
You know we're not siding with Si.

45
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,400
But do you really need to do this?

46
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,440
Must Shancai be Jing's replacement?

47
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,280
Don't say things like that.

48
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,880
Shancai is not Jing's replacement.

49
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,920
They're different individuals.

50
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,680
No person can replace another.

51
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,640
You even asked for a fair competition.

52
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,520
You're just adding insult to injury!

53
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,680
Ximen.

54
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,040
Lei is not like that.
Don't say those things to him.

55
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,400
Lei, explain yourself.

56
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,200
Instead of arguing with me,

57
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,800
you should remind Si

58
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,240
not to escape reality
and be honest with himself.

59
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,800
I'm so tired.

60
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,200
Only a few of these youngsters
are good at doing their job.

61
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,160
Why are they not like Shancai?

62
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,280
Speaking of which,

63
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,600
how long has she been back
from the fishing village?

64
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,920
Has she forgotten about me?

65
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,720
Shancai.

66
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,360
Mrs. Yu?

67
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,080
Why did you call me?

68
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,080
<i>You even dare to ask me why I'm calling.</i>

69
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,080
How long have you been back?

70
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,560
<i>You didn't even tell me.</i>

71
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,880
<i>You didn't come to see me.</i>

72
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,920
<i>Have you forgotten about me?</i>

73
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,760
Mrs. Yu, I didn't do it on purpose.

74
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,800
I was busy moving into my new place.

75
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,720
And catching up with school.

76
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,320
-I'm--
<i>-Why are you still babbling?</i>

77
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,960
<i>Seven o'clock tonight</i>

78
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,640
<i>at Suzhehui Restaurant.</i>

79
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,400
<i>-See you there.
</i>-Hey.

80
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,600
Hello?

81
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,400
Mrs. Yu is so energetic.

82
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,280
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

83
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,720
Shancai.

84
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,640
Tell me the truth.

85
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,040
To you youngsters,

86
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,320
am I old and useless?

87
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,720
Is that why you didn't bother
to come see me after coming back

88
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,600
from the fishing village?

89
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,360
Mrs. Yu, why would you think that?

90
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,320
I missed you.

91
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,240
Why wouldn't I want to see you?

92
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,960
I was just afraid I'd cause you trouble.

93
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,680
You won't cause me any trouble.

94
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,840
But can you tell

95
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,920
that I wanted to trouble you
with something?

96
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,120
All right.

97
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Tell me, Mrs. Yu.

98
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,320
If you need my help,
I'll be there anytime.

99
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,760
All right.

100
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,320
But what can I help you with?

101
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,840
You can help me with a lot of things.

102
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,440
Among them,

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,280
you should always visit me

104
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,400
and see if I'm still alive.

105
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,520
Mrs. Yu, don't say that.

106
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,640
They say that good people don't live long.

107
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,320
You'd probably live to be a hundred.

108
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,920
You're mocking me.

109
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,760
That means you still have a strong
fighting spirit.

110
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,600
Here.

111
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,960
Eat some vegetables.

112
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,400
I ordered all this.

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,280
-Finish it or you're not going home.
-Okay.

114
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,600
Eat some more.

115
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,200
How's your new home?

116
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,480
It's quite nice.

117
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,200
It's a good thing Huaze Lei helped me.

118
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,320
And my friends decorated the place for me.

119
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,120
How is everything with you and Si?

120
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,400
Daoming Si and I

121
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,440
have broken up.

122
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,680
You broke up?

123
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,200
Yes.

124
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,760
He and I

125
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,720
have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

126
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,040
What?

127
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
So,

128
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,080
you've given up?

129
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,320
Mrs. Yu.

130
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,840
I can't win over Daoming Si's mom.

131
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,960
I'm powerless

132
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,880
when it comes to her.

133
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,240
A person like me
wouldn't make Daoming Si happy.

134
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,000
Actually,

135
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,280
logically,

136
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,560
I should stay as far away as possible.

137
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,280
You're good for nothing.

138
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,040
You're so irresponsible.

139
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,160
I'm sorry, Mrs. Yu.

140
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,120
I really did my best.

141
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,040
"Might as well not start a journey

142
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,080
if you're going to stop in the middle."

143
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,520
Do you think I'd say that?

144
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,320
It's never easy to survive

145
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,880
in this world.

146
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,560
You'll encounter a lot of hardships.

147
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,800
There's no guaranteed outcome.

148
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,320
Shancai.

149
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,560
You chose to give up,

150
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,080
to extinguish your passionate feelings

151
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,040
by throwing them to the wind.

152
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,720
You chose others' happiness

153
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,680
over yours.

154
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,520
I know

155
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,120
these things

156
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,680
are even harder to do.

157
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,320
At your age,

158
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,600
you can completely ignore

159
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,640
your friends' problems.

160
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,480
But you didn't.

161
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
You're a good kid.

162
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,040
I know better than others

163
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,680
that sometimes,

164
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,400
reality is very cruel.

165
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,600
And hard to overcome.

166
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,960
However,

167
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,880
you have to make a decision.

168
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
You already did your best.

169
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,520
If you want to stop now,

170
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,040
then stop and rest.

171
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,040
It's not your fault.

172
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,560
Don't feel hopeless.

173
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,800
Don't blame yourself.

174
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,600
Stop crying.

175
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Remember.

176
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,520
You didn't do anything wrong.

177
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,040
I should make a decision.

178
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,520
What I can do right now

179
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,600
is to eat a good meal.

180
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,480
I can only start fresh on a full stomach.

181
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,840
That's a must.

182
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,120
-Eat.
-Okay.

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,920
Eat more.

184
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Here.

185
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,280
Mrs. Yu.

186
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,160
Take care.

187
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,400
Let me know when you get home.

188
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,840
How fussy.

189
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,040
Are you the housekeeper or am I?

190
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,720
Little Miss Housekeeper.

191
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,240
I'm so happy to see you today.

192
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,080
We have to do this again next time.

193
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,880
Of course.

194
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,960
What's the matter?

195
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,520
Nothing.

196
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Mrs. Yu.

197
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,240
Mrs. Yu!

198
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,600
Mrs. Yu!

199
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,080
Look behind you, ma'am.

200
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,240
Mrs. Yu!

201
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,560
-Mrs. Yu.
-What is it?

202
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,760
I...

203
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,720
I want to tell you how I really feel.

204
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,760
I hope at least one person

205
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
can know how I really feel.

206
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
Mrs. Yu.

207
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,240
Actually, I...

208
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,680
I really like Daoming Si.

209
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,240
I know I won't be able to forget

210
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
everything he did for me.

211
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,160
But I can't be selfish
and hurt everyone around me

212
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
because of my love for him.

213
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,360
So I...

214
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,240
I can't keep going back and forth
with him anymore.

215
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,720
I had to end it.

216
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,480
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

217
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
<i>I wonder what you're doing now.</i>

218
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,360
<i>I miss you.</i>

219
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,640
<i>I really miss you.</i>

220
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,240
<i>But our worlds are completely different.</i>

221
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,080
<i>Maybe our time together
has come to an end.</i>

222
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,560
<i>Let's go back to being friends.</i>

223
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,200
<i>And treat each other casually.</i>

224
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,720
Si's here.

225
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,920
I thought you're not coming today.

226
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,920
It's not good to cut class.

227
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,920
Cut the crap.

228
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,400
Why should I cut classes?

229
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,320
What time is it now?

230
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,760
-Why are you late?
-Who knows?

231
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,160
I think so too.

232
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
Good morning, everyone.

233
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,880
-Morning.
-Morning, guys.

234
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,680
Morning, Shancai.

235
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,560
Shancai.

236
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,120
Are you all right?

237
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,000
Why are you asking that?
Of course I'm all right.

238
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,840
I'm going to class.

239
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
The professor is really strict.

240
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,520
We're doomed if we're late.

241
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,640
I'll go now.

242
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,840
Shancai.

243
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
Our classroom is here.

244
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
Yes. Where are you going?

245
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,280
Don't you think Shancai
is really strange today?

246
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,520
She's not just strange,

247
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,560
but it seems like she's possessed.

248
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,520
She's forcing her smile,

249
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,480
pretending like nothing happened,

250
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,320
and acting so unlike her.

251
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,280
Si, what's going on with you two?

252
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,560
If she showed me any affection at all,

253
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,080
I'd be willing to do anything for her.

254
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,200
Elope.

255
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,440
Or even fight with my mom.

256
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,920
But that never happened.

257
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,000
So...

258
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,800
I'll leave it as that.

259
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,600
Is it really over between them?

260
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,080
Who knows what kind of tricks
they are playing now?

261
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,960
Hey, Daoming Si's ex-fiancée.

262
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,640
Can you stop following me?

263
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,560
I want you to take me to Shancai.

264
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,160
You can just call her.

265
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,040
That won't be any fun.

266
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,680
I want to catch her off guard
and surprise her.

267
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,240
By the way, I got her a small gift.
She'll surely like it.

268
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,520
What is it?

269
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,840
What is it...

270
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,200
Take it out and see.

271
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,640
Wait.

272
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,000
Like Daoming Si, would you
place a toy inside to prank me?

273
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,040
Of course I won't.

274
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,720
What's that?

275
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,800
A cactus.

276
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,200
You lied.

277
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,360
You didn't let me finish.

278
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,040
I mean of course I won't miss

279
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,360
-the chance to prank you.
-You...

280
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,000
Xiaozi.

281
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,880
Meizuo, Ximen.

282
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,600
Have you seen Shancai?

283
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,640
I'm not sure where she is.

284
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,720
She's always with Huaze Lei lately.

285
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,960
Does that mean

286
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,560
Si and Shancai are really over?

287
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,600
What do you mean?

288
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
Are they still avoiding each other?

289
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,560
No, not anymore.

290
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,360
Si said he doesn't want
anything to do with Shancai.

291
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,000
And Lei said he'll pursue Shancai.

292
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,440
Wait.

293
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,320
That means they didn't make up
after Shancai came back.

294
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,080
Instead, she became closer to Lei?

295
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,640
I think so.

296
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,320
Then Si...

297
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,960
Is Si broken-hearted?

298
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,600
He deserves it.

299
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,920
Where are you going?

300
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,200
Let's rest a bit.

301
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,160
Your legs are so long.

302
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,280
Your stride is so wide.
I can't catch up with you.

303
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,880
I'm not saying my legs are short.

304
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,880
My shoes today...

305
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,240
Why did you suddenly stop?

306
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,080
Go home. Stop following me.

307
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,080
I'll call you a cab.

308
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,360
-Then I'll leave.
-No.

309
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,920
When will you stop walking around?

310
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
Si.

311
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,160
If you're unhappy, just say it.

312
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,400
Why are you pretending?

313
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,920
Hey.

314
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,240
Daoming Si.

315
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,440
Daoming Si!

316
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,320
Why are you so annoying?

317
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,520
Si.

318
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,200
Since when did you become so gentle?

319
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,440
I remember the first time that I met you,

320
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,000
you really left me alone, barefooted.

321
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,920
You're different this time.

322
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,320
It must be because of Shancai.

323
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,160
People say that a good woman
can change a man.

324
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,800
I think it's true.

325
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,200
Between me and Lei, who would you choose?

326
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,480
You and Lei?

327
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,160
Based on gentleness, you lose.

328
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,560
-Never mind. Go home.
-No.

329
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,120
I was kidding.

330
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,600
If Shancai didn't choose you,

331
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,680
she must have her own reasons.

332
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,320
Reasons?

333
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,920
What an excuse.

334
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,400
I've had enough of the same excuse!

335
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,920
Whatever it is,

336
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,720
regardless if it's wrong or right,

337
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,000
is it always forgivable
because she has her own reasons?

338
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
Why are girls like that?

339
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,400
It's just an excuse
for not being firm enough!

340
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,440
Si...

341
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,280
I'm not sure what I'm saying.

342
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,600
I can't think straight now.

343
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Go home.

344
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,200
I said go home!

345
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,240
You still have me!

346
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,440
I was kidding!

347
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,520
See? You got scared, right?

348
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,680
Were you scared?

349
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,400
Did you get scared? Did you?

350
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,080
Seeing your serious face,
I just wanted to tease you.

351
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,640
It's so much fun, you know?

352
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
-Xiaozi.
-All right.

353
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,520
I'm leaving.

354
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,520
You should also go home early.

355
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,600
Daoming Si.

356
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,000
That brow of yours.

357
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,000
Don't keep it wrinkled like that, okay?

358
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,520
When you do that,
you look like an old man.

359
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,200
Okay?

360
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,200
<i>Shancai.</i>

361
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,440
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

362
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,640
<i>I'm such a bad friend.</i>

363
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,840
<i>But...</i>

364
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,600
<i>I really can't bear</i>

365
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,400
<i>seeing Si in so much pain.</i>

366
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,240
SHANGHAI MINGDE UNIVERSITY
19TH GRADUATION CEREMONY

367
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,360
You played really well today.

368
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,000
-Yes.
-It was superb.

369
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
What can I do for you?

370
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Huaze Lei, happy graduation.

371
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,160
You're not here to congratulate me.

372
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,480
Do you really like Shancai?

373
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,280
Tell me. What do you want?

374
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,960
If you really like Shancai,

375
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,560
I hope you can let Si give up.

376
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,720
I'm not responsible for that.

377
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,000
If Si really gives up,
a part of F4 would die too.

378
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,080
Then you're just going to let him suffer?

379
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,240
I know Si said he already gave up
on Shancai.

380
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,360
But he didn't.

381
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,360
And I think it's better
if we don't make it worse.

382
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,920
I can't keep on seeing him like this.

383
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,680
You'll help me, right?

384
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Sorry, I can't.

385
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,960
Hey, wait.

386
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,480
I admit...

387
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,800
I have my own motives.

388
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,880
If you and Shancai are together,

389
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,560
maybe

390
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,040
Si would accept me too.

391
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,760
I know I'm a very bad and selfish friend.

392
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,040
But they want to give up
on each other already.

393
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,720
I'm just fighting for my feelings.

394
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,600
Maybe we'd both be happy

395
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
after this.

396
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,000
Huaze Lei.

397
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,520
I'm begging you.

398
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,000
Can't you help me?

399
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,560
All right.

400
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
What do you want me to do?

401
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,320
Let's take a picture here.

402
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,120
This is for you.
Take care after graduation.

403
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,320
If you go to Sanya, go to our banana farm.

404
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,080
Our bananas are golden yellow,
soft, and sweet.

405
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,560
I sent a box to Professor Ma once.

406
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,880
He said nothing but compliments.

407
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,880
When I think about not seeing
F4 anymore next year,

408
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,080
the campus seems less attractive.

409
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,240
That's right.

410
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,160
My motivation to come to school decreased.

411
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,320
-There.
-Let's take a picture.

412
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,760
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

413
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,760
-Say cheese.
-Say cheese.

414
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,760
-Happy graduation.
-Let's take a picture later.

415
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,800
-Happy graduation.
-Come here.

416
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
Over here.

417
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,120
-Let's take a picture?
-Okay.

418
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,880
Come on.

419
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,920
You woke up late.

420
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,480
You're teasing me.

421
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,600
Hello, Xiaozi?

422
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,280
Now?

423
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,200
At the Math building courtyard?

424
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,840
You're at my school?

425
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,480
Hey.

426
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,320
-Come here.
-Okay.

427
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,240
One more.

428
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,520
Didn't Xiaozi ask me to come here?

429
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,480
Why don't I see her?

430
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,280
-What's that sound?
-It's the violin.

431
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,200
It sounds so nice.

432
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,520
He's so handsome.

433
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,400
What's Huaze Lei doing?

434
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,160
-He's so good.
-What's he doing?

435
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,800
-Who is he playing for?
-I'm not sure.

436
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,040
Why is Lei playing here?

437
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,360
He said he'll just play
at the ceremony, right?

438
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,200
Isn't that Shancai?

439
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,480
Is Lei playing the violin for Shancai?

440
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,400
<i>It's been a while since I saw
Lei play the violin.</i>

441
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,600
<i>The last time I saw him play,</i>

442
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,360
<i>he's still the same person
who always said,</i>

443
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,600
<i>"I really have no interest
in other people's business."</i>

444
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,160
<i>Without realizing it,
a lot of time has passed.</i>

445
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,320
<i>F4's graduating already.</i>

446
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,520
<i>A lot has happened in the past year.</i>

447
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,160
That will be the last song
I play for you in Mingde University.

448
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,760
Shancai, I dedicated it to you.

449
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,680
What are you doing?

450
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,040
No way.

451
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,480
Huaze Lei and Shancai?

452
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,480
What's going on with them?

453
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,760
Huaze Lei is playing the violin
for Shancai?

454
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,680
Wow.

455
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,800
I really envy Dong Shancai.

456
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,160
-Don't--
-Don't push me away yet.

457
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,400
Before I go, please give me some time.

458
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
Lei.

459
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,160
I'll be happy...

460
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,880
if you're happy.

461
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,720
Si?

462
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,240
Hello?

463
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,320
You want to see me?

464
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,640
Sure.

465
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,480
I'll wait for you at the coffee shop
near your school.

466
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,320
Okay.

467
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,760
Xiaozi?

468
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,200
Shancai.

469
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,400
Sorry.

470
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,520
What happened today
was planned by Huaze Lei and myself.

471
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,600
You know already, right?

472
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,240
Yes.

473
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,320
So what exactly is going on?

474
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,280
Isn't it obvious?

475
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,040
A low-key person like Huaze Lei
played the violin for you

476
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,400
in front of everyone
and he even hugged you.

477
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,200
He's making a love confession.

478
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,960
A love confession?

479
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,360
Aren't you going to accept him?

480
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,840
You really liked him before.

481
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,320
I'm not sure.

482
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,400
Before,

483
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,720
I'd feel nervous for no reason
when I'm with him.

484
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,080
I'm not sure when it started,
but seeing him now

485
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,280
makes me feel very safe and secure.

486
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,200
He's being so nice to you.

487
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,720
Aren't you the least bit affected?

488
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,000
Right now,

489
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,160
there is no other place in my heart
to love anyone.

490
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,160
Is it because of Si?

491
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,920
Shancai, if...

492
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,760
I mean,

493
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,600
if there's someone

494
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,200
who can comfort Si's pain,

495
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,120
would...

496
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,320
Would you mind?

497
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,720
If there's such a person,

498
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,600
I'd be really happy.

499
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,480
I hope

500
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,600
that his suffering will end with me.

501
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,120
Do you really mean it?

502
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,920
It can be anyone?

503
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,160
Yes.

504
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,400
It can be anyone.

505
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,000
When Si's with me,

506
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,400
he suffers as much as me.

507
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,760
So if there is someone
who can make him happy,

508
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,080
I'd be happy for him too.

509
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,400
Xiaozi, are you waiting for someone?

510
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,720
I...

511
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,120
Yes.

512
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,080
-Why is this so hot?
-Are you hurt?

513
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,720
Shancai, isn't it time
for you to go to work?

514
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,760
Don't be late.

515
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,960
Yes, I have to go to work.

516
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,080
I'll go now.

517
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,520
Shancai.

518
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,200
I really like being your friend.

519
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,360
Me too.

520
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,200
<i>Today, Xiaozi looked really nervous.</i>

521
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,880
<i>She seemed like
she wanted to say something.</i>

522
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
<i>And she was speaking hesitantly.</i>

523
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,400
<i>And why would she be helping Lei?</i>

524
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,520
Sorry I asked you to come so suddenly.

525
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,320
It's fine. I'm free anyway.

526
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,000
<i>Turns out Xiaozi was waiting
for Daoming Si.</i>

527
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Sir, what are you having?

528
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,480
-I'll order later.
-Sure.

529
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,320
Xiaozi.

530
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,440
Find a nice guy.

531
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,920
It's not possible for us.

532
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,840
For the longest time,

533
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,520
Shancai is all I can think of.

534
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,680
You finally said it.

535
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,200
I thought you'd say something else.

536
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,920
I'm so relieved, you know?

537
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,600
I thought you're here

538
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,960
because you wanted to forget Shancai
and be with me again.

539
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,160
I'm so relieved that you said that.

540
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,640
How can I go through that again?

541
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,880
That's right.

542
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,680
I wasn't wrong about you.

543
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,120
I'll always treat you as a good friend.

544
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,880
You consider me as a friend
but you consider Shancai as a woman?

545
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,400
Daoming Si.

546
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,480
In our next life,

547
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,000
consider me as a woman too.

548
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,680
Stupid girl.

549
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,240
<i>He's smiling.</i>

550
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,360
<i>I haven't seen his smile for a long time.</i>

551
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,160
<i>I'm not sure why I'm happy for him.</i>

552
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,400
<i>If he's with Xiaozi,</i>

553
