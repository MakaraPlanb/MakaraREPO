EPISODE 33

3
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,320
Give up on Shancai, understand?

4
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,320
-Oh, all right.
-What do you mean, "Oh, all right"?

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,240
What exactly...

6
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,440
-What did you say again?
-I said all right.

7
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,840
I'll give up on Shancai.

8
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,840
Why?

9
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,320
-So I can pursue Shancai?
-No.

10
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,200
Do you want to die?

11
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,720
You jerk.

12
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,520
I was already feeling down
but you provoked me.

13
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,040
You planned all this to make me
admit my feelings.

14
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,280
You think I don't know that?

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,160
I wasn't trying to fool you.

16
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,120
You even dare say that.
That's what infuriates me the most.

17
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
But that's the most interesting part.

18
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,200
Think about it.

19
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,720
You knew I did it on purpose
but you still got mad.

20
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,400
-That proves...
-Shut up.

21
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,200
...that your temper is really bad.

22
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,680
Isn't that obvious?

23
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
You're so annoying.

24
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,280
You're still laughing?

25
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
But Si.

26
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,240
When have you started not doing
what you're thinking?

27
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,400
Even though we grew up together
and knew each other well,

28
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,120
this time,

29
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,520
I was really worried that you were scared.

30
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,200
You don't need to worry about me.

31
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,520
Shancai's the one you should worry about.

32
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,200
It's impossible for you not to know
what I'm thinking.

33
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,960
So what?

34
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,280
You're not saying it
so Shancai won't know either.

35
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,400
I won't pass along the message anymore.

36
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,120
Change your favorite slogan.

37
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,440
You're no longer the Lei who's not
interested in other people's business.

38
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,720
Shancai is not a stranger.

39
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,080
And neither are you.

40
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,120
You're both important to me.

41
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,120
I appreciate your gesture.

42
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,680
But I have to remind you again.

43
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
This is all just part of your plan.

44
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,480
I know, you green-eyed monster.

45
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,640
Do you have a problem with that?

46
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,440
What you're worried about won't happen.

47
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,640
I'll leave Shancai to you.

48
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,200
Take good care of her.

49
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,640
Of course.

50
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,440
But I'm telling you.

51
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,040
You're still my friend.

52
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,480
But don't play me anymore.

53
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,920
The weather's so nice today.

54
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,280
It's time for me to go.

55
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,440
Lei, your parting gift is too much.

56
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,480
Yes. You fooled me so badly.

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,640
I never knew that pursuing Shancai
would have such an impact on you.

58
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,520
Why would it?

59
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,600
But it's strange.

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,120
You and Si had such a big fight.

61
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,240
I thought we couldn't be friends anymore.

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,520
In the end, Ximen and I
were the ones who were fooled.

63
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,560
It's over now.
Why are you still talking about it?

64
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,840
I think it was quite fun.

65
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,720
You're such a weirdo.

66
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,360
Is your family situation really bad?

67
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,600
It's all right.

68
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,080
I should go see my family anyway.

69
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,240
-When are you leaving?
-My flight is in the afternoon.

70
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,800
Be in touch.

71
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,600
I'm already starting to miss you.

72
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,800
If all goes well, I'll be back soon.
You don't have to come to the airport.

73
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,880
Does Shancai know?

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,760
<i>Shancai, there are some things
that I couldn't tell you in person.</i>

75
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,520
<i>So I sent you this voice message.</i>

76
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,520
<i>You already know right?</i>

77
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,200
<i>I only wanted to make Si
face his own feelings.</i>

78
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,920
<i>That's why I decided to pursue you again.</i>

79
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,560
<i>Because I can't think of any other way
to help you and Si.</i>

80
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,360
<i>Sorry if it caused you any trouble.</i>

81
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,600
<i>Even though it was just part of my plan,
but my concern for you is real.</i>

82
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,760
<i>You know that, right?</i>

83
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,760
<i>I'm going back to Taiwan today.</i>

84
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,760
<i>I won't be back here anytime soon.</i>

85
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,920
Huaze Lei!

86
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,560
Goodbye!

87
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,280
<i>When you feel like crying, do a handstand.</i>

88
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,680
<i>That way, your tears won't fall down.</i>

89
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,520
<i>I'm really grateful...</i>

90
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,680
<i>to you.</i>

91
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,760
<i>You really are a nice guy.</i>

92
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,160
<i>I did those things because I wanted to.</i>

93
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,200
<i>Do you regret it?</i>

94
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,000
<i>I do.</i>

95
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,120
<i>I regret giving up on her so easily.</i>

96
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,200
<i>I regret not holding on
a little longer that time.</i>

97
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,200
<i>Shancai, do you get it?</i>

98
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,840
<i>Hold on a little longer.</i>

99
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,520
<i>If you do, a lot of things
might end up differently.</i>

100
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,400
<i>But if you miss that opportunity,</i>

101
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,480
<i>you'll regret it your whole life.</i>

102
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
QQ VOICE MESSAGE FROM HUAZE LEI

103
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,480
<i>Shancai.</i>

104
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,960
<i>Knowing you was the most interesting thing
that has ever happened to me so far.</i>

105
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,320
<i>All this time,</i>

106
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,680
<i>everything we've experienced
was so beautiful.</i>

107
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,520
<i>I won't ever forget it.</i>

108
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,720
<i>See you again.</i>

109
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,440
<i>Shancai, goodbye.</i>

110
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,360
<i>Lei.</i>

111
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,200
<i>Thank you for everything you did for me.</i>

112
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,480
<i>Thank you.</i>

113
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,960
It's so hard to face my own feelings.

114
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,760
<i>I see.</i>

115
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Then I'll go ahead.

116
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,400
I told him I'm not leaving anymore.

117
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,880
He knows what I meant, right?

118
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,240
Then why did you get off the bus?

119
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,360
Did I misunderstand that?

120
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,280
Why did you get off the bus?

121
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,320
No.

122
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,520
He doesn't get it.

123
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,640
He's not the type who'd care
about people's feelings.

124
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,800
I really need to clearly tell him.

125
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,400
Women are so annoying.

126
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,920
What are you babbling about?

127
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,600
So how are things?

128
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,320
Did you get to see Shancai yesterday?

129
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,120
Yesterday...

130
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,480
Yesterday...

131
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,920
What is he trying to say?

132
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,960
I think he's saying,
"Something good happened.

133
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,840
He's unhappy."

134
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,240
And,

135
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,640
"He doesn't understand."

136
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,760
It seems Si has acquired
more depth of expression

137
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,480
after going to graduate school.

138
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
What do you care?

139
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,240
And are you and Shancai

140
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,640
together or not?

141
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,480
Why do you care?

142
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,680
Hey, Si.

143
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,360
Didn't you ask me to come here
to think of a plan?

144
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,360
Haven't you settled it with Shancai yet?

145
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,400
There are some things
that you don't understand.

146
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,920
Then ask me.

147
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,520
Leave your girl problems
to the love expert.

148
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Mr. Love Expert,

149
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,000
let's hear what you have to say.

150
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,080
Women.

151
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,080
If you think of them
as a musical instrument,

152
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,960
she's a violin.

153
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,880
You have to accurately control
your strength, position, and tone

154
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,200
in order to play the best music.

155
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,120
So what do you think?

156
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,960
Master Ximen.

157
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,960
Even I didn't quite understand it,
let alone Si.

158
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,920
Right?

159
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,520
Where's Si?

160
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,640
What are you doing?

161
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,200
Why are you here?

162
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,520
Well...

163
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,480
I have something to tell you.

164
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,200
What is it?

165
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,960
It's not convenient here.
Let's go to the rooftop.

166
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,760
<i>I can easily do other things.</i>

167
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,120
<i>But why is love so hard?</i>

168
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,960
What do you want to say to me?

169
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,080
Tell me.

170
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,240
I'm starving.

171
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,480
<i>I should tell him openly.
I have to tell him how I really feel.</i>

172
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,920
<i>I want to officially
be together with Daoming Si.</i>

173
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,400
Well...

174
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,320
It's...

175
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
I...

176
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,880
<i>Goodness. I must tell him
that I really like him.</i>

177
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,800
<i>Or else we can't officially be together.</i>

178
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,520
What is it? Say what you want to say.

179
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,160
You're so fierce.

180
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,480
Never mind.

181
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,160
What do you mean? Are you playing with me?

182
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,320
I'm not.

183
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,280
Your voice is too loud.

184
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,520
Your attitude is so bad.

185
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,240
So I couldn't tell you any more.

186
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,800
I really don't get you.

187
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,640
I thought you're with me
but then you'll suddenly run away.

188
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,200
I really don't get what you're thinking.

189
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,440
I'm not thinking of anything.

190
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,800
My thoughts are simple.

191
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,600
But I never thought
that your thoughts are even simpler.

192
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,200
They are more straightforward.

193
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,920
What are you trying to say?

194
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,160
I'm warning you.

195
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,880
I don't want to hear harsh words.

196
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,240
Do you want to try this bento box?

197
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,720
You made it for me?

198
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,200
It's not some Michelin dish.

199
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,040
I'm not sure if it will suit your taste.

200
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,240
I'll try it.

201
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,480
What's this jellyfish-like thing?

202
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,520
Enoki mushroom bacon wrap.

203
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,280
I see.

204
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,880
Never mind. Don't force yourself.

205
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,760
I know you're used to food
made by high-class chefs.

206
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,840
You're not used to these common dishes.

207
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,840
Hey.

208
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,640
I thought you'd start dating Xiaozi.

209
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,520
Xiaozi?

210
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,000
Yes.

211
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,120
Last time,

212
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,120
I saw you two having a good time
at the coffee shop.

213
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,800
Are you crazy?

214
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,960
I told you I won't date a girl
that I don't like.

215
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,760
Then will you date me?

216
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,520
Are you all right?

217
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,200
Are you all right?

218
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,920
How can you say such things so easily?

219
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,200
I didn't just say it easily.

220
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm serious.

221
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,400
And...

222
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,520
I hope you can keep it a secret.

223
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,560
Keep what a secret?

224
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,720
About us dating.

225
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,400
Don't tell anyone first.

226
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,040
-Because--
-You want us to date secretly?

227
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,520
That's not what I meant.

228
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,640
We won't keep it a secret forever.
Just don't tell anyone for now.

229
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,640
Are you freaking kidding me?

230
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,480
You want me to watch movies,
go out, and eat secretly?

231
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,920
What are you thinking?

232
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,800
I want to be together with you.

233
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,960
However,

234
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,840
if your mom finds out,

235
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,360
she'll surely take action again.

236
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,520
I don't want to be separated
from you like the last time.

237
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,640
I've had enough.

238
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,960
I've decided not to contact you.

239
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,680
I can't accept it.

240
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,440
You're leaving me
because of such a lousy reason.

241
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That's nonsense!

242
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,560
I don't want to go through that again.

243
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,600
I've already made up my mind.

244
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,880
For you, even if I have
to leave my family,

245
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,520
even if I'm not Daoming Si anymore,

246
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,840
I'd give up everything for you.

247
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,880
You don't need to do anything.

248
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,400
What choice do I have?

249
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,640
Let's see when they find out.

250
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,520
You can't tell Ximen and Meizuo too.

251
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,440
We're keeping it from them too?

252
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,440
Is that okay?

253
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Then...

254
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,760
I think Si doesn't have the courage yet.

255
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,920
Me too.

256
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,520
I'm not sure what Shancai is thinking.

257
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,200
She thinks too much.

258
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,640
That's right.

259
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,680
They're dating
like primary school students.

260
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,040
What is it? Do you have any ideas?

261
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,840
Let's do what Lei couldn't do.

262
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,680
Let's lend Si a helping hand.

263
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,440
Of course.

264
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,040
Wait.

265
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,080
Someone will see us.

266
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,520
There's no one here.

267
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,480
There is.

268
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,000
Near the back. Somebody's there.

269
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,800
Are you part of the Terracotta Army?
Where were you unearthed?

270
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,480
You're the Terracotta Army.

271
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,440
Aren't we already dating?

272
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,960
Can't I kiss you?

273
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,040
No.

274
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,520
Why?

275
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,800
If you don't tell me,

276
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,440
I'm not letting you go.

277
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,160
Because...

278
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,800
Because my heart's beating so fast.
Because I'm too excited.

279
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,440
Because you're all I think about.

280
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,160
Because you're here in front of me.

281
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,360
I can't breathe. So, no.

282
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,800
Why are you talking like that?

283
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,520
That's how I speak. So what?

284
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,960
Hearing you say those things
make me want to...

285
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,360
To...

286
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,600
<i>So this is how it feels to be in love.</i>

287
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,480
<i>It's so unbelievable.</i>

288
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,120
<i>My feelings are overflowing
like a dam on the verge of bursting.</i>

289
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,720
Xiaoyou.

290
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,960
-Move these inside.
-Sure. Right away.

291
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

292
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Ximen?

293
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,440
You should ask Shancai to do these things.

294
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,680
She's stronger than you.

295
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,240
Why are you here?

296
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,200
Are you here to buy milk tea or...

297
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,880
I came for you.

298
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,360
Me?

299
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,600
Why?

300
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,200
But I'm a bit busy now.

301
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,840
It's fine.

302
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,320
I can wait for you.

303
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
Xiaoyou, are the ten orders
of White Jasmine Dew

304
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,320
and 15 orders of Peach Red Royale done?

305
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,800
The customer will be here soon.

306
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,280
Right away.

307
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,160
Aren't you the guy who helped
with our sales the last time?

308
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,560
-Sorry for disturbing you.
-How could that be? Thank you.

309
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,960
-Are you here for Xiaoyou?
-Yes.

310
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,600
She still needs to work for another hour.

311
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,200
It's fine. I can wait for her.

312
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,840
It's okay.

313
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,120
Xiaoyou, leave earlier today.

314
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,520
I'll take care of this.

315
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,040
Can I do that?

316
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,080
Don't let him wait. You can go.

317
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,320
-Thank you, ma'am.
-You're welcome.

318
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,600
<i>Am I mistaken?</i>

319
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,320
<i>Who are they? Why are they following me?</i>

320
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,920
Shancai.

321
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,360
Are you all right?

322
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,280
Who were you hiding from?

323
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,400
I've been followed by strange guys.

324
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,600
Come, this way.

325
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,120
Come here.

326
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,400
Come here.

327
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,560
They're obviously Si's bodyguards.

328
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,360
What do you plan to do?
Do you want to tell Si?

329
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,640
I should.

330
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,640
However,

331
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,560
-I'm worried--
-You're worried that Si

332
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,680
would fight with his mom.

333
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,480
Right?

334
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,680
Yes.

335
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,160
Then let's not tell Si for now.

336
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,680
Si loses all reason when it comes to you.

337
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,720
Ximen and I are also afraid
he'll be too rash.

338
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,560
It might worsen the situation.

339
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,200
I'm not sure what to do anymore.

340
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,280
Well,

341
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,400
I think you'd be fine for now.

342
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,160
However,

343
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,360
try not to go home first.

344
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,680
They'll surely be back.

345
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,400
Okay.

346
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,520
I'll stay with Xiaoyou for a while.

347
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,840
By the way, why are you in this area?

348
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
Xiaoyou's not home.

349
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,720
How do you know?

350
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,840
She's at Ximen's house.

351
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
Who told you that?

352
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,000
Is it true?

353
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,960
Ximen told me earlier
that Xiaoyou's at his house.

354
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,080
And they're tasting some tea together.

355
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,120
Actually...

356
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,160
It should be all right.

357
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,040
But I think I should tell you.

358
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,800
So that you won't blame me later.

359
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,200
Tasting tea?

360
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,040
They can't do that.

361
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,760
Hello? Xiaoyou. Where are you now?

362
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,440
-<i>Shancai</i>.
-Are you at Ximen's house?

363
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,080
<i>Yes. I just arrived at their gate.</i>

364
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,400
Listen to me. Don't go in--

365
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,520
<i>Xiaoyou, what's the matter?</i>

366
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,040
<i>-Come in first.
-Okay.</i>

367
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,880
<i>Shancai, I'll talk to you later.</i>

368
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,600
Hey, I...

369
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,880
Take me to Ximen's house.

370
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,080
Success!

371
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,800
Why did you trick Shancai
into going to your house?

372
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,640
It's a surprise.

373
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,640
It's not something weird, right?

374
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,280
Xiaoyou, trust me.

375
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,200
You won't harm Shancai. I trust you.

376
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,560
You seem to be in a good mood.

377
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
Yes.

378
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,960
I have to keep moving forward.

379
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,240
All right. I'll tell you the truth.

380
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,680
We're trying to help Shancai
and Si take their relationship

381
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,640
one step further.

382
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,560
One step further?

383
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,200
I see.

384
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,520
However, if their relationship goes well,

385
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,440
it's not good for your family, right?

386
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,160
You should be worried.

387
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,880
No, it's not like that.

388
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,360
Shancai...

389
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,360
She doesn't tell me
what she thinks lately.

390
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,840
Maybe she's just shy.

391
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,400
No.

392
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,160
She'd tell me everything before.

393
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,120
But now,

394
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,680
she just handles everything alone.

395
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,400
I can't help her.

396
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,480
And I even need her to protect me.

397
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,040
I'm such a lousy friend.

398
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,480
But I did a lot of thinking lately.

399
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,800
I hope Shancai can be happy.

400
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,040
Since she likes Daoming Si
and Daoming Si likes her too,

401
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
then I'll raise both hands in support.

402
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,480
However, your family might get affected.

403
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,480
Doesn't that matter to you?

404
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,760
I'm already an adult.
I can help with our family's expenses.

405
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,720
And didn't you see it too?

406
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,200
Shancai was not at the milk tea shop.
But I could handle it by myself.

407
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,960
I believe our family can work together
and overcome any challenge.

408
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,040
Didn't Shancai do the same?

409
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,920
If she can do it, so can I.

410
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,880
There's nothing I can't do.

411
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,480
You're not the Xiaoyou
who used to cry on the street anymore.

412
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,680
You've grown up and become stronger.

413
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,360
The one who made me strong

414
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,520
was you.

415
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,480
After what happened,

416
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,080
I told myself I should change.

417
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,760
You told me I should never
look down on myself.

418
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,120
Is that so? What an honor.

419
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,480
You have to find a nice guy
to be your boyfriend in the future.

420
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,080
Keep it up.

421
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,480
Ximen.

422
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,520
Why are you here?

423
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,520
I walked past and thought
it was just someone who looked like you.

424
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,880
Turns out it's really you.

425
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,400
Are you on a date?

426
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,280
Am I interrupting?

427
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,680
No.

428
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
You're not.

429
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,480
By the way,
thanks for agreeing about Shancai.

430
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,880
Also, we'll do our best
to help your family.

431
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,480
You don't have to worry.

432
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,520
Does she want to have a drink with us?

433
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,680
No. She's not coming.

434
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,240
-Let's go.
-Bye.

435
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,200
Where's Xiaoyou?

436
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,000
Wait! Why are you so impatient?

437
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,800
I might be too late!

438
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,800
You're going to break my hand.

439
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,520
Tell me where Ximen and Xiaoyou are.

440
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,120
Master bedroom. Second door on the left.

441
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,080
Does she think she's Xiaoyou's guardian?

442
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,080
She's so easily tricked.

443
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,600
Xiaoyou.

444
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,960
Xiaoyou.

445
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,760
Are you inside?

446
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,760
Xiaoyou.

447
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,880
Hey.

448
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,760
<i>Are they trying to destroy my house?</i>

449
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,760
You're at a bar?

450
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,680
<i>Didn't we agree to meet at your house
with Xiaoyou afterward?</i>

451
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,840
Si and Shancai will be
locked in all night.

452
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,040
What's the point of being there?

453
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,760
<i>We'll suffer if we wait
by their door all night.</i>

454
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Makes sense.

455
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,920
Then I'll join you.

456
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,960
Come over.
You're the only one missing here.

457
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,520
Okay. I'll head there now.

458
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,120
Daoming Si?

459
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,600
What's going on?

460
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,840
Ximen and Meizuo kidnapped me.

461
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,080
Did you see Xiaoyou?

462
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,640
No.

463
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,920
Did I go into the wrong room?

464
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,360
Those guys.

465
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,520
Hey!

466
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,720
Open up! Ximen, Meizuo.

467
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
Where did you take Xiaoyou?

468
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,720
Hey!

469
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,400
-Stop screaming.
-Open the door!

470
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
You've been tricked.

471
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,640
What do you mean?

472
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,480
I received a call from Xiaoyou.

473
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,040
-She said she's here--
-So you've been tricked.

474
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,600
You mean...

475
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,320
Xiaoyou worked with Ximen
and Meizuo to trick me?

476
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,200
They planned this?

477
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,160
No. I have to find a way out.

478
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,960
That door's the only way out.

479
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,800
-But it's locked.
-So we can't go out.

480
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,920
So what do we do?

481
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,600
I don't care. I'm with you anyway.

482
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,000
Be serious. Think of something, okay?

483
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,960
Even if I can think of something,
I'm not going out.

484
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,800
Those guys. They should've just told me.

485
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,560
No need to tie me up like that.

486
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
In that case,

487
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,240
sorry, I'll tie you back up.

488
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,240
Are you crazy?

489
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,400
I'm not ready yet.

490
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,600
If I give you time to get ready,
you'll surely run away again.

491
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,960
<i>He saw through me.</i>

492
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,120
You might not know yet,

493
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,200
but this expression of yours

494
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,120
fascinates me the most.

495
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,320
Shancai.

496
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
You're so short.

497
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,320
My neck's about to break.

498
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,960
Who told you to be tall like a giraffe?

499
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,520
Make yourself taller for me, okay?

500
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,840
I'm so nervous already.

501
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,720
How can I do that?

502
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,160
What's there to be nervous about?

503
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,040
Your face is so red.

504
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,360
It might be contagious.

505
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,640
<i>It looks like things might not go smoothly</i>

506
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,400
<i>even if we're together already.</i>

507
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,760
<i>Especially since our situation
is not ordinary at all.</i>

508
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,160
Do you think this room
is like that wooden mansion in Canada?

509
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,080
Yes. Canada.

510
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,720
At the time,

511
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,560
I thought Xiaoyou went out
to see the night view in the snowstorm.

512
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,400
So I went out to find her.
Then I got lost.

513
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,840
I almost got eaten by wolves.

514
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,960
It was so scary.

515
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,280
-Then you...
-Then what did I do?

516
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,960
I became your savior.

517
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,640
Right?

518
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,600
You always got yourself involved
and saved me.

519
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,560
What do you mean I got myself involved?

520
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,480
What I'm trying to say is

521
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,640
I've always been grateful.

522
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,920
No matter how many times it is,
I'd go and save you.

523
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,720
Because I really love you.

524
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,600
I can't live without you.

525
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,120
Why do you have that expression again?

526
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,360
I might...

527
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,040
<i>Happiness like this is like standing</i>

528
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,320
<i>on a piece of floating ice in the sea.</i>

529
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,040
<i>It might melt anytime.</i>

530
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,720
Ma'am, the investigative report
from Shanghai is here.

531
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,920
Let me see it.
