TALENT'S TEA SHOP

4
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,620
Hi. Your White Jasmine Dew
and Peach Red Royale.

5
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,860
-Please come again.
-Thank you.

6
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,300
Xiaoyou.

7
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,260
Where did you and Ximen go the other day?

8
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,700
Did anything happen?

9
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,540
Nothing happened.

10
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,380
Xiaoyou, listen to me.

11
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,420
You and Ximen can be good friends.

12
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,620
But you can't date him.

13
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:41,711
You'll get hurt, you know?

14
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Why do you always say that about him?

15
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,220
Because I've seen it with my own eyes.

16
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,780
He dates girls one after another.

17
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,740
You know that too, right?

18
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,460
Ximen won't be serious with you...

19
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,500
No.

20
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,940
He won't be serious with anyone.

21
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,420
How do you know?

22
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,060
Do you understand him?

23
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,100
You don't. So how can you conclude that?

24
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,060
How about you? Do you understand him?

25
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,100
Does he want you to understand him?

26
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,900
That's none of your business.

27
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,740
Asking about other people's privacy
is very impolite.

28
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,340
You're right.

29
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,260
He doesn't.

30
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,860
I'm sorry, Xiaoyou.

31
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,860
I was too harsh.

32
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,340
I just don't want you to get hurt.

33
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,660
Shancai.

34
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,140
What is it?

35
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,500
One day, if Ximen treats me
like a stranger, don't be surprised.

36
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,940
You're acting really strange.

37
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,740
I've already decided.

38
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,860
Decided what?

39
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,100
Cheers. You're beautiful.

40
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,220
-You're so sweet.
-Okay.

41
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,700
How long have you been in Shanghai?

42
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,460
I just arrived here.

43
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,900
Really?

44
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,060
You're the first person I know here.

45
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,220
-Let's toast to our encounter.
-It's too noisy here.

46
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,060
Let's go somewhere else.

47
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,060
-Sure.
-It's Xiaoyou.

48
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,860
Why is she all alone there?

49
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,900
Did something happen to her?

50
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,940
Forget about her.

51
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,820
What do you want to drink?

52
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,580
I'm fine. All right.

53
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,500
I think you like fruity cocktails.

54
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
The sweet ones.

55
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,380
Hey.

56
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,020
It's okay. I'll order if I want something.

57
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,140
Aren't you here all alone
so that someone else can order for you?

58
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,540
No, that's not why I'm here.

59
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,660
I noticed you immediately
when you came in.

60
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,980
You sat here and didn't order anything.

61
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,060
Weren't you hoping someone
would come over and chat with you?

62
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,740
-Listen to me.
-All right. Buy me a drink.

63
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,980
I don't know the rules
since it's my first time here.

64
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,700
You're such a cute girl.

65
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,500
No problem. Let's drink.

66
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,260
It's my treat. Order whatever you want.

67
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,420
Okay. Let's drink.

68
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,580
I can tell that you're not a girl
who frequents bars.

69
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,340
It's your first time in a bar

70
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,380
and we met.

71
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,860
I'm so lucky.

72
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,340
Someone bought me a drink
when it's my first time here.

73
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,620
I'm quite lucky too.

74
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,580
How alcohol tolerant are you?

75
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,100
I haven't really drunk that much before.

76
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,100
Then you will know
how much you can drink today.

77
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,380
Ximen.

78
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,780
Where are we going later?

79
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,380
Karaoke? A restaurant? Or to your place?

80
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,100
-To your place, of course.
-Really?

81
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,660
-Xiaoyou is drinking too much.
-One more glass.

82
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,300
Can she handle it?

83
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,900
All that guy ordered for her
are strong drinks.

84
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,180
If this continues,
Xiaoyou will get drunk soon.

85
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,620
Aren't you going to check on her?

86
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,780
You're sitting at the bar too.

87
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,940
I'm buying this time. What are you having?

88
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,020
You're so cute.

89
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,460
Guys are supposed to buy drinks for girls.

90
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,460
Not the other way around.

91
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,180
Shouldn't I pay you back
for your generosity?

92
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,620
Let's make a deal first.
If you buy me a drink

93
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,620
and I get drunk,
you have to take responsibility.

94
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,580
One drink should be fine.

95
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,420
I don't want to owe you anything.

96
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,340
We'll have the same again.

97
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,420
-Are you drunk?
-I'm not.

98
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,540
-My face is just a bit hot.
-Let me see.

99
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,340
You had too much to drink.

100
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,620
Do you want to get some air outside?

101
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,780
-What do you think?
-There's no need.

102
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,100
I want to go home.

103
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,380
The drink just arrived. Maybe after this drink?

104
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,580
I bought that drink for you.

105
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,900
No.

106
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,460
You said you're going home.
So you have to drink this.

107
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,020
That's my wish.

108
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,900
If you don't want to drink it
and want to go home,

109
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,340
I'll take you home.

110
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,380
All right.

111
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,460
-I'll leave after I drink this.
-Sure.

112
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,220
I'll take you home after this.

113
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,300
I'll drink this for her.

114
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,060
-Who are you?
-Done.

115
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,020
You can go now.

116
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,860
Bye then.

117
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
You're drunk, right?

118
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,220
You drank so much, of course you are.

119
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,140
I thought I'd be drunk.

120
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,220
But I can actually drink a lot.

121
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,380
-Want to buy me another drink?
-Why are you doing this?

122
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,260
Why did you come to such a place?

123
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,100
If you can come here, I can too.

124
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,380
If you can drink, I can too.

125
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,860
And I learned how to order drinks today.

126
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,780
Never mind. I'll buy you a drink.

127
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,060
-We'll have the same--
-Come on.

128
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,900
I've already decided.

129
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,260
I want to be with you.

130
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,140
Do you know that you're giving me
a hard time?

131
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,420
And you're making me mad.

132
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,900
I know.

133
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,460
Stop being so self-centered.

134
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,660
Don't act like you want to give up
everything for me.

135
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,660
That doesn't work on me.

136
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,460
And do you think other girls around me
never acted like you do?

137
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,100
But right now,
I'm the one in front of you.

138
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,300
You're...

139
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,660
really one of a kind.

140
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,020
Yes.

141
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,980
I think I'm a weirdo too.

142
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,900
So?

143
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,500
What do you want me to do?

144
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,460
Last time, you said
that there's always regret in love.

145
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,260
So did you also have regrets in love?

146
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,580
Tell me.

147
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,660
Let me know.

148
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,620
I promise I'll stay away from you.
I won't bother you anymore.

149
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,020
All right. I'll tell you.

150
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,700
But after this, leave me alone.

151
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,180
Okay.

152
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,580
What do you want to know?

153
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,500
Everything.

154
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,060
<i>I knew a girl named Xiaogeng before.</i>

155
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,620
<i>We grew up together.</i>

156
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,660
<i>She used to live next door</i>

157
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,220
<i>and always came to play at my house.</i>

158
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,060
Seven.

159
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,340
Nine.

160
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,500
J.

161
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,660
I win.

162
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,220
Don't play poker again.

163
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,620
But I'm better at playing cards
than studying.

164
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,780
I can help you.

165
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,900
I'll help you get good grades.

166
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,900
Am I that easily convinced?

167
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,260
<i>I'm used to having Xiaogeng by my side.</i>

168
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,340
<i>Being together
was as natural as breathing.</i>

169
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,940
You're not studying at all.

170
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,260
<i>But on the other hand,
she made me breathless.</i>

171
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,740
Even though my family seems
to be doing well,

172
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,580
it has been long broken.

173
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,580
Can't you just pretend?

174
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,020
You haven't been coming home.

175
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,380
Have you ever considered my position?

176
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,580
Can we stop fooling other people
as well as ourselves?

177
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,580
Let's stop pretending.

178
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,260
Whether we get divorced or not,

179
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,660
I'll take care of you.

180
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,020
-But we can't go back to the way we were.
-You...

181
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,620
<i>My parents' marriage was a lie.</i>

182
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,940
<i>They were leading false lives.</i>

183
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,940
<i>And they wanted me to live the same way.</i>

184
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,580
<i>But it was really hard.</i>

185
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,820
Tell me.

186
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,820
Can people's feelings

187
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,980
remain unchanged their whole lives?

188
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,540
I get it now.

189
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,340
You were influenced
by your parents' relationship.

190
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,980
You don't trust love.

191
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,780
<i>I always saw and heard my mom crying.</i>

192
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,220
<i>I've learned one thing.</i>

193
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,660
<i>Love hurts people too much.</i>

194
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,740
<i>Love is like a sharp blade.</i>

195
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,420
<i>The more you hold on to it,
the deeper and more painful your wound is.</i>

196
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,460
<i>I was fortunate
to have Xiaogeng by my side.</i>

197
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,020
<i>She was a switch given by the heavens</i>

198
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,220
<i>that could turn off
all the lies in this world.</i>

199
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,140
<i>At that time,</i>

200
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,180
<i>I felt relaxed whenever I saw Xiaogeng.</i>

201
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,100
Chocolate.

202
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,380
Cake.

203
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,860
Ice cream.

204
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,980
They're so delicious.

205
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,780
<i>Xiaogeng was different from F3.</i>

206
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,260
<i>Her existence made me feel at peace.</i>

207
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,580
<i>I hoped our relationship
would never change.</i>

208
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,940
<i>I hoped we would always stay the same
forever and ever.</i>

209
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,780
Men don't seem
to like dolls and stuffed toys.

210
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,660
It depends. To me,

211
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,540
you're the best stuffed toy.

212
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,420
Me? Do I look like one?

213
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,980
Then I'll become a doll.

214
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,580
<i>But Xiaogeng was not a doll.</i>

215
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,860
<i>She didn't just want to stay in one place.</i>

216
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,820
<i>She moved closer to me.</i>

217
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,540
<i>I knew she gathered up
her courage to do it.</i>

218
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,420
Look at me.

219
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,700
Do I look like a girl now?

220
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,900
Take me out.

221
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,540
Okay?

222
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,780
What has gotten into you today?

223
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,620
Why are you wearing that?

224
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,740
It looks so strange.

225
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,220
Did you also put on makeup?

226
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,980
Don't change so quickly.

227
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,220
Go scare other people.
Don't come and scare me.

228
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,700
I know, right?

229
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,620
I think this doesn't suit me either.

230
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,820
I'm too boyish.

231
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,900
By the way, I need to go and do something.

232
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,140
I'll get going now.

233
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,180
I'll come again tomorrow.

234
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,900
<i>I hurt her really bad
so that she wouldn't come near me.</i>

235
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,980
<i>Xiaogeng.</i>

236
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,900
<i>Please stay where you are.</i>

237
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,980
<i>It's the best for you and me.</i>

238
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,420
It's been a while since I tasted
the tea you made.

239
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,660
It's so good.

240
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,140
You're exaggerating.

241
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,700
It really is.

242
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,020
You've been busy lately.

243
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,420
I don't see you when I come here.

244
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,300
What's the matter?
Why were you looking for me?

245
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,140
It's nothing.

246
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,220
Xiaogeng, why don't you find a boyfriend?

247
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,260
What if I have a boyfriend
and you ask me to come for tea?

248
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,940
I won't be able to come then.

249
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,460
You think too much.

250
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,980
I'm always very busy.

251
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,460
<i>I ignored how hurt she felt.</i>

252
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,100
<i>And purposely stayed away.</i>

253
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,460
<i>I thought I was doing the right thing.</i>

254
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,620
<i>But Xiaogeng never came for tea again.</i>

255
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,100
All right. I'm done talking.

256
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,860
Based on our deal,

257
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,180
don't come to me again.

258
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,820
Your White Jasmine Dew.

259
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,860
Please come again.

260
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,500
Hi, ma'am.

261
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,980
-Is Xiaoyou not coming today?
-No.

262
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,140
She called and said
she won't be coming for a while.

263
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,100
Why?

264
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,340
She didn't tell me.

265
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,500
She sounded quite down.

266
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,780
So I didn't ask.

267
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,220
So you have to work extra hard.

268
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,780
-I'm sorry about that.
-It's fine.

269
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,100
Did you bring your friend home today?

270
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,540
What do you care?

271
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,380
It doesn't matter if you did.

272
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
We didn't see anything anyway.

273
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,380
We wouldn't say anything if we did.

274
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,100
ZHUANG

275
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,860
<i>I went back to London.</i>

276
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,180
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

277
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,700
<i>And take good care of Shancai.</i>

278
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,900
<i>By the way, are you satisfied
with my arrangement?</i>

279
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,620
Arrangement?

280
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,860
<i>That night,</i>

281
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,620
<i>Ximen said his story
with Xiaogeng's was over.</i>

282
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,940
<i>But I don't think so.</i>

283
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,220
<i>He's still not over it.</i>

284
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,380
<i>I feel so lost going around
all these buildings.</i>

285
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,340
<i>But I'm determined to do so.</i>

286
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,100
<i>Because I really want to find the answer.</i>

287
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,980
Xiaoyou.

288
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,900
Mom.

289
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,380
Come here. I want to talk to you.

290
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,860
Xiaoyou, where do you always go at night?

291
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,420
You leave in the middle of the night
and return early morning.

292
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,620
Right?

293
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,260
Are you doing something
that you can't tell me?

294
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,660
No. I'm not.

295
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,580
What is this?

296
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,300
What exactly are you looking for?

297
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,420
Names of different buildings
are listed there.

298
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,860
And you marked the places
you've been and haven't been to.

299
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,620
What are you looking for?

300
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,740
I'm not doing anything
you should worry about.

301
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,500
This might be
a very important time for me.

302
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,020
Mom, I hope you understand.

303
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,180
Hey.

304
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,220
What is it? You scared me, you jerk.

305
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,740
Where are your bodyguards?

306
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,260
My sister took care of them.

307
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,420
Listen carefully.

308
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,980
You didn't see anything.
And you won't say anything.

309
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,140
Understand?

310
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,620
Wait.

311
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,860
As Daoming family's bodyguards,
that won't work.

312
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,540
Even if you're a bodyguard,

313
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,900
you have to look good
and be more confident.

314
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,460
Ms. Zhuang is so strange.

315
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,260
My sister is really unusual.

316
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,780
Why would she have such
an outstanding brother otherwise?

317
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,740
Ms. Zhuang is really outstanding.

318
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,620
But you...

319
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,060
What?

320
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,780
Say it clearly, stupid girl.

321
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,540
You're the stupid one, the stupidest.

322
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,100
Me? You're the stupidest of them all.

323
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,740
If you didn't pull down your teammates,

324
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,460
I'd have already conquered
Fantasy Westward Journey.

325
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,380
Fantasy? Fantasy what?

326
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,540
Fantasy Westward Journey?

327
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,140
Yes.

328
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,900
-You can play it, why can't I?
-I...

329
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,220
I didn't say you can't play it.

330
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,020
But you never played with me.

331
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,180
How would you know
if I pulled down my teammates?

332
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,100
I play with you all the time.

333
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,620
I know clearly how you play.

334
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,020
What?

335
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,780
All right.

336
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,180
Actually, I'm "I Call the Shots."

337
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,740
You're "I Call the Shots"?

338
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,460
How's that possible?
He's the X9 League champion.

339
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,060
How can you play so well?

340
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,420
You don't believe me?

341
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,220
What do you think? I'm so cool, right?

342
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,220
I've wanted to show you for a long time.
I just haven't had the chance.

343
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,940
You're really "I Call the Shots."

344
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,860
You're amazing.

345
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,420
But don't use codenames to play games
without me knowing again.

346
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,340
I'll do whatever I want. Why do you care?

347
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,220
Shancai.

348
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,260
Is that the medal
in Fantasy Westward Journey?

349
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,900
Yes.

350
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,220
You're amazing.
You got the champion medal.

351
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,180
I like it so much.

352
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,980
Can you give it to me?

353
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,460
I really treasure this. You wish.

354
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,900
How stingy of you.

355
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,300
<i>It's been days.</i>

356
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,900
<i>I've been going to different buildings
in the city after my class.</i>

357
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,020
<i>I don't even know what I'm looking for.</i>

358
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,100
<i>But like Xiaogeng,
I want to do this for Ximen.</i>

359
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,780
<i>So I couldn't stop.</i>

360
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,020
ENTER STREET AFTER 29 METERS

361
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,700
BEEN THERE

362
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,780
Where's Si?

363
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,220
He should be here soon.

364
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,100
Why do you look like
you're only half-awake?

365
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,380
It's too early.

366
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,100
How is it too early?
It's already noon, okay?

367
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,140
How's your recital practice going?

368
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,300
It's all right.

369
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,940
How about you?

370
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,900
I'm quite interested
in your exhibit this time.

371
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,660
I knew you'd like it. We'll be done with the preparations soon.

372
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,620
You have to be there on the opening day.

373
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,260
Okay.

374
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,420
It's so hard to even go on a date now.
I'm so envious of the college students.

375
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,740
They can have a daily romance.

376
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,140
Ximen.

377
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,900
How did it go with Xiaoyou that night?

378
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,860
You didn't come back to the bar.
You also didn't answer my calls.

379
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,980
-Xiaoyou has fallen, right?
-Fallen?

380
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,260
What do you mean?

381
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,460
Nothing. We're talking about someone else.

382
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,780
Xiaoyou?

383
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,940
Oh. Shancai's best friend.

384
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,220
Lei, aren't you usually bad with names?

385
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,780
Hey, didn't you say you will never
touch Xiaoyou?

386
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,980
What's going on?
I just arrived and he left.

387
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,500
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

388
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,140
-Two Peach Red Royales.
-Thank you.

389
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,380
Please come again.

390
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,260
Xiaoyou.

391
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,060
Can you tell me what's going on
between you and Ximen?

392
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,100
Shancai, stop asking me.

393
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,700
This is between me and Ximen.

394
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,820
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

395
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,140
But I'm really worried about you.

396
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,940
I met Ximen today.
He was also acting quite strange.

397
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
He was?

398
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,420
Yes.

399
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,500
Both of you are not like yourselves.

400
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,900
It's all because of me.

401
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,660
I'll take care of it.

402
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,260
I don't understand what you're saying.

403
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,700
It'll be fine, Shancai.

404
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,660
Just cheer for me.

405
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,900
I hope you can cheer for me.

406
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,180
That's what you said before.

407
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,980
I just want to hear that.

408
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,500
All right.

409
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,940
You can do it.

410
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,860
By the way, I told our boss
I'd leave earlier.

411
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,980
I'll leave the rest to you then.
I'll get going now. Bye.

412
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,940
Hey. Wait.

413
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,060
Why? Did something happen again?

414
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,980
Xiaoyou. Hey.

415
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,620
Daoming Si.

416
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,740
I'm being serious. Bring me to Ximen.

417
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,940
Why?

418
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,780
I don't care. Bring me to Ximen
or we're breaking up.

419
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,620
Have you had dinner?

420
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,980
Yes. Do you believe that?

421
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,300
I don't think so.

422
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,700
Si, why are you here?

423
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,020
Something's up.

424
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,220
Miss, don't be fooled by this wolf
in sheep's clothing.

425
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,260
Shancai.

426
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,540
Don't you have anything better to do?

427
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,580
Do you know that Xiaoyou's so down
and she's crying every day?

428
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,220
Isn't that because of you? It can't be because of someone else.

429
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,100
Tell me. What exactly happened
between you two?

430
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,300
Nothing happened.

431
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,420
But she has to grow up.

432
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,220
No. Let's talk about it outside.

433
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,980
Hey.

434
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,940
Xiaoyou is serious about you.
Why are you so irresponsible?

435
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,860
Do you have to be so mad?

436
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,660
What does Xiaoyou's business
have to do with you?

437
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,900
She's my friend.

438
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,060
How can I not be concerned?

439
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,500
And you.

440
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,540
You're such a lousy friend.

441
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,300
Can't you just date seriously?

442
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,300
Can't you just treasure nice girls?

443
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,980
That's right.

444
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,340
-Learn from me.
-Haven't you had enough? If you don't like Xiaoyou,
why did you show any interest?

445
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,540
Yes. I did show some interest.

446
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,780
I regret it now.

447
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,420
I'm not a good man.
I'll never be with her.

448
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,540
Satisfied?

449
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,860
Hey, Ximen.

450
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,940
Why did you do that?
Why did you go to Ximen?

451
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,740
I told you I'd take care of it.

452
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,740
Take care of what?

453
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,620
What can you take care of?

454
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,900
I...

455
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,700
You haven't been to work or home.
What are you trying to do?

456
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,380
Ximen said he doesn't like you.

457
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,380
I know. You don't have to remind me.

458
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,780
Is this all worth it

459
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,700
just for Ximen? Shancai.

460
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,420
Don't mind me.

461
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,780
Just let me do what I want.

462
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,060
He treated you that way.

463
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,860
You still refuse to give up?

464
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,100
I want to know
what the girl Ximen liked did for him

465
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,740
or else I won't feel at ease.

466
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,340
Does it matter if you find out?

467
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,500
Yes. It matters to me now.

468
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,580
Xiaogeng is the only one who knows you

469
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,500
before you led a false life

470
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,380
or maybe even after that.

471
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,980
You left your sincerity
in the Way of the Tea.

472
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,980
She knew that.

473
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,580
<i>Have you ever heard of what they call
"Once in a Lifetime" in the tea ceremony?</i>

474
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,820
<i>The first time I heard of it</i>

475
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,460
<i>was when my teacher mentioned it.</i>

476
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,740
Do you know what "Once in a Lifetime"
means in the Way of the Tea?

477
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,500
It means

478
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,420
a certain encounter
will only happen once in this life.

479
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,860
Treasure every encounter
as if it's the last one.

480
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,940
<i>Do everything you can.</i>

481
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,500
<i>Don't have any regrets.</i>

482
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,620
<i>No matter what you do
or who you encounter,</i>

483
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,580
<i>that's the attitude</i>

484
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,780
<i>you should have in life.</i>

485
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,540
The Way of the Tea's "Once in a Lifetime"

486
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,980
is a pursuit of sincerity.

487
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,500
And...

488
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,660
I could never do that.

489
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,700
What happened between you two?

490
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:41,180
QZONE MESSAGE FROM XIAOGENG

491
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,420
<i>Ximen. This is Xiaogeng.</i>

492
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,300
I have something to show you.

493
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,140
I'll send you the address.

494
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,500
See you at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

495
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,620
<i>Ximen said</i>

496
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,100
<i>she never went to his house to have tea,
do homework, and play cards again.</i>

497
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,260
<i>The last time she contacted him
was for a date.</i>

498
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,380
<i>She set it at a specific location</i>

499
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,460
<i>at a specific time,</i>

500
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,780
<i>which was at 5 a.m.</i>

501
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,540
<i>I keep telling myself it would be fine.</i>

502
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,100
<i>As long as we never begin anything,
there'd be no ending as well.</i>

503
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,940
<i>As long as I don't go there,</i>

504
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,060
<i>Xiaogeng and I can surely
go back to the way we were.</i>

505
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,820
<i>Because I don't want to lose her.</i>

506
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,180
Don't you want to know
what Xiaogeng wanted to show you?

507
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,860
<i>That day,</i>

508
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,420
<i>Ximen simply deleted
the address Xiaogeng sent.</i>

509
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,940
<i>He didn't want to look at it.</i>

510
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,140
<i>By not knowing where it was,</i>

511
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,260
<i>he could repress his feelings
and not go there.</i>

512
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,260
<i>Because he didn't have
the courage to find out</i>

513
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,820
<i>what Xiaogeng wants to confess to him.</i> Did you listen to
the QZone voice message I sent?

514
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,980
I did.

515
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,140
But I went out with my friends
all night yesterday.

516
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,780
I see. Xiaogeng.

517
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:06,020
I mean, who meets at 5 a.m.?

518
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,500
It's too early.

519
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,540
I had too much fun last night.
I'm going to sleep now.

520
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,420
Ximen.

521
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,060
<i>It'll be all right.</i>

522
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,100
<i>I told myself</i>

523
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,100
<i>that tomorrow, Xiaogeng
would be back like nothing happened.</i>

524
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,460
<i>She'd surely come to me with a smile then.</i>

525
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,980
<i>We'd surely be back to the way we were.</i>

526
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,180
<i>Because...</i>

527
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,620
<i>I don't want to lose her.</i>

528
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,660
Goodbye.
