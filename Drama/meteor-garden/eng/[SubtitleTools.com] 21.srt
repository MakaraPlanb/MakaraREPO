EPISODE 21

4
00:00:05,617 --> 00:00:07,337
Daoming Si agreed to date me.

5
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:16,657
I'm not sure how it happened so fast.

6
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:20,337
I originally wanted to come
and ask you. Then...

7
00:00:22,257 --> 00:00:23,337
Hey.

8
00:00:24,897 --> 00:00:26,057
Monkey.

9
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:30,057
Who are you calling Monkey?

10
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:33,337
Xiaozi. I want to tell you something.

11
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:36,817
I'm not listening to you.
I know what you're going to say.

12
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:38,697
You want to say
that you don't like me, right?

13
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:41,857
You also sent your friends
to date me today, right?

14
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:44,457
Do you think that would make me back out?

15
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,497
You're wrong.

16
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:48,897
-My strongest point is perseverance.
-Let's date.

17
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:57,617
Hey.

18
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:58,937
Is that okay?

19
00:01:01,377 --> 00:01:02,337
What did you say?

20
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:07,137
All right.

21
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:09,257
Yes.

22
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:10,737
Yes.

23
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:14,977
He said he'd try to like me.

24
00:01:15,057 --> 00:01:16,457
I'm really touched.

25
00:01:18,017 --> 00:01:20,817
I'm not sure why I'm so happy.

26
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:22,977
I just realized

27
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,777
that I really like him.

28
00:01:34,017 --> 00:01:34,937
Shancai.

29
00:01:35,777 --> 00:01:37,017
Are you happy for me?

30
00:01:41,777 --> 00:01:43,817
I knew you'd succeed.

31
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:47,977
You're not mad, right?

32
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:49,817
No.

33
00:02:05,577 --> 00:02:09,417
Nutrition refers to the calories
contained in the food

34
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:11,537
as well as other components
good for our health.

35
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:14,817
Humans consume food
to obtain enough nutrients.

36
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:16,737
After food consumption

37
00:02:16,857 --> 00:02:19,337
and going through digestion,
absorption, and metabolism,

38
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:23,577
the body utilizes the substances it needs
to maintain life-sustaining activities.

39
00:02:24,657 --> 00:02:27,897
Through proper nutrition,
a lot of diseases can be prevented.

40
00:02:27,977 --> 00:02:30,017
I brought my Grandma's banana rice balls.

41
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:31,097
See you later.

42
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:34,417
Those are the human's six basic elements
for sustaining life.

43
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:36,577
Do you know what the six elements are?

44
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:38,457
They are carbohydrates,

45
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:42,737
protein, fats, minerals,

46
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:43,977
vitamins.

47
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:50,297
I heard that Si asked
that monkey to date him.

48
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:52,417
Si and Monkey.

49
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:54,217
I can't imagine it.

50
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:57,817
Her name is Xiaozi.

51
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:02,377
As his friend, you guys should be happy
that he's starting to become mature.

52
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:05,897
Shancai.

53
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:07,977
Why do you seem unaffected by this?

54
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:10,097
Don't you feel upset?

55
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:12,697
Shancai!

56
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:14,057
I finally found you.

57
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:16,657
I brought you lunch today.

58
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:17,577
Let's eat together.

59
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:19,937
Didn't you say you especially like

60
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:21,337
-my Grandma's rice balls?
-Shut up.

61
00:03:22,377 --> 00:03:23,617
Eat your rice balls.

62
00:03:27,497 --> 00:03:29,457
Do you want some? It's really good.

63
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:31,257
No.

64
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:32,977
My grandma made this for you.

65
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:34,257
You can't share it with others.

66
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:40,457
How does it taste?

67
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:42,097
Will we get an upset stomach from this?

68
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:43,657
It's sticky.

69
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:44,897
It's delicious.

70
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,897
Where did Daoming Si go?

71
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:53,297
Where's Meizuo?

72
00:03:53,897 --> 00:03:55,257
Meizuo was just here earlier.

73
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:56,497
I'm not sure where he went.

74
00:03:57,097 --> 00:03:59,897
Si should be on a date
with his girlfriend.

75
00:04:00,937 --> 00:04:01,857
What?

76
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:03,617
Daoming Si has a girlfriend?

77
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:13,457
Your smile looks so ugly.

78
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,497
I wonder how Si and that monkey is doing.

79
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,337
Si, why are you walking so fast?

80
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,297
-Are we having a race?
-You're so noisy.

81
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:34,297
I hate walking slowly.

82
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:36,857
Is this even a date?

83
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,737
What's the difference from before?

84
00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:41,537
I was so looking forward to today's date.

85
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:44,617
But you won't even look at me.
And you're not saying anything.

86
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:47,497
Why are we even together?

87
00:04:48,177 --> 00:04:49,377
What do you want me to do?

88
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:56,457
First of all, you have to match my pace.

89
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:58,817
Then you have to smile.

90
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:01,657
Lastly, you have to talk to me.

91
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:04,937
Why is it so hard?

92
00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:17,977
-Hey, what are you doing?
-What?

93
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:20,097
So what?

94
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:21,137
You're my boyfriend.

95
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,537
Si.

96
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:27,977
I'm so happy because you said
you'd try to like me.

97
00:05:28,457 --> 00:05:29,697
Is that true?

98
00:05:31,857 --> 00:05:33,737
I told you I'll try.

99
00:05:33,937 --> 00:05:35,577
Then when will you try?

100
00:05:37,457 --> 00:05:39,457
It's not something that can
be done quickly.

101
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:41,217
Give me an estimate.

102
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:42,617
-Around--
-How would I know?

103
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:51,777
One day, it will happen.

104
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:05,017
As of now, even though Xiaozi's
the one initiating it,

105
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:09,057
but she and Si would meet
two or three times a week.

106
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:12,817
It seems Si is a bit enlightened.

107
00:06:13,777 --> 00:06:14,857
What about Shancai?

108
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:16,857
Does she still bother Si?

109
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:19,297
The situation is,

110
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:23,457
aside from school, Si and Shancai
don't have much contact.

111
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,617
Though, Xiaozi often talks to Shancai.

112
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:30,777
You mean Xiaozi initiates it?

113
00:06:33,657 --> 00:06:35,097
What are they up to?

114
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:39,817
Xiaozi seems quite naive.

115
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:42,777
It seems she'll tell Shancai details
about her relationship

116
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:44,617
with Si.

117
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:47,897
This girl Shancai
has too many tricks up her sleeve.

118
00:06:48,577 --> 00:06:51,617
I think she hasn't given up on Si yet.

119
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:00,017
This is quite good too.

120
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:01,137
Try it.

121
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:05,977
Open the door.

122
00:07:11,217 --> 00:07:12,257
Shancai.

123
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,217
Xiaozi?

124
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:16,097
Why are you here?

125
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:17,617
What's up?

126
00:07:18,577 --> 00:07:19,457
Who is it?

127
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:21,697
It smells so good. Are you having dinner?

128
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:26,217
Hi, good evening.

129
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:29,657
Shancai, is she your friend?

130
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:31,257
Come, have a seat and eat with us.

131
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:32,177
Can I?

132
00:07:32,257 --> 00:07:33,937
-Sure.
-Sit down. I'll get you a bowl.

133
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,457
Thank you, Mrs. Dong.

134
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,177
This is great.

135
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,697
I haven't had dinner here before.

136
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:40,937
Here.

137
00:07:42,977 --> 00:07:44,337
These are just simple dishes.

138
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,497
Can I try them?

139
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:48,497
Of course.

140
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:50,377
These are delicious.

141
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:51,497
Come on. Try it.

142
00:07:51,577 --> 00:07:53,057
-Thank you, Mr. Dong.
-You're welcome.

143
00:07:56,057 --> 00:07:57,537
-It's delicious.
-Really?

144
00:07:57,617 --> 00:07:59,417
Then have some more. Try the others.

145
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:01,577
-Here.
-Okay, thanks.

146
00:08:03,057 --> 00:08:04,777
Shancai, why are you standing there?

147
00:08:04,857 --> 00:08:06,177
Come here.

148
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,657
Okay.

149
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:09,097
I'll try this one.

150
00:08:11,897 --> 00:08:12,737
Have some more.

151
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:13,977
Get some more of this.

152
00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:17,897
Mrs. Dong, you cook so well.

153
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:21,937
You know,

154
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:25,417
I woke up so early in the morning
to do my makeup and get dressed.

155
00:08:25,777 --> 00:08:29,017
I even took out all my clothes
from my closet.

156
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,417
That's right.

157
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:32,257
I also used a new lipstick color.

158
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:34,937
I think he never even looked
at my lipstick.

159
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:37,457
I'm not sure if he noticed it.

160
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:38,497
Shancai.

161
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:40,617
Are you listening?

162
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:42,697
Yes.

163
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:47,417
By the way,
I took him to the park for a walk today.

164
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:51,177
That park is so romantic, you know?

165
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:55,297
I think men should make a move
at those moments.

166
00:08:55,857 --> 00:08:56,897
But,

167
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,017
you know, he didn't even kiss me.

168
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:04,697
Aside from that,
we just sat there silently.

169
00:09:05,097 --> 00:09:07,497
We're not like lovers at all, right?

170
00:09:09,657 --> 00:09:12,457
Do I really need to hear her rants?

171
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:21,417
Shancai.

172
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:25,337
Have you and Daoming Si ever kissed?

173
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:29,537
You have.

174
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,417
You have, right?

175
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:32,937
Tell me honestly.

176
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:37,417
I...

177
00:09:40,377 --> 00:09:41,337
Tell me.

178
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:43,137
Does he still like you?

179
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:45,617
Don't think like that.

180
00:09:45,737 --> 00:09:46,657
It's not like that.

181
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:50,057
Sorry, Shancai.

182
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:52,937
Maybe I'm too impatient.

183
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:56,417
And I've been so sheltered
since I was little.

184
00:09:57,177 --> 00:09:59,057
I've never experienced these things.

185
00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:00,297
I don't know how to handle it.

186
00:10:02,137 --> 00:10:05,217
I just think that this love is so painful.

187
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:08,817
I'm not sure if Daoming Si likes me.

188
00:10:15,497 --> 00:10:17,937
Si's fiancée rants to you every night?

189
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,177
She must have ulterior motives.

190
00:10:22,897 --> 00:10:23,857
No.

191
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:26,017
I think she's really worried.

192
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:29,617
Huaze Lei, talk to Daoming Si.

193
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:34,297
Tell him to treat Xiaozi better
or else she'd rant to me every day.

194
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:39,177
Do you think he'll listen to me?

195
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:41,457
We shouldn't interfere.

196
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:44,537
It's either they get along or they don't.

197
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,097
We can't do anything about it.

198
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:48,297
That's true.

199
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:49,937
-But--
-Stop it.

200
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:53,017
Si can handle his own problems.

201
00:10:54,017 --> 00:10:56,457
I don't intend to know
what happens between them.

202
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:59,497
But Xiaozi tells me about her
and Daoming Si daily.

203
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:00,697
I don't want to know.

204
00:11:01,257 --> 00:11:02,097
Shancai.

205
00:11:02,497 --> 00:11:05,617
Aren't you the last person
who should be involved in this?

206
00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:07,857
In the same way,

207
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:11,177
I also shouldn't suggest
or encourage Si to be nicer to Xiaozi.

208
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:13,177
If I did that,

209
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:15,137
people would think I have
ulterior motives.

210
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:18,377
Do you understand that?

211
00:11:20,657 --> 00:11:22,657
-Huaze Lei--
-Let's go to class.

212
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,577
Si.

213
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:28,497
What?

214
00:11:31,297 --> 00:11:32,817
Didn't I tell you not to come here?

215
00:11:32,897 --> 00:11:34,977
I'm really going to be mad
if you're so unreasonable.

216
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,377
Why can't I come here?
I'm your girlfriend.

217
00:11:40,097 --> 00:11:41,857
Can't you be nicer to me?

218
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:44,617
She doesn't seem like Si's girlfriend.

219
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,257
I think they're having an argument.

220
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:48,937
Let's not stay here.

221
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:50,577
What do you want me to do?

222
00:11:51,617 --> 00:11:52,497
I want you to kiss me.

223
00:11:54,257 --> 00:11:55,297
Kiss me now.

224
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:57,737
What?

225
00:11:58,857 --> 00:11:59,897
Do you still like Shancai?

226
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:03,457
You're always deep in thought
when you're with me.

227
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,617
I'm not sure what you're thinking about.

228
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:08,057
But it's irresponsible
to let your girlfriend...

229
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:10,297
feel insecure.

230
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:21,097
I want proof.

231
00:12:21,737 --> 00:12:24,657
If you don't like Shancai, then kiss me.

232
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:33,657
Close your eyes.

233
00:13:27,577 --> 00:13:29,537
Didn't you want Si to be nicer to Xiaozi?

234
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:31,097
You don't need to be worried now.

235
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:35,137
Why are you so quiet?

236
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:38,577
Do you feel upset?

237
00:13:39,697 --> 00:13:42,097
Upset? Who's upset?

238
00:13:42,897 --> 00:13:45,457
I think this is good.
That's what I hoped would happen.

239
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:47,977
I feel like I'm having

240
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:50,977
vacations for New Year, summer,
and winter all together.

241
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:52,297
No.

242
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:54,497
That's not enough to describe
my excitement.

243
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:57,257
I should say I'm as ecstatic

244
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,017
as when my mom sold a year's worth
of bento boxes in one day.

245
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,497
I'm so happy I'm crying.

246
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:05,857
-Really?
-Why?

247
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:10,097
You blab nonstop whenever someone
guesses what you're thinking.

248
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,377
I don't.

249
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:15,577
Don't act like
you're a psychologist, okay?

250
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,657
It'd be great if you're that focused
in class.

251
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:20,937
Hey.

252
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:22,897
Your bag.

253
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:34,617
You kissed her when she asked you to.
What a happy ending.

254
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:36,697
All right. Great.

255
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:38,217
Don't ever bother me again.

256
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:40,097
Just be with Xiaozi.

257
00:14:40,657 --> 00:14:42,297
I wish you'd be together forever.

258
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:02,377
Hey, Shancai.

259
00:15:03,457 --> 00:15:04,417
What's the matter?

260
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,217
Why is your face all wrinkled?

261
00:15:07,097 --> 00:15:08,017
Is it?

262
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:09,937
What happened?

263
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:13,537
I'm so stupid.

264
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:15,777
I believe anything anyone says.

265
00:15:16,257 --> 00:15:17,937
I'm too self-righteous.

266
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,897
I ended up being played.

267
00:15:20,577 --> 00:15:22,337
How funny.

268
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:24,457
I'm really a fool.

269
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,177
How can you say that?

270
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:28,257
That's because you believe
everyone is nice.

271
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:30,537
After what Li Zhen
and Shunping did to you,

272
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:31,937
you still forgave them.

273
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:33,617
You're that nice.

274
00:15:34,217 --> 00:15:35,057
Is that so?

275
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:37,897
Of course. I like you...

276
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:40,537
because of that.

277
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:42,497
Really?

278
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:45,817
Yes. I like you because of that.

279
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:49,817
It's not too late as long as I find out

280
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:51,977
at the right time.

281
00:15:54,817 --> 00:15:56,817
Hey.

282
00:15:57,377 --> 00:15:58,257
Shancai.

283
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:00,217
I need to get back on my feet.

284
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:03,337
If I think about it,
I'm just going back to being alone.

285
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:05,897
Let bygones be bygones.

286
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,217
You're not alone.

287
00:16:10,297 --> 00:16:11,297
You have me.

288
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:16,897
Qinghe.

289
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:20,817
Thank you.

290
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:23,377
Shancai...

291
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:25,017
It's a good thing you're by my side.

292
00:16:25,577 --> 00:16:27,177
You're like a brother to me.

293
00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:29,137
I'll get going.

294
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:30,097
Bye.

295
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:32,177
Bye.

296
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:34,777
What?

297
00:16:36,137 --> 00:16:38,217
Why am I like her brother?

298
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:43,737
We heard it through the grapevine.

299
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,937
Fang added more yesterday too.

300
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:47,617
Yes, one hundred thousand yuan.

301
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:50,977
And I've decided to add more this time.

302
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:53,737
Absolutely.

303
00:16:54,577 --> 00:16:57,257
Members and employees
get the same information.

304
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:00,137
Trust me.

305
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:02,097
Okay.

306
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,857
It seems Dad's investment consulting
work is going smoothly.

307
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:07,297
I think so.

308
00:17:07,377 --> 00:17:08,897
The investment return is big.

309
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:11,657
So your dad put all our savings into it.

310
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:16,097
-Does it really earn a lot?
-It's a sure win.

311
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:19,297
Many members earned a lot

312
00:17:19,377 --> 00:17:21,177
and asked me to re-invest
their money again.

313
00:17:21,737 --> 00:17:23,057
It's that good?

314
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:34,017
What are you doing?

315
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,417
How are things going between you
and Daoming Si?

316
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:43,697
Nothing's going on.

317
00:17:44,137 --> 00:17:45,497
He already has a girlfriend.

318
00:17:46,697 --> 00:17:48,697
He has a girlfriend? Who?

319
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:52,257
The one who always visits us, Xiaozi.

320
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,497
Xiaozi?

321
00:17:54,937 --> 00:17:56,737
Daoming Si is so strange.

322
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,897
He's dating a girl
that came out of nowhere.

323
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,617
It's so infuriating.

324
00:18:01,017 --> 00:18:01,977
Mom.

325
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:04,257
She came from a well-known family.

326
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:06,537
I'm the one who came out of nowhere.

327
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:09,097
That's not true.

328
00:18:09,777 --> 00:18:11,297
You came from us.

329
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:12,817
Just look at yourself.

330
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:15,097
-That's right.
-Look at your sharp nose.

331
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:16,977
A straight nose and a wide mouth.

332
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:30,417
What a coincidence.

333
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:32,137
Can we have tea together?

334
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:38,177
Are you still mad?

335
00:18:40,217 --> 00:18:41,937
No, I'm not mad anymore.

336
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:43,417
But I'm warning you.

337
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:45,577
Don't judge me again.

338
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:53,977
It's cold. You should wear
something warmer.

339
00:18:55,377 --> 00:18:56,657
Do you still have class later?

340
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:58,657
No. I'm done for the day.

341
00:19:03,937 --> 00:19:05,257
This is for you.

342
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:15,697
What's the matter?

343
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:17,937
Nothing.

344
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:21,257
I just feel that it's so cold outside.

345
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:25,017
But it's warmer to have coffee
with a friend.

346
00:19:27,137 --> 00:19:29,697
It would be better
if we can soak in hot springs.

347
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:31,257
Do you like hot springs?

348
00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:33,137
You've never mentioned that before.

349
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:39,337
Shancai is over there.

350
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:47,497
Let's go.

351
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:48,577
Come on.

352
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:54,537
Shancai, can we join you?

353
00:19:55,097 --> 00:19:56,657
We're not interrupting your date, right?

354
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,377
No, we're not...

355
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,017
This is Huaze Lei.

356
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:01,217
We just met coincidentally.

357
00:20:01,777 --> 00:20:02,897
He's Huaze Lei?

358
00:20:03,617 --> 00:20:04,577
Come here.

359
00:20:06,697 --> 00:20:07,817
Hi.

360
00:20:07,897 --> 00:20:10,057
I'm Si's fiancée.

361
00:20:10,137 --> 00:20:11,577
My name is He Yuanzi.

362
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:12,897
Just call me Xiaozi.

363
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:25,177
This feels so nice.

364
00:20:25,297 --> 00:20:27,537
It's like we're on a double date.

365
00:20:28,657 --> 00:20:30,057
You're talking too much nonsense.

366
00:20:30,857 --> 00:20:32,257
Why are you so angry?

367
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:34,857
Sorry. He's just shy.

368
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:38,577
It's fine. We're used to it.

369
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,857
Earlier, he said he's bored

370
00:20:41,937 --> 00:20:43,017
and wants to go home.

371
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:44,577
I told him we can just go to a hotel.

372
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:46,897
He ran away afterward.

373
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:50,657
I was just teasing him.

374
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:52,817
But we kissed already.

375
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,657
We can go further now.

376
00:20:55,177 --> 00:20:56,097
Monkey.

377
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:58,177
Stop your nonsense.

378
00:20:59,017 --> 00:20:59,977
What's the problem?

379
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:02,337
She likes you so much.

380
00:21:02,457 --> 00:21:03,577
You should be glad.

381
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:06,257
That's right.

382
00:21:06,337 --> 00:21:07,777
Shancai thinks so too.

383
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:13,817
By the way, we have a nice resort hotel
in the mountains.

384
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,177
You don't have class tomorrow.

385
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:16,257
Do you want to go there?

386
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:19,857
No thanks.

387
00:21:20,057 --> 00:21:21,457
You two can go alone.

388
00:21:22,057 --> 00:21:24,377
Huaze Lei, we shouldn't be
third-wheeling here.

389
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:27,657
-Do you have hot springs?
-Yes.

390
00:21:27,737 --> 00:21:29,657
Our hot springs are the best.

391
00:21:29,737 --> 00:21:31,017
I'm going then.

392
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:32,977
All right. It's set then.

393
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:34,457
Let's go now.

394
00:21:49,937 --> 00:21:50,817
Ma'am.

395
00:21:51,057 --> 00:21:52,377
Any new developments?

396
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:57,777
Si and Xiaozi will go to the He Group's
Hot Springs Hotel tonight.

397
00:21:58,537 --> 00:22:00,217
Xiaozi is so smart.

398
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:01,617
She's a fast learner.

399
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,857
But Huaze Lei and Shancai went with them.

400
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:06,177
How did that happen?

401
00:22:06,777 --> 00:22:08,417
They met at a coffee shop.

402
00:22:08,497 --> 00:22:10,257
Then went to the hot springs
hotel together.

403
00:22:10,377 --> 00:22:13,417
Shancai always lingers around them.

404
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:14,697
What is she planning to do?

405
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:19,017
You said Shancai was with Huaze Lei.

406
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:21,137
Then they all went to the hotel, right?

407
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:22,377
Yes.

408
00:22:23,497 --> 00:22:24,857
Maybe she thinks

409
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:29,457
that there's no more hope with Si
so she's now working on Huaze Lei.

410
00:22:30,377 --> 00:22:33,817
She might give up when she sees how good

411
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,817
Si and Xiaozi are doing.

412
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:55,337
Why aren't you eating?

413
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:57,217
This restaurant is really good.

414
00:22:59,857 --> 00:23:00,737
Look.

415
00:23:00,937 --> 00:23:04,257
I think you two really look good together.

416
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:12,497
Si, why are you drinking so much?

417
00:23:13,857 --> 00:23:14,697
Lei.

418
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:17,297
Say something.

419
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:19,737
-What should I say?
-Anything you want.

420
00:23:21,657 --> 00:23:23,097
Can I soak in the hot springs?

421
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:24,657
Of course.

422
00:23:24,857 --> 00:23:26,537
Turn right to go to the pool for men.

423
00:23:34,657 --> 00:23:36,537
Shancai, do you want to go too?

424
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:38,457
They have a lover's pool here.

425
00:23:42,897 --> 00:23:43,737
There's no need.

426
00:23:46,817 --> 00:23:49,897
By the way, the guy you mentioned

427
00:23:50,177 --> 00:23:53,897
that's quiet and looks dull

428
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:55,697
is him, right?

429
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:00,777
Yes.

430
00:24:01,697 --> 00:24:03,377
She likes him a lot.

431
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:06,457
I guessed right.

432
00:24:12,377 --> 00:24:13,297
Si.

433
00:24:13,697 --> 00:24:15,057
Let's soak in the hot springs too.

434
00:24:15,617 --> 00:24:16,457
I'm not going.

435
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,577
Never mind.

436
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:21,777
I'll go with Shancai.

437
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:23,337
Let's go.

438
00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:42,457
It feels so nice.

439
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:51,937
Shancai.

440
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:53,897
What's the matter?

441
00:24:56,777 --> 00:24:57,697
Nothing.

442
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,097
I was just thinking

443
00:24:59,857 --> 00:25:01,497
that your hot spring is great.

444
00:25:02,097 --> 00:25:02,977
Thank you.

445
00:25:03,977 --> 00:25:07,537
I think we're living our dreams now.

446
00:25:08,097 --> 00:25:12,817
Going to a sauna with a close friend,
having a meal and chatting together.

447
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:15,617
I'm so happy now.

448
00:25:19,057 --> 00:25:20,697
I haven't done this for a while either.

449
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:23,257
Shancai.

450
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:26,097
It's so good to know you.

451
00:25:28,657 --> 00:25:32,497
By the way, you have to be
a bridesmaid at our wedding.

452
00:25:35,777 --> 00:25:37,137
Me?

453
00:25:39,097 --> 00:25:40,097
There's no need.

454
00:25:40,297 --> 00:25:41,457
Just enjoy yourselves.

455
00:25:42,097 --> 00:25:43,097
Why not?

456
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:44,577
No. You have to be the bridesmaid.

457
00:25:46,937 --> 00:25:47,977
You know,

458
00:25:49,017 --> 00:25:50,617
when I'm with Si,

459
00:25:51,697 --> 00:25:53,257
I tell myself

460
00:25:53,897 --> 00:25:56,577
that I can't expect him to be
an ordinary boyfriend.

461
00:25:57,737 --> 00:26:00,417
Or else, I'd be so disappointed.

462
00:26:01,537 --> 00:26:03,497
But he's actually quite nice sometimes.

463
00:26:04,017 --> 00:26:06,737
He'd be with me if I ask him to.

464
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:11,217
Shancai.

465
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:13,377
I know I'm annoying.

466
00:26:14,337 --> 00:26:15,657
If you want to run away,

467
00:26:15,737 --> 00:26:17,217
I'll chase after you.

468
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,617
If you run to Mars,

469
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:21,537
I'll go there too.

470
00:26:27,497 --> 00:26:28,977
I can't breathe.

471
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:30,617
I feel so heavy.

472
00:26:31,297 --> 00:26:33,497
I thought I could really
find closure this time

473
00:26:34,057 --> 00:26:35,697
and run away from Daoming Si.

474
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:40,777
But why does it feel
like I'm getting more involved?

475
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:48,817
Shancai.

476
00:26:49,297 --> 00:26:50,537
Shancai, what's the matter?

477
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:00,617
Shancai.

478
00:27:00,697 --> 00:27:02,177
Shancai fainted in the sauna.

479
00:27:57,017 --> 00:27:58,017
I feel so miserable.

480
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:05,417
So miserable.

481
00:28:08,097 --> 00:28:08,937
Drink some water.

482
00:28:10,777 --> 00:28:12,857
I have a bad headache.
What happened to me?

483
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:15,097
You fainted in the sauna.

484
00:28:15,817 --> 00:28:17,897
Get some rest. You'll be fine.

485
00:28:23,897 --> 00:28:25,377
You were the one who brought me here?

486
00:28:28,817 --> 00:28:30,297
You saw everything?

487
00:28:30,497 --> 00:28:31,937
I helped you get dressed, didn't I?

488
00:28:32,857 --> 00:28:34,017
You helped me get dressed...

489
00:28:35,177 --> 00:28:37,017
Then you saw everything
while helping me...

490
00:28:39,457 --> 00:28:41,217
What else can I do?

491
00:28:42,577 --> 00:28:44,337
Can't you ask a girl to help me?

492
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:45,417
Where's Xiaozi?

493
00:28:46,177 --> 00:28:47,977
-I want to talk to her.
-Never mind.

494
00:28:49,537 --> 00:28:51,177
Don't interrupt them.

495
00:28:55,297 --> 00:28:56,417
You're right.

496
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,457
You can stop them if you want.

497
00:29:01,177 --> 00:29:03,137
I can help you break down the door.

498
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:04,897
Why should I stop them?

499
00:29:06,137 --> 00:29:09,537
Because you look like you're going
to cry all the time.

500
00:29:26,737 --> 00:29:28,297
Why did you agree to come here?

501
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,577
You made things so complicated.

502
00:29:34,177 --> 00:29:35,817
Why should we be here?

503
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,457
Since we already saw them,

504
00:29:43,257 --> 00:29:44,937
should we just pretend we didn't?

505
00:29:51,937 --> 00:29:52,817
Si.

506
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:02,417
Si, did you hear me?

507
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:04,857
What is it? You're no noisy.

508
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:17,977
My mom told me to move
to your house next semester.

509
00:30:18,537 --> 00:30:21,057
We can get to know
each other better this way.

510
00:30:34,217 --> 00:30:37,297
It's fine if you want to get
your Master's degree

511
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,337
before we get married.

512
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:42,497
You're just going to follow
your parents' plan?

513
00:30:43,577 --> 00:30:45,777
Don't you feel such a life
would be so boring?

514
00:30:51,337 --> 00:30:52,897
What do you mean?

515
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:56,177
Haven't you already decided to like me?

516
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:04,617
All right.

517
00:31:05,057 --> 00:31:07,257
I won't ask if you don't want to tell me.

518
00:31:09,897 --> 00:31:10,937
But now...

519
00:31:26,737 --> 00:31:27,697
Thank you, Lei.

520
00:31:30,297 --> 00:31:31,337
For what?

521
00:31:32,497 --> 00:31:36,057
Thanks for saving me in the sauna today.

522
00:31:39,137 --> 00:31:40,977
I just finished soaking
in the hot springs.

523
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:43,377
Xiaozi screamed saying that you fainted.

524
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,137
What an impatient person.

525
00:31:47,937 --> 00:31:48,977
And very intense.

526
00:31:50,217 --> 00:31:53,457
In some ways,
she's very similar to Daoming Si.

527
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:56,817
If you think about it,
they're not that similar.

528
00:31:57,617 --> 00:32:00,537
No one can beat Si's personality.

529
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:02,297
You're right.

530
00:32:04,977 --> 00:32:06,057
You finally smiled.

531
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:11,977
What do you mean, "finally"?

532
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,457
You were frowning the whole day.

533
00:32:18,577 --> 00:32:21,297
I've been this way since my first day
in Mingde University.

534
00:32:21,937 --> 00:32:23,137
Not just today.

535
00:32:27,137 --> 00:32:28,337
Is your fighting spirit back?

536
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:29,617
That's good.

537
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,057
That's the Shancai I know.

538
00:32:32,057 --> 00:32:33,697
You were so sad earlier.

539
00:32:34,937 --> 00:32:35,777
Stop it.

540
00:32:36,897 --> 00:32:37,817
Hit me.

541
00:32:38,577 --> 00:32:41,497
Take it out on me
if that would make you happy.

542
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:45,977
Who says I'm not happy?

543
00:32:48,657 --> 00:32:49,617
Don't deny it.

544
00:32:56,577 --> 00:32:58,097
Just like on the rooftop before,

545
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:03,297
Huaze Lei can always calm me down
when I'm most tired and confused.

546
00:33:19,337 --> 00:33:20,177
Daoming Si.

547
00:33:21,217 --> 00:33:22,217
I'm telling you.

548
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,257
Even though I tease you a lot,

549
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:28,817
I'm serious about this.

550
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,137
Don't you feel anything?

551
00:33:34,697 --> 00:33:35,577
No.

552
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:42,137
Is that so?

553
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:44,417
Or do you want me

554
00:33:45,217 --> 00:33:47,097
-to wear see-through stuff?
-Xiaozi.

555
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:50,017
I know! You must not like bathrobes.

556
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:52,137
-Do you like other styles?
-Listen to me.

557
00:33:52,217 --> 00:33:54,457
-I'm not listening!
-Shancai is all I think about.

558
00:33:54,537 --> 00:33:57,257
I told you that I'd try to like you.

559
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:58,737
But I'm really sorry.

560
00:33:58,817 --> 00:34:01,057
-I'm not listening!
-I can't be with you!

561
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,537
What's that sound?

562
00:34:04,617 --> 00:34:06,857
I think it's from Si's room.

563
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:12,377
You think Daoming Si
is forcing himself on her?

564
00:34:13,737 --> 00:34:15,337
I think it's the opposite.

565
00:34:17,777 --> 00:34:19,617
I still want to take a look to be sure.

566
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:25,297
Xiaozi.

567
00:34:38,937 --> 00:34:40,057
Sorry to disturb you.

568
00:35:10,697 --> 00:35:12,497
You saw something you shouldn't have?

569
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:32,857
Do whatever you want.

570
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,817
Beat me up until you're satisfied.

571
00:35:42,457 --> 00:35:43,497
Do you know

572
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:48,937
how much I want to really beat you up?

573
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:53,577
I want to beat you up until you remember
the pain every time you think of me.

574
00:35:55,617 --> 00:35:57,657
Until you can't ever forget me.

575
00:36:01,937 --> 00:36:03,217
But Daoming Si,

576
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:07,897
I couldn't bear to hit you.

577
00:36:17,657 --> 00:36:20,177
I don't feel like myself anymore,
you know?

578
00:36:40,337 --> 00:36:41,337
I'm really sorry.

579
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:13,057
I couldn't sleep.

580
00:37:13,377 --> 00:37:14,977
I was awake the whole night.

581
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:18,257
I had the worst timing.

582
00:37:18,777 --> 00:37:20,737
I shouldn't have seen that.

583
00:37:21,857 --> 00:37:24,137
I didn't want to interfere with them.

584
00:37:25,057 --> 00:37:26,457
I feel so miserable.

585
00:37:39,497 --> 00:37:40,337
Good morning.

586
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:46,377
Good morning.

587
00:37:50,297 --> 00:37:52,897
I'm becoming more and more clumsy
in front of Daoming Si.

588
00:37:53,617 --> 00:37:55,897
Our boisterous fighting days are gone.

589
00:37:56,737 --> 00:37:58,057
It might be

590
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:01,897
because our relationship has changed.

591
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:05,457
I don't feel awkward with Huaze Lei now.

592
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,657
But if it's Daoming Si,

593
00:38:08,697 --> 00:38:11,657
I wouldn't be able to sleep
while holding hands with him.

594
00:38:13,217 --> 00:38:14,417
What's the matter?

595
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:16,457
I'm going home.

596
00:38:16,857 --> 00:38:17,857
Tell Lei.

597
00:38:50,857 --> 00:38:51,897
Xiaozi.

598
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:10,777
I should get going.

599
00:39:15,497 --> 00:39:16,417
Is that so?

600
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:19,137
I want to stay here longer.

601
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:22,137
I'll ask the driver to take you back.

602
00:39:23,137 --> 00:39:24,257
There's no need. Thanks.

603
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:27,057
I met Daoming Si earlier.

604
00:39:27,617 --> 00:39:29,217
He said he was going home.

605
00:39:33,817 --> 00:39:35,497
Oh, yes.

606
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:38,337
Maybe he's feeling shy.

607
00:39:39,137 --> 00:39:40,097
Since...

608
00:39:41,017 --> 00:39:42,417
Last night, we...

609
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:44,897
He might be feeling shy.

610
00:39:47,057 --> 00:39:47,977
I'll get going then.

611
00:39:48,497 --> 00:39:49,377
Thank you.

612
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:59,657
Don't you feel anything?

613
00:40:00,217 --> 00:40:01,057
No.

614
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:07,657
Is that so?

615
00:40:09,057 --> 00:40:10,177
Or do you want me

616
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,737
-to wear see-through stuff?
-Xiaozi.

617
00:40:12,817 --> 00:40:14,137
-I shouldn't be so direct.
-Listen to me.

618
00:40:14,217 --> 00:40:16,457
-I'm not listening!
-Shancai is all I think about.

619
00:40:16,537 --> 00:40:19,257
I told you that I'd try to like you.

620
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:20,737
But I'm really sorry.

621
00:40:20,817 --> 00:40:23,137
-I'm not listening!
-I can't be with you!
