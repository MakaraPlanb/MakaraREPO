00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 17

3
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,720
Shancai, look.

4
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,400
The photos taken in Canada received
a lot of likes after they were shared.

5
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,400
Mine too.

6
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,480
But Qinghe seems a little unhappy.

7
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,080
Really? What did he say? Show me.

8
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,720
"Someone's forgotten this friend."

9
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,280
-I'll reply.
-What will you say?

10
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,200
"You're a pet."

11
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,000
You're just making Qinghe madder.

12
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,080
Ximen.

13
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,760
QQ MESSAGE FROM XIMEN YAN

14
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,280
I miss Canada so much.

15
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,000
Thinking back,
that place was so beautiful.

16
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,560
You little naive girl.

17
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,800
Don't be cheated by Ximen.

18
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,200
I know.

19
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,280
You're more long-winded
than my mom about him.

20
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,920
-Does your foot still hurt?
-No.

21
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,000
It's fine now.

22
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,320
Let's go sit over there.

23
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,720
I'm fine.

24
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,120
Anyway, did you hear about Dabao
organizing a gathering?

25
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,080
Of course.

26
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,120
He invited our circle of friends, right?

27
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,560
Yes. Since graduating from high school,
I haven't seen the rest.

28
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,520
-I can't wait.
-Me too.

29
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,760
I really miss our high school days.

30
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,000
Back then, we only cared about studying
and knew nothing else.

31
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
I miss everyone so much.

32
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,480
Most of them said
that they're going to attend.

33
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,800
Most of them? Who's not coming?

34
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,000
Do you remember when we had
to line up for punishment?

35
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,640
Do you mean Yan Zhibu, "Excuse me,
sir. I need to go to the toilet."

36
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,520
Him? It's okay.
Our other friends will be going.

37
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,080
I haven't seen Yan Zhibu in a while.

38
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,560
-Yan Zhibu?
-Thinking about him makes me laugh.

39
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,840
Yan Zhibu was the clown
in our class, right?

40
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,000
Every time he got into trouble, he'd say,

41
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,040
"I'm fine. I'm good.

42
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,120
-No big deal."
-That's right.

43
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,120
That's the way he is.

44
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,440
I wonder how they look now.

45
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,800
I think

46
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,280
maybe we're the only ones
who became beautiful.

47
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,120
I bet Yan Zhibu is going to bully us
when he sees us.

48
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,800
Yes.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,080
He's probably going to make us play
"One Shot."

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,040
Oh no. I don't want to.

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,160
You won't be able to dodge.

52
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,640
I found the way to win.

53
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm going to use my ultimate move.

54
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,120
You said that just now.

55
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,320
Shut up.

56
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,880
Don't use your ultimate then.

57
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,240
Why should I listen to you?

58
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,520
I lost again.

59
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,200
Because I can estimate my Fury.

60
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,560
Shut up. You're cheating.

61
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,800
I won't use my ultimate
in the next round as a handicap.

62
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,360
You said it yourself.

63
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,520
One more time.

64
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,520
I CALL THE SHOTS

65
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
I'M SLEEPY

66
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,760
Wait.

67
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,000
What?

68
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,760
Jing.

69
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,720
<i>Lei, how are you?</i>

70
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,440
Jing, I'm here too.

71
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,680
Are you coming back?

72
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,120
<i>I won't be going back
to see you guys anytime soon.</i>

73
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,240
It's okay.

74
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,240
Don't worry.
I'm taking good care of everyone.

75
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
Jing.

76
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,400
How is it going with the French guy?

77
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,840
Shancai and I are getting along nicely.

78
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,840
<i>Really? I'm happy for you.</i>

79
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,680
<i>My engagement has been cancelled.</i>

80
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,800
Really?

81
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,920
Does that mean Lei has a chance now?

82
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,080
Let go. You're squishing me.

83
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Say something.

84
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,720
Is it because of your job?

85
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,280
<i>Yes.</i>

86
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,920
<i>I don't want anything to hinder my dream.</i>

87
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,000
<i>I think the press will hear
about the news soon.</i>

88
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,760
<i>So I called to tell you guys first.</i>

89
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,360
All right.

90
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,480
You take care.

91
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,760
<i>I will. You guys take care too.</i>

92
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,720
We're waiting for your return, Jing.

93
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,120
-Bye.
-<i>Bye.</i>

94
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,800
What are you scheming?

95
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,840
Nothing.

96
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,280
Don't lie.

97
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,160
If I win the next round, you'll tell me.

98
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,320
You need to win first.

99
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,560
I can't beat you at the game
but I can win with my brawn.

100
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,880
Okay, let me go.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,840
Well?

102
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,320
If you won't let go,
I'll tell Shancai to ignore you.

103
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,720
Shancai is my girlfriend.

104
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,240
You don't get to decide.

105
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,200
Beg for mercy.
I'll let you go if you call me sir.

106
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,160
In your dreams.

107
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,040
Everyone's here early.

108
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,000
-Hi.
-Hi.

109
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,920
Hi, long time no see.

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,360
-Long time no see.
-Shancai is here.

111
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,560
-Hello.
-Hello.

112
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,760
-You're here.
-Is it you?

113
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,560
Not the real one.

114
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,520
Who are you then?

115
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,480
Your imitation.

116
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,360
Dong Shancai.

117
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,560
Yan Zhibu.

118
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,760
-Long time no see.
-Yes, indeed.

119
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,640
I'm surprised you still remember
our signals from <i>Journey to the West</i>.

120
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,680
Of course I do.

121
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,720
Qinghe and I still play in groups.

122
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,560
We always bring up
the dragon you had before.

123
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,800
That's right.

124
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,840
Zhibu's beast doesn't even have a takedown

125
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,600
but he leveled up to 70.

126
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
You're criticizing me?

127
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,200
You two weren't that good either.

128
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,520
Who was it that didn't receive
double experience?

129
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,920
And came to help the quest
without potions and I had to give mine?

130
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,240
Okay.

131
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,280
Let's not talk about the past.

132
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,200
Yes.

133
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,120
Shancai is more beautiful now.

134
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,400
Don't you start making fun of me.

135
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
I'm not.

136
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,480
So many guys were interested in you
back in high school.

137
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,560
Like who?

138
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,440
-Who?
-So many.

139
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,680
The guys that were punished with you
used to adore you.

140
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,960
Yes!

141
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,320
And me.

142
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,000
And Qinghe.

143
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,880
And them too.

144
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,320
Yes.

145
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,840
That's enough.

146
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,280
Xiaoyou, he's such a riot. Take him down.

147
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,880
Okay.

148
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,800
-You threw it at me?
-Come on.

149
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,320
Come on.

150
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,280
Come get me.

151
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,640
Here.

152
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,200
Yeah.

153
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay.

154
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
I admit defeat, okay?

155
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,880
Are we going to be kicked out like this?

156
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,560
Let's punish Zhibu who started it.

157
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
I'm okay with that.

158
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,120
Qinghe too.

159
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,160
What?

160
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,720
Punished? How?

161
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,480
We'll punish you to do that.

162
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,120
Forget it.

163
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,320
One shot!

164
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,720
One shot!

165
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,280
-One shot!
-Okay. Let's do it.

166
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,640
One shot!

167
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,080
There's no one else. Only Si and the guys.

168
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
You can ask him.

169
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,200
What?

170
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,400
"I, Daosi, is saying
that Ming is really..."

171
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,720
Hello?

172
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,160
I'm Daoming Si. What he said is true.

173
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,360
Hey.

174
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,840
I've been repeating this over and over.

175
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Are we done?

176
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
I've got no choice.

177
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,160
We didn't invite anyone to Canada.

178
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,880
Xinhui and Baihe came along.

179
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,640
Many people are complaining.

180
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,000
It must be those lame girls.

181
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,960
No, Qinghe Chen too.

182
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,640
Qinghe can be categorized
as a lame girl too.

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,640
Qinghe is at a high school reunion.

184
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,880
Xiaoyou shared photos in the group.

185
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,320
Shancai looks so dumb.

186
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,480
Let me see.

187
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,040
See? Such a dumb look.

188
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,200
SHANCAI'S DUMB EXPRESSION

189
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,320
Where is this?

190
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,880
A restaurant on Huashan Road.

191
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,800
I don't know the place.

192
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,240
I'm going there.

193
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,960
Si.

194
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,480
They're having a reunion.
It doesn't concern you.

195
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,720
I don't think it's okay.

196
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,200
Why not?

197
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,560
I think it's perfectly fine.

198
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,800
Yeah, it doesn't sound
like a crazy stalker at all.

199
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,520
Hey, who are you calling a stalker?

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,760
I just happen to be nearby.

201
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,040
Two thousand meters is nearby?

202
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,480
Are you saying you're like
star-crossed lovers?

203
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,400
I'm going to see my girlfriend.

204
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,560
What's wrong with that?

205
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,720
Hopefully, Shancai thinks so too.

206
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,400
Should we follow him?

207
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,280
CUMIN POWDER

208
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh my gosh.

209
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,200
Gosh, Shancai.

210
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,000
Do you think it's salty or sweet?

211
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,680
It's too gross. I'm not playing

212
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,200
-Me neither.
-No.

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's been so long. Nobody gets to escape.

214
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,040
All right.

215
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,200
Everyone, get ready.

216
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,360
Black or White.

217
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,200
Drink.

218
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,160
-Drink.
-Okay.

219
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,280
-Drink.
-I'll do it.

220
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,880
-Drink.
-All right, I will.

221
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,520
I'll go first.

222
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,560
Is Zhibu trying to be a hero?

223
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,040
Everyone needs to drink it.

224
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,440
Yes.

225
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,480
Drink.

226
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,440
Drink!

227
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,080
Drink!

228
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,080
-Drink!
-I'll do it.

229
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,560
Drink!

230
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,480
Are you going to drink this gross thing?

231
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
Is this even wine?

232
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,400
Daoming Si.

233
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,320
What are you doing here?

234
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,400
I came to pick up my girlfriend.
Is there any problem?

235
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,000
-Shancai has a boyfriend?
-Yeah.

236
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,440
-Really?
-I didn't know.

237
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,920
-Since when?
-She's dating?

238
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,000
-Shancai's boyfriend is handsome.
-Is he?

239
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,040
-Who is he?
-Shancai.

240
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,040
You have a boyfriend?

241
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,200
No.

242
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,360
He's my senior in university.

243
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,000
She doesn't recognize you
as her boyfriend.

244
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,560
You better not harass our Shancai.

245
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
He's my buddy, Daoming Si.

246
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,280
We are the F4.

247
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,520
-What's F4?
-F4?

248
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
-What?
-Never heard of it.

249
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,600
It's such a dated name.

250
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,600
Yeah, so ancient.

251
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,240
Like the F4 key on the keyboard?

252
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,280
Yeah.

253
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,520
F4? I've never heard of it.

254
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,000
Why are you causing trouble?

255
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,600
Causing trouble?
I came here just to see you.

256
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,640
I'm fine and well. What is there to see?

257
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,000
You've seen me.

258
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,560
You can leave.

259
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,360
Yeah.

260
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,320
We're having a reunion.

261
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,160
It's none of your business.

262
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,600
Do you want to pay to take part?

263
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,200
You don't have to pay.

264
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,760
Just drink this.

265
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,320
And we can be friends.

266
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,560
Shancai, let's go.

267
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,920
Why should I go?

268
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,800
Hanging out with such lowlifes

269
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,520
at a lousy reunion will make you
like them too.

270
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,280
-Who's a lowlife?
-Yeah.

271
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,480
Then you shouldn't have come.

272
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,200
-What the hell?
-Who are you calling

273
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,800
a lowlife in front of my friends?

274
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,560
-That's right.
-What the hell?

275
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,640
Fine.

276
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,040
I'm a lowlife. I'm no match for you.

277
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,920
Shancai.

278
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,120
Don't.

279
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,840
Everyone's staring.

280
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,640
If you have a problem with our reunion,

281
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,800
we don't welcome you either.

282
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,600
You should leave.

283
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,040
Shancai.

284
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,920
Who exactly is this guy?

285
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,400
He told me to leave.

286
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,480
You're hanging out with these
annoying people, drinking gross drinks,

287
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,520
and flirting so nonchalantly?

288
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,880
Daoming Si, Shaolin Si or whoever.

289
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,320
I won't let you off so easily

290
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,040
if you dare lay a hand on Shancai.

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,120
You can leave.

292
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,320
He hit him.

293
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,160
Oh my god. Is he okay?

294
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,280
Si is too rash.

295
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,600
He just made some progress
and already brandishing his authority.

296
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,880
My instinct tells me Si will be out soon.

297
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,120
Why do you think so?

298
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,440
What if Si is having fun inside?

299
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,360
Why aren't you going in then?

300
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,360
My instinct says it's dangerous inside.

301
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,600
Quick, the hospital is ahead.

302
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,000
-Go to the hospital.
-Is he okay?

303
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,120
-He's bleeding.
-Yes.

304
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,120
Hurry, they're here.

305
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,360
How did this happen?

306
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,480
What's his deal?

307
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,520
Daoming Si.

308
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,600
I've had enough of you.

309
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,880
Please just disappear
from my sight right now.

310
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,880
Why are you angry?

311
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,920
You should thank me for saving you
from those low-life friends.

312
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,440
Otherwise, you'd be stinking by now.

313
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,240
Sure.

314
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,920
They're dirty and smelly.

315
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,360
But they are all my good friends
from high school.

316
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,640
You have no idea how much
I was looking forward to today.

317
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,520
I hate you.

318
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,400
Daoming Si. You've crossed the line.

319
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,000
Shancai, wait for me!

320
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,840
How embarrassing.

321
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,440
How am I going to explain to them?

322
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,880
It's okay. I'll talk to them for you.

323
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,160
They'll understand.

324
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,160
But, you should've told us
about Daoming Si coming.

325
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,240
I had no idea he was going to show up.

326
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,160
I didn't ask him to.

327
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,640
But he really crossed the line this time.

328
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,000
I was really looking forward
to the gathering today.

329
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,400
It's okay.

330
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,560
I'll talk to them. Don't worry.

331
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,640
Here you go.

332
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,080
Eat more.

333
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,400
Time is passing so fast.
It's almost the new year.

334
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,920
It's been a great year.

335
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
See how our Shancai
is growing up beautifully.

336
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,600
I've mastered
the Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles.

337
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,080
And my dear found a good job.

338
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,560
Awesome.

339
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,640
Anyway, shouldn't we buy something
as new year gifts to Daoming Si?

340
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,040
New year gifts?

341
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,040
We're not that close with him.

342
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,520
That can be fixed with more visits.

343
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,120
What do you think we should buy?

344
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,040
What makes you think Daoming Si
will like the things we can afford?

345
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,320
It's the thought that matters.

346
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,640
He will understand.

347
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,080
How about buying a fruit hamper?

348
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
All right.

349
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,240
From now on,

350
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,440
I don't want to hear that name again.

351
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,280
Okay, I won't say it.

352
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,200
Don't be angry. We won't buy anything.

353
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,360
You can.

354
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,720
But we won't buy anything for that jerk.

355
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,600
All done. Keep the wound dry.

356
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,640
-Okay. Thanks.
-You're welcome.

357
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
Thank you.

358
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
Shancai, why are you here?

359
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,520
I don't have a concussion.

360
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,600
The nurse said that I can go home.

361
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,920
I came to see you.

362
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,800
I'm so sorry you got hurt.

363
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Don't worry about it. We're friends.

364
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,280
Don't take it so bad.

365
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,640
But I'm worried about you.

366
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,400
-Did you argue with your boyfriend?
-No.

367
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,960
Besides, he's not my boyfriend.

368
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,880
Anyway, Zhibu.

369
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,520
What did you say to your mom?

370
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,080
I told her I got injured playing football
with friends.

371
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
She believed me.

372
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,320
I'm fine. Don't worry.

373
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,240
Zhibu.

374
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,480
Dad wanted me to settle the bill.

375
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Shancai, this is my brother, Shunping.

376
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,160
Brother?

377
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,400
How come I never heard about him before?

378
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,040
We are stepbrothers.

379
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,080
Our dad divorced his mom
and then married my mom.

380
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
A brother is a brother.

381
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,520
No need to say more.

382
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,280
Shancai.

383
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,880
My brother is really smart.

384
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,400
He's a freshman at Mingde too.

385
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,040
Really?

386
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,680
I'm in Nutrition. How about you?

387
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,600
I'm doing a less popular subject.

388
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm doing Mining.

389
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,040
Unheard of, right?

390
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,640
Okay. I'm done.

391
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,160
-Let's go.
-Okay.

392
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,560
-I brought fruits.
-I'll carry it.

393
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,640
Thanks.

394
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,080
Zhibu, wait for me.

395
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Listen.

396
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,840
This is low risk, high reward.

397
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,320
You'll be rewarded handsomely.

398
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,520
What's the slogan nowadays?

399
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,160
If you don't manage your money,
it will bid goodbye.

400
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,280
If you rather say goodbye to money,

401
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,040
you can say goodbye to me.

402
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,600
The investment rate this year
peaked at 200 percent.

403
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,880
It's the best time to invest.

404
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,000
I will be frank with you.

405
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,240
Even I invested in it.

406
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,680
Let's do it then.

407
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,240
Happy New Year.

408
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,640
I wish you a prosperous one.

409
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,360
Dad, why are you so happy?

410
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,080
I just bagged a huge deal.

411
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,080
With my smooth talking skills,

412
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,680
our family will soon
be at Daoming Si's level

413
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,040
based on company shares.

414
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,680
Dad.

415
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,080
Can you stop mentioning Daoming Si?

416
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,480
Did you two argue again?

417
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,440
He went and started a fight
at my high school reunion.

418
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,080
He ridiculed my friends.

419
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,720
I'll never forgive him.

420
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,720
Okay. Let's not talk about it.

421
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,920
Let's eat. We've got delicious food.

422
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,080
-Have some prawns.
-Wait, let me take a photo.

423
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,200
Hurry and eat.

424
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Look here.

425
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,000
Happy new year.

426
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,720
Have a prosperous year.

427
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,120
-Let's dig in.
-Okay.

428
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,600
I apologize to you
from the bottom of my heart.

429
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,080
Look at that face.

430
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,960
You don't seem sincere at all.
Try imitating Lei's innocent expression.

431
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,600
Yes, that's right.

432
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,640
Now, repeat after Ximen.

433
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,920
My harsh behavior
has brought harm to your gentle soul.

434
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,600
For that, I'm ashamed and sorry.

435
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,200
"My harsh..."

436
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,480
I can't. It's too phony.

437
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,520
Si.

438
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,360
We stayed up late all night
to draft this letter of apology.

439
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,160
Who else would help you if not for us?

440
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,720
He's the one who got on my nerves.

441
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,560
It doesn't matter who started it.

442
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,280
The point is, Shancai is angry.

443
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,760
Just look at him.

444
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,200
If you were Shancai,
would you forgive him?

445
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,480
You mean someone who beat up
my friend without reason?

446
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,720
Yes.

447
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,480
Never in my life.

448
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,760
School is starting soon.

449
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,280
You need to figure out how to make up.

450
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Let's continue.

451
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,520
Hurry up.

452
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,720
"My rash behavior has brought harm
to your gentle soul.

453
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,560
I..."

454
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,680
And then what?

455
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,800
"For that, I'm ashamed and sorry.

456
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,120
I hope the beautiful and merciful you
will be able to forgive my stupidity.

457
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,400
Don't leave me in the dark."

458
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,400
Since you've memorized it,
you can do it then.

459
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
The Nutrition Class is ahead.

460
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,800
Shancai will be there.

461
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,080
Qinghe, come here.

462
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,240
Who did you call?

463
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,840
You, of course. Who else?

464
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,680
I'm still pissed at Daoming Si.

465
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,880
Stay out of it.

466
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,600
Si will settle it with Shancai himself.

467
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,600
I...

468
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,080
Shancai's problem is my problem.

469
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,400
Listen up.

470
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,880
I'm not scared of you.

471
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,480
It's Daoming Si's fault
for making Shancai unhappy

472
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,080
and ruining our gathering.

473
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,720
So...

474
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,560
That guy at the reunion...

475
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,960
You mean Zhibu?

476
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,760
He's recovered.
He beat me in a basketball...

477
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,360
Basketball game.

478
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,960
You must be bad.

479
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,400
Si.

480
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,720
She's here.

481
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
The first sentence is,

482
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,960
"Hello, Shancai."

483
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,280
I know.

484
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,800
Shancai.

485
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,720
Morning, Qinghe. Let's go to class.

486
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm leaving. Bye.

487
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,080
Shancai, Daoming Si got here so early.

488
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,800
Stop right there!

489
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,920
Shancai.

490
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,040
Are you sure it's okay to ignore him?

491
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,200
-I can't be bothered.
-I'm not getting through to you.

492
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,000
I told her to stop and she disobeyed.

493
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,600
She's the rude one.

494
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,280
You guys seemed not to care
about the holiday assignment.

495
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,080
Only three students in the whole class
received above 90 points.

496
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,480
The three are

497
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,880
-Li Zhen.
-Here.

498
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,480
-Dong Shancai.
-Here.

499
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,000
You're amazing.

500
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,280
-And the last one is Li Xinhui.
-Here.

501
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,440
Good.

502
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,400
As for the rest, redo the assignment.

503
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,560
Dismissed.

504
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,640
-No.
-Damn.

505
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
No way.

506
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
Unlucky.

507
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,600
Shancai, Li Zhen, congratulations.

508
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,040
You two improved a lot.

509
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,040
I'm sure you worked hard.

510
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,400
Li Zhen helped me a lot.

511
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,560
No, you worked hard on your own.

512
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,800
My results are still trailing
behind you guys.

513
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Shancai.

514
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,120
Remember to team up with me
for the next assignment.

515
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,160
Stop taking Shancai from me, okay?

516
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,240
Does Shancai belong to you?

517
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,520
How do you do your reports?

518
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,000
You can do it.

519
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,600
All the best.

520
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,600
<i>FOOD NUTRITION</i>

521
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,320
Thanks.

522
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
-Shunping.
-Shancai.

523
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,200
We meet again.

524
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,440
What a coincidence.

525
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,800
Is Zhibu doing well?

526
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,480
Has he fully recovered?

527
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,360
The coach must be worried
after what happened.

528
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,160
My dad is actually was very worried
about Zhibu.

529
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,600
He took the university exam once
and didn't do too well.

530
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,640
He's often out with his low-life friends.

531
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,440
And now he got hospitalized.

532
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,880
I could tell that
he didn't fall and injure himself.

533
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,360
He was beaten.

534
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,640
He must have fought with someone
at the reunion that day.

535
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,480
It wasn't like that.

536
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,920
If Daoming Si hadn't...

537
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,280
acted so rashly,
it wouldn't have happened.

538
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,840
Don't misunderstand your brother.
He's a good guy.

539
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,360
Yes, he's a little naughty sometimes,

540
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,160
but he always took care of us
back in high school.

541
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,960
This is actually the first time
someone defended him.

542
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,200
Hearing you say this,

543
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,080
I might have ignored him in the past.

544
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,960
I'm a terrible brother.

545
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,720
Don't say that.

546
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,120
You're nice too.

547
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,720
You went to visit him
at the hospital, right?

548
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,320
Shancai.

549
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,640
You're so nice.

550
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,160
Can I be friends with you?

551
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,760
Of course.

552
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,440
Zhibu's brother is my brother too.

553
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,680
Si. How long will you stand here?

554
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,320
I wouldn't forgive you if I were Shancai.

555
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,320
I've already apologized.
What else does she want?

556
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,000
Please, Si.

557
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,320
"Stop right there."

558
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,000
Is that an apology?

559
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,280
It's considered one in his vocabulary.

560
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,280
Since you refuse to apologize,

561
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,200
why not visit the guy you beat up?

562
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,600
Maybe that will appease Shancai.

563
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,360
Yes.

564
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,920
You beat him up real good.

565
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,680
You should at least apologize.

566
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,680
You guys are annoying.

567
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,920
My brother actually
played basketball a few days ago.

568
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,000
I think it was with that Qinghe guy
from your class.

569
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,800
He supposedly wanted to beat him
while he's injured.

570
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,120
-And?
-But he failed.

571
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,400
That Qinghe lost pretty badly.

572
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,040
That sounds just like Qinghe.

573
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,280
Are you done?

574
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,040
Are you guys my friends or Shancai's?

575
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,800
-Isn't that Daoming Si?
-We're helping you

576
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,960
because we're your friends.

577
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
Why are we hiding?

578
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,160
Because I don't want to see him.

579
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,240
What?

580
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,800
I want to hear what they're saying.

581
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,680
If you don't yield,

582
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,960
Shancai is the type that will
ignore you forever.

583
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,480
Ignore me then.

584
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,720
What's the big deal?

585
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,080
A bad-tempered tomboy like her

586
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,240
with short and stubby legs
like a frog can stay away.

587
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,440
I have nothing to lose.

588
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,960
They aren't talking about you, right?

589
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,080
You're right.

590
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
She lacks femininity.

591
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,000
She's clumsy and stubborn too.

592
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,800
We never saw her as a girl.

593
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,320
I agree.

594
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,760
But she's exactly the fierce woman
that you like.

595
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,840
Me? Like her?

596
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,920
Yeah right.

597
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,040
She's the one who's always staring at me
with those beady cow eyes,

598
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,760
begging me to be with her.

599
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,560
Do I look like a cow?

600
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,680
No.

601
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,160
She should be grateful
that I accepted her flaws

602
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,640
and her nagging.

603
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,640
I don't want a water buffalo.

604
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,440
You and Ms. Zhuang said the same thing.

605
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,920
She called her a water buffalo too.

606
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,080
Yes. Every time she got angry,

607
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,520
her eyes would get really huge.

608
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,240
She would huff and puff.

609
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Just like a beady-eyed frog.

610
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,360
Just like this, right?

611
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,800
You can imitate Shancai so well.

612
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,760
They're making fun of you.

613
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,080
I'll show them.

614
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,040
Daoming Si, you bastard. Retard!

615
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,640
Get going.

616
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,280
Did you hear someone calling Si?

617
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,600
I thought I imagined it.

618
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,640
I heard "retard" too.

619
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,840
Who dare criticize me? Show yourself!

620
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,480
Are you okay?

621
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,320
We ran far away from them.
I don't think they'll find us.

622
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,200
You almost gave me a heart attack.

623
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,600
I was surprised that I said that myself.

624
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,800
Why did I suddenly lose control?

625
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,600
Thankfully, we got away.

626
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,080
It felt good though

627
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,400
thinking back on it.

628
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,640
I think so too.

629
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,480
I feel like I vented my anger.

630
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,200
It's a rare chance.

631
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,480
The timing, place and people had to align.

632
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,560
You know what?

633
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,440
I wish I had known you
as soon as I joined Mingde.

634
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,640
I think I'd enjoy those days more.

635
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,440
Actually, I heard about you
and what happened.

636
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,120
I've met you before too.

637
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,920
Really?

638
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,440
I saw you when you delivered
an order to our house.

639
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,800
I think you looked
really nice on the bike.

640
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,240
Your hair was billowing.

641
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,400
Just like a leading actress in a movie.

642
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,680
After that, I ordered
from your shop a lot.

643
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,560
It wasn't always you who delivered.

644
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,080
But the food is really good.

645
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,960
I didn't expect

646
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,280
you would win the special award
at the cooking competition.

647
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,760
I guess it's harder to order
for delivery now.

648
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,040
Next time, you can come to my house
and I'll cook for you.

649
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,600
When I was in high school,
your brother, me,

650
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,680
Qinghe and the rest
often ate the corn from this shop.

651
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,600
Really?

652
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,320
But after we entered university,

653
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,440
we became occupied with our own things.

654
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,640
It was hard to meet up.

655
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,880
That's why I really anticipated
the gathering that time.

656
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,000
If you are free and want to hang out

657
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,720
or if you crave for corn, you can call me.

658
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,720
We study at the same place anyway.

659
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,000
We can call Zhibu too.

660
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,920
What?

661
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,440
Do you want a bite of my corn?

662
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,440
Okay, here you go.

663
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,320
Hey, that's a big bite! Give it back!

664
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,280
Give it back.

665
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
There's only one now.

666
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,440
You can have it.

667
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,560
Okay.

668
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,160
So now we're considered

669
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,680
bosom buddies, yes?

670
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,440
Bosom buddies?

671
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,360
Hello, you're a guy, okay?

672
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,520
You can call me your buddy then.

673
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,480
Next time you run into Daoming Si,
you won't have to hide.

674
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,600
I'll protect you.

675
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,000
-Who is this?
-It's none of your business.

676
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,600
The one who called me a retard
was you, right?

677
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,440
I was standing up for my girlfriend.
What's the problem?

678
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,720
Shunping, what did you say?

679
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,160
Shancai, have you lost your mind?

680
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,520
Why are you flirting
with such a pathetic guy?

681
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,960
Why do you care who I'm flirting with?

682
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,520
In your mind,
everyone apart from yourself is pathetic.

683
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,680
Why? Are you jealous?

684
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,680
Do you feel uneasy every time
Shancai is out of sight?

685
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,440
You lash out when things
don't go your way.

686
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,400
Are you still a suckling child
that can't live without Shancai?

687
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,040
It's too bad.

688
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,120
You have no idea what Shancai likes.

689
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,920
She enjoys eating corn with me

690
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,040
more than being with you.

691
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,160
Say it again.

692
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,800
Stop it, Daoming Si.

693
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,520
What? Why should I shut up?

694
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,040
Shancai.

695
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,480
You need to be clear with him.

696
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,200
If you don't reject him,
he'll pester you forever.

697
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,240
One more word...

698
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Daoming Si, stop! Let him go.

699
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,560
Let go.

700
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,480
-Are you okay, Shunping?
-I'm fine.

701
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,240
Daoming Si.

702
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,640
Why must you always be this way?

703
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,920
I feel suffocated.

704
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,160
Please just let me go, okay?

705
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,840
Shancai.

706
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,280
Let's go.

707
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,240
Get away from him.

708
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,640
Do you want some corn?

709
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,280
You can have it.

710
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,520
Dong Shancai!

711
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,320
I like you.

712
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,080
I don't know why.

713
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,880
Even I'm surprised by how much I like you.

714
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,960
No matter where I go,
you're the only person that I see.

715
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,440
Damn, you're annoying.

716
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,080
Just like a buzzing fly.

717
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,480
Shancai.

718
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,400
I know I'm annoying.

719
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,320
If you want to run away,
I'll chase after you.

720
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,640
If you run to Mars,

721
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,560
I'll go there too.

722
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,920
Let's go. He's crazy.

723
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,440
<i>History repeats itself.</i>

724
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,840
Si had a long face
and left without a word.

725
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,600
Lei, you're here.

726
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,800
I saw Si in the hallway but he ignored me.

727
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,520
I think his failed apology
affected him badly.

728
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,840
If we could transfer dating know-how
through our blood,

729
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,600
I'm willing to transfuse mine to him.

730
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,280
I'm even willing to donate my bone marrow,
brain cells and heart.

731
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,160
If so, you guys should look for Shancai
and persuade her.

732
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,520
-No thanks.
-You wanted to donate blood, right?

733
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,040
You know what?

734
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,080
There are two phrases in this world
that you need to say yourself.

735
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,320
"I love you" and "I'm sorry."

736
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,360
Exactly.

737
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,360
Let's check the cafeteria later.

738
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,600
Shunping?

739
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,520
Shancai.

740
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,960
I was looking for you.

741
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,720
How's your injury?

742
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,040
It's just a little bruise. I'm okay.

743
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,760
Who's he?

744
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,680
Zhibu's younger brother.

745
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,760
He's studying Mining.

746
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,520
Zhibu has a brother?

747
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,720
I never knew that.

748
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,200
I know you.

749
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,360
You lost to my brother at basketball.

750
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,680
He said you should train
for another ten years.

751
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,280
Is that what he said about me?

752
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,560
Tell him I want to challenge him again.

753
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,640
Okay.

754
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,680
Shunping, why did you want to see me?

755
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,680
Let's talk elsewhere.

756
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,520
Where are you going?

757
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,680
Shancai.

758
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,480
Sorry.

759
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,640
Why are you saying sorry?

760
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,720
I said you were my girlfriend yesterday.

761
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,200
I wanted to piss Daoming Si off.

762
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,920
I was too harsh.

763
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,200
I hope it's okay.

764
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,520
Of course.

765
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,560
I know you just wanted to help me.

766
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,920
I'm glad you don't mind.

767
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,760
Shancai, since we're bosom buddies,

768
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,120
I want to be honest with you.

769
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,120
I think

770
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,360
you should stop seeing Daoming Si.

771
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,240
He's not a good guy.

772
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,200
To be honest, sometimes I think he's nice.

773
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,480
Sometimes he's crazy.

774
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,440
To me, he's too extreme.

775
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,680
I feel like I'm on a tightrope
when I'm with him.

776
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,520
I hope you aren't offended.

777
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,240
I'm not.

778
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,680
It's because you care.

779
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,760
I have some friends
who knew Daoming Si from before.

780
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,600
They want to talk to you.

781
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,600
Will you see them?

782
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,880
To talk about what?

783
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,720
They'll be here soon.

784
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,240
Let's talk when they get here.

785
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,000
Shancai.

786
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,600
I'm thirsty. I'll get some drinks.
What do you want?

787
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,760
Juice.

788
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,280
I can go with you.

789
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,280
It's okay. I'll be right back.

790
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,040
Shancai.

791
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,160
Shancai!
