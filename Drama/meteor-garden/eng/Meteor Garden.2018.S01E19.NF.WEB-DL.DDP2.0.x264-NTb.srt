TALENT'S TEA SHOP

4
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,320
Daoming Si is going
to introduce you to his mom.

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,600
It feels like you're going to be
married soon.

6
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,760
What are you talking about?

7
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,400
I'm not even his girlfriend.

8
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,800
Why not?

9
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,200
Daoming Si even risked his life for you.

10
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,560
You also got hurt trying to protect him.

11
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,720
You have a very close relationship.

12
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,360
It makes sense to talk about marriage.

13
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,800
Shancai.

14
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,800
You're finally going to become
part of an elite family.

15
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,320
Come on.

16
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,600
My problem is what gift
I'm giving to Daoming Si, okay?

17
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,960
Speaking of gifts.

18
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,760
I really want to lend you some money.

19
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,640
But I'm also a bit tight
with money right now.

20
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,320
Earlier this month,
I bought some clothes on sale.

21
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,880
I'm really broke right now.

22
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,960
Then what should I do?

23
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,400
It would be embarrassing
to show up empty-handed.

24
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,760
Wait a minute.

25
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,160
Didn't you win the special prize

26
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,920
at the Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition?

27
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,280
Any dish you cook must be valuable.

28
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,920
They have famous chefs working for them.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,480
How can they eat the dishes I make?

30
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,400
It's the thought that counts.

31
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,080
You can also make some dessert.

32
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,520
As long as you're the one who made it,
I'm sure he'll like it.

33
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,360
Dessert...

34
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,960
Sorry to keep you waiting.

35
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,040
It's fine. We also just arrived.

36
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,960
Why are you so formally dressed?

37
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,240
We're not too formally dressed.

38
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,720
You're the one that is...

39
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
too underdressed.

40
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,000
This is my nicest dress.

41
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,640
It doesn't matter.

42
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,640
Lei already expected this. Let's go.

43
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,560
Wait.

44
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,960
Tell me.

45
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,720
Why should I wear something nice?

46
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,960
Is there any special meaning
to this birthday party?

47
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,040
Si's birthday party is a very important
occasion in the Daoming family.

48
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,720
How important is it?

49
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,120
Politicians and people of stature
will try to get along

50
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,800
and benefit from the Daoming Group.

51
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,480
Actually, the focus of Si's birthday party
is not about Si himself, but his mom...

52
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,200
Who's the real power
behind the Daoming Group.

53
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,640
Daoming Si's mom?

54
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,000
But what does that have to do
with whether I dress formally or not?

55
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,760
Si's mom is a very scary woman.

56
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,320
She's hard to deal with,

57
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,480
especially in scrutinizing young girls.

58
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,000
As Si's the only successor
of the Daoming Group

59
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,080
and he has brought a girl home...

60
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,520
Your future together...

61
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
Future?

62
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,200
We're referring to your married life.

63
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,120
Shancai, you're the first girl
Si ever brought home.

64
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,080
His mom would scrutinize you
as his fiancée.

65
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,160
Fiancée?

66
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,160
All right. Stop struggling. Let's go.

67
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,680
No. I'm not going anymore.

68
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,840
I'm not going anymore. Let go of me.

69
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,760
Shancai, just wear this one.

70
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,760
It suits you.

71
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,600
It doesn't suit Shancai's age.

72
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,920
It's too extravagant.

73
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,920
How about this one?

74
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,440
It doesn't go with Shancai's dress.

75
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
No.

76
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Wait.

77
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,160
I...

78
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,040
Can I not wear any of them?

79
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,160
I don't think I can pull it off
with my background.

80
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,800
Have more confidence.

81
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,240
You're the special prize winner of the
Chinese Cuisine Culinary Competition.

82
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,800
But we're just attending
Daoming Si's birthday party.

83
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,520
Do we need to be so formal?

84
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,040
Shancai.

85
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,160
Having similar social and economic status
still matters to some people.

86
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,160
Regardless if it's their family background
or ethics,

87
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,840
there isn't a very big difference.

88
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
Si's mom

89
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,280
is especially strict in this area.

90
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,400
Similar social and economic status?

91
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,080
Even though it sounds very traditional,
Si's family still holds this concept.

92
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,040
So just pretend to be
from a well-known family today

93
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,760
for Si's sake.

94
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,120
Please.

95
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,240
This one suits you.

96
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,680
<i>This is Daoming Si's birthday party?</i>

97
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,600
<i>It's just like what I see in the movies.</i>

98
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,920
<i>It's a completely different world
from how I live.</i>

99
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,840
<i>Looking at the other guests,
I really don't belong here.</i>

100
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,640
Excuse me.

101
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,160
Why are you so late?

102
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,600
Because...

103
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,440
You look so elegant today.

104
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,600
Ximen, Meizuo, and Lei
helped me dress up this way.

105
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
It's quite nice.

106
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,880
You look like you're from
a well-known family today.

107
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,360
I'm a fake.

108
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,920
A fake?

109
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,360
Never mind.

110
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,080
It's nothing.

111
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,760
Sorry. Excuse me.

112
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,320
Mr. Daoming Si, on behalf of our company,

113
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,040
I'd like to give you
this 1907 Heidsieck champagne

114
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,360
as your birthday gift.

115
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Happy Birthday, Mr. Daoming Si.

116
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,400
Thank you to you and your family.

117
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,400
You're so thoughtful.

118
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,200
The Shipwrecked 1907 Heidsieck?

119
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,120
That's incredible.

120
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,360
What's so special about that champagne?

121
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,040
That champagne was taken
from a shipwreck in 1907.

122
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,880
Because of its long history,

123
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,440
it's one of the world's
most difficult wines to find.

124
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,800
Isn't it a shame

125
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,080
if you drink such a special wine?

126
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,600
This wine is not for drinking.

127
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,640
Isn't this a gift
for Daoming Si's birthday?

128
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Yes, it is.

129
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,360
But these gifts would be sold
to charity auctions.

130
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,960
All the proceeds will also be donated.

131
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,240
That means that this rare champagne

132
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,360
and other kinds of rare gifts
would all not go to Si.

133
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,440
He's just putting on an act
for receiving them.

134
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,720
I never thought Daoming Si
would have such a big heart.

135
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,160
This way, please.

136
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,480
<i>No.</i>

137
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,200
<i>The gifts from normal people
won't be auctioned.</i>

138
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,560
Mr. Daoming Si.

139
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,640
Hi.

140
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,840
This is the nine heavenly eyes necklace

141
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,680
that my mother used
to pray for you in Bhutan.

142
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,080
It symbolizes nobleness and good fortune.

143
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,840
This is our gift
for your birthday this year.

144
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,840
Thank you very much.
That's very kind of you.

145
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
-This way, please.
-Okay.

146
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,760
Bye.

147
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,040
This heavenly necklace is not only rare,
it's very precious too.

148
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,200
It would surely get a good price
in the auction.

149
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,320
He put a lot of thought
into that precious gift.

150
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,840
He must have a close relationship
with the Daoming family.

151
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,640
They've been working closely
with the Daoming Group for the past year.

152
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,320
What are you thinking about?

153
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Where's my gift?

154
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,960
-I forgot to bring it.
-You forgot?

155
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,720
How could anyone attend a birthday party
and forget the gift?

156
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Just continue playing dumb.

157
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,480
Come on. Follow me.

158
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,600
-Where are we going?
-To introduce you to my mom.

159
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
There's no need for that.

160
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,200
I'll just blend in with the crowd. I'll...

161
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,720
She won't be able to see me.

162
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,720
It's fine.

163
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,040
Why are you so nervous?

164
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,120
I'm not introducing you as my girlfriend.

165
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,800
There's no need for that either.

166
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,840
Just follow me.

167
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,160
No. I'm not going.

168
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,400
I'm not going!

169
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,760
<i>My goodness.</i>

170
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,560
<i>Her eyes are so scary.</i>

171
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,280
<i>Why can't I move?</i>

172
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,320
Miss, who are you?

173
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,720
Sorry. I...

174
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,240
Stand up.

175
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,760
Si.

176
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,040
Is she your friend?

177
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,640
Yes.

178
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,760
Then please escort her out.

179
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,560
Did you hear what I said?

180
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,800
I heard you.

181
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,360
But sorry, I can't do that.

182
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,600
What did you say?

183
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,240
I want to take this opportunity
to formally introduce you

184
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
to someone who's very important to me.

185
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,840
Her name is Dong Shancai.

186
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,360
She's the girl that I like.

187
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,640
I hope you can also accept her.

188
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,120
<i>Daoming Si, are you crazy?</i>

189
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,560
<i>Have you ever considered my position?</i>

190
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,360
Do you realize what you just said?

191
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,880
I do.

192
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,040
You do?

193
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,400
Mrs. Daoming.

194
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,280
This girl is a student
from Mingde University.

195
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,480
She's close with us.

196
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,000
That's right.
It's not what you think at all.

197
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,200
I didn't ask you.

198
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,720
Shut up.

199
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,400
Dong Shancai.

200
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,280
Yes.

201
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,560
Based on what I know,

202
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,040
there's not a lot of people with
the surname Dong in the business world.

203
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,280
I want to ask you

204
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,240
what business is your father in?

205
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,800
My father is...

206
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,400
The President of Huangpu Chamber
of Commerce's Overseas Division.

207
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,720
He's mainly responsible for the business
in North Africa and UAE.

208
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,040
It's understandable
that you don't know him.

209
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,440
That's right. The companies he's handling
would be publicly listed soon.

210
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,000
<i>Why are they telling a lie?</i>

211
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,000
<i>That lie could immediately fall apart.</i>

212
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,080
A girl who comes from this kind of family
must have a lot of skills,

213
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,560
such as playing musical instruments.

214
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Of course.

215
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,840
Shancai can play the piano or violin.

216
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,120
Then please play a song
for our charity auction tonight.

217
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,800
We can also treat it as an auction item.
What do you all think?

218
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,560
Mrs. Daoming.

219
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,400
Shancai is very busy with school lately.

220
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,040
She didn't have time to practice.

221
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,120
How about letting her play next time?

222
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,560
That's right. If you want to hear a song,
Lei can play it for you.

223
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,200
Social etiquette and skills

224
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,360
are basic requirements
for someone from such a family.

225
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
Shancai.

226
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,960
Please go ahead.

227
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,040
Si.

228
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,480
Take her away. She must be terrified.

229
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,880
Humans.

230
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,200
When you put more importance
in the clothes they wear

231
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,520
than the wisdom they possess,

232
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,840
when you put more importance
to the expensive jewelry they wear

233
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,080
than their righteousness, kindness,

234
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,560
and bravery...

235
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,160
When you're easily fooled

236
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,560
by illusory comparisons

237
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,200
and couldn't see the pure heart

238
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,440
that's burning and beating
right in front of you,

239
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,440
you lost the right to have
real human emotions.

240
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,800
Excuse me.

241
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,560
What were you saying earlier?

242
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,120
Tagore once said,

243
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,240
"Set the bird’s wings with gold

244
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,280
and birds won’t fly over."

245
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,080
A person's value

246
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,080
is not decided by
his social class and status."

247
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,160
I don't come from a well-known family.

248
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,160
I can only play this song.

249
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
But so what?

250
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,200
My heart is open and honest.

251
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,200
Si.

252
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,480
Your friend's upbringing
is very interesting.

253
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,360
I'd surely find time to visit
that President father of hers.

254
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,640
I really don't care whose daughter she is.

255
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,160
But you're our family's only son.

256
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,920
Do you think you're a match
for such an ill-mannered girl?

257
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,280
I like her.

258
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,040
Aside from her,
I wouldn't accept any other girl.

259
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,200
I like her. What can you do?

260
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,960
It's not up to you.

261
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,960
Mrs. Daoming.

262
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,000
Please stop.

263
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,840
-Daoming Si and I--
-Since that's the case,

264
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,320
I'll leave with her.

265
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,480
If you dare to walk out this door,
be prepared for the consequences.

266
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,320
Si.

267
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Thanks.

268
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,320
<i>Am I dreaming?</i>

269
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,280
<i>Because of me,
Daoming Si disobeyed his mom</i>

270
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,760
<i>and messed up such an important party.</i>

271
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,040
Put on your seatbelt.
I had a hard time taking you out of there.

272
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,800
I don't want anything to happen to you.

273
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,800
Where are we?

274
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,640
This is one of the clubhouses
our family owns.

275
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,280
The last time my mom came here
she wanted to renovate it.

276
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,400
I guess the renovation hasn't started yet.

277
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,720
Do you know M Hotel?

278
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,280
Yes.

279
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,600
That international chain hotel
with the shape of maple leaf as its logo.

280
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,400
Even though I haven't stayed there before,
I always see it on TV.

281
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,720
That's also my family's business.

282
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,720
My mom has always been
the one handling that.

283
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,520
<i>I couldn't imagine
how a family can be so incredible.</i>

284
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,920
Daoming Si.

285
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,560
Sorry.

286
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,800
I messed up such an important party.

287
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,760
And started a fight
between you and your mom.

288
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,240
It's fine.

289
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,560
I'm not close with my mom anyway.

290
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,960
To her, maybe work
is more important than me.

291
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,080
That's why I don't have
any memory of being with her.

292
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
Don't mind what happened.

293
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,600
I'll make the decisions for my life.

294
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,880
Why are you talking about your life to me?

295
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,200
Nonsense.

296
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,280
My life is you.

297
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,200
The night is so beautiful.

298
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,040
I remember when I was young,

299
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,480
I thought I could get a star
if I can get close to the sky.

300
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,760
My dad would always carry me
on his shoulders

301
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,040
to get me closer to the sky.

302
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,720
My heart is not at ease.

303
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,360
I'll probably have nightmares
from what happened tonight.

304
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,080
Can you even fall asleep?

305
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,200
I wouldn't even dare
to turn off the lights.

306
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,800
I'm afraid that I'll hear a gunshot
outside the window to punish me

307
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,360
for helping Si and Shancai.

308
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,840
Lei.

309
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,800
When did Shancai learn
how to play the piano?

310
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,000
Why didn't we know about it?

311
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,920
We were so nervous earlier.

312
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,680
I only taught her once.

313
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,680
I'm not sure when she practiced
by herself.

314
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,360
But so what if she was able
to play the piano?

315
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,400
It still turned out that way today.

316
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,720
Do you still remember meeting Si's mom

317
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,920
in his house when we were
high school seniors?

318
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,880
You played so badly today.

319
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,200
-I'm so much better than you, okay?
-I'm way better, okay?

320
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,120
Whose idea was it
to cut class and go ice skating?

321
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,200
If you dare to cut classes,
then don't let me find out.

322
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,440
Sorry, Mrs. Daoming.

323
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,120
We won't do it again.

324
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,960
Si.

325
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,400
If you hang around with such people,
then your life would be hopeless!

326
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,160
I also don't feel good now.

327
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,800
At that time, we only cut class
and went ice skating

328
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,920
and we were scolded that way.

329
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,680
With what happened today,

330
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,600
I'm not sure if Si's mom
will make Shancai...

331
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,400
Shancai even dared

332
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,200
to have a direct confrontation with her.

333
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,600
I hope she can take it.

334
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,280
I wonder how they're doing now.

335
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,000
Have you touched the star yet?

336
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,520
Go a little higher and get me closer.

337
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,320
You're so heavy.

338
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,280
Honestly,

339
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,600
did you think about it carefully or not?

340
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,600
Think about what?

341
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,480
Your feelings for me.

342
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,080
I...

343
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,600
Actually, I'm not sure.

344
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,520
When will you learn
to be honest with yourself?

345
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,320
Daoming Si.

346
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,720
Let me ask you a question first.

347
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,040
I'm the one who was asking you a question.

348
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,560
And what kind of lousy answer was that?

349
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,280
How was that a lousy answer?

350
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,720
I told you how I really feel.

351
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,560
All right. Ask your question.

352
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,480
Look at me.

353
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,280
My looks are mediocre.

354
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,800
My skills are mediocre.

355
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,000
My family background is mediocre.

356
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,800
There are so many girls
in Mingde University.

357
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,720
Why me?

358
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,760
Maybe I'm really blind.

359
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,960
I suddenly realized

360
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,120
I brought something we can eat.

361
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,000
What's that?

362
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,880
Nothing.

363
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It's nothing important.

364
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,160
Don't snatch it away.

365
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,240
Give it back to me.

366
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,200
Give it back!

367
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,760
Give it back.

368
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,040
What exactly is this?

369
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,160
It's your birthday gift.

370
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,840
My birthday gift?
Didn't you say you forgot to bring it?

371
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,000
After seeing what others gave you,

372
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
I looked at my lousy gift.

373
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,480
How can I give it to you?

374
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,360
These are the cookies I baked
based on the way you look.

375
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,040
This is you when you're smiling.

376
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,560
This is you when you're mad.

377
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,560
This is you when you're sleeping.

378
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,520
This is you when you're being dumb.

379
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,320
I was in such a hurry.

380
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,320
So I wasn't able to do it well.

381
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,200
Never mind.

382
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,240
Give it back to me if you don't want it.

383
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,600
You're so bad.

384
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,160
I'm sorry.

385
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,120
I'll prepare a better gift for you
next time, okay?

386
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,920
Why didn't you give it to me earlier?

387
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,480
If you did, I would have been
so happy the whole night.

388
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,240
This is the best gift
I've ever received in my entire life.

389
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,160
It's 6:00 a.m. Why is she not home yet?

390
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,600
Haven't I told you already?

391
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,800
If you're worried, just give her a call.

392
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,160
Why would I call her?

393
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,360
She's celebrating Daoming Si's
birthday with him.

394
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,920
It would ruin the mood if I call her.

395
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,320
So what should we do?

396
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,560
My darling daughter.

397
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,760
You're finally home.

398
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,320
-Come on. Give that to me.
-How was it?

399
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,880
We left the party early.

400
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,960
Daoming Si and I ran out.

401
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,520
You ran out?

402
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,920
We went to see the night view
and ate biscuits.

403
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,720
That's so romantic.

404
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,680
-What else?
-Yes. What happened next?

405
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,280
Tell us.

406
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,080
Hurry.

407
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,840
That's it.

408
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,520
What does "that's it" mean?

409
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,760
She said that's it, then that's it.

410
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,800
Look how happy she looks.

411
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,000
"That's it"?

412
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,400
What is it?

413
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,760
"That's it."

414
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,920
Lei, wake up! Lei!

415
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,320
Come on. Wake up. Hurry.

416
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,560
I want to show you something.

417
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,520
Do you know what this is?

418
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,440
This is the birthday gift Shancai gave me.

419
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,120
This is me.
The utterly handsome Daoming Si.

420
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,640
Look. Doesn't it look so similar to me?

421
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,000
Doesn't it?

422
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,440
Huaze Lei. What are you doing?

423
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,120
Spit it out. Hurry!

424
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,040
Spit it out!

425
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,080
Huaze Lei.

426
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,480
She gave them to me.
I haven't even tasted them yet!

427
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,800
Mrs. Daoming, I've already
investigated everything.

428
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,280
Dong Shancai is not the daughter
of some company president.

429
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,240
Her father used to be a logistics director
for a small business.

430
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,920
He now works at Great Earnings
Investment Consulting Corporation

431
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,480
as a telemarketer.

432
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,400
Her mom manages
Dong's Private Kitchen online.

433
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,320
It's a home chef delivery business.

434
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,680
And Dong Shancai is a freshman
at Mingde University taking up Nutrition.

435
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,440
She once attacked Mr. Bobbit,

436
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,440
a guest speaker at the school's
opening ceremony, for no apparent reason.

437
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,520
And her grades are mediocre.

438
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,200
She doesn't have any special talents.

439
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,960
Furthermore, I've confirmed with Mr. Liu

440
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,520
that Si's previous mishaps
and even the time he was hospitalized

441
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,360
were all related to her.

442
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,320
And Si recommended her

443
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,880
on behalf of the Daoming family

444
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,320
to join the Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition.

445
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,040
She got the special prize.

446
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,920
She knows how to use
the Daoming family name

447
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,840
to show her status.

448
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,120
She's smart. She has her ways.

449
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,080
DONG SHANCAI

450
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,200
But if she thinks that she can totally
transform herself

451
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,160
into an exceptional girl using her tricks,

452
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,960
then she's got to be kidding me.

453
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,440
Dumplings again?

454
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,280
Fine.

455
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,320
Who is it? It's just nine in the morning.

456
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,960
Are they here to check the water meters?

457
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,560
Why would they check the meters?
They just did that.

458
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,800
Is this where Dong Shancai lives?

459
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,200
Yes.

460
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,160
Shancai, wake up.

461
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,480
What are you doing?

462
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,280
Daoming Si's mom is here.

463
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,200
Daoming Si's mom?

464
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,680
Yes. She's in the living room.

465
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,960
Mrs. Daoming.

466
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,560
Shancai is so exceptional.
She hasn't even graduated from college,

467
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,120
yet she joined a Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition

468
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,640
and won the special prize.

469
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,840
They said that this prize
is the first of its kind.

470
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,080
Mrs. Daoming, let me tell you.

471
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,160
I discovered an especially good financial
investment project just recently.

472
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,040
The interests are high
and the risk is low.

473
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,520
You're also a businesswoman.

474
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,080
Let's do it together.

475
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,760
I'll just take five percent commission.

476
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,720
What do you think?

477
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,160
May I ask why you came to our house?

478
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,120
I'll get straight to the point then.

479
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,480
-Your daughter is very motivated.
-Yes.

480
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,640
She put a lot of effort into my son.

481
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,600
However,

482
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,640
I won't let her just give up for nothing.

483
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,480
This is a check for five million yuan
as a token of appreciation.

484
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,200
What token of appreciation?

485
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,600
I know this is a bit rude,

486
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,760
but your family
is just managing a small business.

487
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,160
You need subsidy.

488
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,840
Si has a big burden on his shoulders.

489
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,040
He'll manage the whole
Daoming Group in the future.

490
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,640
So Shancai,

491
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,840
I hope you could understand
how a mother feels.

492
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,520
If a stumbling block appears in your life,

493
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,240
you'd remove it too, right?

494
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,400
Stumbling block?

495
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,640
-What do you mean?
-I've already made myself very clear.

496
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,280
If you continue with what you're doing,

497
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,800
you'll be the one
who'll end up getting hurt.

498
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,040
Mrs. Daoming.

499
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,280
I think you're being too nice.

500
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,600
Mom, what are you saying?

501
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,080
You're being sensible.

502
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,840
-What...
-What are you doing?

503
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,440
Mom, what are you doing?

504
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,520
As a mother, I would never allow
anyone to insult my daughter.

505
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,920
Sorry. My mom's too emotional.

506
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,280
I apologize on her behalf.

507
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,200
But it's also not right for you
to insult me.

508
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,960
I never wanted to get anything
by marrying into the Daoming family.

509
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,960
I'm really sorry. My wife was really rude.

510
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,720
-What are you doing?
-I...

511
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,080
-Are you all right, ma'am?
-Here.

512
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,360
Wash it off.

513
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,280
You...

514
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,520
You've gone too far.

515
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,600
-Let's go.
-Wait.

516
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,840
Take your lousy money away.
You're not welcome here.

517
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,680
Come here.

518
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,640
Mom.

519
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,400
You're so great.

520
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,240
You refused five million yuan
for my dignity.

521
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,120
Having a firm tough mom
like you as an example,

522
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,720
I think I can handle anything.

523
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,160
Silly girl.

524
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,720
Do you think five million yuan
would make me surrender?

525
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,960
If it's five hundred million,
I might consider it.

526
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,800
What?

527
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,800
No.

528
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,080
Look at Daoming Si.
He's so handsome and he loves you so much.

529
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,280
I can't get such a son-in-law
with five hundred million yuan. Right?

530
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,320
It's so hilarious thinking
about what you two did to his mom.

531
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,520
I think you were incredible.

532
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,680
-Aren't I great?
-You are.

533
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,960
-Are you satisfied?
-I am.

534
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,120
When you pretended to splash her earlier,
I was really scared.

535
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,160
