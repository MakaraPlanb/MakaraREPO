A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 32

3
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,360
You're an idiot.

4
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,680
Okay.

5
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,720
What do you plan to do?

6
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,040
Quietly look out for Shancai?

7
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,000
What do you mean?

8
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,960
Didn't Huaze Lei confess

9
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,600
to Shancai today?

10
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,000
Also, the problem with Xiaoyou
and Qinghe's families.

11
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,600
There are so many obstacles
standing in your way.

12
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,800
That's not important.

13
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,440
What's important is

14
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,040
Shancai's feelings.

15
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,440
But Shancai said

16
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,360
that she feels at peace

17
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
-with Huaze Lei.
-I don't want her to feel at peace!

18
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,360
I want us to be together.

19
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,680
Whether there are obstacles

20
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,360
or if Shancai's undecided
on whoever she likes,

21
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,720
I want to get her back.

22
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,160
Daoming Si, you're such a nice guy.

23
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,400
Why aren't you mine?

24
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,480
Xiaozi.

25
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,000
Fine.

26
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,760
I was just kidding. Okay?

27
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,960
I support you.

28
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

29
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,640
Your White Jasmine Dew.

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,520
I still remember the first time
you came here.

31
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,560
You didn't actually like milk tea.

32
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,800
But you ordered it
because of its unique name.

33
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,200
You still remember that?

34
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,560
Where's your friend Xiaoyou?

35
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,000
Why isn't she here today?

36
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,520
She's busy with her finals.

37
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,720
So she's got the day off.

38
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,560
I'll wait for you and take you home later.

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,080
Lei.

40
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm grateful you brought me back
from the fishing village.

41
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,320
You decorated my place,

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
helped me with my assignments,

43
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,760
stayed beside me, and took care of me

44
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
during my most difficult times.

45
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,800
And the song you played

46
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,440
was really nice.

47
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,160
I really liked it.

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,960
I'm really grateful...

49
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,080
to you.

50
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,840
You really are a nice guy.

51
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,520
I did those things because I wanted to.

52
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,360
We can't be together.

53
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,760
Don't worry.

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,440
I just want to be nice to you.

55
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,760
Maybe there won't be an opportunity
for me to do so in the future.

56
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,160
Right now, these are
unforgettable memories for me.

57
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,520
Shancai.

58
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,880
This is the first time
I don't have to think about Si

59
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,520
and just be with you.

60
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,880
Are you used to living alone?

61
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,800
It's all right.

62
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,480
I keep myself busy as much as possible.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,760
That way, I have less time
to think about it.

64
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,760
You sound like Jing.

65
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,000
Jing?

66
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,280
Since I left France,

67
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,360
Jing was alone.

68
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,360
Even though that was her decision,

69
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,600
I went there and left.

70
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,640
It'd be worse if I didn't go there at all.

71
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,680
I know.

72
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,800
When you enter someone's life,

73
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,680
she'll have expectations of you.

74
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,920
When you leave,
her life goes back to square one.

75
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,480
The disappointment and sadness
are even more unbearable.

76
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,800
You're right.

77
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,080
But I wasn't thinking clearly at the time.

78
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,480
I wasn't sure how to face her.

79
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,160
So I left.

80
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,920
But Jing didn't blame me.

81
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,720
She just said

82
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,160
she made herself busier
to tire herself out.

83
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
To numb herself.

84
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,080
Do you regret it?

85
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,600
I do.

86
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,400
I regret giving up on her so easily.

87
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,600
I regret not holding on
a little longer that time.

88
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,560
Shancai.

89
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,160
Do you get it?

90
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,600
Hold on a little longer.

91
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,400
If you do,

92
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,000
a lot of things might end up differently.

93
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,080
But if you miss that opportunity,

94
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,160
you'll regret it your whole life.

95
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,120
Regret?

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Your decision

97
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,920
determines the outcome,

98
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,480
whether it's a happy ending or a sad one.

99
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,040
If you still don't know
what you want to do,

100
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,320
then hold on a little longer.

101
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,800
Just like Si.

102
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,080
Even though he's immature,
he's very sincere.

103
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,160
He's still holding on

104
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,240
to his love for you.

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,080
Didn't you say

106
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,840
that Si can recover as quickly as a dog?

107
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,640
I think that's how he is
when it comes to love too.

108
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,320
What do you think, Mrs. Yu?

109
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,320
Do I give out

110
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,480
powerful vibes?

111
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,200
What's wrong?

112
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,040
Is there something on my face?

113
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,640
Si.

114
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,040
Right now,

115
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
you're back at being your old self.

116
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Of course.

117
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,240
I'm not like you,

118
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,320
who's a flickering candle.

119
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,880
You're joking around again.

120
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,360
You meant to say,

121
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,560
"A candle in the wind," right?

122
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,840
Silly boy.

123
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,440
Silly boy?

124
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,560
You can call me silly.

125
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,720
I'm going to do the silliest thing
I'll ever do in my life.

126
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,640
This boy.

127
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,160
<i>Doesn't he still have</i>

128
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,800
<i>a lot of silly things
that he's never done in his life yet?</i>

129
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,440
Lei, I want to tell you something.

130
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,160
Okay.

131
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,240
Shancai's mine.

132
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,680
Does that mean you're competing with me?

133
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,840
I accept your challenge.

134
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Why are you smiling?

135
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,080
So you're not giving up on her?

136
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,760
That's right.

137
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,360
I can't let her be with another guy.

138
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,640
I want to win her heart.

139
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,720
Regardless if it's my mom or you...

140
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,480
Even if the whole world wants me
to give up on her,

141
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
I'd never leave Shancai.

142
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,680
In that case, let Shancai choose.

143
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,960
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

144
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,520
Hello?

145
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,120
Shancai, promise me one thing.

146
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
<i>What is it?</i>

147
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,040
Turn off your cell phone
for 48 hours starting now.

148
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,720
Turn off my phone for 48 hours?

149
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,960
Why?

150
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
I don't want to.

151
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,760
POWER OFF

152
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,400
Shancai, why did you turn off your phone?

153
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,320
Turn to chapter two.

154
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,200
Is there anything I can do for you?

155
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,000
Sorry, professor.
I'm looking for Dong Shancai.

156
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,040
She didn't come to class today.

157
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,480
Let's continue.

158
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,040
<i>The number you are calling

159
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,600
<i>Please try again later.</i>

160
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,400
Hey, have you seen Shancai?

161
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,800

<i>Please try again later.</i>

165

Qinghe.

166
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,600
What?

167
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,600
Come here.

168
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,680
Wait for me.

169
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,560
What's the matter?

170
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,640
Where's Shancai?

171
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Why do you want to know?

172
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,320
Cut the crap. Tell me.

173
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm not telling you even if I know.

174
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,440
Tell me now.

175
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,640
All right. Let go of me.

176
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,520
Shancai...

177
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,120
Shancai didn't come to school today.

178
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,320
Hi, is Shancai here?

179
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,800
Shancai? She already left.

180
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,840
Shancai.

181
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,160
Shancai!

182
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
<i>The number you are calling

183
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880

00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,640
Sir, I want to report a crime.

188
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,800
There's a thief.

189
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,640
<i>Dong Shancai.</i>

190
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,480
<i>No matter where you're hiding,</i>

191
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,800
<i>I'll find you.</i>

192
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,840
I bought the moisturizer
you recommended in Canada

193
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,160
right after I returned.

194
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,840
Doesn't it nicely tighten
and moisturize your skin?

195
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,280
It's made from the finest herbs.
Safe and effective.

196
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,680
Look. I don't have fine lines anymore.

197
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,040
See.

198
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,480
Is Jiang Xiaoyou smart or what?

199
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,880
Yes.

200
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,760
Shancai, thanks for helping me
look for venues today.

201
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,680
You must come to the tea ceremony.

202
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,040
No problem.

203
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,360
However,

204
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,440
why did Huaze Lei call and tell me

205
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,640
to hold you up

206
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,080
as long as possible?

207
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,320
He said that?

208
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,800
Why?

209
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,560
I'm not sure either.

210
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,920
Huaze Lei is very mysterious.

211
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,760
Here. Have some fruit.

212
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

213
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,520
Shancai.

214
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,040
You haven't been here for so long.

215
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,560
Look. I prepared your favorite fruit.

216
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,840
-Eat more.
-Okay.

217
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,120
It's so sweet.

218
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,120
You're such a foodie.

219
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,840
I am and so are you.

220
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
<i>This happiness</i>

221
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,360
<i>was almost gone because of me.</i>

222
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,320
<i>Yesterday, I was still thinking
if I should be true to myself.</i>

223
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,160
<i>But if I do that,</i>

224
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,040
<i>I might hurt people around me</i>

225
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,120
<i>and not be able to live with myself.</i>

226
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,840
Hey.

227
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,640
What is Si doing?

228
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,200
Why isn't he back yet?

229
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,080
I have a feeling

230
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
that Si won't be back tonight.

231
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,480
You're trying to say something.

232
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,440
Tell me. What's going on?

233
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,680
Si called me yesterday
and asked where Shancai lives.

234
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,560
Is Si pursuing Shancai again?

235
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,520
No way.

236
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,720
Isn't Shancai with Lei now?

237
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,760
I'll call Si.

238
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,680
<i>Hello?</i>

239
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,880
Hello, Si.

240
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Where are you now?

241
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,880
I'm coming.

242
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,320
Who's being so rude?

243
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,360
Who are you looking for?

244
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,640
<i>Shancai stayed here last night.</i>

245
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
<i>But a guy picked her up earlier.</i>

246
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,400
Lei.

247
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,880
You haven't told me yet.

248
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,680
Why did you ask me
to turn off my cell phone?

249
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,680
To avoid unnecessary disturbance.

250
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,480
Unnecessary disturbance?

251
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,640
You mean...

252
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,720
Daoming Si told me
he's not giving up on you.

253
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
What do you think?

254
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,760
I've already decided.

255
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,160
Are you sure?

256
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,440
Yes.

257
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,160
This decision was really hard to make.

258
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,000
I admit that I hesitated.

259
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,440
But since I already knew the outcome,

260
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,440
I can't just

261
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,360
blindly hold on.

262
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,160
I know Si has been looking for you

263
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,600
and waiting for you.

264
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,000
He's been holding on.

265
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,480
I'm going to work.

266
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,080
I'll go with you.

267
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,400
Shancai!

268
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,160
Don't go.

269
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,480
Don't go with Lei.

270
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,400
Don't leave me.

271
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,760
Si.

272
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,560
Shancai already made her choice.

273
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,040
Why should she stay with you?

274
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,840
Screw her choice!

275
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,840
Shancai.

276
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,120
I can't be without you.

277
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,800
I can't live without you.

278
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,640
Daoming Si.

279
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,200
Let's just give up.

280
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,360
Stop holding on anymore.

281
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,560
Absolutely not.

282
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,320
My life has no meaning without you.

283
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,520
When I'm awake,

284
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,920
you're all I think of.

285
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
When I close my eyes, you're in my dreams.

286
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,240
I can only think of one thing.

287
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,320
I can't live without you.

288
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,840
Shancai.

289
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,000
I've always done
what I wanted to do before.

290
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,160
But I don't know what to do anymore.

291
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,560
Please tell me.

292
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,720
What should I do

293
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,040
for me to continue loving you?

294
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,400
Si.

295
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,000
If your love brings problems to Shancai,

296
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,000
are you sure that will make her happy?

297
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,200
Shancai.

298
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,760
You know you're the only one for me.

299
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,360
Trust me.

300
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,800
I'll definitely make you happy.

301
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,040
Shancai.

302
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,520
If you're sure about your decision,

303
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,520
I'll support you no matter what.

304
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,480
Shancai!

305
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,360
Shancai!

306
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,040
Shancai!

307
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,280
Shancai!

308
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,600
Shancai!

309
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,640
<i>-Faster. Go faster.</i>
-Shancai!

310
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,720
<i>Don't let me hear his voice again.</i>

311
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,880
Shancai!

312
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,920
Shancai!

313
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,040
Shancai!

314
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,040
Shancai!

315
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,040
Shancai!

316
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,480
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

317
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,960
<i>-My heart...
</i>-Shancai!

318
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,560
<i>...is going to break apart.</i>

319
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,920
Shancai!

320
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,120
Stop looking.

321
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,600
-Don't get off if you've already decided.
-Shancai!

322
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,840
Don't give him any more chances.

323
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,640
Shancai!

324
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,000
Shancai!

325
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,000
Daoming Si!

326
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,520
Daoming Si!

327
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,160
You're such a fool.

328
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,080
Do you know how dangerous that was?

329
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,680
She looks like the one in the picture.

330
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,960
Let's go.

331
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,400
Wait. It's a misunderstanding.

332
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,120
Daoming Si, wait for me.
I won't leave you anymore.

333
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,880
Hey, Daoming Si.

334
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,040
Someone reported
that their meteor necklace went missing.

335
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,560
Is it with you?

336
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,360
Meteor necklace?

337
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,120
Yes, it is.

338
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,280
But I didn't steal it.

339
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,920
-Are you admitting it?
-I...

340
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,600
The person who reported it
said he was mistaken.

341
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,000
<i>We're responsible to protect the citizens.</i>

342
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,840
<i>We'll thoroughly investigate
every crime reported.</i>

343
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,000
<i>I'm really sorry.
I reported it without checking properly.</i>

344
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,440
<i>-Please forgive me.
-All right.</i>

345
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,360
<i>Since it's your first offense
and you've regretted your actions,</i>

346
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,840
<i>we'll let you go this time.
Don't do it again, okay?</i>

347
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,080
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

348
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,480
Daoming Si.

349
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,680
Why did you do that?

350
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,520
What do you mean?

351
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,400
<i>Silly girl, where did you go?</i>

352
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,240
<i>Dong Shancai, listen carefully.</i>

353
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,840
<i>No matter where you're hiding,
I'll find you.</i>

354
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,240
<i>Silly girl.</i>

355
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,800
Why did you keep calling me that?

356
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,080
You're a silly boy, right?

357
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,040
Why were you hiding?

358
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,600
Didn't I tell you before?

359
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,760
No matter what happens,
I need to know where you are.

360
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,600
So you asked the police to arrest me?

361
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,800
You're so smart.

362
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,160
I almost got myself a criminal record!

363
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,560
Then what did you want me to do?

364
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,480
I almost went crazy looking for you.

365
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,720
You've been...

366
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,760
looking for me?

367
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,840
What did you think?

368
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,800
You didn't attend class or go to work.

369
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,200
You didn't go home.

370
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,880
Your phone was turned off.

371
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,200
Do you want me to die from stress?
Why did you disappear?

372
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,640
Thank you

373
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,120
for looking for me.

374
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Daoming Si.

375
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,800
I thought you'd never come back
to me anymore.

376
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,000
<i>I've always pushed myself into a corner</i>

377
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,520
<i>and trapped myself in fear and pain.</i>

378
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,400
<i>However,</i>

379
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,640
<i>even if I regret it later,</i>

380
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,560
<i>I want to hold on to my happiness now.</i>

381
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,280
Are you hungry?

382
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,720
It wasn't me.

383
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,120
It wasn't me.

384
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,720
I'm sure it was you. I heard it.

385
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,680
The sound came from your stomach!

386
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,960
-Why are you accusing me?
-Just because...

387
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,120
All right. Since you looked so cute
when you accused me,

388
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,480
a chivalrous person like me
won't argue with you anymore.

389
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,840
When did I accuse you?

390
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,400
All right. Let's eat.

391
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,920
Why are you holding my hand so tightly?

392
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,280
I'm afraid you'll run away.

393
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,760
I'm thinking

394
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,920
I should have borrowed handcuffs
from that officer earlier.

395
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,640
Then you won't be able to run away.

396
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,800
Silly boy.

397
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,080
Let's go eat ramen.

398
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,600
Ramen?

399
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,240
Why should we eat ramen?

400
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,720
What are you thinking?

401
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,000
I'm thinking of eating ramen.

402
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,120
Then what are you thinking?

403
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,600
<i>It suddenly feels like we're flirting.</i>

404
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,800
<i>What should I do to break the awkwardness?</i>

405
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,640
I know.

406
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,600
You're thinking about me, right?

407
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,040
Stop being so narcissistic.

408
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,960
<i>Goodness.</i> <i>What did I just say?</i>

409
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,880
<i>It's even more awkward now.</i>

410
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,560
That's so funny.

411
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,440
How is that funny?

412
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Are we eating or not?

413
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,920
-Wasn't it funny?
-Not at all.

414
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,080
-Okay.
-It was not funny.

415
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,920
Hey!

416
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,720
Sir, can you please stop the bus?

417
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,520
I'm begging you! It's very important.

418
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,600
Shancai.

419
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Are you sure?

420
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,240
Lei, I want to give it a try.

421
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,720
Compared to trying my best and failing,

422
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,760
not trying at all would make me
regret it even more.

423
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,680
Excuse me.

424
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,680
This is your ramen. Please enjoy.

425
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
It looks so good.

426
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,200
-Okay, thanks.
-You're welcome.

427
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,720
Why aren't you eating?

428
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,680
I'm suddenly not that hungry.

429
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,000
It's such a waste not to eat it.

430
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,600
Okay, fine.

431
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,240
How is it? Is it good?

432
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,360
Yes, it's all right.

433
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,800
Hey.

434
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,640
Do you have a passport?

435
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,640
Yes, I do.

436
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
I applied for one
the last time I went overseas.

437
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,760
Then there's no problem.

438
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,600
What are you talking about?

439
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,840
Shancai, let's go to London together.

440
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,040
You mean...

441
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,960
that newly-opened London coffee shop?

442
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,680
I think we need to come up
with a plan soon.

443
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,080
My mom is not that easy to handle.

444
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,520
Wait.

445
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,040
Aren't we being too rash?

446
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
Don't you want to?

447
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,080
No.

448
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
I don't.

449
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,600
Why?

450
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,680
What do you mean?

451
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,920
I don't want to go to a foreign country.

452
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,080
I don't have friends there

453
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,480
and my English is bad.
I'm not used to Western food.

454
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,280
What if I get sick?

455
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,440
Then why did you get off the bus?

456
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,880
Did I misunderstand?

457
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,760
Why did you get off the bus?

458
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,240
<i>Is this guy</i>

459
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,920
<i>pushing me to make things clear?</i>

460
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,040
Can't I get off the bus?

461
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,320
I see.

462
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,760
Then I'll go ahead.

463
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,920
<i>What exactly am I saying?</i>

464
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Daoming Si, wait!

465
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,240
I...

466
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,320
I want to say...

467
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,040
Good night.

468
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,000
That's it?

469
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,440
That's it.

470
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,320
Why are you looking for me?

471
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,720
I just want to tell you in person
that Shancai is mine.

472
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,880
Don't bother her anymore.

473
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,600
So you're together now?

474
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,600
Is Shancai your girlfriend?

475
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,240
That's none of your business!

476
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,000
I don't think she is.

477
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,560
I still have a chance then.

478
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,000
Don't you get it?
Tell me that you're giving up on Shancai.

479
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,840
I don't see why I should do that.

480
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,720
Huaze Lei.

481
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,640
Am I not your friend anymore?

482
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,760
You know I can't live without Shancai.

483
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,800
-You know I--
-I don't.

484
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,720
You...

485
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,760
I know you hurt her with your temper.

486
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,360
How could I hurt her?

487
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,640
Give up on Shancai, understand?

488
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,120
I'm not deaf. You don't have to shout.

489
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,880
I don't care what you think.

490
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,080
I'm warning you.

491
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,440
Shancai is mine.

492
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,320
I, Daoming Si, will be
responsible for her.

493
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,320
I'll take care of her.

494
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,160
I won't let her be with a guy like you.
A guy who has no conscience and loyalty.

495
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,360
Do you hear that?

496
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,320
Oh, all right.

497
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,320
What do you mean, "Oh, all right"?
What exactly...

498
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,240
What did you say again?

499
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,960
I said all right.

500
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,280
I'll give up on Shancai.

501
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,400
Why?

502
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,880
-So I can pursue Shancai?
-No.
