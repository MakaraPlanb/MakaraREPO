EPISODE 23

3
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,960
Shancai.

4
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,600
Wake up.

5
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,560
We start cleaning at 7:00 a.m.

6
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,120
Mrs. Yu, I've completed my tasks.

7
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,760
What else should I clean?

8
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,240
Just completing them
and completing them nicely

9
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,000
are two different things.

10
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,280
If it doesn't pass my examination,

11
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,240
you have to do it again.

12
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,200
Wait.

13
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,400
Why aren't the pleats on the window
curtains the same size?

14
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,840
It doesn't look uniform.

15
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,880
Why aren't those bathroom slippers
placed facing the door?

16
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,840
What if someone slips

17
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,760
when trying to wear them?

18
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,400
And this trash can.

19
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Why is the trash bag visible
in the trash can?

20
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,080
That's not allowed either?

21
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,880
That's how we do it at home.

22
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,480
That's not how we do it here.

23
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,720
There would be no sign of life
if it's too clean.

24
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,040
How can we not leave a trace
while we're alive?

25
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,480
Don't talk back to me.

26
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,400
The sign of life you're referring to
is sloppiness.

27
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,320
It's time to wake Si up.

28
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,400
Why are you still standing there?

29
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,960
Aren't I just responsible for cleaning?

30
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,760
Go when I tell you to.

31
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,520
Okay.

32
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Never mind.

33
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,040
This is work.

34
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,600
Just act like normal.

35
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,840
Daoming Si.

36
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,480
Sir, wake up...

37
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,760
Why isn't he budging at all?

38
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,720
He sleeps like a dead person.

39
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,440
It's so rare to see him so quiet.

40
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,920
Looking at him closely...

41
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,160
His nose is quite sharp.

42
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,480
Hey.

43
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,960
Let go.

44
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,160
-Hey.
-Stop.

45
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,800
Why are you so violent?

46
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,360
Can't you be nicer?

47
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,720
You jerk.

48
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,960
Were you pretending to be asleep?

49
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,440
No.

50
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,760
I was dreaming.

51
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,160
You...

52
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,120
Can you wear something to bed from now on?

53
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,560
Why?

54
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,720
Are you feeling shy?

55
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,600
Of course not.

56
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,360
I heard my mom bothered you yesterday.

57
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,360
Sorry about that.

58
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
That's fine.

59
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,520
Did you and Xiaozi meet afterward?

60
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,240
She came to my house.

61
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,680
Really?

62
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
How is she?

63
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,360
She's all smiles on the outside.

64
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,400
However...

65
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,760
Even though I feel sorry for her,

66
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,840
but...

67
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,400
I can't control my feelings.

68
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
I thought

69
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,400
you'd be with Lei.

70
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,440
Lei?

71
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,480
What are you talking about?

72
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,960
You...

73
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
Are you stupid?

74
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,880
-I--
-Never mind.

75
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,040
Anyway, it's not important.

76
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,160
Why are you speaking calmly?

77
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,760
Listen.

78
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,000
Didn't you tell me
that you'll fight with my mom for us?

79
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,520
For us...

80
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,760
You should have told me earlier.

81
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,960
That way, I wouldn't date other girls.

82
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,280
Daoming Si.

83
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,960
-Let me explain.
-I'm not listening.

84
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,760
Every time you explain,
it only complicates things.

85
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,960
Because life itself is complicated.

86
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,400
Si.

87
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,600
You're being so intimate with our cleaner
so early in the morning.

88
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,120
What do you think you're doing?

89
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,880
Mrs. Yu.

90
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,320
You should knock before you come in.

91
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,360
You're dillydallying.

92
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,520
I asked you to wake Si up.

93
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
I didn't ask you to provide
other services.

94
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,320
What are you saying, old lady?

95
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,040
That kid

96
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,560
who pees his bed until the third grade

97
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,080
is all grown up now.

98
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,000
-So you think you can disrespect me now?
-Mrs. Yu, stop it.

99
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,400
Who changed your sheets

100
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,520
every time you wet your bed?

101
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,200
And who always cried saying,

102
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,040
"Don't tell my sister"?

103
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,760
Si.

104
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,600
Have you forgotten already?

105
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,200
Mrs. Yu.

106
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,040
That's ancient history. Don't bring it up.

107
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,000
And you're even saying them
in front of a girl.

108
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,920
Shancai, I dare you to laugh.

109
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,760
Didn't you retire
due to a bad back a year ago?

110
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,800
Why did you come back
when my mom asked you to?

111
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,960
Do I look like someone's puppet?

112
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
This time,

113
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,760
even though the president was the one
who asked me to come back,

114
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,360
I decide how to organize

115
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,400
this household.

116
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,240
No matter who he is,

117
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,600
if he's wrong,

118
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,680
I won't be lenient with him.

119
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,200
Shancai.

120
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,640
Shouldn't you get back to work outside?

121
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,760
Yes.

122
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Mrs. Yu.

123
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,160
Did my mom send you to spy on me?

124
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,520
Si.

125
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,960
What did you do

126
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,880
to need such supervision and re-education?

127
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,080
-What happened to Shancai?
-I'm not sure.

128
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,400
Didn't she write a post
in QZone saying she's fine?

129
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,720
Yes, but I don't know where she is now.

130
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,080
Stop worrying.
You'd see her later in class.

131
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,320
-Shancai.
-Shancai.

132
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,600
Why are you with Daoming Si?

133
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,240
Did you spend the night together?

134
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,440
Well...

135
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Shancai, we'll be late. Let's go.

136
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,200
-We'll go to class first.
-All right.

137
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,240
Come on. Hurry.

138
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,640
Daoming Si, just wait.

139
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,880
Just you wait.

140
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,480
Shancai.

141
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,080
So Shancai's been staying with you
after she was driven out by her landlady?

142
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,840
Yes.

143
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,600
She even woke me up this morning.

144
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,520
What? Did I hear you right?

145
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,640
She woke you up?

146
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,040
That means...

147
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,440
I mean

148
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,160
I can see the person I like
when I wake up every day.

149
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,880
What's going on?

150
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,240
Shancai is a cleaner at your house?

151
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,320
That's ridiculous.

152
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,240
How can you develop

153
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,520
such a unique love story
when you're with Shancai?

154
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,200
Because they're both not normal.

155
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,760
By the way, I saw your application, Si.

156
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,080
You're going to graduate school?

157
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,000
Yes.

158
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,480
Shancai is a sophomore.

159
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,640
We'll graduate together
if I stay two more years.

160
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,560
Does Shancai know?

161
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,840
Not yet.

162
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,600
However, I have to personally
hear her say those three words.

163
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,880
Which three words?

164
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,560
You are annoying, stay far away,
you stupid fool.

165
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,720
Or...

166
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,560
He he he?

167
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,960
It seems you already have a perfect plan.

168
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,720
Don't worry.

169
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,560
I've got it all planned out.

170
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,080
<i>I never thought I'd live
in the same house as Daoming Si,</i>

171
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,960
<i>especially working at his house.</i>

172
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,880
<i>I wonder how my parents
are doing in the fishing village.</i>

173
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,760
<i>I hope they can come back soon.</i>

174
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,360
<i>And we'll live happily as a family again.</i>

175
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,800
<i>No.</i>

176
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,200
<i>I can't feel discouraged.</i>

177
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,320
<i>I have to live well for my parents
and not worry them.</i>

178
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,720
The calories it contains...

179
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,120
Your meal is ready.

180
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,960
Please enjoy.

181
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,720
Eat with me.

182
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
I can't.

183
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,080
I can't eat with you when I'm working.

184
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,400
Why not?

185
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,600
It's against Mrs. Yu's rules.

186
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,760
You can if I say you can.

187
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,360
All right.

188
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,720
Can we eat now?

189
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,520
I'll meet you at midnight.

190
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,840
<i>What should I do?</i>

191
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,960
<i>Why does he want to meet me?</i>

192
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,120
<i>How about I just pretend to be asleep?</i>

193
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,280
<i>No.</i>

194
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,320
<i>He must have the key to this room.</i>

195
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,400
<i>No.</i>

196
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,920
<i>With his bad temper,</i>

197
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,200
<i>he'll wake everyone up
if he can't come in.</i>

198
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,360
<i>When that happens,
it would cause a huge misunderstanding.</i>

199
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,520
<i>What should I do?</i>

200
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,520
<i>What should I do with Daoming Si?</i>

201
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,840
<i>He just does whatever he wants.</i>

202
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,640
<i>He never cares
about what other people feel.</i>

203
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,320
<i>He might do something extreme.</i>

204
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,120
<i>What if...</i>

205
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,200
<i>No. It's too dangerous.</i>

206
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,240
<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>

207
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,400
<i>I'll just spend a night at Xiaoyou's.</i>

208
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,760
<i>I'll deal with him tomorrow.</i>

209
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,920
<i>Why are you so slow?</i>

210
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,560
<i>Were you hatching eggs in the bedroom?</i>

211
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,240
It's very late now.

212
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
-I think--
-There are many things

213
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,120
that we can only do at night.

214
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,680
No.

215
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,960
We can't do it regardless
if it's daytime or night time.

216
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,680
I've already made a decision.

217
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,320
I won't be shy.

218
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,760
Why did you ask me to come here?

219
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,160
To watch you launch a rocket?

220
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,240
Are you stupid?

221
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,440
You're the stupid one.

222
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,040
You don't know how to set it.

223
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,840
Who doesn't know that's a telescope?

224
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,520
That's strange.

225
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,280
It's tonight for sure.

226
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,280
You asked me to come here to look at this?

227
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,760
Why are you laughing?

228
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,360
Don't distract me.

229
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,960
I'm heading back to sleep.

230
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,120
Can't you just look
in the mirror to see a Martian?

231
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,200
I found it. Come and see it.

232
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,680
-See what?
-Come and take a look.

233
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Do you see it?

234
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,880
Yes. It's so beautiful.

235
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,800
-Let me see.
-Okay.

236
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,760
Let me see it.

237
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,120
Let me see it again.

238
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,120
It's really beautiful.

239
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,680
Stupid girl.

240
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,400
Aside from that,
can't you say anything else?

241
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
It's so spectacular.

242
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,840
It's like thousands of diamonds
falling from the sky.

243
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,040
It's so nice.

244
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,240
Then...

245
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Do you like it?

246
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes, I do.

247
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,360
But it's too short.

248
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,440
I wonder how many decades later
it will take to see it again?

249
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,920
It'd be nice if I can see it every day.

250
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,720
You want to see it every day?

251
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,520
Then close your eyes and make a wish.

252
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,120
Maybe it'll come true.

253
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,080
I'm not a kindergarten student.

254
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,360
Do you think I'll believe that?

255
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,920
How would you know if you don't try?

256
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,120
All right.

257
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,080
I'll put it on for you.

258
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,080
No. It's too expensive.
I can't accept this.

259
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,280
Don't move.

260
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,200
This gift has a special meaning.

261
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,040
So you can't refuse it.

262
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,920
Why are you so overbearing?

263
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,800
Because you're the only one
I'm willing to trade all the meteors

264
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,400
in the sky for.

265
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,200
Shancai.

266
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,200
Be my girlfriend.

267
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Daoming Si.

268
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,680
I'm very moved that you like me so much.

269
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,200
But...

270
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,840
But what?

271
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,520
If my feelings for you

272
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,600
are only ten percent
of your feelings for me,

273
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,880
would you still want to be my boyfriend?

274
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,600
Only ten percent?

275
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,000
I really hate the way you speak.

276
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Sorry. I...

277
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,600
I just wanted to tell you how I feel.

278
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,920
What if I couldn't like you

279
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,720
the way you like me?

280
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,640
Then be my girlfriend.

281
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,640
If you become my girlfriend,
I'll make up for the 90 percent.

282
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,800
What if you couldn't make up for it?

283
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,480
It's fine if you don't trust yourself.

284
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
But you trust me, right?

285
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,040
I won't force you.

286
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,240
But you have to give me chance, okay?

287
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,920
If...

288
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,080
If you still don't like me after a month,

289
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,360
I won't bother you again.

290
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,520
Think about it carefully.

291
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,520
Give me an answer by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

292
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,520
Seven in the morning?

293
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,920
Isn't that only three hours away?

294
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,840
Do you only need three minutes then?

295
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,080
Fine. 7:00 a.m. then.

296
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,480
Daoming Si.

297
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,240
You should wake up.

298
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,000
Can I come in and do the cleaning?

299
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,960
I'll start cleaning.

300
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,200
Aside from cleaning

301
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,400
don't you have anything else to say?

302
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,280
I want to say...

303
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,920
What do you want to say?

304
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,960
Regarding the one month trial period,

305
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,760
I think we can try it.

306
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,680
But it's not a trial period for you,
but for me.

307
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,120
I want to officially
and seriously date you.

308
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,040
If I can't like you with all my heart,

309
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,600
then I'm the one who's leaving.

310
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,280
So the answer is yes?

311
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,400
Right?

312
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,400
Answer me.

313
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,240
Yes.

314
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,760
I don't know.

315
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,720
Ask her yourself if you want to know.

316
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,280
-How can I ask her?
-How can I?

317
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
How is it?

318
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,520
We're still testing it.

319
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,600
Your girlfriend's here.

320
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,920
Shancai, someone's waiting for you.

321
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,160
Go over there.

322
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,920
I'll just sit here with Qinghe.

323
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,080
Why?

324
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,600
We usually sit together.

325
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,440
Shancai, let me ask you.

326
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,080
Are you officially dating Daoming Si?

327
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,040
Why are you just standing there?
Come here.

328
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,320
Let's go.

329
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,840
What are you doing?

330
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
My goodness.

331
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,920
They're together?

332
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,160
They're officially together?

333
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,200
They're officially together.

334
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,440
That's so surprising.

335
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,960
-I'm so envious.
-I'm so envious.

336
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,160
That's so surprising.

337
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,120
-That's right.
-She's so lucky.

338
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,800
-Why isn't it me?
-What a lucky girl.

339
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,320
-That's right.
-It's so annoying.

340
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,640
-Look at them.
-Yes.

341
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,560
-Shancai's so lucky.
-That's right.

342
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,160
-They're together now?
-Daoming Si's so handsome.

343
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,160
So what? He's taken already.

344
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,840
-He's so cute.
-That's right.

345
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,040
Impossible. Stop dreaming.

346
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,280
He's so handsome.

347
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Look.

348
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,080
Shancai's so awkward
in front of Daoming Si.

349
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,840
It's so unnatural.

350
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,960
Really?

351
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,480
I think they look good together.

352
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,240
Shancai's not usually like that.

353
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,680
I don't care. I won't allow them
to be together.

354
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,280
Shut it.

355
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,120
Sorry.

356
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,960
Why are you apologizing?

357
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,160
What's wrong?

358
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,440
I'm not used to this.

359
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,200
That's understandable.

360
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,320
All eyes would be on you
if you're with someone like me.

361
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,160
It's normal to not be used to it.

362
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,960
However...

363
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,320
You can't use this reason
to reject me after a month.

364
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,200
Eat up.

365
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,840
You're dating?
And you're living in his house?

366
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,720
Congratulations.

367
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,240
You're finally together
after such a long time.

368
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,200
Why do you look so worried?

369
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,320
Aren't you happy with Daoming Si's
love confession?

370
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,440
You don't understand.

371
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,960
I just ate at the cafeteria
and all eyes were on me.

372
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,720
I felt like a freak in a jar

373
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,720
at a medical laboratory.

374
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,480
I couldn't eat.

375
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,040
How would I be happy?

376
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,080
I don't think that would work.

377
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,960
Me too.

378
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,280
But how can we date like this?

379
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,760
Don't think too much.

380
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,360
Tell me what's your ideal date.

381
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,400
An ideal date should be

382
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,240
going to the library to study together.

383
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,600
Then shopping and walking together,

384
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,720
watching movies together,

385
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,520
and eating in
popular restaurants together.

386
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,600
Then do it.

387
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,840
What are you worried about?

388
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
But...

389
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,600
But these don't seem like the things
Daoming Si would like to do.

390
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
Shancai.

391
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,760
When two people are together,
they have to understand

392
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,000
and adjust to each other.

393
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,000
If he really likes you,
he'll adjust for you.

394
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,160
This month, you can test him
and see if he really likes you.

395
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,000
But how would I ask him out?

396
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,640
I know.

397
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,560
I'm going on a date
with my boyfriend this weekend.

398
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,160
Bring Daoming Si along.

399
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,640
My boyfriend and I usually do
the things you've mentioned.

400
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,720
We'll see if Daoming Si can adjust to you.

401
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,240
Xiaoyou.

402
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,520
When did you have a boyfriend?

403
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
You didn't tell me.

404
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,880
Who is it?

405
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,240
I wanted to tell you a long time ago.

406
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,320
But weren't you in a bad mood lately?

407
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,200
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

408
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,120
He's my classmate.

409
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,760
He took me home
when it was raining one time.

410
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,520
Then he kissed me at my door.

411
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,360
He kissed you the first time
he took you home?

412
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,040
He's so romantic.

413
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,560
I really like him.

414
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,480
Xiaoyou, I'm really happy for you.

415
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,120
And I'm really curious
about what type of person he is

416
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,040
to make you like him so much.

417
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,960
So bring Daoming Si
and let's have a double date.

418
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,680
All right.

419
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,000
I think the topic of your thesis is great.

420
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,400
But it has to be more focused.

421
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,000
I don't think so.

422
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,920
Look at this.

423
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,960
-What's the matter?
-Have some fruit.

424
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,280
It's really delicious.

425
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
Hey.

426
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,640
Know your places.

427
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,640
She can only feed me.

428
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,960
-Go on.
-Hey.

429
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,560
-Why did you choose this?
-Look at this.

430
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,720
What do you want to say?

431
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,520
Come out for a while.

432
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,040
I have something to tell you.

433
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,840
Just say it here.

434
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,720
By the way, Ximen, scroll down.

435
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,680
Okay.

436
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,160
Do you see this? This one.

437
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,960
-The topic won't work.
-Let's go on a date.

438
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,680
Shancai, you're incredible.

439
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,680
Little Miss Shancai is making
the first move now.

440
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,600
Well, do you still remember
my good friend Xiaoyou?

441
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,440
Yes, the one who works with you.

442
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,440
She's thin with round eyes. Very cute.

443
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,600
Don't get any ideas about her.

444
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,120
I'm just complimenting your friend.

445
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,840
What exactly are you trying to say?

446
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Let's have a double date
with Xiaoyou and her boyfriend.

447
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,680
On Sunday at 11:00 a.m. at the theme park.

448
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,800
Just treat it as a date with me.

449
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,000
Never mind. If you didn't hear clearly.
I'll take it as a yes.

450
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,880
This is the legendary double date.

451
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,000
The famous double date 20 years ago.

452
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,000
You want me to go out
with someone I don't know?

453
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,400
Who says you don't know her?

454
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,440
Xiaoyou's my friend. Just adjust to it.

455
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,280
Adjust? Why?

456
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,600
It's a bit outdated,

457
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,360
but it's the first time Shancai
asked you out.

458
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,560
Si, you can play
a supporting role for once.

459
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,400
Won't you do it for Shancai?

460
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,080
How boring. I got excited over nothing.

461
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,480
Why are you making that face?

462
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,200
It's just the first day
of the one month period.

463
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,880
Can't you just try it once?

464
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,920
I don't want to do it. No way.

465
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,480
You know how he is.

466
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,440
Don't worry about it.

467
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,760
Shancai. You know him.

468
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,360
If Si really goes there,
that would truly be awkward.

469
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,720
Never mind.

470
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,640
I won't ever ask him out again.

471
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,480
Can't he just adjust a bit?

472
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,960
Big stupid fool!

473
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Good night.

474
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,960
Sorry, Xiaoyou.

475
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,960
Daoming Si...

476
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,560
attended a friend's wedding.

477
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Which friend?

478
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,200
That friend...

479
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,040
Never mind.

480
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,360
Daoming Si slipped and fell
when he walked out the door earlier.

481
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,480
I won't even believe that.

482
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,600
Shancai.

483
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,000
Sorry, we weren't able to catch the train.

484
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,120
We had to wait.
This is my boyfriend, Xiaoqi.

485
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,920
Hi, I'm Zhang Ziqi. Just call me Xiaoqi.
That makes us sound closer.

486
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,600
Hi, I'm Dong Shancai.

487
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,240
-Where is he?
-He might not make it.

488
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
He can't come?

489
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,240
Something came up at home.

490
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,720
I'm really sorry.

491
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
It's fine.

492
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,280
Let's have some burgers.

493
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,880
No, you guys go ahead.

494
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,440
I don't want to intrude on your date.

495
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,680
Traffic was bad.

496
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,800
Daoming Si, is everything okay at home?

497
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,480
Yes.

498
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,120
Let me introduce you.

499
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,320
This is Daoming Si. Shancai's boyfriend.

500
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,600
Hi.

501
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,080
Why are you so shy?

502
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,360
Let's take a picture.

503
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,160
Say cheese.

504
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,840
All right.

505
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,040
Let's have some burgers.

506
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,640
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

507
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,080
Didn't you say you're not coming?

508
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,840
Just this once.
There will be no second time.

509
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
Why are you laughing?

510
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,680
I'm laughing because you were like a robot

511
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,680
learning his first movement
when you extended your hand earlier.

512
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
You talk too much.

513
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,360
What are you having?
Order whatever you want.

514
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,360
My treat.

515
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,680
Don't be shy.

516
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,640
This one.

517
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,440
No.

518
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,160
You're all grown up
and you're ordering a kid's meal?

519
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,480
Your boyfriend is a child at heart.

520
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,440
Do you want a Minion toy with it?

521
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
I want this one too.

522
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,160
Me too. It's so cute.

523
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,440
Let's order the same thing.

524
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,600
All right.

525
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,400
What do you think?

526
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,640
He's quite handsome, right?

527
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,520
Yes.

528
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,000
But how do I say it?

529
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,760
He's different than what I imagined.

530
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,040
How tall are you?

531
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,760
I'm 185cm.

532
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,240
You're 185cm?

533
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
No wonder.

534
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,280
You can be a model.

535
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,360
I was wondering
why your name is Shaolin Si.

536
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,320
Turns out your mom has foresight, right?

537
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,360
It's Daoming Si.

538
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,000
Don't mind him.

539
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,320
He just likes to make jokes.

540
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,960
Do you smoke?

541
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,720
I knew it. You look like such a good boy.
Surely you don't smoke.

542
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,520
Are you also a good boy at home?

543
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,480
Well...

544
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,800
Where are we going later?
How about the theme park?

545
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,040
All right. Let's go there after.

546
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,840
This pirate ship ride is so exciting.

547
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,960
Let's go on it together.

548
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,600
Daoming Si.

549
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,440
You're so tall.

550
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,480
You're not afraid, right?

551
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,000
No problem.

552
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,360
I'll go with the girls, all right?

553
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,640
-Let's go.
-No.

554
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,520
I'm the one who's afraid.

555
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,120
You two go ahead.

556
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,480
Daoming Si and I will just walk around.

557
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,000
Looks like

558
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,240
they have a good relationship, right?

559
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,240
Dong Shancai.

560
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,640
This is the double date
you were talking about?

561
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,400
What kind of person is that?

562
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Why would your friend
be with such a freak?

563
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
What are you thinking?

564
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,000
All right. If you don't want to stay,
let's just go home.

565
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,200
No.

566
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,960
I mean

567
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,640
it'd be awkward for you if I leave.

568
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,760
I think you look really handsome...

569
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,960
today.

570
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,080
Don't worry.

571
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,160
I won't beat him up even though
that guy is really infuriating.

572
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,000
Really?

573
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,840
Even if I'm so mad, I won't beat him up.

574
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,200
Let's go.

575
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,760
THOMAS THE TRAIN

576
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,680
-What is this?
-This is a very famous haunted house.

577
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,320
It's only in Shanghai for a few days.

578
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,520
I don't want to miss it.

579
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,440
Haunted house? I'm not going.

580
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Why?

581
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,000
It looks boring. What's so good about it?

582
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,080
But I really want to go.

583
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,720
Come with me.

584
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,480
I can't say no to you.

585
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,920
ENTRANCE

586
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,320
It's so dark.

587
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,040
I feel like I can't see anything.

588
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,360
I'm so nervous.

589
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,480
It's so exciting.

590
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,160
How is it exciting?

591
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,480
I told you. These things are fake.

592
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
Why are you laughing?

593
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,320
Haven't I told you already?
These things are not scary at all.

594
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,160
Stay behind me and follow me.

595
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,760
I told you it would be fine.

596
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,720
Let's go.

597
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,200
Sorry.
