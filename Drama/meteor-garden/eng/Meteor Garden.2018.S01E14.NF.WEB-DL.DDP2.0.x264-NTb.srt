CHINESE CUISINE CULINARY COMPETITION

4
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,960
<i>Next, can we please give
a round of applause</i>

5
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,600
<i>and welcome the ten contestants.</i>

6
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,720
Shancai, you can do it!

7
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,880
The contestants will first present
their dishes for the stir fry round.

8
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,160
Now, our judges

9
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,720
are carefully tasting each dish
our contestants carefully prepared.

10
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,880
We can see the unique and thoughtful
expressions on their faces.

11
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,000
How do the dishes prepared
by our contestants taste like?

12
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,800
Can it entice our judges' appetite?

13
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,800
Shancai should be fine, right?

14
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,960
Of course.

15
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,840
If she can't qualify, who else can?

16
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,960
Next, the judges would be tasting

17
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,280
the contestants' broiled dishes.

18
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,640
This round is coming to an end.

19
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,760
Who will continue standing on this stage?

20
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,200
Who will be eliminated?

21
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,080
May we please have our judge,
Tu Xiaowen, announce the results.

22
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,440
I'm announcing the results.

23
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,360
Dai Jingjing.

24
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Gao Xinting.

25
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,600
Zao Xiaoyang.

26
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,840
And...

27
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,640
Lin Wenjiao.

28
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,920
I'm sorry, you are eliminated
for this round.

29
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,800
The competition ends here for you.

30
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,440
FIRST ROUND EVALUATION RESULTS

31
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,440
<i>Shancai qualified for the next round.
That was close.</i>

32
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,680
Hey.

33
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,040
I can't believe it.

34
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,400
Little Ms. Flying Kick,
who kicked you in the hallway before

35
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,280
is now a very skillful cook.

36
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,840
Do you have an eye for talent

37
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
or is this all due to
your sister's strict training?

38
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,240
Whatever it is,

39
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,840
Shancai has unique determination

40
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,560
that can accomplish the impossible.

41
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,400
After the first round of elimination,
we still have six contestants left.

42
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,400
These six contestants would enter
the next phase of the competition,

43
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,240
which is the pastry round.

44
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,080
Next, may we please request our judge,
Miss Tang Jingmei,

45
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,680
to discuss the criteria for judging.

46
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,000
SECOND ROUND, CHINESE PASTRY

47
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,920
Pastries were initially made
to reward soldiers when at war.

48
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,880
It's also the essence
of our Chinese food culture.

49
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,560
In this round,

50
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,160
the contestants need to choose
a flower as a key ingredient.

51
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,040
Infuse the flower's flavor
into the pastry,

52
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,720
present a visually enticing
and tasty course and create

53
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,200
a unique pastry that stands out
in color, fragrance, and taste.

54
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,800
Everyone, please do your best.

55
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,480
So what are our contestants waiting for?
Please go to your stations immediately.

56
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,200
CHINESE CUISINE CULINARY COMPETITION

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,560
Next, let's see

58
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,280
the cooking process of each contestant
in the kitchen.

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,160
The time limit for the second round,
the pastry round, is one hour.

60
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,960
At the end of this round,
we'll select four out of six contestants.

61
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,720
What is Shancai doing?

62
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,280
I don't get it as well.

63
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,440
It's good that you don't get it.

64
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,320
If you knew what it was,
it wouldn't be amazing.

65
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,640
Only one minute left.
Let's start the countdown.

66
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,280
All right. Time's up.

67
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,360
Now, the contestants
have completed their dishes.

68
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,080
Whose dish will move people's hearts?

69
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,760
Please bring your dishes in.
Judges, please get ready.

70
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,080
All right. Next, we'll ask our contestants
to present their dishes.

71
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,560
Now, our judges are carefully tasting
each pastry our contestants made.

72
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,240
So what do our judges think
about the pastry they've tasted?

73
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,880
This Lotus Flower Cake
is very interesting.

74
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,800
From its physical appearance,

75
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,480
it looks like

76
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
lotus flowers known as flower fairies.

77
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,400
As for its taste,

78
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,320
it's soft, fluffy and sweet.

79
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,240
It's very flavorful.

80
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,240
Very good.

81
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,160
Thank you.

82
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
It's so beautiful.
Its fragrance is very inviting.

83
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,800
It delights the heart
and refreshes the mind.

84
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,160
I want to have another piece.

85
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,320
This is the natural fragrance
of lotus flowers.

86
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,040
I preserved its natural state.

87
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,320
I like this girl.

88
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,080
No way.

89
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,080
Are you falling for Caina?

90
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,720
Now, the judges are holding
Miss Dong Shancai's Plain Flower Candy.

91
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,240
It tastes delicious.

92
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,440
Should I say

93
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,960
that it's grayish

94
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,560
or yellowish?

95
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,240
Do you know what's
the most important thing

96
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,320
required to win this competition?

97
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,480
This pastry is called

98
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
"Dong Xiaowan's Blooming Beauty,
Exquisite Elegance,

99
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,040
Delicate Grace and Golden Age."

100
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,240
Wow, is that a tongue twister?

101
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,320
I want to hear more about it.

102
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,120
Dong Xiaowan is a famous chef in history.

103
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,120
She especially likes
to use flowers in cooking.

104
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,840
That's why she made this pastry.

105
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,840
Many years ago,

106
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,560
her husband, Mao Xuejiang, fell sick.

107
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,520
In order to make her husband
recover quickly

108
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
and take up his sword,

109
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,360
she made this pastry herself

110
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,600
and named it Plain Flower Candy.

111
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,800
Even though this is just a simple pastry,

112
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,280
but it comes from
a very beautiful love story.

113
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,880
There are very few people
who know how to make this pastry,

114
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,560
especially young girls like her.

115
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,720
-That's not easy.
-Yes.

116
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,200
You know quite a lot.

117
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,840
All right. Thank you, Dong Shancai,
for your Plain Flower Candy.

118
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Next, we'll go to our next round.

119
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,440
Who will continue standing on this stage?

120
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,360
We'll find out after the commercial.

121
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,440
CHINESE CUISINE CULINARY COMPETITION

122
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,880
After a heated discussion
among our judges,

123
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,200
we have the results of the second round.

124
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,640
Four contestants will enter the final
battle between the East and the West.

125
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,480
Can we have our judge,
Tang Jingmei, to announce the results.

126
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,360
Who are the final four contestants?

127
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,200
After careful deliberation
from the judges' panel,

128
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,560
the following will be able
to enter the final deciding round

129
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,160
of the Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition.

130
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,560
Miss Zhou Caina.

131
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,880
SECOND ROUND EVALUATION RESULTS

132
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,720
Miss Luo Qianni.

133
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,800
Miss Ling Chenxi.

134
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,360
And last but not the least...

135
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,000
Maybe

136
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,480
this is a little unexpected.

137
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,720
Congratulations, Miss Dong Shancai.

138
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,120
-Shancai! You did it!
-Hey!

139
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,360
-Si.
-Si.

140
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,240
-Shancai! Well done! Shancai!
-Calm down, Si.

141
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,720
-Did I hear it correctly?
-All right. Miss Dong, step forward.

142
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
-Yes!
-Yes!

143
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,160
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

144
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,960
She's great!

145
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,240
That's great!

146
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,520
The Budding Beauty, Elegance...

147
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,600
-No, Exquisite Elegance.
-Your tongue is all tied up.

148
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,240
Anyway, Dong Shancai's
Plain Flower Candy is the best!

149
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,280
-Come on.
-Come on.

150
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,440
Yes!

151
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,720
Let's watch more.

152
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,800
I'm so tired.

153
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,720
Why is this cooking competition

154
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,280
more tiring and nerve-wracking
than when I competed?

155
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,960
All right. Thank you, judges.

156
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,960
This year's Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition's champion

157
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,680
will be chosen
from these four contestants.

158
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,960
Congratulations again
for advancing to this round.

159
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,920
Please return backstage and take a rest.

160
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,720
Please look forward
to the final deciding round.

161
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,120
I'm furious!

162
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,480
I'm so unlucky!

163
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,800
It doesn't matter if I lost to Caina.

164
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,680
But I couldn't even beat Dong Shancai.

165
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
It's so infuriating!

166
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,760
Hey, did you bribe the judges?

167
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,160
That's right.

168
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,080
I...

169
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,600
It's a fact that you lost to her.

170
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,200
You can't lift yourselves up
by putting others down.

171
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,400
It would just show
how unsportsmanlike you are.

172
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,480
Shancai.

173
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,080
Drink something warm and relax.

174
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,680
Thank you.

175
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,240
Miss Zhou Caina.

176
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,560
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

177
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,920
I'm so nervous.

178
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,120
I'm not sure what the challenge is
for the next round.

179
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,240
You can do it.

180
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,600
-Thank you.
-This is for you.

181
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,480
I'm Meizuo. Nice to meet you.

182
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,040
Excuse me. I still have work to do.

183
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,480
Si, aren't you going to encourage her?

184
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,480
That's right, Si.

185
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,160
You were so excited earlier.

186
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,160
Why aren't you encouraging her now?

187
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,040
Come on. The competition
is about to start again.

188
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,560
Well...

189
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,360
You...

190
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,600
What?

191
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,880
-What?
-Good.

192
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,240
What do you mean "good"?

193
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,320
You did well earlier.

194
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,200
Keep up the good work.
Keep getting great results.

195
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,080
Why are you laughing?
Didn't you ask me to encourage her?

196
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
Hi, all.
Chinese Cuisine Culinary Competition

197
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,360
is brought to you by High-End
Smart Kitchen Electronics.

198
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,880
Can we have our judge, Jang Jinbao,

199
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,480
to discuss the criteria for this round.

200
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,920
Unique traits of a local place
give special features to its people.

201
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,480
Our hometown flavors
always carry us away, lost in reverie.

202
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,120
In the last round,

203
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,480
the contestants will be accepting
the most rigorous challenge.

204
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,480
Listen carefully. For this round,

205
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,600
you have to prepare a special
dish from your hometown

206
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,800
<i>within 45 minutes.</i>

207
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,520
Everybody can make their hometown dishes.

208
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,960
But in just 45 minutes...

209
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,560
Can they make it in time?

210
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,960
That's right.

211
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,680
The dishes we taught Shancai

212
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,080
would take at least two hours to prepare.

213
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,320
Forty-five minutes is very tight.

214
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,960
What are you waiting for?
Aren't you rushing over to your stations?

215
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,640
Zhou Caina is really good.

216
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,920
In such a short amount of time,

217
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,320
she was able to sculpt
a chrysanthemum from a cabbage.

218
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,720
And she looks so confident.

219
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,400
Zhou Caina's flower looks really good.

220
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,520
Hey.

221
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,760
You're not going to the cemetery.
Why do you need a chrysanthemum?

222
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,720
-Si.
-What?

223
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,640
This is not a sculpting competition.
This is a cooking competition.

224
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,440
I think Shancai is having a hard time.

225
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Look.

226
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,280
<i>This is so hard.</i>

227
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,920
<i>A hometown dish in 45 minutes.</i>

228
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,360
<i>The Shanghai dishes I've learned, such as
egg white-topped fried crab on a shell,</i>

229
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,880
<i>salted pork with bamboo shoots soup,
braised Mandarin fish with white sauce,</i>

230
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,560
<i>"Eight Treasure Duck."</i>

231
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,360
<i>They all need a lot of time to make.</i>

232
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,520
<i>Unless, fried river prawn.</i>

233
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,240
<i>No.</i>

234
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,200
<i>Okay. Now we can see
the three contestants have selected</i>

235
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,240
<i>their ingredients
and went back to their stations.</i>

236
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,560
Only Dong Shancai's basket
is still empty until now.

237
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,840
Stupid girl, why are just standing there?

238
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,880
There's not enough time. Move it!

239
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,560
Hey, relax.

240
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,240
Shancai must still be thinking.

241
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,480
You'll only make her panic even more.

242
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,960
-What is he doing?
-Where are you going?

243
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,920
-What's going on?
-What's happening?

244
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,880
Sir, please leave the recording room.

245
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,560
Sorry, sir, we're filming right now.
Please leave.

246
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,760
What are you doing?

247
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,520
Hey.

248
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,280
Shancai.

249
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,040
Shancai.

250
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,320
Everyone, we apologize.

251
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,560
There's been a minor hiccup.

252
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,000
Maybe Miss Shancai's fan
is too passionate.

253
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,920
He went to the cooking stations.

254
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,480
Shancai.

255
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,560
-Shancai!
-Please leave.

256
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,920
Shancai!

257
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,320
-Shancai.
-All right.

258
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,560
<i>I know you're reminding me
that I have to win.</i>

259
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,720
<i>My dad has a one million yuan debt to pay.</i>

260
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,200
<i>I can't just give up.</i>

261
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,200
-Sir, please leave.
-Please go.

262
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,760
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

263
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,080
<i>What should I do?</i>

264
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,120
<i>My brain is completely blank.</i>

265
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
<i>Stupid girl.
Go and choose your ingredients.</i>

266
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,680
<i>Stupid boy. What should I choose?</i>

267
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,680
<i>Stupid girl. Is your brain damaged?
Think about what you should do.</i>

268
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,800
<i>Stupid boy.</i>

269
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,400
<i>It would be good if I know what to do.</i>

270
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,760
<i>Stupid girl.</i>

271
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,240
<i>It doesn't matter
if you forget everything.</i>

272
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,760
<i>Shancai! Release your fighting spirit.</i>

273
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,640
Yes, I have to win.
I have to release my fighting spirit.

274
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,960
I can do it.

275
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
Sorry, sir. Please leave.

276
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,840
-Pineapple?
-Pineapple?

277
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,120
Shancai is so interesting.

278
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,840
Shancai.

279
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,760
You have to believe your strong genes.

280
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,600
The blood of a chef is in you.

281
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,440
Shancai looked so cute
when she closed her eyes.

282
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,400
Cute?

283
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,960
I was terrified for her earlier.

284
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,960
Me too.

285
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,320
I don't know what Shancai
will make with pineapples.

286
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,120
My brother is too involved.

287
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,160
He looked so cute when he barged in.

288
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,200
He really thinks he's her knight
in shining armor.

289
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,840
But I think Shancai has to relax.

290
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,200
Maybe she'll really lose this round.

291
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,520
Shancai, you're going
to lose to me this time.

292
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,760
Why?

293
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,160
Because I know how delicious
a dish would taste

294
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,560
just by looking at it.

295
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,720
I already feel very lucky for being able
to stay in the competition until now.

296
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,480
Maybe I can depend on my luck
to keep winning.

297
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,760
Luck will not always be on your side.

298
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,160
<i>All right.</i>

299
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,120
<i>The last round of our Chinese
Cuisine Culinary Competition,</i>

300
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,840
<i>Hometown Dish, only has two minutes left.</i>

301
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,360
<i>Time's up.</i>

302
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,880
<i>Please stop cooking
and get ready to present your dishes.</i>

303
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,760
DONG SHANCAI

304
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,640
ZHOU CAINA

305
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,520
LUO QIANNI

306
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,760
LING CHENXI

307
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,120
All right. We're going into the very
intense part of our competition.

308
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,000
Our judges are already
starting to taste the dishes

309
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,240
prepared by our contestants.

310
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,320
What surprised me

311
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,560
was that Wenchang Chicken
usually needs to be soaked in broth

312
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,840
for at least three hours

313
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,960
before it can produce such rich flavor.

314
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,120
Miss Zhou Caina, may I ask

315
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,000
how did you use 45 minutes
to complete this dish so beautifully?

316
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,560
It's easy.

317
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,080
I used chicken bones and a large
amount of chicken wings.

318
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,280
I also added onions,
mushrooms, potatoes and cooked them all

319
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,000
at the right temperature.

320
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,760
That way, the soup cooked in 20 minutes
can also have a rich taste.

321
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,320
Just the way the chicken was cut

322
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,280
is already very impressive.

323
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,600
How did you achieve
such good cutting skills?

324
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,760
When I studied abroad,

325
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,880
I didn't want my family
to pay for my living expenses.

326
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,320
I always went to the market

327
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,320
-and bought the chicken bones.
-Who wants to listen

328
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,240
-to her nonsense?
-After a long period of time,

329
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,280
-I cut all the meat
-If Shancai's the one talking,

330
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,680
-from the bones
-he won't be mad.

331
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,440
and made Kung Pao Chicken for my friends.

332
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,520
This dish is quite excellent.

333
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,160
-Luo Qianni's stewed pigeon
-She is so perfect to receive

334
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,520
-has a nice flavor.
-such praises from Mingde's alumni.

335
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,880
The Chinese Yam is so soft.

336
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,680
-Can you tell us how you made the pigeon
-You're exaggerating.

337
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,040
-so flavorful in such a short time?
-I'm not.

338
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,840
-Not at all.
-Covering the bowl with salt...

339
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,480
If I were the judge, I'll choose her now.

340
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,840
We're in sync, all right.

341
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,080
The pigeon meat
would be even more delicious.

342
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,680
Next, judges, please taste the dish
prepared by our last contestant,

343
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,360
Dong Shancai.

344
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,520
May I ask what this is?

345
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,520
This is "Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles."

346
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,360
Why are you laughing?

347
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,240
Didn't they tell her to make
famous hometown dishes?

348
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,680
Because "Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles"
is too common.

349
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,760
Didn't Shancai train at Daoming Si's
house for a long time?

350
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,280
Why did she make such a common dish?

351
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,600
Yes.

352
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,040
Dear,

353
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,840
did you teach her how to make
this "Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles"?

354
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,480
No.

355
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,760
Why did she think of making this dish?

356
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,440
Are you from Shanghai?

357
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,040
Yes.

358
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,080
I grew up in Shanghai.

359
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,040
Every time I got sick and had no appetite,

360
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,200
I would gain my appetite back

361
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,880
after I ate
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles."

362
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,440
However, other contestants

363
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,320
prepared well-known dishes
that are hard to make.

364
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,760
Yet you made this snack.

365
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,840
Aren't you afraid of losing?

366
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,200
I am. Of course I am.

367
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,280
But I feel

368
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,600
that regardless
if it's a hard or easy dish,

369
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,200
it would be able to rise up
to the challenge

370
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,040
as long as it has its unique quality.

371
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,120
There's a reason why

372
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,560
you won't get tired of eating
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles"

373
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,320
even if you eat it every day.

374
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,520
I think the flavor is quite unique.

375
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,880
Did you add pineapples?

376
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,240
Yes.

377
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,080
You added pineapples?

378
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,640
How did you think of that?

379
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,920
Based on my personal experiences.

380
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,960
Apparently, Miss Shancai's experiences
are different from others.

381
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,640
Maybe someone in her family
plants pineapples.

382
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,280
You were the one who inspired her, right?

383
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,480
Who knows?

384
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,920
I just wanted to encourage her.

385
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,640
Who knew she wouldn't be able
to contain her inspiration

386
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,000
when she saw me?

387
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,240
What? Isn't that possible?

388
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,200
Of course it is.

389
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,440
Of course, nobody can beat true love.

390
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,400
Even though that's a very honest answer,

391
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,400
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles"

392
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,760
might be her dad's provided work meal.

393
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,440
Look at the expression
on the judges' faces.

394
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,000
Would they be convinced by her?

395
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,960
The results will be announced soon.
I'm so nervous.

396
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,000
Don't worry.

397
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,280
Shancai would surely win.

398
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,440
Don't look at me that way.

399
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,760
Because I'll vomit.

400
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,200
All right. Can we have
our judges come to the stage

401
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,400
to comment on the performance
of today's contestants

402
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,480
and award the winner.

403
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,840
The result is in my hands.

404
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm as excited as you all are
at this very moment.

405
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,480
Because the four contestants
all performed very well,

406
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,440
especially two of them,

407
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,200
let me just provide some simple comments.

408
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,360
Earlier, Qianni's Huangshan Stewed Pigeon

409
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,920
was a very refreshing soup.

410
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,200
It's such a shame
that the meat was too tough.

411
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,600
For Chenxi,

412
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,800
it's really hard for her to make

413
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,880
Buddha's Temptation in such a short time.

414
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,120
Too bad that the cooking temperature
was not right.

415
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,960
That Hainan Wenchang Chicken dish

416
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,640
prepared by Miss Zhou Caina earlier

417
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,200
is perfect in every way,

418
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,920
including her cooking skills.

419
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,480
The plating, the substance
and flavor of the dish.

420
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,120
Miss Dong Shancai's performance

421
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,520
is also remarkable, right?

422
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,440
Yes.

423
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,960
She put pineapples into the most common
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles" dish,

424
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,520
that reduced the spiciness
for those who don't like spicy food.

425
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,320
It's a very creative move.

426
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,360
Hey.

427
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,880
-Why can't she be direct?
-Miss Shancai was able to get rid of

428
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,200
the old idea and focus on
the uniqueness of common dishes.

429
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,400
She embodies the creative spirit
of our Chinese Cuisine.

430
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,560
Thank you.

431
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,760
Next, our judges will announce

432
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,600
today's winner.

433
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,240
-Why can't you watch it?
<i>-Now, the winner</i>

434
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,600
-I can't.
<i>-of the Chinese Cuisine</i>

435
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,400
<i>-Culinary Competition is chosen.</i>
-Watch it.

436
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,200
<i>Who will win the one million yuan
cash prize?</i>

437
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,680
Ms. Zhuang.

438
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,480
Based on overall performance,

439
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,040
Shancai's chances of winning are not high.

440
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,560
It doesn't matter
whether she wins or loses.

441
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,640
My brother obviously likes this girl.

442
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,000
I have to acknowledge her too.

443
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,240
Regardless of who wins or loses tonight,
we have to celebrate.

444
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,120
The winner...

445
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,440
It's Miss Zhou Caina.

446
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,720
All right. Congratulations, Caina!

447
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,960
Caina, please step forward.

448
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,920
CHAMPION ZHOU CAINA

449
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,840
You're not allowed to clap for her.

450
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,360
Next, can we have the judges

451
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,920
to award the trophy
and prize money to Caina.

452
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,640
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

453
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,520
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

454
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,440
Thank you.

455
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,760
Thank you to all the judges.

456
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,000
And thank you to everyone
for liking my dishes.

457
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,880
Actually, the contestants in this
cooking competition are all exceptional.

458
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,680
But I still believe that I'll be
the champion for the whole competition

459
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,160
because I believe
that as long as I work hard,

460
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,080
my dream will come true.

461
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,520
Again, thank you, everyone.

462
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,360
All right, up next,

463
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,640
we'll request Mingde University's
most beautiful alumni, Tang Jingmei,

464
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,560
to announce
the Special Prize winner today.

465
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,040
We especially made an exception this time

466
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,640
to select a special prize winner,

467
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,520
who will get 500,000 yuan cash prize,

468
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,840
in order to serve as encouragement

469
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,920
for her persistent
and outstanding performance.

470
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,720
And she's also my junior in school,

471
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,200
Miss Dong Shancai.

472
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,360
Congratulations!

473
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,840
SPECIAL PRIZE, DONG SHANCAI

474
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,240
Dong Shancai, well done!

475
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,840
-I knew you could do it!
-Hey.

476
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,400
You're acting nuts!

477
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,520
-Good job, Shancai!
-Now, we'll award Shancai

478
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,840
the prize money and certificate.

479
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,760
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

480
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,120
Shancai, say a few words.

481
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,880
Actually,

482
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,360
I never thought

483
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
that I can compete together

484
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,480
with such outstanding contestants,

485
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,200
Zhou Caina.

486
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,400
She really deserves to win.

487
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,960
I...

488
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,200
In receiving this award,

489
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,320
I would like to thank

490
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,040
all the people that have helped me.

491
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
Thank you to Ms. Zhuang.

492
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,800
Thank you to all my good friends.

493
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,600
Ten days ago,

494
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
I still wasn't brave enough
to accept this challenge.

495
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,720
I was afraid that I would lose.

496
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,400
It would be too humiliating.

497
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,400
Thankfully, there's someone

498
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,480
who always encouraged me

499
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,760
and supported me

500
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,720
without expecting anything in return.

501
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,960
Thank you.

502
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,800
All right. Congratulations, Shancai.

503
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,520
Next, we'd like to invite our ambassadors

504
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,920
to present flowers
to these two contestants.

505
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,680
All right, Shancai!

506
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,080
Cheer for her.

507
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,480
All right. Thank you to the brilliant
performance of all our contestants.

508
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,920
And thank you to all the judges
for their amazing support.

509
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,720
This year's Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition

510
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,240
has now ended.

511
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,320
Let's keep promoting
the spirit of Chinese cuisine

512
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,560
so that it would spread throughout
all of China and the whole world.

513
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,960
We'll see you again next time.

514
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,200
Shancai.

515
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,360
Good job!

516
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,520
I knew you could do it!

517
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,040
Shancai, well done!

518
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
She won!

519
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,400
-That's great!
-Shancai is the best!

520
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,120
Our daughter won the special prize.

521
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,360
She earned a lot of money!

522
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,280
Yes.

523
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,160
Hello?

524
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,120
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles"?

525
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,520
Yes.

526
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,840
You mean the noodles
my daughter cooked earlier, right?

527
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,240
Of course we have it.

528
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,840
Let me tell you,
I taught her how to cook that.

529
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,120
Yes.

530
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,200
When can we sell it?

531
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,440
Tomorrow is fine. We'll sell it tomorrow.

532
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,120
But you have to be quick.

533
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,800
This dish is limited edition.

534
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,680
You...

535
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,600
All right.

536
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,960
-Somebody just ordered it?
-Yes.

537
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,960
Dear.

538
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,000
Do you think we should give
this special noodle dish a powerful name?

539
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,920
Yes.

540
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,560
-It should be popular right away.
-Yes.

541
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,600
We'll call it Powerful Noodles.

542
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,080
It's too short. It's not powerful enough.

543
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,040
Then we can name it something longer.

544
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,760
I know.

545
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,000
We'll call it Dong Shancai Chinese Cuisine

546
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,160
Special Prize

547
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,760
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles."

548
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,560
That's so powerful!

549
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,480
Dear, I knew you were smart.

550
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,520
This name is so great!

551
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,600
-I've forgotten it now.
-Dong Shancai.

552
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,920
Dong Danian's daughter.

553
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,920
-No.
-Isn't the name--

554
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,320
Dong Shancai Chinese Cuisine Special Prize

555
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,920
-"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles."
-"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles."

556
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,640
This is the "Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles"
that I prepared.

557
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,160
Si, you inspired me to make this dish.

558
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,760
Do you want to try it first?

559
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,760
That's right.

560
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,800
How can we dare eat it
if you haven't tried it?

561
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,920
Shancai.

562
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,960
Shancai.

563
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,320
What you just said is as hilarious
as your pineapple head.

564
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,920
Based on my personal experiences...

565
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,960
We told you to eat.
What are you waiting for?

566
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,080
All right. I'll eat it.

567
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,320
It's a bit spicy,

568
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,200
but it's quite good.

569
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,760
This flavor should be paired
with red wine.

570
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,600
It's delicious.
I like this level of spiciness.

571
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,720
The pineapple's sweetness
balanced the grease of the noodles.

572
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,320
Well...

573
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,800
Actually,

574
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,720
I'm very thankful
for the experiences I gained

575
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,800
from the preparation
until the actual competition.

576
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,080
Thank you for helping me, Ms. Zhuang

577
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,800
and everyone.

578
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,400
So thank you to all of you.

579
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,760
<i>It's so strange.</i>

580
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,320
<i>Why am I more nervous now
with that guy staring at me</i>

581
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
<i>than when I was at the competition?</i>

582
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,960
Come with me for a while.
I want to tell you something.

583
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,520
You don't need to leave. We'll leave.

584
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
Come. Follow me.

585
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,640
Ms. Zhuang, are we going to buy some wine?

586
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,840
Enough talking. Let's just go.

587
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,720
-Okay.
-You all don't need to go.

588
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,760
I'll say it in front of all of you.

589
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,160
Shancai.

590
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,720
Spend the day with me tomorrow.

591
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,960
Who asks someone out on a date
in front of everyone?

592
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,680
Why should we date in secret?

593
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,200
Didn't you want to thank me?

594
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,360
If you really want to thank me,

595
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,960
then spend the day with me.

596
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,640
All right. Let's all spend
the day together.

597
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,000
My schedule is full tomorrow.

598
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,400
I have a tea ceremony tomorrow morning.

599
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,680
At night, I have to discuss
some things with Ella,

600
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,600
Selina, and Hebe.

601
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,360
I have to set up our exhibit
tomorrow morning.

602
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,120
Then I have a date at night.

603
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,240
Huaze Lei, you're always free, right?

604
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,000
He's going shopping with me tomorrow.

605
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,800
See?

606
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,800
I'm the only one available to go
on a date with you.

607
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,760
All right. Let's not talk about it first.

608
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,200
I'll make a toast first

609
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,080
to thank everyone for supporting me.
Bottoms up.

610
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,240
Hey, Shancai.

611
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,560
That alcohol is really strong.

612
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,280
You're sober now?

613
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,280
Check it out. What do you think?

614
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,600
What is this?

615
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,280
DONG SHANCAI EIGHT TREASURE SPICY NOODLES

616
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,120
That's right.

617
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,960
It's honorably named as Dong Shancai
Chinese Cuisine Special Prize

618
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,280
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles."

619
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,800
Please validate
the Dong Shancai authenticity logo.

620
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,160
Where did you find such an ugly picture?

621
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,080
Is it ugly?

622
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,040
It's so pretty! I even edited it.

623
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,000
-See how small your face is.
-That's right.

624
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,600
Come on.

625
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,520
-Help me record it.
-Come on.

626
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,720
-Record what?
-Advertisement.

627
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,880
Your mom and I practiced
the whole morning.

628
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,800
Record it properly.

629
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,320
Can we start?

630
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,040
When people become old,

631
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,560
they often have no appetite
and have poor digestion.

632
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,040
Sea cucumber, abalone, lobster

633
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,560
are not appetizing to them.

634
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,200
Dear.

635
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,720
Guess what I made for you?

636
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,760
Could it be Dong Shancai Chinese
Cuisine Special Prize

637
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,480
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles"?

638
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,040
That's right.

639
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,240
After eating Dong Shancai Chinese
Cuisine Special Prize

640
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,160
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles",
your back would not ache,

641
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,440
your legs would not cramp up

642
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,960
and your memory will improve.

643
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,720
It'll help you pass the English exam.

644
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,640
Your mom wouldn't need to worry
about your studies anymore.

645
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,120
Dong Shancai
Chinese Cuisine Special Prize,

646
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,480
"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles."

647
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,000
Awaken your sleeping taste buds.

648
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,240
A gentle reminder.

649
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,400
Please eat the noodles in a civilized way.

650
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,040
Don't slurp it up.

651
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,000
-How is it?
-How is it?

652
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,920
-All right. I have to go.
-Let me see.

653
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,800
The orders will start coming in
at 10:00 a.m.

654
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,400
What? It's 10:00 a.m.?

655
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,920
Sorry.

656
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,040
Are you hurt, kid?

657
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,200
I'm a man. I don't get hurt that easily.

658
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,880
Little boy,

659
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,280
what are you doing in front of my house?

660
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,680
"Mrs. Dong,

661
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,200
I'm Mrs. Wang from next door.

662
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,960
The company suddenly asked me
to do overtime work tonight.

663
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,560
I can't take care of my kid.

664
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,760
The nanny is not here either.

665
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,840
Please help me take care of him today.

666
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,240
His name is Xiao Long.

667
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,360
He's very nice. Thank you."

668
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
So you're Mrs. Wong's kid from next door.

669
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,400
Who are you?

670
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,000
I'm Mrs. Dong's daughter.

671
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,680
You can call me Shancai.

672
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,880
Shancai, bring me home.

673
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,640
I'm busy.

674
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,560
My parents went to Hangzhou
to buy something.

675
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,520
Think. Do you know any other neighbors?

676
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,520
No.

677
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,680
It's fine. Nobody cares about me anyway.

678
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,920
It's best if I get lost.

679
