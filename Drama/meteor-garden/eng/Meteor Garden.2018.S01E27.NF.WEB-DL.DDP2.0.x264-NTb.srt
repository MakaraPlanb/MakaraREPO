EPISODE 27

3
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,120
Shancai has arrived, ma'am.

4
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,160
-Ask her to come in.
-Yes.

5
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,120
Please come in.

6
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,960
Bag.

7
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,040
You're all sweaty from running.

8
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,200
Have some tea.

9
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,680
I brought them from London.

10
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,320
There's no need.

11
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,080
I'll leave after I speak my piece.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,480
I like your style.

13
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,200
Then let's get straight to the point.

14
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,720
I'll agree to all your conditions.

15
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,960
Please stop destroying my friends' lives.

16
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
Mr. Fang? It's me.

17
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
Cancel all of my instructions.

18
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,560
What will you do for me?

19
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,080
I'll leave immediately.

20
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,440
I'll cut my ties

21
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,880
with Daoming Si from now on.

22
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,240
Satisfied?

23
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Then why are you still standing there?

24
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,760
Maybe you're a successful businesswoman.

25
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,480
A person in the Forbes' billionaire list.

26
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,120
But you use people as tools

27
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,320
to achieve your goals
with the power you possess

28
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,360
and destroy life's precious things.

29
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,680
You're even more despicable
than a criminal.

30
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,240
Life's precious things?

31
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,280
Don't tell me you're talking about
love and family.

32
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,400
Kid.

33
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,160
You're wasting my time.

34
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,600
Do you know

35
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,920
that the time I spent listening
to your joke

36
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,520
is enough to close a business deal

37
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,480
that your family

38
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,960
cannot even earn in three generations?

39
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,640
No matter how nice your make-up is,

40
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,240
it cannot hide your ugly face.

41
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,280
Do you know the price you'll pay
for saying that?

42
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,880
Do whatever you want.

43
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,400
But I'm telling you.

44
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,760
No matter how you break me,

45
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,960
I will continue to pick myself up.

46
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,320
But if you dare to hurt my friends,

47
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,600
I won't let you off easily.

48
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,040
You bitch.

49
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,520
Why is Shancai not back yet?

50
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,880
It's already eight o'clock.

51
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,440
At this time,

52
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,680
she should have already started working.

53
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,560
Mrs. Yu.

54
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,120
Shancai came back earlier.

55
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,880
She came and left?

56
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,400
Yes, she seemed to be in a hurry.

57
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,680
Why would she be in a hurry?

58
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,640
Where's the president?

59
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,520
She left and went back to London.

60
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,120
TO MRS. YU

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,920
<i>Mrs. Yu,</i>

62
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,760
<i>my parents suddenly asked me
to go back to the province.</i>

63
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,520
<i>So I have to leave today.</i>

64
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,720
<i>I hope you understand</i>

65
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,400
<i>how much I miss my family
and want to be with them.</i>

66
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,720
<i>I'm very sorry for being so selfish.</i>

67
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,640
<i>Thank you for taking care of me.</i>

68
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,880
<i>You treated me like my own grandma.</i>

69
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,120
<i>I will never forget you.</i>

70
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,120
<i>I'm really grateful.</i>

71
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,280
<i>Shancai.</i>

72
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why are you standing here?

73
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,960
Why are you all drenched? Let's go home.

74
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,760
I want to tell you something.

75
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,560
What's the matter?

76
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,360
I...

77
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,920
I can't see you anymore.

78
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,160
What are you talking about?

79
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,760
I'm leaving your house tonight.

80
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,920
Why are you acting like this?

81
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,000
Didn't we go to the Rabbit Hole together?

82
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,760
So sweet.

83
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,000
How do you eat these things?

84
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,440
Cakes are supposed to be sweet.

85
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,440
You even said you want us to be balanced.

86
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,880
And told me not to move out.

87
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,400
We're lovers.

88
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,000
The effort we put in the relationship
should be balanced.

89
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,560
If I'm too reliant on you,

90
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,200
we'll lose this balance.

91
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,280
Have you forgotten already?

92
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,960
I didn't forget.

93
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,600
Then what's going on?

94
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,720
Turns out you didn't want me
to protect you

95
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,240
because you wanted to break up with me?

96
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,640
No.

97
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,560
I meant everything I said.

98
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,920
I meant it when I told you
I wanted to be your girlfriend.

99
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,080
Then why?

100
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,280
Tell me what's wrong.

101
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
You're saying this out of the blue.

102
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
I can't accept it!

103
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Your mom said

104
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,880
that if I continue seeing you,

105
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,640
she'll make Qinghe and Xiaoyou's
dads lose their jobs.

106
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,240
I'll talk to her now.

107
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,320
Don't!

108
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,760
I've already decided

109
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,760
to have nothing to do
with the Daoming family.

110
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,920
I've decided not to contact you.

111
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,760
I can't accept it.

112
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,560
You're leaving me because
of such a lousy reason.

113
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,080
That's nonsense!

114
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,600
Shancai.

115
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,680
Do you really think I'm a useless guy?

116
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,960
Forget about my family, my mom,

117
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,960
and everything else.

118
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,680
Have you ever thought of me
as a worthy guy?

119
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,200
<i>Yes.</i>

120
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,840
<i>Since a long time ago.</i>

121
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,560
Stop!

122
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,400
Stop it!

123
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,440
<i>At that time,</i>

124
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,560
<i>to me,</i>

125
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
<i>you're not the successor
of the Daoming Group</i>

126
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,200
<i>or Daoming Feng's son.</i>

127
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,000
Stupid girl.

128
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,240
Good thing I came here early.

129
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,520
Or else what would you do?

130
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,840
You stupid boy!

131
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,640
Why didn't you fight back?

132
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,640
If I fought back,

133
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,440
then I would really lose.

134
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,120
<i>You're just an overbearing,</i>

135
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,880
<i>innocent, kind and gentle man.</i>

136
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,800
I'll put it on for you.

137
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,720
No. It's too expensive.
I can't accept this.

138
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,960
Don't move.

139
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,440
Shancai.

140
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,200
Be my girlfriend.

141
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,760
<i>I was naive</i>

142
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,280
<i>thinking that I can forget everything
and just be with you.</i>

143
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,160
<i>However...</i>

144
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,560
No.

145
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,560
Not even once.

146
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,840
If I really like you,

147
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,120
I wouldn't leave you.

148
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
I should go now.

149
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,080
Bye.

150
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,200
Shancai.

151
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,440
<i>I can't stop walking.</i>

152
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,920
<i>I can't turn back.</i>

153
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,840
<i>If I hesitate,</i>

154
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,240
<i>I'd run into Daoming Si's arms.</i>

155
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,120
<i>If that happens,</i>

156
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,240
<i>the harsh words I tried so hard
to tell him would be in vain.</i>

157
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,440
<i>I'm getting numb.</i>

158
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,440
<i>Aside from the pain of my heart
being torn apart,</i>

159
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
<i>I can't feel</i>

160
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,960
<i>anything else.</i>

161
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,120
Mr. Lu, why don't we have water?

162
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,080
That's right.

163
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,520
This house's pipes are old.
There's nothing we can do.

164
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,560
The pipes burst from the heavy rain.

165
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,720
But don't worry.

166
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,760
Well...

167
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,560
Terence said that he'll take care of it
by wrapping the pipes.

168
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,040
He's outside right now.

169
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,480
He should be done soon.

170
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,640
He's here again?

171
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,560
Yes.

172
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,080
It's good that he's here.

173
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,880
I can go and rest.

174
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,080
It's raining so heavily. Go inside.

175
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,240
I'll be done soon. Go back inside.

176
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,480
Go back inside.

177
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,680
No.

178
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,520
Have some ginger tea.

179
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,160
Did you make it?

180
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,520
It's good.

181
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,000
Let me guess.

182
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,920
You added brown sugar,
lemon, and a little cola.

183
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,760
And a special flavor.

184
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,400
Is it sesame?

185
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,360
Am I right?

186
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,120
You're good.

187
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,320
I'll give you some more.

188
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,120
My heart is already warm.

189
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,600
You got drenched because of me

190
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,520
and fixed our pipes.

191
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,920
I think anyone with that much compassion

192
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,080
would do something seeing you this way.

193
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,600
So you're taking pity on me?

194
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,560
Yes.

195
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,720
I guess so.

196
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,160
Caina.

197
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,560
Actually,

198
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,920
I've always wanted to tell you...

199
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,080
Tell me what?

200
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,760
-Sorry.
-It's fine.

201
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,160
Do you want to take a shower?

202
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,160
There's no need.

203
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,600
Hello? Meizuo.

204
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,560
There's a visitor in your house?

205
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,800
Yes. It's Terence.

206
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,560
Terence is in your house?

207
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
<i>He's taking a shower?</i>

208
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,840
No. I asked him to, but he refused.

209
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,000
No.

210
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,280
That's not what I meant.

211
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,520
Why am I...

212
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,520
I can't explain now.
I'll hang up now. Bye.

213
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,160
I'll get going.

214
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,720
Good night, Caina.

215
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
MINGDE UNIVERSITY

216
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,520
<i>Sorry. The subscriber you called
does not answer.</i>

217
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,600
<i>Please try again later.</i>

218
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,840
Si, why did Shancai disappear?

219
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Wasn't she staying with you all this time?

220
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,280
Isn't your relationship going well?

221
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,000
Why would she disappear?

222
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,160
Did you make her mad again?

223
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,800
Daoming Si.

224
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,240
Where's Shancai?

225
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,760
She has no home and no money.

226
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,360
How would she survive?

227
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,400
Is it because of what happened
a few days ago?

228
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,880
Shancai sacrificed herself

229
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,760
to protect them, right?

230
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,840
It looks like what happened
to Xiaoyou's family and mine

231
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
-is all because of your mom?
-Shut up.

232
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,720
Shut up? Daoming Si.

233
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,280
Why did you let your mom
do such a thing to us?

234
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,200
Why did she do such a thing to Shancai?

235
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
What did Shancai sacrifice?

236
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,560
Where exactly is she?
Why can't you protect her?

237
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,480
I said shut up! Don't you get that?

238
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,800
-Si.
-Si.

239
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,040
Did you see the look on Si's face?

240
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
It's the same as before.

241
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,240
The old Si is back again.

242
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,040
Didn't Shancai contact you?

243
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,040
No. I'm also very worried.

244
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,040
I can't reach her.

245
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,280
Why did she suddenly disappear?

246
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,240
Actually,

247
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,520
I heard

248
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,400
that Shancai left because of us.

249
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,200
I knew it was strange.

250
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,000
My dad was sued.

251
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,320
After Shancai disappeared,

252
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,720
the lawsuit was withdrawn.

253
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,960
That's right.

254
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,480
After Shancai left my house,

255
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,400
my dad received a call saying he doesn't
need to work in Qinghai anymore.

256
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,440
It must be because of Daoming Si's mom.

257
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,120
How can she do that?

258
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,480
She used us to deal with Shancai.

259
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,480
Because of us, Shancai...

260
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,680
But she never said a word.

261
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,960
That's what she always does.

262
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,320
She silently helps us.

263
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,000
She never complains even when
she's carrying such a heavy burden.

264
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,920
Actually, I don't think it's our fault.

265
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,080
Daoming Si's mom knows that Shancai
values her friends.

266
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,320
That's why she used it to her advantage.

267
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,080
Isn't Daoming Si going to do
anything about it?

268
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,080
Don't mention that scumbag.

269
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
Shancai left.

270
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,480
Daoming Si didn't say anything
and wouldn't let us look for her.

271
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,080
She didn't file a leave with the school.
What if she gets expelled?

272
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,280
But did Daoming Si really act that way?

273
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,240
Yes. I'm so furious!

274
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,400
I shouldn't have entrusted Shancai
to that guy.

275
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,320
You're Shancai's best friends.

276
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,360
Tell me. I'm more suitable
for Shancai than Daoming Si

277
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,800
and I can make her happier, right?

278
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,080
Qinghe.

279
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,640
We can see that you really like Shancai.

280
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,920
That's right.

281
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,200
I like Shancai the most.

282
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,680
I wonder where Shancai is.

283
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,520
Is she out crying because of that bastard?

284
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,880
Yes. I wonder how she's doing,

285
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,640
whether she's cold or hungry.

286
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,640
I wish she'd contact us soon.

287
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,440
I'm really worried about her.

288
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,520
<i>Goodbye, Daoming Si.</i>

289
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,440
<i>Goodbye, Mingde University.</i>

290
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,160
Dad.

291
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,160
It's late. What's the matter?

292
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,560
<i>Caina.</i>

293
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,880
<i>When are you coming back to California?</i>

294
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,080
Something came up.

295
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,160
I'm busy.

296
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,160
<i>You're busy?</i>

297
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,920
<i>What are you busy with?</i>

298
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,200
<i>Your marriage with Tian Ye
was cancelled all of a sudden.</i>

299
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,480
<i>Our relatives keep asking me about it.</i>

300
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,520
<i>Well...</i>

301
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
<i>I feel so humiliated.</i>

302
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,120
I have my own thoughts regarding marriage.

303
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
<i>All right.</i>

304
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,920
<i>Since you're not planning to get married,
come back immediately.</i>

305
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,880
<i>Our company needs your help.</i>

306
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,440
Dad.

307
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,680
I don't want to work in our own company.

308
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,880
I want to stay in Shanghai.

309
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,400
<i>Stay in Shanghai?</i>

310
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,800
<i>What do you plan to do in Shanghai?</i>

311
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,360
There are lots of things I can do.

312
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,720
For example,
our ancestral house is so old.

313
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,000
You've always wanted
to renovate it, right?

314
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,600
<i>Caina.</i>

315
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,400
<i>This house was your great grandfather's.</i>

316
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,280
<i>Your mom kept trying to hire
that famous designer.</i>

317
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,520
<i>But she couldn't get him to work on it.</i>

318
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,400
<i>How can you do that?</i>

319
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,080
Dad.

320
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,360
Can I stay in Shanghai
if I can get that famous designer?

321
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,520
<i>That's impossible.</i>

322
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,560
Miss, who are you looking for?

323
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,880
Hi, I'm looking for Mr. Ye.

324
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,920
May I know your name?

325
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,600
I'm Zhou's Development--

326
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,880
Don't construction companies
like you ever get tired?

327
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,680
There's no one by that name here.
Just leave.

328
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,280
Wait.

329
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,160
I'm not representing any company.

330
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,200
I must see Mr. Ye today.

331
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,680
You people come here
without setting an appointment.

332
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,800
Either you're a nouveau riche
who wants your mansion designed

333
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,280
or a construction company

334
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,680
who wants to use Mr. Ye's name
to sell your properties.

335
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,880
I've seen a lot of people.

336
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
Don't come again.

337
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,600
Mr. Ye would not see you.

338
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,280
Terence?

339
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,080
Why are you here?

340
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,000
Are you stalking me?

341
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,640
Mr. Ye.

342
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,480
Do you know her?

343
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,520
She's my friend, Ms. Zhou Caina.

344
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,720
She's my assistant, Ding Qi.

345
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,960
She's very good.

346
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,400
Ding Qi, coffee for me please.

347
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,680
Your assistant is so fierce.

348
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,320
Actually, not a lot of strangers
come here,

349
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,520
especially beautiful girls like you.

350
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,080
How did you find me?

351
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,920
Or should I say,

352
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,680
how did you find out about me?

353
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,600
I didn't.

354
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,040
I just met you by chance earlier.

355
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,920
I don't even know your real name.

356
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,040
I just know your English name is Terence.

357
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,840
Who knew you're the famous Ye Mingchuan?

358
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,560
Are you mad?

359
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,280
Why should I be mad?

360
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,680
Actually, I didn't mean
to hide it from you.

361
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,840
I wanted to tell you so many times.

362
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,720
However, you didn't seem to be interested.

363
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,680
Indeed.

364
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,560
I'm not interested in you.

365
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,960
-I came for Ye Mingchuan to--
-Mr. Ye.

366
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,680
Mr. Ye. You have an important phone call.

367
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,320
Excuse me for a while.

368
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Help me entertain her.

369
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,320
Thank you. Sorry to bother you.

370
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,600
Never mind.

371
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,600
If you're not here,
I wouldn't be bothered.

372
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,560
Are you...

373
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,640
Mr. Ye's girlfriend?

374
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,680
No.

375
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,320
I came here to ask Mr. Ye

376
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,200
to do an interior design project.

377
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,680
You want Mr. Ye
to design an ordinary house?

378
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,960
It's not ordinary.
Ours is an ancestral victorian house.

379
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,600
We need him to redesign it.

380
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,880
So what?

381
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,560
Do you know how many

382
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,640
large-scale international
cases he rejected?

383
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,280
How can he design your house?

384
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,440
So, it's not possible?

385
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,800
My goodness. Don't you get it?

386
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,080
A famous designer like Mr. Ye

387
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,720
would not accept an ordinary

388
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,800
residential or commercial project
no matter how much your offer is.

389
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,400
Do you understand?

390
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,160
Sorry.

391
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,760
I was too inconsiderate.

392
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,160
Caina.

393
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,920
Where are you going?

394
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,600
What's the matter?

395
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,280
I shouldn't be here.

396
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,000
Then why did you come here?

397
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,320
I wanted to find a master
to do something he wouldn't do.

398
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
I can help you.

399
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,880
<i>"Ye Mingchuan."</i>

400
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,800
RENOWNED ARCHITECT

401
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,400
He graduated from
Catalonia Polytechnic University

402
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,560
with an Architectural Doctorate Degree.

403
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,240
He joined the International Architectural
Design Exhibit when he was 28.

404
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,280
With his brilliant design work,

405
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,720
he received the 2011 Florence
Architecture Gold Award.

406
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,080
In 2012,

407
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,800
he received the Notre Dame
Architecture Gold Award.

408
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,560
But on one condition.

409
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,320
The design, construction,
and budget of your house

410
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,880
are all up to me, all right?

411
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,800
Of course.

412
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,480
Is he such a world-class designer?

413
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,080
I even treated him like a plumber.

414
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,640
And I didn't even pay him.

415
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,160
-Well...
-Mr. Lu.

416
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,440
Stop it.

417
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,560
Isn't this embarrassing enough?

418
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,320
But at least I can tell my dad

419
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,200
that I found the designer
he's been looking for.

420
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,320
I can stay in Shanghai.

421
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,960
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO LATELY?

422
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,960
ARE YOU FREE?

423
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,040
-Any plans for tonight?
-I don't know.

424
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,560
You haven't dealt with your rival yet?

425
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,160
What rival?

426
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,120
I don't consider him a rival at all.

427
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,560
<i>Sorry. Just saw your message.</i>

428
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,120
<i>I'm fine.</i>

429
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,440
<i>That day with Terence
was a misunderstanding.</i>

430
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,040
<i>He just came to my house to fix the pipes.</i>

431
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,440
I knew it.

432
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,000
With him?

433
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,840
I don't think he's that fast.

434
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,080
When have you ever let a girl
decide your fate?

435
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,720
Never, but...

436
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,240
Caina is different.

437
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,440
I don't want to scare her away
that quickly.

438
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,280
That's why I prolonged my plan.

439
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,120
You haven't used any tricks yet?

440
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,400
Meizuo.

441
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,280
Why are you being so polite?

442
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,760
Are you becoming like Si?

443
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,360
What? This is what you call strategy.

444
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,360
But now,

445
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,480
since that guy is making his moves,

446
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,440
I'll also make mine.

447
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,560
Huaze Lei.

448
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,840
Please take care of it.

449
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,640
You mean you want me
to use that old trick?

450
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,720
But that's a killer move.

451
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,320
Still no news from Shancai?

452
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,480
None.

453
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,200
My phone was on the whole night.

454
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,800
I was afraid I'd miss her message.

455
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,160
But there was none.

456
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,240
Where do you think she went?

457
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,560
Isn't that Ximen?

458
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,440
Ximen.

459
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,720
Ximen, bro!

460
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,880
Who's your bro?

461
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,280
You are. We're so close already.

462
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,400
Ximen.

463
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,600
Any news from Shancai?

464
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,280
I don't know where she is.

465
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,520
So she didn't contact you either.

466
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,560
How about Daoming Si?

467
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,960
Did he try to find her?

468
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,880
Now, Si's who I'm most worried about.

469
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,440
Tell me.

470
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,280
Should I really confess to him?

471
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,760
Go if you like him.

472
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,320
But...

473
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,200
I heard he's dating Shancai.

474
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,880
I heard that he already dumped her.

475
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,280
Really?

476
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,600
Grab the opportunity now.

477
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,360
Daoming Si's coming. Come on.

478
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,320
Go.

479
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,440
Daoming Si.

480
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,400
I made this cake myself for you.

481
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,880
I hope you'll accept it.

482
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,600
He accepted it. She succeeded.

483
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,160
Actually, I started liking you
a long time ago.

484
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,920
I spent all night making this.

485
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,280
If Dong Shancai didn't keep bothering you,

486
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,560
I would have already...

487
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
What happened?

488
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,520
Daoming Si went too far.

489
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,480
How can he throw the cake in her face?

490
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,920
Yes. What's wrong with him?

491
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,200
See?

492
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,360
Si completely changed.

493
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,200
If Shancai doesn't come back,

494
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,800
I don't know what'll happen to him.

495
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,040
Hello?

496
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,520
Hello? Caina.

497
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,320
Meizuo.

498
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,320
You can't miss the dinner your boyfriend's
preparing for you tonight.

499
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,120
All right.

500
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,280
Meizuo. Sorry to keep you waiting.

501
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,360
That's all right.

502
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
That's specially for you.

503
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,880
This card contains
the fragrance of grass and soil.

504
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,640
It should be the fragrance of a field.

505
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,480
You're the only girl who can tell.

506
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
You won't ever be sad when I'm here.

507
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,600
Come on.

508
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,160
Let's have a toast.

509
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,680
I want to know all about you.

510
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,000
Me?

511
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,040
Then should I start from when I was a kid?

512
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,120
Sure.

513
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,600
During springtime,
a lot of girls wore dresses.

514
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,600
They were really cute.

515
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,760
But I can't wear them

516
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,360
because I'm allergic to the catkins.
Then I'll...

517
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,080
I'll sneeze.

518
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,160
So I felt so embarrassed
during springtime.

519
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,200
Because the spring wind also wants
to chase your bright smile.

520
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,280
That's why the catkins
flow with the wind towards you.

521
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,640
Meizuo.

522
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,960
You're really cute.

523
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,360
I'm not that pretty, you know?

524
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,360
When you really like someone,

525
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,360
it's easy to give
such a sincere compliment.

526
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,040
I'm not that pretty, you know?

527
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,200
How am I different from other girls?

528
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,680
Three days is not enough to describe it.

529
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,800
Meizuo.

530
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,080
You're such a cute little boy.

531
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,800
Look.

532
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,400
Your smile is so nice.

533
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,960
That's why the heavens like you so much.

534
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,320
How do you know?

535
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,600
Because they always give you gifts.

536
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,680
They do?

537
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,840
What else will I receive?

538
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,680
You haven't seen the real gift yet.

539
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,520
Where is it?

540
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,680
So where exactly is it?

541
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,440
Count to three.

542
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,160
One.

543
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,080
Two...
