A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 20

3
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,720
All right. Done. Take a look.

4
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,800
This one won't do. I look so ugly here.

5
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,320
The cookie looks so ugly in this one.

6
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,560
This one won't do either.

7
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,360
Both the cookie and I look so ugly.

8
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,200
Help me take more photos later.

9
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,760
What's so good about this cookie?

10
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Has it been blessed?

11
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Shancai gave it to him.

12
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
The most precious happy face
was eaten by you, you jerk.

13
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Damn it.

14
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,880
Look at this. Does it look like me?

15
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,920
Look at this one.

16
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,240
And this one.

17
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,680
I like this one the most.

18
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,840
Look. Does it look like me?

19
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,760
Yes, it does.

20
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,840
I think Shancai is following
the flow of abstract consciousness.

21
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,560
She pursues a close resemblance,

22
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,200
not an accurate representation.

23
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,360
How were things with you two yesterday?

24
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,200
Did anything groundbreaking happen?

25
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,600
We just broke thin ground.

26
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,520
How thin?

27
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,360
We watched the stars together.

28
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
And we even kissed.

29
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,840
-What?
-What?

30
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,000
It's really thin.

31
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,360
Si, are you really a man?

32
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,480
Hey.

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,440
I like it. So what?

34
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,400
I didn't ask you to do the same.

35
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,240
Ma'am, what can I do for you?

36
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,360
I thought it was still too early
to implement that plan.

37
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,400
But I think it's time.

38
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,760
Do it.

39
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,840
All right. Si's graduating soon anyway.

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,680
It's good for him
to choose his path sooner.

41
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,480
Yes. Contact them immediately.

42
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,600
All right.

43
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Five million dollars?

44
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,120
Daoming Si's mom wants to give
you five million yuan?

45
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,400
That's a big dowry.

46
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,120
What are you talking about?

47
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,960
She gave me five million yuan

48
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,920
to stay away from Daoming Si.

49
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
She's gone too far.

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,320
-Who gave her the right to do that?
-That's right.

51
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,040
I'm not her employee.

52
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,040
So refusing this money

53
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,200
means you're refusing to break up
with Daoming Si?

54
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,360
Yes.

55
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,480
No.

56
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,400
I don't know.

57
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,000
Shancai.

58
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,880
Actually, regardless of who you choose,

59
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,320
I just hope you're happy.

60
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,480
You have no idea how infuriating
Daoming Si's mom was.

61
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,720
There are really people who you'd want
to kick when they open their mouths.

62
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,760
Welcome to our store.

63
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,800
Hi, Shancai.

64
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,080
The president asked me
to give this to you.

65
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,240
"Miss Shancai, you're cordially invited

66
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,040
to Maple Hotel

67
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,600
Jingan Temple Main Branch,
VIP Room at 2:00 p.m.

68
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,600
From Daoming Feng."

69
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,960
What does she want this time?

70
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,560
If she wants to see Shancai,
she can come here.

71
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,880
She would like to discuss
yours and Si's future there.

72
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,360
The car is waiting outside.

73
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,000
Shancai.

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,840
You can do it.

75
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,160
This way, please.

76
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,160
<i>Dong Shancai, don't embarrass yourself.</i>

77
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,880
<i>There's nothing to be afraid of.</i>

78
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,440
Let go of me!

79
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,560
Why did you bastards bring me here?

80
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,560
You told me my sister's back

81
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,520
for a blind date with this annoying girl?

82
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
Hey, who's annoying?

83
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,480
You think I want to be here? I was brought
here and I didn't even bring my phone.

84
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,720
For your information,

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,800
Mr. Tony from the salon downstairs
is more handsome than you.

86
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,640
Well, young people nowadays
are very outspoken.

87
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,920
They're impatient. That's understandable.

88
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,000
I asked them both to come here today
to introduce them

89
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,120
so that they can slowly
get to know each other.

90
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,320
Then we can prepare for the wedding.

91
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,560
Who's marrying her?

92
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,440
That's what I wanted to say.
Who wants to marry you?

93
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,400
Excuse me.

94
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
Please come in.

95
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,520
Shancai, why are you here?

96
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,680
I asked Miss Shancai to join us.

97
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,480
Miss Shancai is Si's good friend.

98
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,120
I want her to be a witness
to Si's future marriage.

99
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,520
Shancai.

100
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,360
Look at Xiaozi.

101
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,000
She's beautiful

102
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
and talented.

103
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,080
Isn't she and Si a perfect match?

104
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,400
You should be happy for Si, right?

105
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,840
I am.

106
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,520
I'm happy that Daoming Si

107
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,720
can marry such a nice girl.

108
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,360
Shancai, what are you talking about?

109
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,200
I won't marry this girl
no matter what happens.

110
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,600
What are you saying?
You want me to marry him?

111
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,840
You guys have fun. I'm leaving.

112
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,840
-Wait.
-Bye.

113
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,800
Nobody can leave.

114
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,960
Look at yourselves.

115
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,480
Do you look like future successors?

116
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,400
Let me tell you.

117
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,240
Your lives aren't all about
following your instinct.

118
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
Let's go.

119
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,520
This kid.

120
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,200
Don't say anything. Don't look back.

121
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,960
-We're dead if they catch us.
-Who?

122
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,280
Hey, stop.

123
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,720
Are you crazy? Are you running a marathon?

124
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,840
Why is it you?

125
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,480
What do you mean? You dragged me here.

126
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,520
Where's Shancai?

127
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,000
Who's "Suancai"?

128
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,560
Hey, stop right there.

129
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,640
The weather is so cold.

130
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,640
I lost my shoes.

131
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,720
-Stop.
-Let go.

132
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,400
Let me tell you.

133
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,880
Wearing these prison clothes
already irritates me.

134
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,480
You even dragged me here this way.

135
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,120
I don't have my phone and money with me.

136
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,680
I'm even barefoot.

137
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
Are you crazy?

138
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,480
If I had any money,
I would've taken a cab.

139
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
How can my mom fix me
with someone like you?

140
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,400
My mom's the crazy one
to let me marry you.

141
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,720
You...

142
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,320
You can't leave.

143
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,600
Leave your money or take me home.

144
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,320
Are you a thief?
Or do you think I'm a cab driver?

145
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,680
Don't think you can leave.

146
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,480
Hey, what are you doing?

147
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,400
-I...
-Get off me.

148
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
-No.
-Did you grow up with monkeys?

149
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,720
If you don't get off me,
I'll throw you down.

150
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,640
Hey.

151
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,360
Shancai, get out a pineapple for me.

152
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,840
-"Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles" again?
-That's right.

153
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,960
Don't you know?

154
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,640
Your signature dish
is quite famous online.

155
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,200
DAOMING SI CALLING FROM QQ

156
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,160
Why is he calling me?

157
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Does he want me to be a witness
to his wedding again?

158
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,960
DAOMING SI

159
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,560
Si.

160
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,760
Why did you leave by yourself after class?
You didn't call us.

161
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,360
By the way,

162
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,360
how's the financial report
that Professor Luo asked us to do?

163
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,280
No problem, right?

164
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,160
Yes.

165
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,760
It's very easy for me.

166
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,680
Then why are you in a bad mood?

167
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,080
It looks like you and Shancai
had a fight again.

168
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,360
It's a long story.

169
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,400
It doesn't matter.

170
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,000
We have the whole lunch period anyway.

171
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,440
You can take your time to tell us.

172
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,200
Ximen, my brother.

173
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,080
Shancai, let's go over there.

174
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,840
Sure.

175
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,400
I can congratulate Daoming Si too.

176
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,520
Daoming Si.

177
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,400
Congratulations
on your upcoming engagement.

178
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Engagement?

179
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,040
This is your long story?

180
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,920
Hey, I didn't know about it either.
My mom decided on her own.

181
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,640
Is that so?

182
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,560
Weren't you passionately holding hands

183
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,120
-while running to elope?
-Am I crazy?

184
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,840
-Why would I elope with that crazy woman?
-I'm the one who's crazy.

185
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,680
I was dragged by your mom

186
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,160
to witness your romantic moment
with Miss Xiaozi.

187
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,800
I can't explain it to you.

188
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,680
Then don't.

189
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,600
Just talk to your perfect match, Xiaozi.

190
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,000
You ran off together anyway.

191
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,360
That's what you should do.

192
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,560
I'm telling you again.

193
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,720
I made a mistake. I thought it was you.

194
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,200
Our height, hairstyle, and clothes
are completely different.

195
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,360
Are you blind?

196
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,840
Why are you so unreasonable?

197
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,760
I called you all night yesterday.
You didn't give me a chance to explain.

198
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,080
What's there to explain?

199
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,720
You're the perfect pair.
Why drag me into this?

200
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,120
You even played me like a fool.

201
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,120
Who's the unreasonable one?

202
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,280
If you like tall, slim,
sexy and beautiful girls,

203
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,600
why don't you just tell me?

204
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,200
Hey! Shancai, where are you going?

205
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,160
What were they talking about?

206
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,040
I'm so furious.

207
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,800
It was so obvious.
He even tried to deny it.

208
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,800
Dong Shancai. Look at yourself.

209
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,600
You know they're the perfect pair.

210
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,200
Yet you're still not avoiding him.

211
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,600
Now, look what happened.
You're a laughingstock.

212
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,360
What's there to be sad about?

213
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,600
She's tall and slim, just like a model.

214
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,200
That's what Daoming Si's mom
wants for her son.

215
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,760
Wait...

216
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,960
You're...

217
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
He Yuanzi?

218
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,160
Isn't that the daughter
of He Group's president?

219
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,680
The one who's in oil and mining business?

220
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,680
The only business lacking

221
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,160
in our family is oil.

222
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,560
A commercial marriage to expand territory.

223
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,560
That's something she would do.

224
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,760
By the way,

225
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,280
how's Xiaozi?

226
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,280
What's she like?

227
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,440
Si likes the hot-headed type,
like Shancai.

228
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,680
This kind of spoiled heiress

229
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,760
should be sweet and silly.

230
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Sweet and silly?

231
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,680
She's a monkey.

232
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,840
A monkey?

233
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,520
She climbs anything that resembles a tree.
And she even bites people's ears.

234
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,160
Bites people's ears?

235
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,680
What kind of interesting games
were you playing?

236
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,880
Cut it out.

237
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,320
I'll go first.

238
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,360
Si's face is even redder
than a monkey's butt.

239
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,440
Aren't you that...

240
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,080
We met at Maple Hotel yesterday, right?

241
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,320
What's your name? I'm Xiaozi.

242
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,640
<i>Why is she here?</i>

243
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,320
<i>Is she here to find Daoming Si?</i>

244
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
I'm Shancai.

245
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,320
Shancai.

246
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,480
All right. I'll remember that.

247
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,080
Are you looking for Daoming Si?

248
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Yes.

249
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,320
He's in the cafeteria. Just go over there.

250
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,840
Cafeteria?

251
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,040
Okay.

252
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,000
I happened to drive past
Mingde University.

253
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,040
So I came to visit.

254
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,960
Exactly what kind of school
can produce such a weirdo?

255
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,680
Weirdo?

256
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,960
Yes. Don't you think he's strange?

257
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,240
I think

258
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,320
he might be from Mars.

259
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,280
Yesterday,

260
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,760
I didn't have any money.

261
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,040
I lost my shoes due to running.

262
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,960
I was barefoot.

263
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,520
Tell me. What kind of guy
would leave a girl

264
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,480
all alone on the street?

265
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,520
You mean he left you all alone
on the street yesterday?

266
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,200
Yes, I was so furious.
I walked an hour to get home.

267
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,280
Shancai.

268
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,680
Tell me.

269
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,800
-Does he like...
-Si.

270
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,480
-Shancai's over there.
-men?

271
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,920
I don't think so.

272
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,120
No?

273
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,800
Hey, Monkey. Why are you here?

274
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,520
Speaking so rudely would reduce
your lifespan, you know?

275
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,600
-My name is Xiaozi.
-I don't care what your name is.

276
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,840
What are you doing here?

277
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,560
Thanks to you,
I was in pain all day yesterday.

278
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,440
Don't you care about me at all?

279
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,400
In pain all day?

280
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
You were that intense
the first time you met?

281
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,840
What does that have to do with me?

282
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,920
Listen, my mom can't decide who I'd marry.

283
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,080
Then you listen.
My mom can't decide who I'd marry too.

284
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,040
But I like you.

285
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,280
Monkey, what are you talking about?

286
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,400
Okay.

287
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,840
You can't fool me.

288
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,480
Your ears got all red

289
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,200
after I bit them, right?

290
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,080
-Now he's still putting on an act now.
-Bit his ear?

291
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,320
I'll beat you up if you don't shut up.

292
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,000
Daoming Si, from now on,

293
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,920
I'll train you properly

294
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,480
as your fiancée.

295
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,640
We'll get married anyway.

296
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,160
Let's date first.

297
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,520
Si, how can you hit a girl?

298
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,400
Why would I hit a girl? Let me go.

299
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,360
Nonsense. You already did before.

300
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,280
I'm not hitting a girl.
I'm hitting a monkey.

301
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,720
Why can't you be nice?

302
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,600
But the more naughty you are,

303
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,880
the more I want to be with you.

304
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,880
Let go of me.

305
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,720
I'm not playing along anymore.

306
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,720
Whatever you do has nothing to do with me.

307
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,120
Shancai.

308
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,040
Wait for me.

309
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,000
Why did you run away so fast?

310
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,280
What is it?

311
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,480
What are you doing later?

312
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,880
Why?

313
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,880
Hey, what are you doing?

314
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,160
Let's have coffee if you're free.

315
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,480
I didn't say that I'm free.

316
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,640
Let's go. My treat.

317
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,320
Why are you guys all so unreasonable?

318
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
I remember now.

319
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,440
You seem so familiar.

320
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,000
Do you know me?

321
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,960
Aren't you the special prize winner of
Chinese Cuisine Culinary Competition?

322
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,240
I remember Caina told me

323
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,400
so many nice things about you
after the competition.

324
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,320
I just got lucky.

325
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,960
Even though I didn't expect you to win,

326
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,640
congratulations anyway.

327
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,360
Seriously,

328
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,200
what do you think

329
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,240
of Si?

330
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,720
How would I know?
I have nothing to do with him.

331
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,280
I'm not talking about that.

332
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
I mean,

333
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,760
his face got all red after I bit his ear.

334
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,360
Is he a virgin?

335
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,360
Excuse me, miss.

336
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,800
What are you thinking asking me
such a question in public?

337
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,080
It's very important.

338
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,880
We'll get married in the future.

339
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,000
I have to know.

340
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,440
Since you'll be married to him,

341
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,160
then just ask him. Why are you asking me?

342
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,560
I'm leaving after I finish my coffee.

343
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,720
Actually, I've never actually
dated anyone before.

344
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,240
The guys I know
are either too stupid for me to like

345
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,200
or they feel that my temper is bad
and won't dare to approach me.

346
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,800
I know my parents
would surely find someone for me.

347
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,480
I thought they would find someone ugly,
spoiled and full of shit.

348
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,480
But after seeing Daoming Si,

349
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,320
I think he's quite nice.

350
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,560
Even though he has a bad temper,

351
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,480
but he's very cute.

352
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,320
So I've decided to officially date him.

353
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
That's good.

354
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,480
You can do whatever you want.
What does that have to do with me?

355
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,880
Sorry.

356
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,160
Maybe because I'm an only child,

357
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,040
I've been too sheltered
and self-righteous.

358
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,800
That's why I couldn't
make any good friends.

359
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,920
Sorry.

360
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,840
No, sorry about that.

361
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,320
I was too emotional.

362
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,120
You're very nice.

363
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,960
You're lively, cute, and generous.

364
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,880
Is that so?

365
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Let's be good friends.

366
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,200
As friends,

367
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,480
we have to be honest
with each other, right?

368
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,720
Let me ask you.

369
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,560
Have you ever...

370
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,880
liked anyone before?

371
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,360
Not now.

372
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,280
Not now?

373
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
That means you did like someone.
Tell me about him.

374
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,480
Well...

375
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,720
Previously...

376
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,040
There was someone who seems dull,

377
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,800
doesn't talk much

378
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
and likes to sleep a lot.

379
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,400
What? Your taste is that poor?

380
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,920
Your taste is not that good either, okay?

381
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,240
Then let me ask you another question.

382
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,560
Has Daoming Si ever liked you before?

383
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,760
Shouldn't you ask him that yourself?

384
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,080
I think he must have liked you before.

385
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,360
Even though he told you he liked you,

386
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,520
but has he ever told you
that he only liked you?

387
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,200
No.

388
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,600
No, right?

389
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,560
Then what if he likes someone else too?

390
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,880
Is that so?

391
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,080
Yes.

392
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,600
Help me pursue him.

393
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,200
If he's unmoved,
then that means he really likes you.

394
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,160
If he falls in love with me,
then he's a playboy.

395
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,960
Let's dump him together. Okay?

396
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,480
You have a point.

397
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,520
Of course.

398
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,200
Then you'll help me, right?

399
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,160
It's a deal then.

400
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,040
Here. Try this.

401
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
It seems really good.

402
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,520
No, you can have it.

403
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,720
<i>This is the only place</i>

404
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,520
<i>I can be at peace.</i>

405
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,880
<i>But why do I feel so sad?</i>

406
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,640
<i>When I close my eyes,</i>

407
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,080
<i>all I see if Daoming Feng's arrogant face</i>

408
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,600
<i>and Xiaozi's excited face.</i>

409
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,800
<i>It's so annoying.</i>

410
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,320
It's getting more and more annoying!

411
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,480
Why do you find me annoying?

412
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,400
No.

413
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,440
I don't.

414
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,160
I'm happy to see you every day.

415
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
Is that so?

416
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,360
I don't mean it that way.

417
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,000
Why are you spouting nonsense?

418
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,280
Your face is so red.

419
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,720
-Do you have a fever?
-Hey.

420
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,640
Because the sun is too strong.

421
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,880
Shancai.

422
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,280
Instead of chatting with me,

423
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,160
shouldn't you resolve
your problem with Si?

424
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,320
I'm not sure what to do either.

425
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,160
His mom feels that I'm a stumbling block

426
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,560
and she introduced
a perfect girlfriend to him.

427
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,200
That girl likes him too.

428
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,960
I feel that I'm the odd one out.

429
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,960
You're not the Shancai I know at all.

430
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,240
After everything that happened,

431
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,880
don't you know how strong
Si's feelings are for you?

432
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,840
You should be confident with yourself

433
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,720
and your feelings for each other.

434
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,720
Really think about it.

435
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,680
You don't know how much pressure I feel.

436
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,960
<i>I want to be confident
with our feelings for each other.</i>

437
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,800
<i>But what should I do?</i>

438
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,520
<i>We're all powerless</i>

439
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,480
<i>in front of Daoming Feng.</i>

440
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,160
Daoming Si.

441
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,960
Why did you come
to my house to look for me?

442
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,120
How dare you ask me that.

443
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,520
Where did you go this afternoon?

444
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,680
You won't answer your phone.
Do you know how long I've waited for you?

445
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,240
What did you do?
Is it fun to pretend to be missing?

446
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,040
You came here because of that?

447
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,000
Do my whereabouts have
anything to do with you?

448
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,240
Then let me tell you.

449
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,400
I had tea with your fiancée
in the afternoon.

450
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,240
That's it.

451
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,240
That crazy, overbearing girl?
Why did you go out with her?

452
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,640
What did she want?

453
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Initially,

454
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,320
I thought

455
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,840
she's a spoiled

456
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,120
and an arrogant heiress.

457
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,000
I realized...

458
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,640
that she's actually quite nice

459
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,720
and straightforward.

460
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,880
She's a thoughtful girl.

461
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
She has a good figure too.

462
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,680
-Her upbringing--
-Why are you telling me this?

463
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,680
I wanted to tell you

464
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,720
that I think you're quite a match.

465
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,560
It would be good

466
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,720
if you two end up together.

467
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,000
How about following your mom's advice

468
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,280
and staying by her side?

469
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,640
This way, everybody is happy.

470
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,960
Do you understand?

471
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,040
I was wrong about you.

472
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
<i>Dong Shancai.</i>

473
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,680
<i>You idiot.</i>

474
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,280
<i>You hurt Daoming Si again.</i>

475
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
<i>You know you'd hurt him this way.</i>

476
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,440
<i>And you've made it even worse.</i>

477
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,320
Lei, I'm so envious
that you're studying music.

478
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,160
Unlike Ximen and I,

479
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,880
who has a lot of reports to turn in.

480
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,160
I have to practice the piano daily.
My hands have a lot of callouses.

481
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,080
It would be easier if I'm incredibly
business-minded like Si.

482
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,280
The stumbling block in Si's life is love.

483
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,440
He has to do better in that subject.

484
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,160
Or else his life would be a mess.

485
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,560
Si.

486
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,960
Why are you drenched?

487
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,320
What happened to Si?

488
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,640
Why do you look so pale?

489
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,240
It seems like he's struggling
in the love subject again.

490
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,400
I think you're quite a match.

491
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,120
Si's situation seems
even worse than before.

492
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,880
Should we try to understand it more?

493
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,320
Understand what?

494
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,640
Isn't He Yuanzi

495
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,920
the fiancée Si's mom found

496
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,480
to make Shancai stay away from Si
after she met her?

497
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,480
What kind of girl

498
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,680
is He Yuanzi?

499
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,800
This is what we'll do.

500
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,120
After submitting our reports tomorrow,

501
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,000
let's deal with He Yuanzi.

502
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,400
Then she wouldn't bother Si.

503
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,880
Then Si and Shancai

504
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,680
won't have anything to worry about.

505
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,640
Lei, what do you think?

506
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,760
What do you mean?

507
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,480
You have to participate too.

508
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,520
This is Si's business.

509
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,080
We'd only complicate things

510
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,960
if we get ourselves involved.

511
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,320
Complicating things

512
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,960
is precisely what we want to do.

513
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,600
Sir, you spent a huge amount today.

514
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,640
We can give you a VIP card.

515
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,480
Can you please fill out your information?

516
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,920
No, thanks.

517
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,320
I, Ximen,

518
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,760
ended up fighting...

519
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,080
over dolls from claw toy-grabber machines
with some brats.

520
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,640
It's the same for me.

521
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,120
I ended up becoming an assistant.

522
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,800
Hey.

523
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,160
Why is there no Durian King doll?

524
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,800
Go and get me one.

525
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,360
Hey, aren't these enough?

526
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,360
You asked me to come out
when I was so comfortable at home.

527
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,280
And now I'm not enjoying myself.

528
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,880
Why are you doing this?

529
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,880
I'll buy all of them for you, okay?

530
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,720
No. You have to get it
from the claw machine.

531
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,640
It's more meaningful.

532
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,280
All right. I'll do it now.

533
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,960
Have you completed your mission?

534
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,880
Miss, all their C cup bras are here.

535
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,000
Don't ask me to exchange them anymore.

536
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,160
No limited edition style?

537
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,440
Then I don't want them.

538
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,960
Are you kidding me?

539
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,560
Let's get things clear, okay?

540
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,960
You guys asked me to come out.

541
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,760
If you can't fulfill my expectations,

542
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,880
then I'll go to Daoming Si.

543
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,160
Don't.

544
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,240
Which style do you want? I'll buy it.

545
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,760
Really?

546
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,240
Then wear it for me.

547
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,480
Quit playing around.

548
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,520
I'm not asking you to strip.

549
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,240
Just try wearing it.

550
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,160
Is this enough?

551
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
Why is there no smiling Durian King doll?

552
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,240
I remember there was one in there.

553
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,440
Smile.

554
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,040
Is there such a thing?

555
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,680
You two are so boring.

556
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,240
I'm going to find Daoming Si.

557
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,240
Hi, this is your White Jasmine Dew.

558
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,480
This isn't White Jasmine Dew, is it?

559
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
Sorry.

560
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,680
Sorry about that.

561
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,480
Shancai, what's the matter?

562
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,360
You look so pale.

563
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,080
And you're so absent-minded.

564
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,600
It's nothing.

565
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,840
I stayed up late
doing homework last night.

566
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,120
<i>Xiaozi suits Si better than me.</i>

567
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,600
<i>His mom would be all quiet now.</i>

568
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,240
<i>This is a good thing.</i>

569
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,240
<i>Dong Shancai.</i>

570
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,360
<i>You should be happy for them.</i>

571
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,080
Shancai.

572
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,920
Xiaozi.

573
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,520
I brought my two assistants along
to see you.

574
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,280
-Ximen.
-Shancai, Xiaoyou.

575
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,240
Finally, there's a cute girl.

576
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,120
What are you three doing?

577
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,480
What else? Dating.

578
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,800
Dating?

579
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,520
I don't know why they asked me
to come out.

580
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,040
This is a bad decision.

581
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,200
We stayed at the arcade all afternoon.

582
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,680
Then we watched a movie.

583
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,520
Then we went around Nanjing West Road.

584
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,760
She hasn't had enough.

585
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,760
She asked me to buy her bras.

586
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,560
Shancai, do you want them?

587
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,160
There are many styles to choose from.

588
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,000
There's no need.

589
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,400
I would rather shop
with Xiaoyou for a year

590
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,840
than see this terrible girl again.

591
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,480
Then when do you plan to date me?

592
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,560
But why are you doing this?

593
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,440
Listen.

594
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,600
At first, I thought I was too charming,
they couldn't help themselves.

595
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,880
Then I realized

596
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,520
they wanted me to give up on Si.

597
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,400
How did you know?

598
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,440
Actually, you did well.

599
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,040
But I don't like you.

600
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,360
No matter what you do,

601
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,920
I won't like you.

602
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,560
Let me tell you.

603
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,640
He gets tired easily.

604
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,600
He doesn't know how to enjoy himself.

605
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,560
But both of them

606
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,440
are especially great to hang out with.

607
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,920
How boring.

608
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,160
I don't think it's fun at all.

609
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,320
Never mind. I'll go ahead.

610
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,960
I'll leave the best supporting actors
to you.

611
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,280
See you next time. Bye.

612
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,440
Hey, who's a supporting actor?

613
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,800
In my world, I'm always the main actor.

614
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,120
Why do you all look so sad?

615
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,160
What can I get you?

616
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,520
-Alcohol.
-Sure. Please wait.

617
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,600
Shancai, you can't drink.

618
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,360
Hey, we can't act this way.

619
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,040
Our plan just failed.

620
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,280
Why are we so down?

621
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,960
What's the matter?
Is it because of that pretty girl?

622
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,120
Pretty?

623
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,720
She looks like E.T.

624
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,520
Didn't you see how Monkey

625
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,280
played us today?

626
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,880
But...

627
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,160
why are you doing something
you don't like for Daoming Si?

628
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,560
Because of you.

629
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,280
Are you stupid?

630
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,680
You know how Si is.

631
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,160
He might even back out of his marriage.
We're doing everything to help you,

632
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,080
yet you just want to give up.
Do you know how sad Si is?

633
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,200
By the way,

634
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,800
on that rainy night,

635
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,840
why did Si come home all drenched?

636
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,560
What happened?

637
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,040
I told him

638
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,840
to date Xiaozi

639
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,680
and said that they're a good match.

640
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,560
How can you say that?

641
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,560
Have you ever considered
how Si would feel?

642
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,360
Have you ever considered how I feel?

643
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,000
I can't change their family.

644
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,520
His mom even went to my house
with five million yuan

645
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,520
so that I'll break up with him.

646
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,280
Have you ever been insulted that way?

647
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,840
Five million yuan?

648
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,920
Did you take it?

649
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,480
Of course not.

650
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,000
You should tell Si.

651
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,600
How else would he know?

652
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,160
Stop it.

653
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,840
Daoming Feng is his mom.

654
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,320
What else can I do?

655
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,040
What can I do to satisfy all of you?

656
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,400
All right.

657
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,560
We'll stop, okay?

658
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,480
All right.

659
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,440
I know you have your reasons.

660
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,160
Come on. Let's toast

661
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,280
to the invincible Dong Shancai.

662
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,920
-Here.
-Hey.

663
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,640
-Cheers.
-Meizuo can drink.

664
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,680
But why are you toasting

665
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,880
-when you can't drink?
-Cut the crap. Here.

666
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,400
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

667
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,240
The president is waiting for you.

668
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,560
Lei.

669
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,280
Some unfortunate things
happened on Si's birthday.

670
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,680
I wasn't able to contact you afterward.

671
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,160
-Well--
-That's fine, Mrs. Daoming.

672
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,720
Why did you ask me to come here?

673
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,720
I watched you and Si grow up together.

674
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,360
I contacted Jing's family earlier.

675
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,120
They said

676
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,160
that Jing would not
come back anymore, right?

677
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,080
Why are you asking me this?

678
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,320
Actually,

679
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,520
I heard about you and Shancai.

680
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,840
Shancai used to like you.

681
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,000
Because she couldn't get your affections,

682
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,720
she accepted Si.

683
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,400
Is that what happened?

684
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
Mrs. Daoming,
I think you've misunderstood.

685
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,920
Si is the one Shancai likes.

686
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,800
Don't you understand Si's personality?

687
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,200
He likes to take other people's things.

688
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,200
Do you remember that Spiderman toy
when you were young?

689
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,480
He got tired of it
after he stole it from you.

690
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,120
I'm worried

691
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,720
that Shancai is just like your toy.

692
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,600
After Si gets her,

693
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,400
he'll dump her.

694
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,600
If that happens,

695
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,080
Shancai would end up getting hurt.

696
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,560
Si was naughty before.

697
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,960
But he's all grown up now.

698
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,000
He wouldn't do that.

699
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,520
Si has been fickle-minded
ever since he was little.

700
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,360
I'm worried that Shancai will get hurt.

701
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,440
By the way,

702
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,080
I heard that your dad's company

703
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,040
is having some financial trouble lately.

704
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,120
I'm not sure about that.

705
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,720
I really don't want

706
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,680
to see your family business
get into trouble.

707
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,200
I'm thinking that maybe

708
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,280
I can help you.

709
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,440
As long as you and Shancai

710
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,360
can start over again.

711
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,280
Mrs. Daoming.

712
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,400
Don't you think
what you're doing is not right?

713
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,440
You're still young.
You'll understand better in the future.

714
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,800
There are some things

715
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,600
that the end is more important
than the means.

716
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,280
My dad would handle our business matters.

717
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,280
Then aren't you worried

718
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,280
that Si would dump Shancai one day?

719
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,720
For that, I trust your son more than you.

720
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,240
Toys and lovers are different.

721
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,880
Regarding Shancai,

722
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,600
I'd protect her as a friend
for the rest of my life.

723
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,800
I'll tell you something else.

724
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,400
We all know Si's personality.

725
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,240
The more you want to break them up,

726
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,840
the stronger their bond will be.

727
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,920
I hope you won't outsmart yourself

728
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,800
and hurt your relationship with Si.

729
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,960
That's all.

730
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,080
I'll get going.

731
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,840
Mrs. Daoming,

732
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,800
let me say again.

733
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,000
Regarding Shancai,

734
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,160
I'd protect her as a friend
for the rest of my life.

735
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,960
I won't let her get hurt.

736
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,240
Miss Heiress.

737
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,080
Why are you here?

738
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,040
What happened?

739
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,400
You...

740
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,880
You're crying.

741
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,880
You're crying.

742
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,160
Sorry.

743
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,480
I'm too emotional.

744
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,240
I'm not sure what to say.

745
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,320
Si...

746
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,000
Did he bully you?

747
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,240
I know him.

748
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,720
You don't have to worry about him. Listen.

749
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,040
I'll help you beat him up.

750
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,600
-I once beat him until--
-Daoming Si agreed to date me.
