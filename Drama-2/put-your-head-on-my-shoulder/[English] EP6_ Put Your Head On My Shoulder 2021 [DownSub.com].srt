What are you doing?

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,680
I’m 100% man.

32
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,720
If you don’t believe me,
do you want to try?

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,440
No, I believe you now.

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,120
Well, to summarize this,

35
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,960
he’s a real man. We’re all clear?

36
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,320
So then...

37
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,560
Let’s all split up now.

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,520
I’m sorry. I really am sorry.

39
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,560
Calm down, Prapai.
Your radar is just a little broken.

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,280
It’s going to be alright.

41
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,160
But...

42
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,920
Calm down.

43
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
Prapai.

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,200
Breathe in.

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,240
Sleep. Just sleep.

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,600
You’re the one to blame.
Why are you hiding?

47
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,360
That’s enough, Prapai.

48
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,600
Stop thinking too much.

49
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,680
Just calm yourself down.

50
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,080
Pai, Pai.

51
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,600
I was about to go to you.

52
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,200
What’s the matter, Faye?

53
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,880
I presented your idea
to the client today.

54
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,000
How was the feedback?

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It passed. The clients loved it.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,200
You’re great.

57
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,720
I was thinking of letting you

58
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,520
suggest a few references
to help guide me.

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,360
Sure.
I’ll help you after I clear of my work.

60
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,600
Great job, Pai.
Send them to me tomorrow.

61
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,480
Tomorrow?

62
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,160
I have a department meeting tomorrow.

63
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
So I can bring it up then.

64
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,480
Please, Pai. Help me out.

65
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,760
Just think of it
as a collection of ideas.

66
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Alright.

67
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,840
Great job, Pai.

68
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,040
Take it as an experience
in working as an advertiser.

69
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,360
This is too sweet.

70
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,400
I’ll take this one instead. Thank you.

71
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,760
You’re an accountant.
You have to be detailed and careful.

72
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,520
How can you do this?

73
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,960
This is all about money.

74
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,720
What if something happens?

75
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,560
Can you be responsible for it?

76
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,120
I can’t. I’m sorry.

77
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,320
Pai, I’m going now.

78
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,240
A late night again tonight?

79
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,280
It’s just 8 p.m.

80
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,680
I’ll wait till it’s a little later.

81
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,920
You’re really strange.

82
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,800
No one here
wants to stay late after work.

83
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,480
Why?

84
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,600
Because

85
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,400
no one gets paid an OT.

86
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
Man, what were you doing?

87
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,000
I’m not joking. It’s true.

88
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,760
I’m out. See you tomorrow.

89
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,800
Bye.

90
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,480
He’s probably not asleep yet.

91
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,720
When will he be asleep?
So I can finally go home.

92
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,440
I’ll go now.

93
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,800
Even the ghosts don’t want me here.

94
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,320
I’m going now. I’m sorry.

95
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,800
It’s late already. Why is he still up?

96
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,600
Why are you hiding from me?

97
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,560
I’m not hiding.

98
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,240
I just dropped something.

99
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,360
Are you okay? Why are you acting weird?

100
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,160
No. Nothing’s wrong.

101
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,800
Nothing at all.

102
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,940
I told you already.

103
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,120
I do believe that you’re a real man.

104
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,460
Mom,
I think Pai has been bit by a zombie.

105
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,280
Just like in the movies.

106
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,800
Oh my god, Pai.

107
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,920
Why do you look so drained?

108
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,800
Would you like one of my vitamins sets?

109
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,520
Or do you want a face moisturizer?

110
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,640
Can I change from the vitamins
to something else?

111
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,440
Sure. I’ve got everything. Just tell me.

112
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,520
Do you have a new room

113
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,720
with the same price range
as the one I live in now?

114
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,600
Oh, why so?

115
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,680
Oh, Tookta.

116
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,120
The reason I decided to stay

117
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,880
is because I thought
Pupaa didn’t like girls.

118
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,360
But now I know the truth.

119
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,160
How can you let me live with a guy?

120
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,400
Living with a guy is exciting.

121
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,120
What if one day he does something to me?

122
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,760
What am I going to do?

123
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,920
Well, don’t act like you’re innocent.

124
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,840
Alright, I will try
and find one for you.

125
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,640
Thank you.

126
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,800
Sure.

127
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,760
Bye.

128
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,200
Look at yourself.

129
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,800
Block him.

130
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,840
Ta, come here.

131
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,680
Look at him play.

132
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,400
Go on, Pupaa.

133
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,160
Everyone, let’s take a break.

134
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,000
What’s this?

135
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,700
What is going on between you two?

136
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,720
You’re off the game.

137
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,240
Oh.

138
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,280
Hey.

139
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,760
What’s going on? Spill it.

140
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,280
Well,

141
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,560
my friend told me

142
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,160
there’s a girl who lives with him

143
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,160
and she misunderstood
that he doesn’t like girls.

144
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,400
What kind of friend is he?
How did he manage to confuse her?

145
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,560
Well,

146
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,120
just a regular guy.

147
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,920
A regular guy.

148
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,440
Is he handsome?

149
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,480
Well...

150
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,320
Well..

151
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,160
He looks good.

152
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,280
If he looks good,

153
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,640
got fair skin,

154
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,820
takes care of himself well,

155
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,240
she could misunderstand.

156
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,360
But when she knew he’s a real man,

157
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,940
she starts acting strange

158
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,840
when he’s around.

159
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,120
What do you think she’s thinking?

160
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,160
It’s not that difficult.

161
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,120
She’s just shy, right?

162
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,960
She’s afraid.

163
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,200
Afraid?

164
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,120
Of course.

165
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,560
Well, a guy and a girl,

166
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,300
living together in a room.
It’s not weird that she’s afraid of him.

167
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,100
Especially if someone like Ta

168
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,760
creeps up on her. She’d be done.

169
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,480
Yeah.

170
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,960
Pai, you’re not done yet? So dedicated.

171
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,600
Cartoon.

172
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,440
Can I go sleep with you for a few days?

173
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,920
It’s not quite convenient.

174
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
But I wouldn’t mind for a few days.

175
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,480
Really? Thank you so much.

176
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,560
But

177
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,720
why don’t you go home?

178
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,080
(Prapai)

179
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,280
What are you looking for?
Do you need any help?

180
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,440
Oh, nothing.

181
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,600
Hold on, Pupaa.

182
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,920
I want to be straight.

183
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,800
If Pai moves out,

184
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,480
can I rent out the room again?

185
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,280
Move out?

186
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,480
You didn’t know?

187
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,240
This morning Pai was asking me
to help find her a new room.

188
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,160
Honey, you’re back.

189
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,440
Honey, that’s my friend Pai.

190
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,000
I’m really sorry.

191
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,560
Honey,
Pai will be sleeping over tonight.

192
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,760
Why didn’t you call me first?

193
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,960
I was close by already.

194
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,540
Cartoon,

195
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,760
I’m sorry I didn’t know
you lived with your boyfriend.

196
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,840
It’s okay. Bo doesn’t mind.

197
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,840
You can sleep on the bed
with me tonight.

198
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,640
No problem. You guys have the bed.
I’ll sleep on the sofa.

199
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,760
It’s alright. You want some water?
Come here.

200
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,800
Feel at home. You’re welcome.

201
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,000
Stop it, Bo. What time is this?

202
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,200
Bo.

203
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,680
Come on.

204
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,480
Be quiet.

205
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,400
Just a little kiss.

206
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Come on, come on.

207
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,680
I haven’t seen you the entire day.

208
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,480
(Missed call)

209
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,040
(Pupaa 22)

210
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,800
(Pupaa)

211
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,880
What’s up, Pupaa?

212
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,120
Where are you?

213
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,480
Why aren’t you back yet?

214
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,360
I’m at a friend’s place.

215
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,120
Why didn’t you tell me?

216
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,680
Oh.

217
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,000
Why do I have to tell you everything?

218
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,520
Well...

219
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,600
It’s your turn for chores tomorrow.

220
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,120
Don’t forget.

221
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,560
Oh.

222
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,080
What’s wrong with him?

223
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,120
Stop it, Bo.

224
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,720
Just a little bit.

225
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,160
No, it tickles.

226
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,760
Thank you so much
for having me over last night.

227
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,840
Don’t worry. It’s all good.

228
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,920
I’ll have to disturb you again
tonight...

229
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,000
Hello.

230
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,000
Are you wearing yesterday’s clothes?

231
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,600
You didn’t go home?

232
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,640
Oh my.

233
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,840
Why don’t kids these days
have any responsibility?

234
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,840
Did you apply for the job
because you really wanted to?

235
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Because you keep making
the same mistakes.

236
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,560
If this continues,

237
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,400
you’ll never pass probation.

238
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,240
Once you’re done with Pla, come to me.

239
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,320
That’s wild.

240
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,560
Let’s have dinner tonight.

241
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,200
Sure, but it can’t be too late.

242
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,280
I’ve got an early meeting tomorrow.

243
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Okay, sure.

244
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,080
Where do you want to go?

245
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Oh, Pai, how did it go?
How are your ears?

246
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,440
Pon, this is Pai.

247
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,720
The person I was telling you about.

248
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,240
Pai, this is Pon, the creative director.

249
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

250
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,440
Is there a problem with your job?

251
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,320
I couldn’t catch up
with the accounting work.

252
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,360
It’s alright.

253
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,760
Do your main job.

254
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,680
You can finish the job
you’re helping me with tonight.

255
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,400
I was thinking of
letting you do the key visuals.

256
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,000
To put in your portfolio.

257
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,760
If this job is really used,

258
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,240
you can say that you did it.

259
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,160
Really?

260
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,880
Um.

261
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,800
Sure. I’ll finish it tonight.

262
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,760
Good job.

263
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,800
Kids these days are so motivated.

264
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,240
I’ll have to excuse myself.

265
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,080
Okay.

266
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,480
- Keep fighting.
- Bye. Thank you.

267
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,960
We’ll buy something back for dinner.

268
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,080
For Bo too.

269
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,160
I’ll go get my clothes too.

270
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,280
- Sure.
- Um.

271
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,600
Prapai.

272
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,840
Let’s go home.

273
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,840
Cartoon, I’ll go to you tonight.

274
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,900
Ouch.

275
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,120
Are you afraid I won’t do my chores
that you had to go take me home?

276
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,000
Well…

277
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,120
Yeah.

278
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,720
Alright.
I’ll finish it quickly, so I can go.

279
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,400
Man.

280
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
I’ve finished cleaning.

281
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,680
I’ll go clean the toilet.

282
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,880
This area is not clean yet.

283
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,360
It wasn’t dirty when I was sweeping it.

284
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,080
I’ll mop it then.

285
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,840
Mopping will only take 10 minutes.

286
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,640
Hey.

287
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,800
You already cleaned the toilet?
It’s still dirty.

288
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,560
Ah.

289
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,960
I already cleaned it.

290
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,160
Are you messing with me?

291
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
I...

292
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,200
Why would I do that?

293
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,800
It’s dirty.

294
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,040
Clean it properly.

295
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,960
Sure.

296
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,800
Pizza delivery is here.

297
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,680
Thank you.

298
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,200
You’re tired. Grab something to eat.

299
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,160
Food is the best way to keep her here.

300
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,080
You normally don’t eat carbs.

301
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,080
Why did you order pizza?

302
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,920
Oh,

303
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,440
well,

304
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,840
I saw there was a discount.
So I tried ordering it.

305
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,360
You can eat it first,
I’m not hungry yet.

306
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,040
She’ll fall asleep if she finishes that.

307
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,200
I’m stuffed. I’m sleepy now.

308
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,080
Just as planned.

309
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,000
I’ll hurry out now then.

310
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,960
Oh.

311
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,920
When did it rain?

312
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,440
Um.

313
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
It’s raining heavily.

314
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,600
Hello, Cartoon.

315
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,640
I don’t think I can go. It’s raining.

316
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,960
Really?
But it’s not raining around here.

317
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,720
Oh alright. See you then.

318
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,520
Oh.

319
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,880
You’re still going?

320
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,560
You’ll get sick.

321
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,720
My friend said it’s not raining there.

322
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,080
It’ll probably stop soon.

323
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,320
Okay. Take care. It’s a dark street.

324
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:45,400
Recently, there have been many stalkers
following women,

325
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,240
and kidnapping them.

326
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,800
However, the police have not yet found
the suspect.

327
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,920
Why have they not caught the suspect?

328
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,480
If you’re not in a rush,
then you don’t have to go.

329
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,760
It’s late. It’s dangerous out there.

330
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,480
And you want me to be alone with you?

331
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,200
You’ve been for ages,
you didn’t say anything.

332
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
Well, I didn’t know

333
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,320
that you’re 100% man.

334
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,560
I’m a 100% man.

335
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,800
And I’m a gentleman too.

336
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,760
Leaving late at night,

337
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,280
being dark and dangerous like this.

338
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,800
If you think I’m more dangerous
than those stalkers,

339
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,080
then it’s up to you.

340
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,840
Hello, Cartoon.

341
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,040
I don’t think I can make it.
It’s really late.

342
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,440
I’ll see you at the office.

343
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,240
Alright, bye.

344
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,480
Oh,

345
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,680
you’re not going anymore?

346
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,520
Um.

347
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,800
I don’t want to disturb my friend.

348
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,680
Why do you like eating unhealthy food?

349
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,160
(I’ve prepared breakfast for you)

350
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,760
(See you this evening)

351
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,280
(I’ve prepared breakfast for you.
See you this evening.)

352
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,200
(See you this evening)

353
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:13,600
(I’ve prepared breakfast for you)

354
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I’m all done, Professor.

355
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,480
Oh.

356
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,120
Hey.

357
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,080
Where is he rushing off to?

358
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,360
Prapai.

359
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Prapai.

360
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,520
I’m doing this for you.

361
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,640
So don’t scold me.

362
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,880
I, I...

363
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,240
I wasn’t going to do anything.

364
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,840
I...
I was just going to rub your fever off.

365
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,960
Love you.

366
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,600
What did you say?

367
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,160
You’re so cute.

368
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,920
Prapai.

369
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,000
Prapai.

370
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,960
Prapai.

371
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,840
Hey you.

372
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
Are you feeling better?

373
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,800
I just had a little fever.

374
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,120
Why are you in here?

375
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,680
Did you do something to me?

376
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,360
Don’t be afraid of me.

377
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,520
I won’t do anything like that to you.

378
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,600
(Hourly body temperature record)

379
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,320
Your fever is better now.

380
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,080
You don’t need to go to the doctors.

381
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,240
Why is your face still red?

382
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,400
Oh, I’m normally prone to congestion.

383
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,720
My cheeks get red easily.

384
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,600
You don’t have to go to work
if you’re sick.

385
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,440
Take more rest.

386
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,240
I’ll go get some medicine for you.

387
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,200
Oh,

388
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,600
I made you some porridge.

389
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,280
Just come have some when you’re hungry.

390
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,920
Drink lots of water too.

391
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,760
Um.

392
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,800
Thank you so much. You’re so cute.

393
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,920
(Faye)

394
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,000
How is it going, Faye?

395
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,120
Where are you, Pai?

396
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,440
I don’t see you at the office.

397
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,640
I’m sick, so I took a sick leave.

398
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Oh, what should I do?

399
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,320
The key visual that I told you earlier,

400
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,720
I need to use it soon.

401
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,600
I’ll finish it for you
as soon as possible.

402
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,080
I’ll send it to you once I’m done.

403
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,240
Then I’ll leave it to you.

404
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,560
I’ll go prepare my other works.

405
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,320
There’s so much going on at the moment.

406
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,320
Alright. Goodbye, Faye.

407
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,760
Hope he doesn’t scold me
for working at home.

408
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,200
Why do I have to be
afraid of him anyway?

409
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,960
Why are you working during sick leave?

410
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,800
Did I accidentally sleep?

411
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,880
No, no.

412
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,440
Hey,

413
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,920
does accounting work need Photoshop?

414
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,240
No, it doesn’t.

415
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,300
Is the work at the office too little,

416
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,560
or you don’t have enough income?

417
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,440
Yeah.

418
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,960
Are you going to pay for me?

419
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,280
Hey, what is wrong with you?

420
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,840
I just want to do what I like.

421
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,360
A genius who gets to work
their dream job like you

422
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,080
will never understand.

423
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,280
I wasn’t born a genius,

424
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,280
but I wanted to choose this path

425
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,160
and dedicated myself towards it.

426
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,880
When you set a goal,

427
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,040
and dedicate yourself to it,

428
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
you’ll be successful.

429
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,600
If you choose to do something,

430
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,560
just do it.

431
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,720
Put in your full effort.

432
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,240
A dedicated person like you,

433
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,480
no matter which path you choose,
I’m sure you can do it.

434
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,560
Thank you.

435
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,240
You’re actually cute when you smile.

436
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,760
Why don’t I normally see you smile?

437
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,160
Well,

438
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,200
I don’t have any reason to smile.

439
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,240
So I’m the reason to make you smile.

440
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Right?

441
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,400
Right?

442
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,440
You’re crazy.

443
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,280
Hurry and finish your soup.
And get some sleep.

444
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,240
Yes, sir.

445
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,680
Don’t go off smiling alone.

446
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,600
Cartoon.

447
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,960
Are you sure you’re done?

448
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,680
Go redo it.

449
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,480
I was about to let someone call you.

450
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,720
All of Ann’s job is done.

451
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,960
- From now on you can...
- Pla.

452
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,520
I want to quit.

453
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,000
What is wrong with you?

454
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,400
I just wanted you
to help with editing the work.

455
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,440
And you want to quit?

456
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,400
It’s not like that.
I really want to quit.

457
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,920
I want to go do something I want to do.

458
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,840
And I want to start now.

459
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,120
I see you’ve decided.

460
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,400
Up to you then.

461
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,040
Thank you.

462
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,760
Pai, have you been working so hard
that you’re going crazy?

463
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,760
Calm down first.
Do you want to rethink it?

464
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,640
It’s not that easy to find a job.

465
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,760
Thank you for caring for me.
But I have thought it through.

466
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,040
Pai.

467
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,280
Why are you packing?

468
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,440
I’ve quitted, Faye.

469
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,600
Quit?

470
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,080
What about the work
you’ve been helping me?

471
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,560
I’m really sorry, Faye.

472
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,400
But I think you should let
someone in the creative department help.

473
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,600
I have to go now. Goodbye.

474
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,040
Cartoon, bye.

475
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,480
Did she really quit?

476
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Pupaa.

477
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,160
You’re back already.

478
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,760
What’s all this?

479
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,760
Oh,

480
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,560
I quit my job.

481
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Why did you quit?

482
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,040
Well, I followed your advice.

483
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,600
If I choose to do something, just do it.

484
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,480
And do it with full dedication.

485
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,280
But I didn’t mean to let you quit.

486
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,480
Pla, I don’t want to quit now.

487
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,400
Hold on.

488
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,840
Calm down.

489
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360
Get yourself together.

490
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,440
Since you’ve made up your mind,

491
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,600
you’ve got to move on.

492
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,280
What do I do next?

493
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,240
You can start again tomorrow.

494
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,880
Find a job you really want to do.

495
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,160
You’ve had enough for today.

496
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,920
You should get some rest.

497
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,120
(Find your dream job)

498
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,400
(Job description)

499
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,240
Why is it so difficult
to find my dream job?

500
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,400
Doing house chores is way easier.

501
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,520
Or should I be a maid?

502
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,160
What if I find a bossy boss like Pupaa?

503
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,680
I’ll probably be dead.

504
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,280
No, no.

505
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,220
Prapai.
You want a job in advertising.

506
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,200
Advertising.

507
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,240
Advertising.

508
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,280
Advertising.

509
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,600
If searching online is difficult,

510
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,720
then I’ll go outside and find one.

511
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,640
Thank you.

512
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,080
Oh, Pai.

513
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,400
Hello.

514
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,320
You’re going to work late?

515
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,040
Well,

516
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,280
I already quit my job.

517
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,320
Oh.

518
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,280
Will you have the money
for my rent next month?

519
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,680
Can I please talk with Pupaa first?

520
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,560
Pupaa won’t let you.

521
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,080
He didn’t want you to stay
since the beginning,

522
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,000
and now you’re not going to pay.

523
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,040
I don’t know how to help you anymore.

524
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,240
(Special scene)

525
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,160
Oh.

526
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,840
When did it rain?

527
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,320
Um. It’s raining heavily.

528
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,440
Recently, there have been many stalkers
following women.
