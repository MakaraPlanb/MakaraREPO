Hurry up.

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,120
Hey, come here.

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,740
Prapai.

34
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,240
Where are you going?

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,320
They’re heavy smoke on our floor,
let’s go down.

36
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,280
Where’s Prapai?

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,800
I didn’t see her.

38
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,760
Pupaa.

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,760
Prapai.

40
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,480
Prapai.

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,720
Pupaa.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,120
Prapai.

43
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,360
Next time be careful with what you do.

44
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,080
What if Pupaa
didn’t rescue you in time?

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,480
It’s alright.
No need to scold her.

46
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
She might still be scared.

47
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,200
I’m really sorry. I just wanted to cook

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,800
and celebrate with Pupaa
because I got a new job.

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,440
I didn’t think it would be
a big problem like this.

50
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,200
Never mind. At least no one got hurt.

51
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,560
I’ll have to go back to my child now.

52
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,760
Everyone. There’s nothing going on.
We can all get back to our rooms now.

53
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
I’m sorry, Pupaa.

54
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,600
I really didn’t mean to do it.

55
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,480
It’s okay. It’s okay.

56
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
At least you didn’t get hurt.

57
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,440
It’s alright. It’s alright.

58
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,160
Assumption number five,
if we love someone,

59
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,520
we will care for them more than others.

60
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,240
I’m sorry I destroyed your kitchen.

61
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,740
You don’t have to apologize anymore.

62
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,920
No one wants anything like this
to happen, right?

63
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,640
I’ll admit my cooking skills is zero.

64
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,600
Then I’ll cook for you instead.

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,040
Hey, don’t make that face.

66
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,960
Didn’t you get offered a job today?

67
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,960
We should celebrate.

68
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,640
Then you can order anything,
it’s my treat.

69
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,280
You can order for me.

70
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Sure. I got it.

71
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,220
Excuse me,

72
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,600
Can I have two noodle soups?
No MSG, please.

73
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,920
Thank you.

74
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,000
Come on, let’s cheers.

75
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,240
Here.

76
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
To the talented Prapai.

77
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,460
Yay.

78
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,560
Hey Pupaa, what’s wrong?

79
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,680
Come, come.

80
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,520
Are you alright?

81
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,040
Take it slow.

82
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,160
What’s wrong with you?
Have you got diarrhea?

83
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,760
Don’t tell me...

84
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,080
Two noodle soups, please.

85
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,360
I’m sorry.
I shouldn’t have ordered street food.

86
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,800
Even though I know your body is weak
and I still took you there.

87
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,200
I’m sorry.

88
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,840
It’s alright.

89
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,200
Do you want to go to the hospital?

90
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,200
It’s alright.

91
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,880
I feel better now.

92
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,760
How are you better? You look so drained.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,160
Come on. I’ll take you to the hospital.

94
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
Come on, get up.

95
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Okay, let’s go.

96
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,480
I think he’s got food poisoning.

97
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,360
Yes, I think I have an idea about that.

98
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
He’ll feel better after a shot.

99
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,960
Thank you.

100
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,560
I feel better now.
We don’t have to do this.

101
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
I’m sorry, I can’t say no.
The doctor said so.

102
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,880
Are you afraid of needles?

103
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,000
No.

104
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,800
I just don’t know
what she’s injecting into me.

105
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,760
Hey, this is the hospital.
And she’s also a nurse.

106
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,600
Yeah, I’m afraid of needles.

107
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,880
Don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone

108
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,520
that the perfect Pupaa
is afraid of needles.

109
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,280
It won’t hurt. Don’t be scared.

110
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,760
Here, hold my hand.

111
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,480
All done.

112
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,360
She’s done.

113
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,000
Hey, it’s done.

114
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,520
See? That’s it.

115
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,600
He can go home
after he’s taken his pills.

116
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,280
Thank you.

117
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,320
Come on, let’s take the pill.

118
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,800
Come on.

119
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
I’ll go take it back at home.

120
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,480
Hey, just get it done now.

121
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,280
Don’t tell me
you’re scared of taking pills too?

122
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,080
Hey, it’s not funny.

123
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,480
I nearly choked on it to death before.

124
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,280
Aw.

125
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,320
It’s alright, little kid.

126
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,920
Don’t cry. Don’t be upset.

127
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,840
Aw.

128
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,400
Here’s water.

129
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,360
Are you better?

130
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,920
Any better?

131
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,000
Prapai.

132
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
You’re so sneaky.

133
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,800
I did it because I want you
to get better.

134
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Come on, let’s go home.

135
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,160
You lied to me. Carry me back home.

136
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,880
Alright. Come on.

137
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,480
Are you okay?

138
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,960
Walk slowly.

139
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,640
(I got my dream job already)

140
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,520
(Wealth, luck, bad luck)

141
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,920
(Lucky color for clothing table)

142
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,040
(Power, wealth, luck, back luck)

143
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Oh, you’re better already?

144
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Probably because of the pill
you tricked me into taking last night.

145
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,080
Thank you.

146
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
It’s your first day of work, isn’t it?

147
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,760
Good luck.

148
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,520
I’ll head out now. Fighting.

149
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,400
Bye.

150
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,760
Hello, Pon.

151
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,080
Great. You’re on time.

152
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,960
Tomorrow we’ve got a poster shoot,

153
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,720
doing a teaser about tourism in Bangkok.

154
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,340
Living Life in Bangkok.

155
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,880
Like the one I helped Faye with?

156
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
That’s right. Come on, follow me.

157
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,700
Everyone, this is Prapai.

158
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,360
She’ll be another creative worker
on our team.

159
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,520
Hello. You can just call me Pai.

160
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,000
Take a seat.

161
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,280
Yes.

162
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,480
How’s it going?

163
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,800
I’m fine.

164
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,000
Note down the details too,
so you don’t forget.

165
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,880
Sure.

166
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,040
Let’s start now.

167
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,760
This is a big project.

168
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,020
So we’re suggesting the client

169
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,720
to use popular celebrities
at the moment.

170
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,160
To capture the attention of teenagers
both in the country and overseas.

171
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,360
I’ve already talked about the concept
with the photographer.

172
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,560
And the details about the poster,
Cop will be responsible for that.

173
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,880
I think this is it.

174
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,000
Who’s taking care of the model?

175
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
Everyone already has a job.

176
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,300
I think you can point out
who you want to let them be in charge.

177
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,280
It’s easier that way.

178
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,540
Then I’ll let Pai do it.

179
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,820
You don’t have any responsibilities yet.

180
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,240
Just take it as your first task then.

181
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,280
Sure. I will do my best.

182
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,400
Is Professor not here yet?

183
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,760
Professor has a seminar this morning.

184
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,920
I heard the seminar has been extended,
so he might be a bit late.

185
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,480
If you need any help, just let me know.

186
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,520
Sure.

187
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,840
Pupaa.

188
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,560
Can you help me with this?

189
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,160
Sure.

190
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,880
There’s this one person who’s doing
the same research topic as I am,

191
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,180
so I was thinking of
exchanging ideas with them.

192
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,440
I think we could share some ideas.

193
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,800
Do you think I should add anything else
to this?

194
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,680
I think you need a little fixing here.

195
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,640
Try put it in.

196
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,120
Excuse me.

197
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,080
I’m sorry. Excuse me.

198
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,840
- Ta da.
- Ta da.

199
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,760
Ken, Ken. My name is Ken.

200
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,200
He’s here with Tum and oh...

201
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
- That’s all. It’s just the two of us.
- That’s all. It’s just the two of us.

202
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,160
I told you coming in like this
wouldn’t work.

203
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,620
- Look, dead silence.
- It’s not even complete.

204
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,840
Look, everyone’s so still.

205
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,840
Why are you two here?

206
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
I told with Professor already.

207
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,640
He said this research is a big topic,
I should find some help.

208
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,680
So I invited Ken and Tum to help.

209
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,360
If you have anything for us to help,
you can let us know.

210
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,240
That’s right.

211
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,760
It’s fine.

212
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I’ll go take my work to do outside.

213
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
Then where should we start?

214
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,720
This one here.

215
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,800
Oh wow.

216
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,160
Do smarty pants use these?

217
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,680
Hey, Ken. Tum.

218
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,920
Come here.

219
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,160
Excuse me, for how many years
have we been working together?

220
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,920
Exactly.

221
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,660
Why is there still a problem?

222
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,160
It’s the same problem.

223
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,040
Please fix it.

224
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Oh, I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.

225
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,360
Be careful.

226
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,800
Hello.

227
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,140
I’m Pai.

228
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,840
I will be taking care of you today, Tan.

229
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,200
Hold on. What did you call me?

230
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,520
Well, Tan.

231
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,680
Time.

232
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,800
Tan is the one with the rumor
about the swimming suit right now.

233
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,740
Where have you been?

234
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,960
I’m the year’s teenager’s idol.

235
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,520
But you called my name wrong.

236
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,240
I’m sorry. I just started working here.

237
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Did they send a newbie
to take care of me?

238
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,320
This is not professional.

239
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,360
I must make a comment on this.

240
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,440
Please, don’t tell Pon.

241
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,680
I don’t want him to know
I made a mistake.

242
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,200
I promise I will not call you
with the wrong name anymore.

243
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,360
Please.

244
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,200
Time, I’m going to go out for a while.

245
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,520
Did something happen?

246
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,840
Nothing. You can go.

247
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,000
Good. I’ll be back.

248
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,040
Can you just turn a little?

249
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,920
Just to the side.
Put your hands in your pocket.

250
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,080
Turn a bit more.

251
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,080
Everything should be fine.

252
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,880
I’ll be back then.
I’ll go grab a coffee.

253
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,000
Sure.

254
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,920
- Come on, Faye.
- Sure.

255
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,960
Put your hands in your pocket too.

256
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,960
- I’ll be right back.
- Alright.

257
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,720
Put your hands in your pocket.

258
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,560
Hey,

259
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,100
if you don’t follow the reference,

260
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,400
how will the client be using it?

261
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,280
Don’t be so problematic.

262
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,480
I’m not trying to be problematic,

263
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,520
but are you sure
you want me to pose like this?

264
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,240
Do you want to ask the agency?

265
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Let’s calm down first.

266
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,040
So what do you want?

267
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,240
If you can’t conclude it for me,
I won’t do this shoot.

268
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,400
Right now Time is upset
with the pose that he is forced to do,

269
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,240
But the photographer wants the set
to come out perfect.

270
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,280
If this continues,
this is going to be bad.

271
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,080
But Time is a famous idol.

272
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,360
If we make him upset,
it’s going to be bad.

273
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Think, girl, think.

274
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,080
So can we do this instead?

275
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,980
During the first part,

276
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,240
he can do a freestyle pose.
Act all fun and happy.

277
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,060
Then after that,
we can follow the reference.

278
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,400
Acting cool and sleek.

279
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,800
Let’s give a try.

280
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,360
- Let’s try this.
- Okay.

281
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,840
Thank you.

282
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,680
Excuse me, Time, the set is ready.
You can get into your position.

283
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,040
Everything is clear, right?

284
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,760
Yes.

285
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,840
So we’ll do a freestyle pose here.

286
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,500
I want fun.

287
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,520
And excitement.

288
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,280
Then we’ll change the mood

289
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,560
to be cool and sleek.

290
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,240
Sure.

291
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,960
All done.

292
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,880
Of course.

293
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,300
Because if there’re Ken and Tum,

294
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,480
everything will be double
the efficiency.

295
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,400
You got anything else for us to do?

296
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,760
Actually, there’s another thing
I need you to help me with.

297
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,440
- Sure.
- Sure.

298
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,720
(Hypothesis)

299
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,280
It’s the correct document, right?

300
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,440
This is very theoretical.

301
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,720
Assumption number one.

302
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,160
Always jealous
when someone gets close to her.

303
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,640
Come on, Tintin, let’s go to bed.

304
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,160
Hold on.

305
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,960
Jealous even with the kid next door?

306
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,040
Even if it was a kid, but it’s a boy.

307
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,360
Oh boy, let’s look at the second one.

308
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,500
Assumption number two.

309
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,600
Heart races when she’s near.

310
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,880
It is found that

311
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,440
the heart rate is with an average of
100-135 beats per minute

312
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,240
every time she gets close.

313
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
Let’s get onto the next one.

314
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,660
Assumption number three.

315
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,440
She changes me unbelievably.

316
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,160
Excuse me, can I get another spare fork?

317
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,680
Is it good?

318
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,140
Assumption number four.

319
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,840
I’m always happy when she’s happy.

320
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,560
I’m getting a job.
I got a job interview.

321
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,680
Assumption number five.

322
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,620
If we love that person,

323
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,720
we will care for them more than others.

324
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,920
So,

325
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,520
what’s the conclusion?

326
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,380
This is so obvious.

327
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,560
How can someone smart like you not know?

328
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,180
Exactly.

329
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,840
Should’ve known since assumption two.

330
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,120
(Like or not like)

331
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,440
So who is this girl?

332
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,800
Who is it?

333
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,280
You don’t have to know.

334
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Once we’ve got the conclusion,

335
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,520
what do I do next?

336
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,760
Just continue flirting with her.
What are you waiting for?

337
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,360
When did you get here?

338
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,560
So, how do I flirt with her?

339
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,400
It’s hard work,
being at a production shoot.

340
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,260
Excuse me.

341
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,160
What are you doing here?
Only staff is allowed in here.

342
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,940
I just wanted to get Time’s autograph.

343
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,120
Can you please help me?

344
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,220
I travelled on the train from far away.

345
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,480
I came here since morning.

346
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,400
Can you please help me?

347
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,640
Please.

348
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,500
Please.

349
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,880
I really want it.
I came here just for it.

350
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,120
Alright.
I’ll try talking to him for you.

351
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,240
Thank you.

352
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,080
Oh Time, have you not changed?

353
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,040
No one told me what to do.

354
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,040
How can you guys work like this?

355
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,680
And what’s that?

356
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,160
You want an autograph?

357
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,480
And you called me the wrong name?

358
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,000
Your fan asked me to get your autograph.

359
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,160
I can’t sign.

360
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,440
Why?

361
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,920
It’s not in the work schedule.

362
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,680
What? It’s only an autograph.

363
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,280
She came from far away.

364
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,080
I said I can’t sign.
Don’t you understand?

365
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,760
So what do you want me to tell her?

366
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,040
I feel bad for her.

367
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,080
You accepted it. Fix your own problem.

368
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,940
You’re so mean.

369
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,280
How can this type of person
even have a fanclub?

370
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,660
Such a pity for his fanclub.

371
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,640
You can’t even sign one autograph.

372
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,980
(Time)

373
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,840
How to flirt
and make her fall in love with you.

374
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,440
So how does it work?

375
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,800
Start with giving attention.

376
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,760
Just call her.

377
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,520
Yes.

378
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,420
Ask her how she’s doing.

379
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,240
Show her your care.

380
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,400
Why do I need to call?
We’ll meet in the evening anyway.

381
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,960
So,

382
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,160
I’ll go make a call.

383
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,000
Hello, what’s going on?

384
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,440
How are you doing?

385
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,720
I’m a bit busy right now.
We’ll talk later.

386
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,840
How was it?

387
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,400
It didn’t work.

388
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,680
She said she’s busy and just hung up.

389
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,760
Don’t give up.

390
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Girls are like this.
You’ve got to keep trying at first.

391
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,160
Let’s do this. Send her a text.

392
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,540
- Send it.
- Send it.

393
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,200
Send it. Send it.

394
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:46,320
(Take care of yourself
and don’t forget to eat)

395
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,060
This seems too normal.

396
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,680
It doesn’t feel special.

397
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:04,480
(Take a break some time. I’m worried.)

398
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,800
That seems too direct.
You don’t look sophisticated.

399
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,280
I’ll think of one on my own.

400
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,320
Good job.

401
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,520
(Pupaa
I won’t be home too late today.)

402
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,720
(Take a break some time. I’m worried.)

403
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,680
(How does it
feel working in the job you like?)

404
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,780
(It’s actually really fun.)

405
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,280
(It’s only the model
that’s giving me a hard time.)

406
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,240
Start by giving attention.

407
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,260
(There’s a lot of dust outside.
Lots of diseases spreading.)

408
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,480
(Take care of yourself.)

409
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,520
(The name of the group
has changed to Secret Mission)

410
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,640
(The highest possibility is that
it’s the girl from the party.)

411
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,840
(I don’t think so.
That’s his best friend’s best friend.)

412
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,120
(Let’s consider other possibilities.)

413
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,180
(Where are you working at?)

414
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,840
(I’ll check for you
if the dust level is high or not.)

415
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,720
- All done.
- Thank you.

416
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,760
Thank you.

417
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,280
You can come
and check out the photos first.

418
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,160
This one looks great.

419
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,720
Don’t you think?

420
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,520
Calm down, please.

421
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,400
Everyone, please give me some time.

422
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,860
Today Time is only here to work.

423
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,640
He’s not giving out autographs.

424
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,040
Then why is she the only person
to get the autograph?

425
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,720
Exactly.

426
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,840
We’re not okay with this.

427
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,440
We’ve always supported Time.

428
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,480
Wherever you want us to go,
we’re always there.

429
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,300
But there’s someone
who’s had more privilege.

430
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,280
What do you want us to think?

431
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,880
Yes, we can’t take this.

432
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,080
Why is she the only one
who got the autograph?

433
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,160
I think

434
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,880
today Time worked in the studio
the entire day.

435
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,520
He didn’t come out to meet anyone.

436
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,400
I don’t think
this is the real autograph.

437
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,560
Hey you.

438
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,640
You faked the autograph?

439
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,800
I didn’t fake it.
I really didn’t fake it.

440
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,120
I gave the photo to one of the staff.

441
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,080
And Time really signed it back to me.

442
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,340
Here. Here she is.

443
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:10,800
Prapai.

444
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,280
Hey, how can you do this?

445
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,040
Why did you do this?

446
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,560
Explain to us.

447
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,040
Come here, everyone.

448
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,480
Because I’ve already finished the shoot
today,

449
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,140
I’ll give everyone a photo

450
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,240
and an autograph to everyone
who came to support me today.

451
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,120
For every Timer here today.

452
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
Is everything good?

453
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,000
Certainly.

454
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,800
I’m so happy today.

455
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,240
Yay.

456
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,400
Thank you everyone for coming
to support me here today.

457
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,600
We are so honored.

458
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,400
First job
and you’ve already caused trouble.

459
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,720
Why didn’t you think things through?

460
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,000
I’m sorry.

461
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,880
I didn’t think
it would come out like this.

462
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,240
You’re a creative.
You have to think smart.

463
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,160
It’s good that Time came to help
on time.

464
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,920
Otherwise you’ll be doomed.

465
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,760
I really apologize for what happened.

466
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,120
She just joined the team.
She really doesn’t know.

467
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,760
Making you waste your time
to sign a lot of photos.

468
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,560
It’s not a waste of time.

469
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,200
Because I didn’t say
that I’d sign it myself.

470
00:33:50,440 --> 00:34:01,920
(I’m just passing by the studio.
Do you want to go back together?)

471
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,920
(I’m not done yet. There’s so much work.
You can go home first.)

472
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:12,000
(It’s alright. I can wait.)

473
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,240
(Up to you. I warned you.)

474
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,520
Are you Prapai?

475
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,200
Yes.

476
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,400
Your smile really is bright.

477
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,040
Someone gave this to you.

478
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,640
Thank you.

479
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,440
Good work. You can’t even tell
it’s not my real autograph.

480
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,440
When you’re done signing,
don’t forget to give them to the fans.

481
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,200
And this too.

482
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,600
Give the masks to my fans too.

483
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,480
When are you going to finish all this?

484
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,600
I know, right?

485
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,280
I now understand why you didn’t sign it
in the first place.

486
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,320
I’m really sorry I caused you trouble.

487
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,360
I really didn’t think things through
like what Pon said.

488
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,360
No, please don’t.

489
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,200
I caused the trouble.
I should be responsible for it.

490
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,920
The fact you sorted things out
with your fans for me,

491
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,160
I’m grateful enough already.

492
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Why do you keep talking so formally?

493
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
Makes me think of when I first debuted.

494
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,560
There weren’t as many fans as now.

495
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
I signed every photo for them.

496
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,160
Here you go. Give these out too.

497
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,480
Sure.

498
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,360
What are you waiting for? Go on.

499
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,320
Sure.

500
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,840
I’m sorry for the long wait.

501
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,360
I’m sure there’s enough for everyone.

502
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,640
Here you go.

503
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,400
Here you go.

504
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,760
Thank you.

505
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,160
Here you go.

506
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,560
Here you go.

507
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,760
Thank you.

508
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,280
See you again.

509
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,000
I have a male fan too?

510
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,800
It’s late already. Where are you going?

511
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,240
I’ll drop you off.

512
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,440
Thank you.

513
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,600
But I’ve got someone
to pick me up already.

514
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,760
Up to you.

515
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,840
- He’s really handsome.
- True.

516
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,000
He’s so handsome, right?

517
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,760
Come on, Prapai, let’s go home.

518
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Hey, what is this?

519
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,640
Are you a creep?

520
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,120
- I’m sorry.
- I don’t know him.

521
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,520
He looks good.
Shouldn’t have been a creep.

522
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,480
Pupaa.

523
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,280
Did you meet a friend?

524
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,120
Oh.

525
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,040
I talked to the wrong person.

526
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,720
Where’s the mask I gave you?

527
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,640
Oh, it was you?

528
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,280
It’s not this one.

529
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,160
They’re all the same.

530
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,640
Come on, let’s go home.

531
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,160
It’s not the same.

532
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:36,860
(Wawa)

533
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,240
What’s going on, Wawa?

534
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,160
Pai.

535
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
Ta hasn’t even talked to me.

536
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
He just disappeared.

537
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,320
What should I do?

538
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,240
It’s what I’ve been trying to tell you
all along.

539
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,240
I didn’t want to see you
crying over and over again like this.

540
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,320
I’ve known him for a long time.

541
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,680
I know he can’t be changed.

542
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,560
I know too.

543
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,360
But it’s not easy
to stop loving someone.

544
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,680
But if one day,

545
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,560
you’ve made your mind and be strong.
You’ll get over it.

546
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,560
And you’ll meet the right person
for you.

547
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,840
I don’t know, Pai, I don’t know.

548
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,560
(Rendering video)

549
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,560
It’s alright. I’ll be here for you.

550
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,280
(I miss you)

551
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,320
(This page is a must)

552
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,840
(Tomorrow’s the first day
of mid-term exam. Study hard.)

553
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,840
Here,
you can put the dessert right here.

554
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,920
Please.

555
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,080
You can put the purple one here.
Thank you.

556
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,260
Prapai.

557
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,520
Time asked for you. He said it’s urgent.

558
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,280
Just go.

559
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,520
And don’t cause any more trouble.

560
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,640
Sure.

561
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,240
- You replace her here.
- Sure.

562
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,920
How’s it going?

563
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,960
How can I help you?

564
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,680
Nothing.

565
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,080
I just asked to see
if you’re here today.

566
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
You can go now.

567
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,760
Sure.

568
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,240
Pai.

569
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,480
- Yes?
- I want a cold wipe.

570
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,040
Cold wipe?

571
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,160
Sure.

572
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,920
Here’s your cold wipe.

573
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,760
What have we got for lunch?

574
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,520
I’ll go check it out for you.

575
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,880
Chilli basil stir fry.

576
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,000
Too spicy.

577
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,640
Noodles stir fry.

578
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,040
Too fat.

579
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,640
I want some water.

580
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,240
I said I’m thirsty.

581
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,640
Sure.

582
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,480
Here’s your cold water.

583
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,320
I want room temperature water.

584
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,840
Can’t you make do with cold water?

585
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,280
Room temperature water.

586
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,280
Room temperature.

587
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,560
Sure. Please wait a moment.

588
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,960
Here’s your water.

589
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,600
Here you go.

590
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,080
Alright?

591
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,680
I want a straw.

592
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,720
Sure. Please wait a moment.

593
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,600
Pai.

594
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,560
Pai.

595
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,320
Pai.

596
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,320
What is going on?

597
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,120
Pai.

598
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,320
What?

599
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,360
I’m sorry.

600
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,880
I was just going to tell you
the set is ready. Go get Time.

601
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,400
Sure.

602
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,120
I haven’t called you yet.

603
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,800
The set is ready. You can head over now.

604
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,440
Stop talking to me so formally.

605
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,240
Then I’ll go.

606
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,920
What are you talking about?

607
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,680
Time, please head to the set.

608
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,880
Just a bit more.

609
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,160
Time, please go to the set.

610
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,960
Just a bit more.

611
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,840
Time, let’s go to the set.

612
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,880
That’s it. Come on.

613
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,560
Please go.

614
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,720
Please go, please.

615
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,880
Just this one, trust me.

616
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,680
The reason I got to date my girlfriend
is because of this book.

617
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,600
Really?

618
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,200
Are you serious?

619
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,640
Yeah. After I finished the book,
she said yes.

620
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,080
Thank you so much.

621
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,680
Come on, trust me.

622
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,440
(Guide for men to chase after women)

623
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,640
There’s only a few left,
meaning a lot of people have bought it.

624
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,600
(Biography of Einstein)

625
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,020
This book is really popular.

626
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,080
Everyone says it works.

627
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,800
480 baht.

628
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,080
Do you want a bag?

629
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,640
No, thanks.

630
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,880
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

631
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,160
Thank you.

632
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,520
Pai. What should I do?

633
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,900
What’s going on?

634
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,400
The girl model
that needs to shoot with Time,

635
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,160
we’ve told her to be here at 8,
and she’s not here yet.

636
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,320
She said she’ll be here in 15 minutes.

637
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,000
Then just wait. It’s only 15 minutes.

638
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,200
We can wait.
But we’re afraid that Time won’t wait.

639
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,840
Time is very strict on being on time.

640
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,160
That much?

641
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,900
Yes. The reason we’re stressed

642
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,960
is because it happened once.

643
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,340
He left the set before.

644
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,160
because the other actor
didn’t come on time.

645
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,340
If he knows that our model
is not here yet,

646
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,160
it’s going to be...

647
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,600
I’m going now.

648
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,680
(Special scene)

649
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,800
You can’t go in if you’re not a staff.

650
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,360
I just wanted to give a friend
something.

651
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,360
Oh, what’s her name?
So I can give it to the right person.

652
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,720
Her name is Prapai.

653
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,320
Her height is about 163 cm.

654
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,400
Her eyes are bright and shiny.

655
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,840
And when she smiles,
everything becomes bright.

656
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,120
Overall,

657
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,120
she’s cute.
