You two can come too.

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,920
- Sure.
- No, thanks.

32
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,520
It’s a graduation trip for the club.

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,720
The juniors set it up for us.
It’s going to be only us.

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,960
It’s just for fun. Come with us.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,320
Come on.

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,720
We’re going to the beach.

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,760
Yeah, it’s going to be fun.

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,000
If the girls are going,
you’re all welcome.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,080
Great job.

40
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,880
Come on, Pai.

41
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,680
Let’s go have fun together.

42
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,840
- Come with us.
- Please, come on.

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,160
So Pai is...

44
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,360
Shouldn’t go.

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,080
This is our club’s activity.

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,640
Those who are not involved shouldn’t go.

47
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,360
You guys should go. I’m going home.

48
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,960
- Wait, Pai.
- Pai.

49
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,640
I’ll go talk her back. Pai.

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,240
You know what you just said?

51
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,000
I’m just saying the truth.

52
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,740
(Ta)

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,560
Pai,
so are you going to the trip Ta invited?

54
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,320
No, I want to stay
and finish my final project.

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,160
Come on, let’s go. It’s only a few days.

56
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,640
We won’t have any occasions like this
when we graduate.

57
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,480
Please, let’s go, please.

58
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,240
Hello, Ta, what’s up?

59
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
Ta wants to speak to you.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,160
Hello?

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,440
If you’re calling about the trip...

62
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,720
No.

63
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,040
Because my roommate
is still bugging me about it.

64
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Pai, what is wrong with you?

65
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,600
I’m not upset.

66
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,800
If you’re not upset,
then you have to come with us.

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,000
Otherwise, I’ll say you’re upset.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,680
Please go.

69
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,440
Please.

70
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,340
If you’re not going,
then who am I going to sleep with?

71
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,120
Pai.

72
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,080
Oh my, alright, alright.

73
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,240
Yes!

74
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,320
Here, take it back.

75
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,000
You’re the best.

76
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,080
That’s enough. Go back to your bed.

77
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,240
What are we waiting for?

78
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:16,980
Well,

79
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,120
Pai and Wawa.

80
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,000
It’s late already.
I don’t think they’re coming.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,600
Come on, let’s just go.
We need to catch up with the others.

82
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,620
Come on, just wait a bit more.

83
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,440
I’m calling them now.
Just wait a minute.

84
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,080
Pai, quickly.

85
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,640
I know. I’m rushing too.

86
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,040
(Elevator is broken)

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,200
Why does it have to be broken now?

88
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,800
The elevator is broken.
Can I not go anymore?

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
No. Hurry up.

90
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,440
Come on,
we’ve waited for 10 seconds already.

91
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,720
Wait, just 10 seconds?

92
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,440
Oh my, just bossing me around.

93
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,000
Ten seconds is not called waiting,
Pupaa.

94
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,520
Come on, start the car.

95
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
Yes, sir.

96
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,520
You can’t even wait.
You’re so impatient.

97
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,160
Ta, it’s another 10 seconds late.

98
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Let’s go to the beach.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
Is that Ta’s car?

100
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,360
Hey, where is he going?

101
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,720
Wait, wait. Wait for us.

102
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,680
Be careful.

103
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,560
Hey.

104
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,560
- Stop the car.
- Hey.

105
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,880
- Pai.
- Ta, what’s wrong?

106
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,600
- Are you hurt?
- I’m okay.

107
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,960
Prapai.

108
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,280
Oh, is my car alright?
Is there a scratch?

109
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,560
Why are you laughing?

110
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,120
You’re the one who invited us
and didn’t even wait.

111
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,320
Do you really want us to go?

112
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,400
This guy.

113
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,160
He said not to wait.

114
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,040
You were late,
so I thought you’re not going anymore.

115
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,720
Look at all your wounds.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,360
Why aren’t you staying in to rest?

117
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,640
I didn’t want to go anyway.
I’m going to go back now.

118
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,080
- Wait, we’re just joking.
- Pai, come on, let’s go.

119
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,680
Alright, let’s go.

120
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,920
Let’s go.

121
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,800
Come on, I’ll help you.

122
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,600
All done.

123
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,600
Why are both of your bags the same?

124
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,560
- Traded in after shopping.
- Traded in after shopping.

125
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,840
Come on, let’s go.

126
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,960
Can Pai sit at the front?
She gets car sick.

127
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,280
But normally she’s fine.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,560
It’s fine. Let Wawa sit at the front.
I’ll sit at the back.

129
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,300
So what? What if you get car sick

130
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,640
and vomit in my car?

131
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,720
I don’t get car sick anymore. I’m fine.

132
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,760
I’ve known you for how many years?
It’s not easy to stop getting car sick.

133
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,920
Are you crazy? Come on, let’s go.
Just sit at the front.

134
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,960
If you don’t hurry up,
Pupaa will start complaining again.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,760
Come on.

136
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,120
Just both sit at the back.

137
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,120
Stop fighting.

138
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,440
We’re already 22 minutes late.

139
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,140
Why are you so jealous?

140
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,840
You think people won’t notice?

141
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,600
Oh man.

142
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,160
Are you alright, Pai?

143
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,800
I’m great.

144
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,520
Look at you saying you’re fine.

145
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,520
I told you Prapai gets car sick.
You didn’t believe me.

146
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,120
Lovely smell.

147
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,960
What are you doing?

148
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,160
Pressing your Hegu point.
Just like traditional Chinese medicine.

149
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,520
Helps with car sickness.

150
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,080
What point is it?

151
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Hegu point.

152
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,840
Oh, Hegu point?

153
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,440
Teach me too.

154
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,160
Give me your hand.
I’ll press it for you.

155
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,240
Professor Ta.

156
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,840
It really does feel good.

157
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,960
You’re feeling good,
but others are about to die.

158
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,240
Come on, let’s go. Hurry up.

159
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,720
We’ll all be late because of me.

160
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,160
Hold on.

161
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,080
You can sit at the front.

162
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,020
(Coastal road)

163
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,640
Wawa.

164
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Come on, I’ll help you.

165
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,940
Here you go.

166
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,240
Here you go, Wawa.

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,960
Thank you.

168
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,400
Here you go.

169
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,960
Here’s another one.

170
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
The last one.

171
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,560
But not the least.

172
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
This one is the last one.

173
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,320
I’ll go check on the keys for you.

174
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,240
I’ll come too.

175
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,440
Let’s go.

176
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,200
See you.

177
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,840
I’m hungry.

178
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,160
Thank you.

179
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,440
Why are you so cold?

180
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,360
Let me lie down.

181
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,120
There’s only one bed.

182
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,000
Whoever sleeps first, loses.

183
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,720
Oh man, you’re not playing with me.

184
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,240
Oh, Mr. Pupaa.

185
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,840
We’re only here for a night.

186
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,600
Why checking the entire room?

187
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,640
I just want everything to be in place.

188
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,160
Up to you.

189
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,440
I’m going to go for a walk.

190
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,780
I was thinking of going to check out
the party area for tonight.

191
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,440
Do you want to come?

192
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,920
No, thanks.

193
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,380
The sun is too bright.

194
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,000
I don’t want to get skin cancer.

195
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,560
OK, OK, I’ll go ask Pai.

196
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,840
Wait a minute, Ta.

197
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,680
Did you change your mind?

198
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,640
Wear your sunglasses,
you’ll get cataract.

199
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,520
Sure, see you.

200
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,160
Yeah, what do you want?

201
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,960
Do you want to go for a walk?

202
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,560
Can I go?

203
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,240
Can I go too?

204
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,200
Yeah, sure, it’ll be fun going together.

205
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,840
I’ll go get my stuff.

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,800
Let’s go.

207
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,720
Quickly, let’s go to the beach.

208
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,240
Why are both of your bags the same?

209
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,200
Ta, look at that.

210
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,240
It’s beautiful.

211
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,680
- There’s more over there.
- Let’s go see.

212
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,440
Are you alright?

213
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,760
Ta, come help me. I can’t walk anymore.

214
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,200
You can sit down and take a rest.

215
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,240
You can catch up when you’re ready.

216
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,640
Come on.

217
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,400
Ta, if you turn around and just call me

218
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,120
I wouldn’t give up.

219
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,840
Prapai.

220
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,640
Look at that.

221
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,040
Why are there buildings there?

222
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,840
It’s called a mirage.

223
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,200
This phenomenon is caused by
the refraction of light.

224
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,020
Because the temperature of the air layer
that light travels through is different,

225
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,040
so it causes a reflection.

226
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,200
A delusion.

227
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,840
Something like that.

228
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,520
But in the end, the delusion disappears.

229
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,560
Because it’s not real.

230
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,720
Just like when we have our own thoughts,

231
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,320
thinking that one day he will see me.

232
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,660
If you know it’s not real,

233
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,840
then you should accept the truth,

234
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,280
and be with what’s real.

235
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,680
I guess so.

236
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,440
So, what are you doing here?

237
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,200
Your bag was swapped with mine.

238
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,080
I don’t think so. Mine has a key chain.

239
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,920
It must be.

240
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,880
Because...

241
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,200
I saw...

242
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,240
a bra in the bag.

243
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,920
Really?

244
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,960
Let’s go change it now. Quick.

245
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Give me a pose and smile.

246
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,140
Great.

247
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,520
One more photo.

248
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Another one.

249
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,560
Move the scarf.

250
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,200
1, 2, 3.

251
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,320
I thought you’re a real model.

252
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,060
Ta, don’t look at me like that.

253
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,160
Your girlfriend will be jealous.

254
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,520
Who’s going to be jealous of me?
I don’t have a girlfriend.

255
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,440
What about Prapai?

256
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,000
Apart from... that...

257
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,600
You didn’t see anything else, right?

258
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,480
What a relief.

259
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You didn’t take anything, right?

260
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,840
There’s one thing.

261
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,020
See, you’re a pervert.

262
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,320
Give me back my bikini.

263
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,360
I meant this.

264
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,360
The kitty?

265
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,560
Yes, the kitty.

266
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,640
So where is it?

267
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,080
Here it is, I found it.

268
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,960
Ken, Tum.

269
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,600
Come on.

270
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,600
Ta is here, I’m here.

271
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,160
Pai, can I talk to you?

272
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,040
What’s up?
What do you want to talk about?

273
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,840
I will be honest with you,
only this one time.

274
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,560
I like Ta.

275
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,960
I want to ask him out.
And I know you like him, too.

276
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,000
Shall we let Ta choose
who he wants to be with?

277
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,240
If Ta chooses you,
I will give up everything.

278
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,560
You can shout or scold at me,

279
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,080
but I really want to fight for
this love.

280
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,600
Why are you smiling?

281
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,240
Smiling for your dedication.

282
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,560
Me and Ta, we used to...

283
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,960
Never mind. You don’t need to worry.

284
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,180
From now on,

285
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,180
Me and Ta are just friends.

286
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,720
Okay?

287
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,320
Really? Are you serious?

288
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,920
Then you must help me with Ta.

289
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,340
But you need to be careful,

290
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,760
I don’t want to see you upset.

291
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,640
Why?

292
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,640
You’ll know
when you’ve known him for a while.

293
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,760
Come on, let’s go.
They’re waiting for us.

294
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,780
And this is the climax of the trip

295
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,780
that everyone’s been for waiting.

296
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,880
Waiting for.

297
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,920
- Which is our beach activity!
- Beach activity!

298
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,320
This is the two-legged race game.

299
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,600
But we’re not just going to let you
waste your energy for free.

300
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,520
Yes, exactly.
We have a special prize for you too.

301
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,540
Which is a bouquet of blue roses.

302
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,400
It’s a rare item.

303
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,100
Let me tell you,

304
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,000
if any guy gives this to a girl,

305
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,320
she’ll take it for sure.

306
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,240
Take what?

307
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,440
Take your heart.

308
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,040
The second prize? A lipstick.

309
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,520
This color is limited edition.

310
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,880
Like, winning the prize, putting it on,
and getting a kiss?

311
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,180
Whoever gets the first and second prize
can take it.

312
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,980
I want the third prize.

313
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,760
Why?

314
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,480
Because it’s a Gold series basketball.

315
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,040
Then what are we waiting for?

316
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,720
Come get the rope and pair up.

317
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,800
Ta, can you be my partner?

318
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,040
Yeah, of course.

319
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,240
Let’s go get the rope.

320
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,320
Ken, Tum, can I have a rope?

321
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,380
Done.

322
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,240
Everyone, we’re going to start now.
One, two.

323
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,120
Two.

324
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,860
We need to run at the same pace

325
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,160
to get through this.

326
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,200
Don’t run alone. Let’s count together.

327
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,040
One, two.

328
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,680
- One, two, one.
- One, two, one.

329
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,520
Pupaa and Prapai are in the lead.
They’re leading now.

330
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,920
- One, two.
- One, two.

331
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,800
Can Ta and Wawa catch up?

332
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,760
Pupaa and Prapai are winning this.

333
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:53,580
Ouch.

334
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,920
Oh, they fell.

335
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,080
Are you alright?

336
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,080
I’m fine. It’s just a small wound.

337
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,020
Oh my.

338
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,920
Ta and Wawa have beaten them.

339
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,440
Hey, they’ve beaten us already.

340
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,960
Never mind.

341
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,340
How can you say that?

342
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,560
I’m not getting hurt for nothing.

343
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,360
Come on let’s go.

344
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,480
Step on my foot.

345
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,140
- Let’s go. One.
- One, two.

346
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,820
What’s happening?

347
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,920
Can they catch up?

348
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,060
- Two.
- One.

349
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,440
They’re catching up. Hurry up.

350
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,760
- They’re catching up.
- Can they catch up?

351
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,520
Hurry up.

352
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,880
We can’t catch up anymore.

353
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,200
- Can they catch up?
- Ta and Wawa.

354
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,520
- We’re nearly there.
- Pupaa and Prapai.

355
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,320
- We’re nearly there.
- Ta and Wawa.

356
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,120
- Nearly there.
- Pupaa and Prapai.

357
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,880
- We’re nearly there.
- Ta and Wawa.

358
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
Just a bit further.

359
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,880
Ta and Wawa are at the finish line.

360
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,640
- They won.
- Just by a tiny bit.

361
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,360
- Good job.
- Our team is great.

362
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,520
What a pity. We were so close.

363
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,520
Come on, I’ll get your wound treated.

364
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,440
Get on my back.

365
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,520
I can walk. You don’t have to carry me.

366
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Just come on.

367
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,220
Come on.

368
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,000
All done.

369
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,840
Thank you.

370
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,760
I’ll be back. Just wait for me here.

371
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,920
Oh my god, did we win this prize?

372
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,700
That’s great.
Being second isn’t that bad.

373
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,560
We got a lipstick.

374
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,840
Why do girls like lipsticks?

375
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,720
Because lipsticks are like
a girl’s secret weapon.

376
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,160
It’s like when guys play games
and they have secret weapons.

377
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,560
Because lipsticks are like
a girl’s weapon.

378
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,940
You see?

379
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,800
Does it look like a commercial?

380
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,920
Does it?

381
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,180
Hey.

382
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,360
I’m trying to be beautiful, not funny.

383
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,720
Sorry.

384
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,960
Isn’t it beautiful?

385
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,320
It looks like the old one.

386
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,440
Really?

387
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,120
Isn’t it sad? We’re graduating soon.

388
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,720
We’ll all have to go our separate ways.

389
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,560
Wait a minute, I’ll be back.

390
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,020
No matter what happens,

391
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,920
our friendship will never fade away.

392
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,080
Let me hug you.

393
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,100
After all this,
I don’t have you as a roommate anymore,

394
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,440
I would probably be lonely.

395
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,820
If I didn’t have you,

396
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,000
my life would be so quiet.

397
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,720
Do you want to take me with you?

398
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,660
No, thanks.

399
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,720
But thank you for the great friendship
throughout the past four years.

400
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,920
No, it’s forever.

401
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,480
Come on.

402
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,280
I haven’t eaten.

403
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,640
Try it.

404
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,000
How is it?

405
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,120
Is it tasty?

406
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,320
Some grilled shrimp served hot.

407
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,040
Wow, it looks great.

408
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,360
Of course, I cooked it.

409
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,680
I’ll go get the dipping sauce.
Wait a minute.

410
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,320
I’ll peel them for you.

411
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,920
- It’s delicious, right?
- Ken.

412
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,900
Yeah?

413
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,960
Can you give this to Ta and Wawa for me?

414
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,280
There’re three bowls.

415
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,800
You can take one of them. I’m off now.

416
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,480
This is so fresh.

417
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,300
Here you go, Wawa.

418
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,480
Prapai told me to give you this.

419
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,920
Where did Pai go?

420
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,640
I don’t know. I saw her go off that way.

421
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,240
Can I have one?

422
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,080
You’re also waiting for the
meteor shower?

423
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,080
It was announced that there will be
a meteor shower phenomenon.

424
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,040
But this time
won’t be as much as last year.

425
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,900
But being in the countryside like this,

426
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,240
it should be easier to see
than in the city.

427
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,880
Because there’re no other lights around.

428
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,520
And if we put our hands like this,
we can see it more easily.

429
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,280
You normally stay quiet,
but you’re actually quite talkative.

430
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,520
Like this?

431
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,280
Like this.

432
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,200
Oh, look, a meteor. Make a wish.

433
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,960
A meteor is just a falling meteorite.

434
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,560
Shh, make a wish. Look.

435
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,660
You normally have a straight face.

436
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,720
You look better when you smile.

437
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,480
What are you looking at?

438
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,500
At Chiang Mai,

439
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,560
there’re way more stars.

440
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,640
If you like watching the meteor,
you should go visit sometime.

441
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,240
I used to live in Chiang Mai
when I was young.

442
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,740
Really?

443
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,880
We might have met before, right?

444
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,200
Just like the
six degrees of separation theory?

445
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,760
How many people do you follow
on social media?

446
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
Maybe about 400 people?

447
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,840
And how many of them
do you actually know?

448
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,120
Maybe about 100.

449
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,400
Mathematically explaining,

450
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,060
if everyone knew on average 100 people,

451
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,400
meaning they will know about six layers
of 100 people.

452
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,560
This is already more than
the population of the world.

453
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,780
This means I’ll know the prime minister,
right?

454
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,300
Am I right? Yeah?

455
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,560
It’s only a theory.
There’s always a possibility.

456
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,440
But maybe not that much
of a coincidence.

457
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,900
I thought you said
you went to get the dipping sauce.

458
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,880
Is your dipping sauce here?

459
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,220
Or,

460
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,000
if you wanted to meet up with a guy,
you can tell me.

461
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,320
Ta, don’t start a fight on me.

462
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,840
We just met in coincidence.

463
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,020
We don’t need to explain.

464
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,320
We were talking.
What does it have to do with him?

465
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,700
But,

466
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,880
because I’m Pupaa’s best friend,

467
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,400
I’ll tell you now, you and Pupaa
will never understand each other.

468
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,080
Because you know nothing about science.

469
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,420
Because all you do

470
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,600
is look for good food
or just something nonsense.

471
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,600
Ta, that’s too much. Say sorry to me.

472
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,120
Why do I have to say sorry?
Did I say something wrong?

473
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,500
You’ve been my friend for so long.

474
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,240
If you think I’m like this,

475
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,760
then it’s up to you.

476
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,640
Ta.

477
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,680
Isn’t Prapai your best friend?

478
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,440
Friends don’t do this to each other.

479
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,000
Hello?

480
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,600
Mr. Pupaa,
from the department of physics right?

481
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,240
I apologize for calling so late.

482
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,200
It’s alright.

483
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,940
I happen to look through your research.

484
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,200
Do you want to get interviewed
as my assistance?

485
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,720
Yes, I am interested.

486
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,560
How about tomorrow at 10 a.m.?

487
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,480
Sure, sir.

488
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,720
Great. See you tomorrow.

489
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,440
Goodbye.

490
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,560
Pai. Pai.

491
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,480
Let go.

492
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,080
Pai, where are you going?

493
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,840
I’m going to leave. Stop following me.

494
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,480
Pai.

495
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,680
Wait a minute, can we talk?

496
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,120
Ta, I’m going to leave now.

497
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,200
I’ve got an interview tomorrow.

498
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,080
Really?

499
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,880
What a coincidence.

500
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,280
It’s not a coincidence.

501
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,640
I’m following Pupaa back. Are you happy?

502
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,520
Then please take care of Prapai.

503
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,000
Then you take care of Wawa, too.

504
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,600
Let’s go.

505
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,520
You can talk if you want.
I won’t get annoyed.

506
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,440
It’s kind of good that we left early.

507
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,120
So I can go back and finish my project.

508
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:43,200
Did you know? I actually hate math.

509
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,800
But I’m here doing accounting.

510
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,480
Isn’t it funny?

511
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,600
Actually,

512
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,760
I wanted to study advertising.

513
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,140
But my father

514
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,320
was afraid it would be difficult
to find a job.

515
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,960
We fought all the time.
And in the end, I gave up.

516
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,040
When I was in middle school,
I deliberately chose language arts.

517
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,960
And you studied together with Ta, right?

518
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,960
Umm.

519
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,640
It was me, Ta and Kwang.
Just the three of us.

520
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,260
But

521
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,320
one day, Ta and Kwang started dating.

522
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,760
So I became useless.

523
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,320
Why do I have to like someone like this?

524
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,480
You’re so stupid, Prapai.

525
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,200
Ouch, who hit my head?

526
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,240
I...

527
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,400
I...

528
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,920
How are you going to
take responsibility for this?

529
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,500
I don’t even know if my head has a lump,

530
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,840
Give me your hand and feel it.

531
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,860
Feel my head, is there a lump?

532
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,560
Here, over here.

533
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,120
Pupaa, is this your type?

534
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,880
It’s okay, don’t be shy.

535
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,060
I have to go now.

536
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,420
- Take care of yourself.
- Where are you going?

537
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,280
Let me come too.

538
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,920
Let me come too, wait for me.

539
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Wait for me. Stop. Wait for me too.

540
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,600
I really like your research direction.

541
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,060
You have a very open mind.

542
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,960
But there are a lot of people
who are interested in the position.

543
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,480
Yes, anyone would love to do
a great research.

544
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,940
Well, this research
still has a long way to go.

545
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,960
If we received some financial support,

546
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,180
we can develop to a larger scale.

547
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,880
Until then,
we shall have a lot more to do.

548
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,640
But I think
I won’t be working with you anymore.

549
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,400
I don’t know any investors.

550
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,840
What are you saying?
Those who can come here to study.

551
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,000
I believe their family status
is well-off.

552
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,440
I hope you find your investor soon.

553
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,640
I should get going.

554
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,880
Excuse me,

555
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,120
are you Pupaa?

556
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,800
I overheard you’re looking for a job.

557
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,620
I know a professor,

558
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,360
he has a similar personality as you.

559
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,280
Are you interested?

560
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,760
Sure.

561
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,080
Can I have your contact number?

562
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,620
I’ll send you
the professor’s contact details.

563
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,720
You can try and call him.

564
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,600
Tell him Meena introduced you to him.

565
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,160
Thank you.

566
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,540
You don’t need to thank me.

567
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,680
You can buy me a meal
if you pass the interview.

568
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,160
I’ll excuse myself.

569
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,080
The final settlement is 250,000, right?

570
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,000
No, it’s 280,000.

571
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,840
Really?

572
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,480
I think you miscalculated.

573
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,720
I don’t think so.

574
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,920
So how was your beach trip?

575
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,480
It was okay.

576
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,040
Why so? You went with Ta, didn’t you?

577
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,000
No.

578
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,120
What happened? Did you guys fight again?

579
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,360
Can you stop talking about him?

580
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,160
From now on,
Ta will be just a regular friend.

581
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,900
He’s just as unimportant
as everyone else.

582
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,000
So then stop talking about him.

583
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,960
Okay, I won’t ask anymore.

584
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,760
Pai, let’s go
to the basketball club tomorrow.

585
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,280
Nope. Why not invite Maesa?

586
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,680
I don’t want to go.
I don’t like basketball players.

587
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,160
Pai, let’s go.

588
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,000
Everyone goes to watch
the basketball players before the match.

589
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,100
If you don’t go,

590
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,900
I will keep disturbing you
so you can’t work.

591
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,320
- Until you say yes.
- Alright.

592
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,460
- Are you going?
- Okay.

593
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,760
I know, I know, I’ll go.

594
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,400
Yay, you’re the best.

595
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,080
All happy now I see.

596
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,240
What are you looking at?

597
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,200
Nothing.
I’m just looking at your screen.

598
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,640
Keep researching.

599
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,920
How about this one?

600
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,400
Pai, come on.

601
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,600
Calm down.

602
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,000
Slow down or you’ll fall.

603
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,080
We’ll be late.

604
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,560
You missed again.

605
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,860
Wow, so cool.

606
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,000
I wouldn’t have guessed you being gay.

607
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,200
Ta, concentrate.

608
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,120
Sure, I’ve got the best support.

609
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,160
You got the three points.
They were frightened.

610
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,720
Great job.

611
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,680
It’s normal.

612
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,120
Wawa.

613
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,720
(Special scene)

614
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,600
- Come on.
- Step on my foot.

615
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,160
We’re nearly there. You can do it, Wawa.

616
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,120
The second prize will be the lipstick.

617
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,760
Quickly, they’re catching up.

618
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,280
- I can’t catch up.
- Come on.

619
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,400
Just a bit more.

620
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,040
What a pity. We were close.

621
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,280
It was so intimidating.

622
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,120
They won by just a tiny bit.

623
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,440
There’s no pity.

624
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,960
I came in second as planned.

625
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,160
What are you saying?
