=Episode 13=

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,320
What are you doing?

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,880
Pupaa.

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Pupaa.

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Ouch.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Pupaa.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,640
Pupaa. Pupaa.

36
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,680
Hello?

37
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,680
Who’s that? Is it Prapai?

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes.

39
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,920
Why are you the one
answering Pupaa’s phone?

40
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,000
She’s answering his phone
this early in the morning.

41
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,060
I think they’ve been together
since last night.

42
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,920
Shouldn’t have asked.

43
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
Is it true?

44
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,760
He was very drunk last night, so I...

45
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,840
Took advantage
and spent the night with him, right?

46
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,200
Yes. And what is your problem?

47
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,600
Well, we’re dating.

48
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,840
It’s not weird for us
to be staying together, is it?

49
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,000
Alright, we won’t disturb you.

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
You can spend your time together.

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,080
Hold on, it’s not like that.

52
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,040
- Hey, a cockroach.
- Cockroach? Where?

53
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,080
Hey.

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,320
Were you fake sleeping?

55
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,080
When did you wake up?

56
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,260
So

57
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,600
you must’ve heard me on the phone.

58
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,520
Hey.

59
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,080
Come on, let’s continue resting.

60
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,600
Sneaky.

61
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,560
Hey, girlfriend, slow down.
You’ll slip and fall.

62
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,720
(Heart marks, care level, smile level)

63
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
I made you a sandwich. Go on, have some.

64
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
You’re a mess.

65
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,160
Don’t you have to go to the laboratory?

66
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,880
I thought they were calling for you
this morning.

67
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,840
Maybe they have something for you to do.

68
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,000
I don’t think I have to go.

69
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,920
They can still work it out without me.

70
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,520
Pupaa, that’s wasa-

71
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,440
Hold on.

72
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,080
Here, have some milk.

73
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,960
Do you feel better?

74
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,640
What were you daydreaming about?

75
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,040
I thought it was mayonnaise.

76
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Pupaa.

77
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,920
I’m alright. You can go to work.

78
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Alright.

79
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,040
I’ve got to go now.

80
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Bye.

81
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,780
Time.

82
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,960
(WeTV: Time explains he didn’t hurt them)
Why didn’t you come out to explain?

83
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,600
Well, I have to say,

84
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,960
I don’t want anyone to be harmed.

85
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,800
And also,
about the truth of the incident,

86
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,440
the people who saw it
know exactly what happened.

87
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,680
But my fans have been showing concerns

88
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,000
about whether will people will be
misunderstanding me or not.

89
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,400
So the truth was revealed as shown.

90
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,200
So what would you do next
with the fans that accused you?

91
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,520
I’m not going to do anything,

92
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,540
because my fans

93
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,800
are the group of people
who have always supported me.

94
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,640
And what the fans did
is because of their admiration for me.

95
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,040
But it might be a little too much
at times.

96
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
So do you want to leave a message
about this?

97
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,200
I would like to tell my fans,

98
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,200
to all my fans, thank you very much

99
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,000
for supporting, admiring,
and still trusting in me.

100
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,160
Pai, it’s time for the meeting.

101
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
Sure.

102
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,780
This is our new product, cat food.

103
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,000
Soon to be launched.

104
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,240
So they wanted to do an online ad
before launching.

105
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,400
So then, Pai, you can go brainstorm
some ideas to present.

106
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,600
I’ll have a look and help you with it.

107
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Sure.

108
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,880
Who do you think we should suggest
as the presenter?

109
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,480
Time.

110
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,080
If Time heard what you said,

111
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,600
he’d love you to death.

112
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,600
But the latest news just came out.

113
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,760
Time didn’t hurt his fans.

114
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,280
And in his latest interview,

115
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,600
he’s been receiving positive feedback.

116
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,280
I agree.

117
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,000
We should take this as an opportunity
to create an eye-catching project.

118
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,280
And for our previous work,

119
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,680
I don’t think we should replace Time.

120
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,000
Otherwise people will be saying

121
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
that when there’s a problem,
we just ditched him.

122
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,520
I think

123
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,520
it will be bad for both the company
and our client.

124
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,660
Interesting.

125
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,640
So I’ll bring this up with the clients.

126
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
Sure.

127
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,940
Yes.

128
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,500
(Care level, obedience level)

129
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,800
(Smile level, responsibility level,
gentleness level)

130
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,480
Oh.

131
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,160
You’ve been doing this puzzle all day?

132
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,040
Um.

133
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,000
Taking it serious
just like your research.

134
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
I’m going to bed now.

135
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,760
Hold on.

136
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,040
Don’t be like this.

137
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,720
I know you’re feeling upset.

138
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,120
But did you know?

139
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,580
Not everyone

140
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,360
can do a research like this.

141
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,080
You’re smart and talented.

142
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,900
You can’t be using it
to do just puzzles like this.

143
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,040
It’s a pity.

144
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,200
I’m not that smart.

145
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,640
It’s so embarrassing.

146
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,380
Like I told you,

147
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,080
I never missed a scholarship.

148
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,480
(Faculty of Science and Technology)

149
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,640
What are we doing? This is boring.

150
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,480
Where is Pupaa anyway?

151
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,640
He hasn’t come in weeks.

152
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,520
Yeah.

153
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,480
Professor is also very mad
that he just left work like that.

154
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,160
I get goosebumps every time I see him.

155
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,360
Meena too. She’s even worse.

156
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,160
She’s become so arrogant
since she got the scholarship.

157
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,320
She used to keep asking for Pupaa.

158
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,320
Now she doesn’t say a word.

159
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,360
- Hey.
- Hey.

160
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,080
Oh.

161
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,240
Are you here for Pupaa?
He’s not here today.

162
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,160
Yeah. I haven’t been able to contact him
the past few days.

163
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,640
Have you seen him?
I don’t know what he’s up to.

164
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,280
He’s disappointed
for not getting the scholarship.

165
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,680
I’m here to see if there’s anything

166
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,760
that will inspire him
to get him back on his feet.

167
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,480
So that he can reapply
for the scholarship.

168
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,680
But you have to be quick.

169
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,480
Because Professor Sunan is very mad.

170
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,160
I also heard him say

171
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,200
that he won’t introduce
another scholarship for him.

172
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
What?

173
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Do you have any of Professor’s contacts?

174
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,360
Can I have it?

175
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,160
Hello, Professor.

176
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,720
Hey.

177
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,680
You’re Pupaa’s girlfriend, aren’t you?

178
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,600
I wanted to talk to you about Pupaa.

179
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,920
He’s lost his confidence
after he lost the scholarship.

180
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,320
But I know he still wants to work
on the research.

181
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,100
Do you happen to have any more
scholarships for him to apply?

182
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,680
Can you give him some more time, please?

183
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,400
There are some scholarships left.

184
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,120
But the deadline to apply for it
is tomorrow.

185
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,560
Can you extend it for a little while?

186
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,160
I don’t think that’s enough time.

187
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,760
How can I extend it?
I’m not the one who set it.

188
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,760
Also,

189
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,240
if Pupaa is the one
who really wanted the scholarship,

190
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,200
the person who should be
standing in front of my gate right now

191
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,840
should be him, not you.

192
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,360
But Professor...

193
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,960
That’s enough.

194
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,320
Say no more. It’s time for you to leave.

195
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,680
But Professor, can you please help find
any other scholarships?

196
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,600
Professor, Professor.

197
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,440
Hello. Are you here for Professor?

198
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,880
Come on in first.

199
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,560
What’s wrong? Did something bad happen?

200
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,880
I’m back.

201
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,920
You’re home already, honey.

202
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,520
I’ve been waiting for you.

203
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,000
Come, come.

204
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,800
You’re still here?

205
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,120
She came to ask for the scholarship
for her boyfriend.

206
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,280
The guy isn’t even here himself.

207
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,000
I don’t think he really wants it.

208
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,420
Oh you.

209
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,120
Can’t you give the kid a chance?

210
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,800
Think about yourself back in the days.

211
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,900
When you failed the scholarship

212
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,000
and flee into the woods for months,

213
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,420
I had to beg the Professor

214
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,920
to not cut you out of the system.

215
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,520
Oh dear,
why are you talking about the past?

216
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,400
It’s not the same.

217
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,680
Me back then

218
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,160
did everything perfectly.

219
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,720
But lost it to the guy with connections.

220
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,040
But Pupaa didn’t.

221
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,320
He didn’t present all of the data.

222
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,120
Especially the medium used
to refract light.

223
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,120
He didn’t put any details about it in.

224
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,560
Instead of feeling bad for himself,

225
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,880
he should spend the time
to fix the mistake.

226
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,800
And make it correct. Am I right?

227
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,560
I will find the mistake and fix it.
Thank you.

228
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,320
Goodbye.

229
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
She’s gone.

230
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,080
Find a new scholarship for him.

231
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,960
Do you understand?

232
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes, my dear wife.

233
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,680
Good job.

234
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
This tea is nice.

235
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,320
The medium used to refract light?

236
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,240
How can it be missing?

237
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,920
We’ve calculated these data already,
I remember.

238
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,960
Exactly.

239
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,200
Normally Pupaa is very detailed
and careful.

240
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,160
I don’t think he’ll miss
such an important data like this.

241
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,880
Meena was even the one who sent
some parts of the data to us.

242
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,080
Am I right?

243
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,720
I don’t remember.

(Advanced Holography

00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,960
(By Puwadol Kittaset)

246
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,760
OMG, it’s really gone.

247
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
Let me see.

248
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,280
(Advanced Holography

249
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,120
There’s been an edit.

250
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
But this is before Professor
reviewed it.

251
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,640
Or did someone replace and save it?

252
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,640
Or someone intentionally deleted it.

253
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,960
Hey, who would do it?

254
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,760
Exactly. Because in this room,
there’re only me and you,

255
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,040
Pupaa, Professor and...

256
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,120
Then we’ll have to prove it.

257
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,080
The time that it was edited
is 8:45 PM.

258
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,360
And Meena walked into the building
at 8:20 PM.

259
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,200
And she walked out at 9:02 PM.

260
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,520
But we can’t see anything

261
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,280
from the laboratory.

262
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,280
For the safety and confidentiality
of the research,

263
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,560
that’s why
there’re no security cameras inside.

264
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,680
This is bad. This means that
we don’t have any proof.

265
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,680
Then we have to let her
admit her own crime.

266
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,760
Huh?

267
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,400
How so?

268
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,820
Her face says it all.

269
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,520
I think she’s got a plan. Spill it.

270
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,960
Hello. What’s wrong, Ken?

271
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,800
Hello, Meena. Can you please
come to the security camera room?

272
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,960
Security camera room?

273
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,520
Yes, the security camera room.

274
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,280
Professor is also here.
Please come quick.

275
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,080
What are you doing?

276
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
Nothing.

277
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,600
Are you trying to erase the evidence?

278
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,600
What are you talking about?
I don’t understand.

279
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,600
We’re suspecting Pupaa’s research
for the scholarship application

280
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,640
was edited after the submission
to Professor.

281
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,400
So we wanted to find proof.

282
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,760
During 8:30 PM of that day,

283
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,080
where were you? What were you doing?

284
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,540
I went into the data room next door.

285
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,160
And I didn’t go into the laboratory
that day.

286
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,280
If you don’t believe me,
then you can check the security cameras.

287
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,200
Us lab students know

288
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,680
that the laboratory and the data room
has no security camera.

289
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,160
We won’t see anything anyway.

290
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,960
And so what?

291
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,880
You’re going to say I did it?

292
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,200
If it’s not you, then who can it be?

293
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,320
If you’re really innocent,

294
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,920
can I please see your smart watch?

295
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,800
Don’t make us do it the hard way.

296
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,360
What are you going to do?
Don’t come over.

297
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,640
Stop it, Meena.

299
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,280
Why is your heart rate during
8:40 PM and 8:50 PM

300
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,680
not normal?

301
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,080
I was having a problem
with my research at that time.

302
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,280
Can’t I be anxious?

303
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,260
I thought you just said
you were in the data room.

304
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,040
You weren’t in the laboratory.

305
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,360
Why is there a problem
with your research then?

306
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,760
This means you really went into
the laboratory, right?

307
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,480
Calm down, Meena.

308
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,520
Calm down, Meena.

309
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,360
Don’t come close.

310
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
Pupaa.

311
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,800
Just admit the truth, Meena.

312
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,400
What’s going on?

(Faculty of Science and Technology)

314
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,760
Meena.

315
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,240
Did you really erase
part of Pupaa’s research?

316
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,320
Why did you do that?

317
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,840
What are you proud of getting
the scholarship with this kind of act?

318
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,320
I guess you’re happy
for getting me in trouble.

319
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,920
I didn’t want to win in this situation.

320
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,120
But I did this

321
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,580
because I don’t want Pupaa

322
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,720
to blame himself

323
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,680
for not trying hard enough,

324
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,920
and not wanting to do what he loves.

325
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,920
I will have to report this situation.

326
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,320
You guys should go prepare the file
to submit it again.

327
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,920
And we’ll see what they say.

328
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,480
You don’t have to.

329
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,160
Huh?

330
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,360
Why?

331
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,880
Actually, for my research,

332
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,040
if Meena didn’t help me,

333
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,800
I wouldn’t have had
all the data collected.

334
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,720
You should be the one
getting the scholarship, Meena.

335
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,800
Pupaa.

336
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,560
Is this the time to be the good guy?

337
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,800
Meena.

338
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,480
I never taught you
to be this kind of person.

339
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,360
I’m very disappointed in you.

340
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,360
I’m sorry.

341
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,120
How could you let her go?

342
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
She made you lose your opportunity
in getting the scholarship.

343
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,920
Never mind.

344
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,840
So you’re ready to come back
and continue with the research?

345
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Um.

346
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,280
But isn’t the due date tomorrow?

347
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,840
Actually, there’s also
another scholarship you could apply for.

348
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,360
But its deadline is next week.

349
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,040
Will you be able to finish it on time?

350
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,920
- Sure.
- Sure.

351
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,480
Thank you so much, Professor.
Thank you.

352
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,840
Well,

353
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,960
someone told me to do this.

354
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,800
Um.

355
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,240
So from now on,
don’t you ever blame yourself again

356
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,400
for not trying hard enough.

357
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,840
So this means I have to push harder
in gaining marks

358
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,960
in becoming your real boyfriend, right?

359
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,440
So how did you do it?

360
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,240
To let Professor say yes to me.

361
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,560
It’s a secret.

362
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,520
Come on, tell me.

363
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,360
No.

364
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,880
- Tell me.
- No.

365
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,480
- Tell me.
- No.

366
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,920
Look, there’re so many stars.

367
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Look.

368
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,080
I can’t believe that
we could still see stars in Bangkok.

369
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,520
That must be

370
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,800
the Triones,
or the seven principal stars.

371
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Huh?

372
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,560
Try and count how many stars there are.

373
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,880
Seven stars.

374
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,000
When arranged,
does it look like a big spatula?

375
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,520
It’s part of the
Ursa Major constellation.

376
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,040
Its tail

377
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,960
points to different directions
in each season.

378
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,200
If we can find the Triones,

379
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,320
we’ll be able to find
other constellation stars.

380
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,680
Wow, amazing.

381
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,760
How about that one?

382
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,000
That should be the Aquila,

383
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,120
or the Altair.

384
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,120
Altair?

385
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,080
Is it the story of the Cowherd
and the Weaver girl?

386
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,780
The Chinese love story.

387
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,520
I once read it from a book.

388
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,560
It said that the two
loved each other so much,

389
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,960
but they didn’t make it together.

390
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,280
The Weaver girl was taken to heaven,

391
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,200
and the Cowherd tried to follow her.

392
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,160
But a river was blocking the way.

393
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,480
Only one day out of the entire year

394
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,760
that magpies would line up as a bridge

395
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,080
for the lovers to cross the bridge
to see each other.

396
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
A bridge?

397
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,520
It’s probably the Milky Way.

398
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,840
Isn’t it pitiful for them?

399
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,760
They get only one day
out of the entire year to meet.

400
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,080
They have to long for each other
up to 364 days.

401
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Astronomy is part of science.

402
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Myths like that aren’t real.

403
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,920
It’s just a beautiful fairy tale.

404
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,280
Boy, you don’t know
how to be romantic, do you?

405
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,240
If I wasn’t here anymore,

406
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,000
would you be sad?

407
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,640
Why are you asking this?

408
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,240
You can’t leave me.

409
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,200
I’m not going anywhere.

410
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,000
I haven’t even been passed
being your intern boyfriend.

411
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,080
He’s very easy to take care of.

412
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,220
Just feed him two meals regularly
in the morning and evening,

413
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,360
and you can let him run around.

414
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,200
Don’t worry.
We’ll take good care of him.

415
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,680
Joobjoob, mommy will be back.

416
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,800
Mommy will come for you
as soon as possible.

417
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,480
Hello, kitty cat.

418
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,920
You’re so cute.

419
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,080
Isn’t the shooting next week?

420
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,720
Why is the cat here now?

421
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,520
The client knows the owner,

422
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,520
and said that it must be only this cat.

423
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,560
But the owner is leaving the country
today.

424
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,600
So the client told her
to leave the cat with us first.

425
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,800
So we can get familiar with it.

426
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,320
Isn’t all of them the same?

427
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,100
This one won a competition.

428
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,680
You won’t know how much it costs.

429
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,200
It’s “him”, instead of an “it”.

430
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
Six figures.

431
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,000
- Six figures?
- Six figures?

432
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,920
So who’s going to take care of
Mr. Joobjoob?

433
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,400
I have a dog,
I don’t think I can take him in.

434
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,040
Seems like you like cats.

435
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,640
Yes, I do.

436
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,240
Actually I really want a cat.

437
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,200
But my family won’t let me.

438
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,440
Then

439
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,000
I’ll let you take care of him
until the shooting.

440
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,040
But pets aren’t allowed at where I live.

441
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,120
Just ask for permission.
It’ll be only a few days.

442
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,760
But he’s a six-figured cat.

443
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,640
If something happens to him,

444
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,040
I can’t take responsibility for it.

445
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,440
You can’t say no, because you’re
in charge of taking care of the actors.

446
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,820
And this is one of the actors

447
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,740
that you must take care.

448
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,440
Right?

449
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,240
Prapai, you’re back?

450
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,840
Stay quiet, alright?

451
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,160
What are you doing?

452
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,040
Just doing some more research.

453
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Oh.

454
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,360
So how is it going? Going good?

455
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,300
I just have to find the missing data

456
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,240
and it’ll be ready to submit.

457
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,160
- Oh.
- It’ll sure be completed on time.

458
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,040
That’s good.

459
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,320
What’s this cat food for?

460
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,200
Well,

461
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,720
it’s a product used for work.

462
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,140
I bought it back

463
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,440
so I could continue with my brainstorm.

464
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,720
They’re giving you work
to do at home again?

465
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,420
Next time charge them for overtime.

466
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,960
It’s unfair to be working overtime.

467
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,480
Hey, it’s alright.

468
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,840
Don’t worry about it.

469
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,240
I think you’re getting sick.

470
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,920
You should go get some rest,

471
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,920
so you can get better soon.

472
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,480
Go to sleep early..

473
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,560
Have a good night. Bye.

474
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,280
Don’t come over. Go away.

475
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
Don’t come over.

476
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,800
Don’t come over. Go away. Don’t come.

477
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,280
Don’t come over.

478
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,520
Hey, what are you doing?

479
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,240
That’s a six-figured living creature.

480
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,880
Are you okay?

481
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,680
No.

482
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,080
I really have to do this.

483
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,240
If I don’t bring it back,
I’m going to get fired.

484
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,720
That’s not going to happen.
Pets aren’t allowed here.

485
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
Well,

486
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,700
it’s going to be only a few days.

487
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,360
Don’t tell anyone then.

488
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
You can’t.

489
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,440
Pupaa, please let me stay.

490
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,840
Meow.

491
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,000
If you let him stay,

492
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,400
I’ll give you two extra marks.

493
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,040
Please, let me stay. Pretty please.

494
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,760
Alright.

495
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,560
- Yay.
- Don’t come over.

496
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,440
You must promise me

497
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,140
that you won’t let it
run around outside.

498
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,040
I’m allergic to cat fur.

499
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,640
Hey, call her Mr. Joobjoob.

500
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,680
He seems to like you.

501
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,520
No way. What kind of funny name is that?

502
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,920
How is it funny? See, it’s Joobjoob.

503
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,280
Is this the person who said
he would change himself?

504
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,040
He really can’t change, can he?

505
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,360
Alright now.

506
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,360
Can we test the lights?

507
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,400
- It’s okay.
- Okay.

508
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,360
Are you ready?

509
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,960
Pupaa, thank you.

510
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,320
I’ve put myself at risk here.

511
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,880
Am I close to getting full marks?

512
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,320
I said don’t come over.

513
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,560
Move away.

514
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
Just go.

515
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,880
(Are you looking for this?)

516
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,120
(Yarn hygienic masks)

517
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,480
(What everyone is looking for)

518
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,080
It’s cute, isn’t it? Put it on.

519
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,280
What do you want?
I can’t understand you.

520
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,120
Use the cat language translation
application.

521
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,800
What do you want?

522
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,200
(Hungry)

523
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,680
Hey, it really does work.

524
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,320
Here, let me try. Come on here.

525
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,080
Come sit with me.

526
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,320
Is Prapai cute?

527
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,920
(Yes)

528
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,600
How about Pupaa?

529
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,600
(No)

530
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,240
Watch yourself.

531
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,280
(Scared)

532
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,320
You can communicate in cat language.

533
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,320
There’s only a limited frequency
of cat sound.

534
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,640
Do you want to help me
with the shooting tomorrow?

535
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,240
I’m afraid I’ll be too busy and
won’t be able to take care of Joobjoob.

536
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,800
I’ll give you extra marks.

537
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,120
Can extra marks be full marks?

538
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,560
Dream on.

539
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,920
Then I’ll go now.

540
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,960
Where are you going?

541
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,280
Going to the laboratory.

542
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,080
There’s a team from
a university from China coming today.

543
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,080
Professor wants me to go
and get familiar with them.

544
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,000
Okay.

545
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,960
Just a minute.

546
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,680
Huh?

547
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,000
Here you go.

548
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,840
What is it?

549
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,200
Yarn hygienic mask.

550
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,600
I knitted it myself the entire night.

551
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,560
Wear it so you don’t sneeze.

552
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,840
Prapai.

553
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,520
Yes?

554
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,360
But yarn doesn’t protect you
from cat fur.

555
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,040
Oh.

556
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,560
It’s alright. I’ll add in my own filter.

557
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,320
I’ll wear it every day.

558
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,040
Um.

559
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,320
Prapai and Joobjoob
will always support you.

560
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,200
Fighting.

561
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,560
Meow, meow.

562
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,880
Fighting.

563
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,680
Bye.

564
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

565
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,080
Please come in.

566
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

567
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,320
Hello, hello.

568
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,280
Hello, hello.

569
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,260
This is our research team

570
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,000
who’s working on the hologram project.

571
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,420
This research was inspired

572
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:02,200
by a 3D book of childhood memories.

573
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,880
They said they would like
to support your project.

574
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,520
But we hope

575
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,560
you can work with
the Chinese research group

576
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,680
to finish this project together.

577
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,580
So more people from
different academic departments

578
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,360
could participate.

579
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,560
You mean

580
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,920
you need me to do the research in China?

581
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,840
Yes.

582
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,720
You don’t have to worry.

583
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,000
We will finance your research

584
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,440
until it’s fully completed.

585
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,000
That’s great. Great.

586
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,920
If I wasn’t here anymore,
would you be sad?

587
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,960
You can’t leave me.

588
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,720
Thank you very much.

589
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,040
But I’m going to say no.

590
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,640
What?

591
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,400
I think Pupaa may be

592
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,600
a little too excited.
You’re doing it again, Pupaa.

593
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,840
Why are you doing this?

594
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
This is the most important thing
in your life.

595
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,600
How can you say that?
Think before you speak.

596
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,560
We’ll get back to you later.

597
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,200
This will be the next scene
that we’re going to shoot.

598
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,500
We might take a photoshoot too

599
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,280
because it’s the same costume.

600
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,800
This one here...

601
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,480
Prapai.

602
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,360
Pupaa.

603
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,360
- Pon.
- Huh?

604
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,500
This is Pupaa.

605
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,200
He’ll be helping with Joobjoob today.

606
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,800
Oh really? That’s great.

607
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,040
Let’s go set up.

608
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,800
Sure.

609
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,520
You don’t have to help me
the entire day.

610
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,560
I want to help you.
So I can get full marks soon.

611
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,600
Are you doing this for an exchange?

612
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
Of course. It’s worth it.

613
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,720
Servant, come here.

614
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,360
I know.

615
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,880
- I’ll get to work now.
- Um.

616
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,200
Please take care of Joobjoob.

617
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,320
Bye.

618
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,000
Prapai.

619
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,120
Meow, meow.

620
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,800
You don’t have to be this cute.

621
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,000
I’m falling for you already.

622
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,600
Are you friends?

623
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,740
What do I have to do today?

624
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,280
Just give me a short brief.

625
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,080
Oh okay. This is the next scene
you’re going to shoot.

626
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,720
We’ll shoot this one and this one,
all together.

627
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,240
Because you’re wearing the same costume.

628
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,080
And the scene doesn’t change.

629
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,680
Hey, listen carefully.

630
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,560
Take it serious.

631
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,200
Listen to me.

632
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,200
This is the scene
where you have to be here.

633
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,280
And you’ll go in and play with Joobjoob.

634
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,320
This is a great filming location.

635
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,000
(Biography of Einstein)

636
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,080
Meow, meow.

637
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,520
Hey baby.

638
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,360
Let’s go for a walk.

639
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,680
Meow, meow.

640
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,480
Meow, meow.

641
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,520
Meow, meow, meow.

642
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,120
You know you’re allergic to cat fur,
and you’re still forcing it.

643
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,680
Just go home.

644
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,400
Meow, meow.

645
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,120
Time.

646
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,800
What are you doing here?
It’s time for the shoot.

647
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,000
I’m just trying to get familiar
with the cat before the scene.

648
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,560
Am I right, little girl?

649
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,400
Joobjoob is a little boy.

650
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,360
Give it to me.

651
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,520
You should get on set.

652
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,760
Joobjoob.

653
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,760
Why has no one taken the cat
onto the set?

654
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,320
This is bad, Pon.

655
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,960
Joobjoob is on the tree.

656
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,680
Hey.

657
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,240
What did you do?

658
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,080
I told you to take care of it.

659
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,880
You know it’s worth
probably your entire year’s salary.

660
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,600
- Get it down now.
- Yes.

661
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,240
I’ll get it down.

662
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,240
I’ll take care of it.

663
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,040
(Special scene)

664
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,200
Meow.

665
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,400
Meow, meow.

666
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,000
Meow.

667
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,640
(Love)

668
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,880
Meow.

669
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,960
(Love)

670
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,880
Meow.

671
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,760
(You)

672
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,240
Meow, meow, meow.

673
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,760
(I love you)

674
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,600
Prapai.

675
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,040
Meow, meow, meow.
