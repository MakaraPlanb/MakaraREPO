I’ll make merit for you.

Help!

36
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,660
Hey.

37
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,760
You stalker.

38
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,600
What is going on, Pai?

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,920
What time is it now?

40
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,440
Why are you knocking so late?
My child will wake up.

41
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,960
I need an explanation.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,960
This guy came into my room

43
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,640
and he said he’s the owner of the room.

44
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,880
What does this mean?

45
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,400
Pupaa.

46
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,080
How did you get here?

47
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,240
This is my room. Why can I not be here?

48
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,480
How can this be your room?

49
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,400
I rented the room from her.

50
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,600
Does my family know
you’re renting out this place?

51
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,240
Who is it, mom?

52
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,680
Alright, everyone,
let’s calm down first.

53
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,640
I will take care of this.

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,680
Your mom won’t answer.

55
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,880
She should be overseas as usual.

56
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,880
Your mom said

57
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,580
no one was living in this room,
so she told me

58
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,520
to rent it out.

59
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,020
And normally your mom

60
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,640
trusts me to sort everything out.

61
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,760
And she didn’t say you would move in.

62
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,160
Prapai already paid.

63
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,700
Then you can give back her rent.

64
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,920
I’ll tell my mom.

65
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,840
No, you can’t do that.

66
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,800
I paid already. I moved everything in.

67
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,440
Exactly. Payment is made. No returns.

68
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,360
But this is my room.

69
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,560
Why do you have to be mean to girls?

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,600
You’re so cute, little boy.

71
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,040
Did your mom teach you this?

72
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,720
Nope, my teacher taught me.

73
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,160
My teacher said,
guys have to help girls.

74
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,880
Right? It’s unfair for the girl, right?

75
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes. Please let her stay. Please.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,360
Well, we are all Thai.

77
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,200
We should help each other,
and be kind, right?

78
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,440
And this room has two bedrooms.

79
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,060
Wait.

80
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,600
You’re going to let me
live with this guy?

81
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,480
Otherwise go stay somewhere else.

82
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,440
Well, he doesn’t like girls anyway.

83
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,960
Nothing’s going to happen.

84
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,360
Better than having no place to stay.

85
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,320
Alright.

86
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,780
I don’t have to move anymore. Yay.

87
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,600
- Yay.
- Yay.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,680
But only for this month, alright?

89
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
We’ll talk about it
once my mom gets back.

90
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,920
Hey.

91
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,320
Hey you.

92
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,400
Why are you in here? I’m on the toilet.

93
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,560
How did you get in here?

94
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,960
I was here first.

95
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,800
Then why didn’t you lock the door?

96
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,720
Normally I live with guys.

97
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,280
Why would I lock the door?

98
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,680
Are you going to stay any longer?
Get out first.

99
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,240
You get out. I’m going to shower.

100
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,880
Hey, what is this?

101
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,960
If you’re going to stay here,
there need to be some rules.

102
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,720
Rules of staying together.

103
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,800
Number one, no personal belongings
in the living area.

104
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,480
The common area must always be tidy.

105
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,640
Yes. So you have to take those stuff

106
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,040
into your room.

107
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,720
How about your stuff?
Why is it out here?

108
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,040
This is my room. I set the rules.

109
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,680
If you can’t follow, then leave.

110
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,080
Number two, control and limit
the number of visitors.

111
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,120
Hey.

112
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,680
Don’t you ever have friends?

113
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,440
Have you never invited any friends over?

114
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,200
If you want to stay,
then follow the rules.

115
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,560
I’ve thought about it already.

116
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,080
How about Ta? Is he an outsider?

117
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,520
According to my
anthropological research,

118
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,200
Ta is considered a close friend

119
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,560
but still an outsider.

120
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,360
How about your parents?

121
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,040
Who’s considered an insider?

122
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,660
In this case,

123
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,520
it’s only me and you. Just us two.

124
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,880
Stupid rules. So bossy.

125
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,240
What did you say?

126
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,680
Nothing. I’m in a hurry to work.
We’ll talk later.

127
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,800
I’ve got to get to work early today.

128
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,200
Don’t you remove the plastic bag first?

129
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,700
Did you know

130
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,160
if you put it in the microwave,

131
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,680
the plastic bag will melt
and stick to your food?

132
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,120
Why? Is it one of the rules as well?

133
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,440
What are you looking at?

134
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,680
You want some, don’t you?
Do you want some? I’ve got many.

135
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,920
No, thanks. I don’t eat food like this.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,080
Why so? This is my favorite.

137
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,960
How can you say that?

138
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,120
Full of cholesterols and carcinogens.

139
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,280
I think you should take care of yourself

140
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,120
and your health more.

141
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,440
The plastic bag that you use

142
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,380
also contains carcinogens.

143
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,000
If you put it in the microwave...

144
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,960
Hello.

145
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,520
You’re Prapai, right?

146
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,600
Yes, I am.

147
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,800
My name is Pla.

148
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,480
Come on, follow me.

149
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,360
Yes.

150
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,240
This is the creative department.

151
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,320
Creating quality work for the company.

152
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,000
Including online media,
posters, print ads, etc.

153
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,600
This is the accounting department.

154
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,040
And this is your table.

155
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,560
I’ve let Cartoon prepare the essentials
for you already.

156
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,200
But if you need anything else, tell me.
I’ll get it sorted for you.

157
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,440
Sure. Thank you.

158
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,280
No problem.

159
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,600
Hi, I’m Cartoon.
I’m from the information department.

160
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,480
I’m Prapai. You can call me Pai.

161
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,760
You’re replacing our old accountant,
Ann, right?

162
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah.

163
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,280
It’s going to be tough
if you’re not strong enough.

164
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,880
Ann only asked for a maternal leave,

165
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,720
but she quitted after that.

166
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,920
This is what Ann hasn’t finished.

167
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,240
You can start with finishing these off.

168
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,560
Okay.

169
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,660
(Financial statement)

170
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,520
Hi, hello.

171
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes, sure. I’ll get it done for you.

172
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,280
Please excuse me for a minute.

173
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,080
Yes, it will be done soon.

174
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,360
I’ll handle it for you.

175
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,660
Thank you.

176
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,540
Hello?

177
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,720
Pai.

178
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,160
Yes?

179
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,120
It’s the reimbursement
of the creative department.

180
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes.

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,360
These are my files,
can you type it up for me?

182
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,640
Pai, can you send these over
to the finance department?

183
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,120
Can I have it done today by noon?

184
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,240
Drop a bit more. A tiny bit more.

185
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,800
Amazing.

186
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,240
Oh, Pupaa, you’re on time.

187
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,200
Do you want some?

188
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,640
It’s coffee.

189
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,080
No, thank you, Professor,
I’ve already had breakfast.

190
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,120
You’re going to regret this.

191
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,760
Hello, Professor.

192
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,680
Oh, Meena, you’re here.

193
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,960
Take Pupaa to see our laboratory.

194
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,320
Show him where to find the equipment

195
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,160
and where to return them.

196
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,040
Okay, sure, sir.

197
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,800
Okay.

198
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,840
Are you sure you don’t want some?

199
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
No, thanks.

200
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,360
First of all, let’s go put on our gown.

201
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,600
I knew we’d meet again.

202
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,800
I have to thank you for introducing me
to Professor.

203
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,920
No problem.

204
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,580
I’m also happy Professor has you

205
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,680
to help out with the research.

206
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,240
So we can spend some time together.

207
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,040
I mean,

208
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,040
I’ve always wanted to work with someone
as talented as you, Pupaa.

209
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,920
Let’s go and have a look
at the laboratory over there.

210
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,960
Please take over this for me.

211
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,880
Sure.

212
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,320
(Ta)

213
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,040
(Missed call)

214
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,720
(Ta)

215
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,780
If you’re going to start over,
you have to be strong.

216
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,480
Prapai.

217
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,800
(Prapai: What do you want?)

218
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:29,040
(Ta: Where are you?)

219
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,240
(Prapai: I’m working. What do you want?)

220
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,080
Prapai.

221
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,000
If I’m not dating Wawa anymore,

222
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,880
will you be my girlfriend?

223
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,760
(What is wrong with you?)

224
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,280
(You’re a grown man.
Be responsible for your actions.)

225
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,440
Useless.

226
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,580
The budget you did was not usable.

227
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,200
There’re omissions in the texts.

228
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Also miscalculations.
You’re so careless.

229
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,480
I’m sorry. I will...

230
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,800
I want the rest of the work done
within this week.

231
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,160
Pai.

232
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,720
How’s your first day
of being a full-time employee?

233
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,520
Hi there, Faye.

234
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,320
A little bit tough.

235
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,020
You’ll do fine.

236
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,640
So fit and talented.

237
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,480
And why aren’t you going home yet?

238
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,520
Not yet, I have to finish these first.

239
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,040
I’m leaving now. Fighting.

240
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,400
Sure, fighting.

241
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,440
Goodbye.

242
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,320
Hey, what are you doing here?

243
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,520
Rule number three.

244
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,640
You must put away your shoes
once you enter the room.

245
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,120
Are you satisfied now, Mr. Homeowner?

246
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,080
Not yet.

247
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,020
You must read all the rules

248
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,120
and follow them strictly.

249
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,220
Number four.

250
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,760
You cannot enter the other person’s room
without permission.

251
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,080
Don’t worry.

252
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,640
I won’t go into your room.

253
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,520
You can’t come into mine too.

254
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,560
Next one.

255
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,860
Number five

256
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,280
Chores are to be done
according to the schedule.

257
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,240
Louder.

258
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,740
Number five.

259
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,080
Chores are to be done
according to the schedule.

260
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,140
Number six.

261
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,620
Time spend in common area

262
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,280
should not exceed 30 minutes.

263
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,840
Hey, I’m a girl.

264
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,260
I need some beauty time.

265
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,840
Isn’t it a little too much?

266
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,800
Then you can use it between
10 p.m. and 6 a.m.

267
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,040
It’s my resting time.

268
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,200
And do not disturb me.

269
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,520
Sure.

270
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,200
Then after 10 p.m.,
I’ll take all the time to shower.

271
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,780
Number seven.

272
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,400
Only put things in the designated areas
in the fridge.

273
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,040
The top shelf is yours,
and the bottom shelf is mine.

274
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,560
And whoever is using the freezing
can put their name on it.

275
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,160
And be responsible for your own laundry.

276
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,400
That’s all the rules I can think of now.

277
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,980
If I can think of any more,

278
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,280
I will add it on.

279
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,560
But if you don’t follow the rules

280
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,320
for more than three times,

281
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,360
you must leave.

282
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,560
Anything else?

283
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,000
Yes.

284
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,640
That area there,
I will use it to leave a message

285
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,600
when I don’t see you.

286
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,040
I’ll just leave a note on there.

287
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,120
You too.

288
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,960
If you have anything,
you can leave a note.

289
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,920
Yes, Mr. Homeowner.

290
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,960
Hey, why did you turn it off?
I was watching it.

291
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,720
Others are trying to sleep.

292
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,960
You cannot make loud noises like this.

293
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,600
It’s not one of the rules.

294
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,340
(Number eight)

295
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,000
(No loud noises
during watching the television)

296
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,720
Can I continue watching now?

297
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,640
Prapai.

298
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,640
The board is only for
useful information.

299
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,880
It is not for doodling.

300
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,680
Please understand.

301
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,000
This is the first warning. Erase it.

302
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,480
Erase it.

303
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,820
This is the first warning.

304
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,540
Erase it.

305
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,000
Prapai.

306
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,840
Prapai.

307
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,760
Prapai!

308
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,840
Oh, what is up with you?

309
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,120
What is wrong with you?

310
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,440
What did you do with the fridge?

311
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,400
Oh, fermented fish sauce. Why?

312
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,920
I put it in the correct shelf already.

313
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,220
But the smell of your food

314
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,800
is all on my food.

315
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,640
What do you want me to do?

316
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,960
Clear everything out.
Or else we can’t live together.

317
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,240
I know.

318
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,120
Hi there.

319
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,440
Hello, how are you doing?

320
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,100
I never thought life after graduation

321
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,080
would be this cruel to me.

322
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,200
Both my new place,
and my new work place.

323
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,120
It’s alright.

324
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,120
At least you have a job
and you’re not unemployed.

325
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,280
Look at me,
I’ve applied to so many places,

326
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,760
none of them have contacted me.

327
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,160
I’m so fed up.
Do you want to go shopping this evening?

328
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,080
I can’t go. I haven’t finished my work.

329
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,260
I don’t even know if Pla will give me

330
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,080
any more work or not.

331
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,640
I don’t even want to think about it.

332
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,720
Hey.

333
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,120
I have to go now.

334
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,640
If you’ve finished your lunch,
go get back to work.

335
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,040
Don’t sit here, hanging around.

336
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,440
That’s why your work is not done.

337
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,000
Yes.

338
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,760
So have you finished the first quarter?

339
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,680
Not yet.

340
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,160
Finish it before you leave.

341
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,640
Put it on my desk.
I will come and check it tomorrow.

342
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,000
You want it today?

343
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,460
If you’re not wasting time
talking on the phone,

344
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,120
you would finish it on time.

345
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,240
Noted.

346
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
I’m all done, Professor.

347
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,600
Let me see.

348
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,320
You’re very neat. This is great.

349
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,080
Good job.

350
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,800
Hang on a minute, I’ve got a call.

351
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,880
Hello?

352
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,040
Yes, it’s me.

353
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,320
Yes, our training event is this week.

354
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,720
What? You can’t come?

355
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,940
What a pity.

356
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,500
There will be many great professors

357
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,720
from around the world.

358
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,200
Alright, never mind.

359
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,160
I’ll find a replacement.

360
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,520
Who should I ask?

361
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,200
Are you free this week?

362
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,120
Yes, I am.

363
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,720
You know me.

364
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,720
How can it be only you two?

365
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,080
Pupaa is in the lead now I see.

366
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,960
Then both of you come.

367
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,420
So Pupaa can also gain some experience

368
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,640
from big events like this.

369
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,860
Because I believe,

370
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,860
in the future,

371
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:17,680
it could be you on stage
like other experts.

372
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,520
Finally I’m done.

373
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,320
It’s a late night again.

374
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,280
It’s your turn to clean the toilet.

375
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,840
It’s 10 o’clock already.

376
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,840
Can I do it tomorrow?

377
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,080
I’m really tired.

378
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,520
Rules are to be followed.

379
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,560
If you’re not going to follow, then...

380
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,720
OK, OK.

381
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,040
I’ll clean it now, Mr. Homeowner.

382
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,920
This stupid guy, why are you so mean?

383
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,880
Prapai, you can stop now. Go to bed.

384
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,240
Prapai.

385
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,120
I know. I’ll go change later.

386
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,840
Are you crazy?

387
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,400
Go to bed.

388
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,800
Go.

389
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,440
Go.

390
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,360
I told you to go to bed.

391
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,400
Hey, that’s my room.
Where are you going?

392
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,360
Hey, why are you on my bed?
Get down now.

393
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,080
Come here.

394
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,760
You’re sleepwalking?

395
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,720
Prapai.

396
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Prapai.

397
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,040
I’m so happy tonight.

398
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,760
Thank you very much.

399
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,440
Where are you going?

400
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,800
Going to work of course.
I’m already late.

401
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,320
But today is Saturday.

402
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,320
Oh, today is Saturday?

403
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,400
Really? I thought it was Monday.

404
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,280
That’s good. I don’t want to go to work.

405
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,120
Oh, so comfortable.

406
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,680
But my body aches so bad.

407
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,920
Maybe I’ve been sitting down
for too long.

408
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,320
Why do you look so tired?
Did you sleep last night?

409
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,840
Let’s say I had a bad dream.

410
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,600
A nightmare?

411
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,520
But I had a really good dream
last night.

412
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,560
Last night I dreamt

413
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,480
that I went to a ball.

414
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,320
And you know, the event was gorgeous.

415
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,840
It was a huge event.

416
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,640
The ballroom was like a palace.

417
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,120
And everything was set so perfectly.

418
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,080
I was dancing in the ballroom.

419
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,580
How about this,

420
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,520
whenever it’s your turn for chores

421
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,640
and you’ve finished work late,
let me know.

422
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,160
So I can change it.

423
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,520
Thank you.

424
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,200
No need to thank me.
I’m doing it for myself.

425
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,440
I can’t do this every night either.

426
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,960
(Ta)

427
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,040
What’s up, Ta?

428
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,880
Can I go over to your place?

429
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,600
Yeah, why not?

430
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,360
But I have to go somewhere else first.

431
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,040
Maybe next time.

432
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,120
See you later, Ta.

433
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,520
Alright.

434
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,120
Thank you.

435
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,440
What for?

436
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,200
For not letting Ta come over
when I’m here.

437
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,560
Who said I’m helping you?

438
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,120
I’m about to go outside.

439
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,160
It’s your turn to clean the living room.

440
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,720
Finish it before I get back.

441
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,800
Yes, sir. I know.

442
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,200
(Chores schedule)

443
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,020
(Rule number four)

444
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,760
(You cannot enter other’s room
without permission.)

445
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,240
You’re back?

446
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,760
You came into my room?

447
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,720
What does rule number four say?

448
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,160
I just came in to clean.

449
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
What about my stuff here,
where has it gone?

450
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,480
Did you throw it away?

451
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,560
I told you how important it was to me.

452
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,120
What kind of person do you think I am?

453
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,240
I felt bad after I saw it.

454
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,920
So I fixed it for you.

455
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,280
How is it? Is it better?

456
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,040
You must really love this, don’t you?

457
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,840
I’m really sorry.

458
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,920
This is considered the second time
you’ve done wrong.

459
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,960
If there’s a next one,
prepare to pack your bags.

460
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,360
Ta.

461
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,360
You have a meeting
with your consultant on Monday.

462
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,600
I saw you didn’t reply to my text.
I thought you might forget.

463
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,000
I can remember.

464
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,360
It feels like we haven’t seen
each other much recently.

465
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,400
I’m trying to finish my final project.

466
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,440
I saw you were looking for references
for your final project.

467
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,960
So I took a look in the library.

468
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,720
I think these two can help. Have a look.

469
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,440
Thank you.

470
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,960
I’ll take it back for you when it’s due.

471
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,720
So I’ll go now.

472
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,200
(Going to a training event.
Will be home late.)

473
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,280
It’s finally time for freedom, Prapai.

474
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,960
Welcome, brothers and sisters.
Hello everyone.

475
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,840
Thank you for your support.

476
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,280
I won’t disappoint you.

477
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,060
I thought I was early.

478
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,840
You’re earlier than me.

479
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,000
Why are you so diligent?

480
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,400
I want to help Professor set up.

481
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,440
- Hello, Professor.
- Hello there.

482
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,800
Everything should be ready.

483
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,080
You can help just during the day.

484
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,860
Because

485
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,600
the person who’s coming this afternoon
will come take over soon.

486
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,240
Alright.

487
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,260
OK, OK.

488
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,440
Bring up the first slide.

489
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,120
We’ve finished earlier than I thought.

490
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,800
Do you want to go grab some lunch?

491
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,000
No, thanks.
I think I’ll be heading straight back.

492
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,120
Hey, have you got a dress for the party?

493
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,360
Not yet.

494
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,880
It’s nearly the graduation party.

495
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,520
Have you prepared yourself?

496
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,920
Us science students
aren’t really interested in it.

497
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,600
But girls are really
looking forward to it.

498
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,240
I don’t even know who to go with.

499
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,800
Can you go with me?

500
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,840
I don’t want to go alone.
It feels strange.

501
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,920
I think you should ask someone else.

502
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,760
Why?

503
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,920
I’m going with someone else.

504
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,680
Was I too slow?

505
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,440
Thank you. If you could excuse me.

506
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,480
Oh Pupaa. You’re back already?

507
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,960
Why are you back early?

508
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,520
Come, come sit here first.

509
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,400
Come sit down.

510
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,160
Do you want some snack?

511
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,120
I was planning to clean up everything,

512
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,200
but why are you back early?

513
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,240
Are you saying it’s my fault?

514
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,600
You’ve violated the rules
three times already.

515
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,040
No.

516
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,720
I’m sorry.
I will clean everything up now.

517
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,080
Please don’t kick me out.

518
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:38,000
Rules are rules.

519
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,640
Pupaa.

520
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,180
Don’t you feel any pity

521
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,360
for a small girl like me?

522
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,880
Look, if you kick me out now,

523
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,760
I don’t know where to go.

524
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,040
Do you want to see me
sleeping on the streets?

525
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,840
Please. Pretty please.

526
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,760
I have an offer for you.

527
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,520
To fix this.

528
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,080
What is it? You can tell me.

529
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,480
I’ll do everything for you.

530
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,320
You have to be my partner for a day.

531
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,240
(Special scene)

532
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,920
Sleep.
