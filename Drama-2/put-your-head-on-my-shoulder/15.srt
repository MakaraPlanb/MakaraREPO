Pupaa. You’re still working?

31
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,000
Ye... yes.

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,120
How about we have a dinner together?

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,920
What do you say?

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
OK.

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,240
Hello, Pupaa.

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,040
Prapai, let’s break up.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Oh, it was a nightmare.

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,520
But they say the dream before we wake up
will always come true.

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,040
No.

40
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,920
(Are you up?)

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,520
(I’ll call you.
I have something to tell you.)

42
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
(Pupaa)

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,960
(Pupaa)

44
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,440
Hello.

45
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,840
I don’t want to talk to you yet.

46
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,680
You...

47
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,360
No, no.

48
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,960
I don’t want to listen.

49
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,640
Alright, I won’t bother you anymore.

50
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,160
I just wanted to tell you
to open the drawers by the television.

51
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,360
I left you a gift. That’s all.

52
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,640
Um.

53
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,480
(Put this gift on top of the phone)
Put this gift on top of the phone

54
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,600
(and watch the clip I sent to you)
and watch the clip I sent to you

55
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,600
My beloved Prapai.

56
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,120
This will be by your side
as my substitute.

57
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
I may not be able to hug you in person,

58
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,280
but every word that I say

59
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,520
can prove it all.

60
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,120
Hello, Tookta.

61
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,960
Pai, this box here,

62
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,360
Pupaa left it with me

63
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,040
and said to give it to you today.
It must be today.

64
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,200
Thank you.

65
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,000
Then

66
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,640
I’ll leave now.

67
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,400
Sure.

68
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,140
(Pour water into the bowl)

69
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,340
(Put the mirror in diagonally)

70
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,740
(Turn on the spotlight
and point it to the mirror in the bowl)

71
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,720
Tookta must have given you the gift.

72
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,880
Pour water into the bowl.

73
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,680
Put the mirror in diagonally.

74
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,200
(Prapai: My rainbow)

75
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,240
(My rainbow)

76
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Seems like this gift
is given at the right time.

77
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,280
So for the next project,

78
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,960
Prapai can still help out Faye.

79
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,120
Wait until you’re more used to it,
then I’ll let you handle it yourself.

80
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,080
Sure.

81
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,160
If you’ve got anything to ask...

82
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,240
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.

83
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,880
Alright, if...

84
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,720
If you’ve got...

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Never mind. I’m all done.
Let’s split up.

86
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,120
Go on.

87
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,200
I’m really sorry. I’m sorry.

88
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,920
Break time.

89
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,360
Let’s have lunch.

90
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Sure.

91
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,240
(Memory of love story
short films project)

92
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,800
(Time: You can’t avoid me.)

93
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,160
(Time: Are you avoiding seeing me?)

94
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,680
Pupaa, today I saw an announcement.

95
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,880
There’s going to be
a short film competition.

96
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,600
It’s theme is “Memory of love story”.

97
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,800
So I’m thinking of competing.

98
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,440
Actually I don’t want the prize,

99
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,920
but I want it to be a memory of us.

100
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,960
Pai.

101
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,000
What are you doing?
Aren’t you going for lunch?

102
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,840
This project seems interesting.

103
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,120
Are you going to compete?

104
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,600
Yes.

105
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,320
I have some idea in mind.

106
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,160
But I don’t know who to ask for help.

107
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,120
Do you want me to help?

108
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,440
You’ve helped me with a lot
of my projects.

109
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,520
Let me help you too.

110
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,680
It’s alright.
I don’t want to bother you.

111
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,520
It’s alright.

112
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,560
We’re in the same team.
You’re not going to bother me.

113
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,400
Thank you.

114
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,360
So what are you missing?
Maybe I can help sort it out.

115
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,960
Right now,

116
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,920
I think I will let my friend
play the leading female role.

117
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,640
Um.

118
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,520
But the leading male role.

119
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,400
Who should I choose?

120
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,040
Why don’t you try contacting Time?

121
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,320
Aren’t you two close?

122
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,840
If you have a superstar in your project,

123
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,280
it will be a highlight of your project
when you submit it.

124
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,840
(That day you left me
and you’re still this quiet?)

125
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,560
I must be overthinking.

126
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,520
What are you talking about?

127
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,400
Who is this? Pupaa?

128
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,080
Do you remember Oh?

129
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,120
The one in our common group class.

130
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,760
Um.

131
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,040
Oh went to continue her studies
in China.

132
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,760
And she sent me this photo.

133
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,040
So what?

134
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,520
Isn’t he just having lunch
with a girl friend?

135
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,700
And also

136
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,000
the university that Pupaa went to
isn’t a boys-only institute.

137
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,080
It’s not weird
to be having a girl friend.

138
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,160
Really?

139
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,920
Um.

140
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,200
Should I tell Pai?

141
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,600
Don’t even think of telling her.

142
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,640
She’ll be stressing out about it.

143
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,880
Hey, guys.

144
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,520
I’m just going to dig in.

145
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,560
I’m so hungry.
I haven’t had anything to eat.

146
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
I’ll take this one.

147
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,840
Are you that busy?

148
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,320
Enjoy your meal.

149
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,880
Right now I’m doing a short film project
to enter a competition.

150
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,280
And so I have to look for the actors,

151
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,400
the location, and also write the script.

152
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,280
Once I’m done with the script,
I’ll let you guys read it.

153
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,920
Time, how did you get here?

154
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
I told you.

155
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,240
You can’t avoid me.

156
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,400
But I already apologized to you
for that day.

157
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,040
What else do you want me to do?

158
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,560
You have to be responsible

159
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,040
by letting me ask you out.

160
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,000
Huh?

161
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,940
Of course.

162
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,680
You’re handsome, rich and famous.

163
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,000
I fully support you.

164
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,120
I agree.

165
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
Wait a minute, guys.

166
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,320
That’s not right. Pupaa is my boyfriend.

167
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,600
And so? You’re not married.

168
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,040
Exactly.
Don’t block off your opportunity.

169
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,120
You’ve still got a choice.

170
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,240
People in the entire country
will be jealous of you.

171
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,960
- This is the country’s best idol.
- Exactly.

172
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,560
Your friends are cheering for me.

173
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,960
You must give me a chance now.

174
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,000
You guys can enjoy this meet and greet.

175
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,440
I’m out.

176
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,520
I’ve got so many other things to do.

177
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,880
Where are you going?

178
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,720
Home.

179
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,280
See you.

180
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,760
Can I take a photo?

181
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,320
Of course. Sure.

182
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,440
Short film about memory of love?

183
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,760
Um.

184
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,320
I don’t want in.

185
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,480
I’m still single.

186
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,880
I don’t feel like it.

187
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,200
Well, you did it to yourself.

188
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,120
But you said I’m your best friend.

189
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,400
Aren’t I?

190
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,640
Wawa.

191
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,840
Wait a minute. Hold on.

192
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,600
Where are you going?

193
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,120
Take a seat first.
Hold on, I’ll grab a chair for you.

194
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,800
Please sit down.

195
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,960
This is my leading female role.

196
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,240
Me?

197
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,040
Um.

198
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,280
In exchange for New Titipum’s autograph.
[*Famous Thai actor]

199
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
Alright.

200
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,960
I’m actually free these days.

201
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,240
And you’re my best friend.

202
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,800
You’ve got your leading female role.

203
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,400
You’ve also got your leading male role.

204
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,880
Who told you
I’ve got a leading male role?

205
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,120
It’s me.

206
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,640
Pai, did you make an appointment
with anyone?

207
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,040
Well, it’s like this.

208
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,560
I want to use this location
for the shooting.

209
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,000
Because Pupaa bought me here once.

210
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,760
So I tried talking
with the restaurant’s manager,

211
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,840
and he told me the price.

212
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
But it’s so expensive.
I can’t afford it.

213
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,820
But he said

214
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,680
he would go talk to the owner about it.

215
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
So the owner made an appointment
with me, here,

216
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,600
today.

217
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,560
So I invited you all here
to talk about it.

218
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,640
Did you secretly install a tracker
on her?

219
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,520
I see you following her everywhere.

220
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,920
Not this time.

221
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,360
Because this time,
I was the one who invited her.

222
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,480
Huh?

223
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,200
When did you ask me?

224
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,440
You should be talking to the owner
of the place you want to use

225
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,680
a bit better than this.

226
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,080
You’re the owner of this place?

227
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,440
Impossible.

228
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,440
Then how would I know about this?

229
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,200
Right?

230
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,120
Thank you.

231
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,000
You’re welcome.

232
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,160
Hey, can I ask you something?

233
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,120
Sure.

234
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,480
Prapai seems busy these days,

235
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,640
what is she doing?

236
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,600
Oh.

237
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,840
She’s working on a short film project
for a competition.

238
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,920
I heard she’s looking for a few actors
and the locations too.

239
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,800
Yes, exactly.

240
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,760
Why don’t you play the leading role?

241
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,960
So you can find an opportunity
to get close to her.

242
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,040
Yes.

243
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,320
Hey, I’m an actor.

244
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,760
I’ve got so much money.
I’ve got to be investing in something.

245
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,240
But that’s not the point.

246
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,600
The point is,
I can let you use this place for free.

247
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,760
Really?

248
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,120
But under one condition.

249
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,920
I’ve got to play the leading male role
of this short film.

250
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
- No.
- No.

251
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,400
Oh.

252
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,640
Then you can’t use this location now.

253
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,920
Do you want to answer again?

254
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,040
- Okay.
- No.

255
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,080
Ta, but this is my project.

256
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,920
And I need to use this location.

257
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,440
There’re other locations
similar to this one.

258
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,960
But this place is free.
Or are you going to pay for me?

259
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,320
- Alright.
- Alright.

260
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,480
Here.

261
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,800
A contract for renting the place.

262
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Sign it.

263
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,440
(Prapai)

264
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,400
Um.

265
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,840
And if you cancel,

266
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,680
you’re going to be fined.

267
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,480
Keep that in mind.

268
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,480
See you later, everyone.

269
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,680
Wow, I get to play with a superstar.

270
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,400
Wow.

271
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,760
He must have forgotten

272
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,240
that we tricked him that day.

273
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,400
Yes, hello?

274
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,320
Yes, Chain.

275
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,200
Thank you so much

276
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,000
for letting me pretend to be the owner
of the restaurant for the day.

277
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,320
I promise once the short film is out,

278
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,440
everyone will be rushing to queue up
at your restaurant.

279
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,040
Sure. Thank you so much, Chain.

280
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,400
Alright, in this scene,
the leading male and female

281
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,880
will be sitting here
looking at the stars together.

282
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,720
Then the girl will see a meteor
from that direction.

283
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,360
She’ll be in shock
and will quickly grab his hands.

284
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,400
Just like this.

285
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,760
Time will then ask you,
what did you wish for?

286
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,640
The girl will then reply

287
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,040
I wish to be with you forever.

288
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,560
Like this, alright?

289
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,280
Okay.

290
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Hold on.

291
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,960
Can you repeat that again?

292
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,840
I’m just feeling it.

293
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,840
Hey, stop playing.

294
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,160
Everyone, be in set up position.

295
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,640
Everyone, get ready.

296
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,040
Let’s go.

297
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Camera.

298
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,160
Speed.

299
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,360
And action.

300
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,480
A meteor.

301
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,720
Um.

302
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,240
What did you wish for?

303
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,760
I wish to be with you forever.

304
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,600
I’ll be right beside you.

305
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Cut.

306
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,800
Great job. This was great.

307
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,960
What kind of script is this?

308
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,400
Why are they hugging for real?

309
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,640
Why didn’t you adjust the camera angle?

310
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,680
What are you mad about, Ta?

311
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,200
Why are you complaining?

312
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,520
I think

313
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,480
it’s inappropriate for kids under 18.

314
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,240
Huh?

315
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
Just a hug?

316
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,840
Yes.

317
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,960
Nonsense.

318
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,960
It came out great.

319
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,240
You could’ve still adjusted
the camera angle.

320
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,640
Hey.

321
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,800
Both leading roles don’t seem to have
any problems.

322
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,560
It’s boring.

323
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
It’s not interesting.

324
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,000
Also

325
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,120
many memories of love stories

326
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,640
mostly end with a bad ending.

327
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,920
That’s why it’s more memorable
for the audience.

328
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,320
No.

329
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,900
I want it to be

330
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,040
a moment of comfort.

331
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,840
A couple being together
is a great memory.

332
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,000
Long distance relationships
don’t work out.

333
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,560
Alright, everyone,
get ready for the next scene.

334
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,000
All ready.

335
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,520
Starting from not answering calls,

336
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,480
saying I’m busy as an excuse.

337
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,520
Then later on, having weird behaviors

338
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,800
that make you question.

339
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,120
Do you want to continue the shoot?

340
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Alright, everyone be ready.

341
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,360
And action.

342
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,840
Pai, I’m going to go now.

343
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,480
Um.

344
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
This...

345
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,640
Oh this...

346
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,360
This is a project from work.

347
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,600
I hired Ta as a freelance photographer.

348
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,040
He just sent me the work to approve.

349
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,600
But his skill is great, isn’t it?

350
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,680
The script you wrote,

351
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,440
it’s about you and Pupaa, right?

352
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,720
You miss him so much
so you had to turn it into a short film?

353
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,520
So romantic.

354
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,400
Yes.

355
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,520
I’m about to

356
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,160
leave right now.

357
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,920
Sure.

358
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,880
Even if Ta has been having
bad reputation about all the girls,

359
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,080
but I know him well.

360
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,600
I can confirm to you
that he really has changed.

361
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,320
Are you really not going to give him
another chance?

362
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,840
Actually

363
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,480
I was planning to just act strong
for only this month.

364
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,040
Both as a test
and to wash away bad luck.

365
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,880
To wash away bad luck?

366
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,880
I went to a fortune teller.

367
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,720
She said my relationship status
is not so well this month.

368
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,640
If I can pass through this month,

369
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,200
everything will be better.

370
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,320
So I...

371
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,080
Is she accurate?

372
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,440
Yes.

373
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,560
Wawa.

374
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,680
I’m about to go home.

375
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,200
Are you free?

376
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,720
Can you drop me off?

377
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,640
I sure am.

378
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,680
I’m always available for you.

379
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,960
Let’s go home.

380
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,760
I’ll head out now.

381
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,520
Alright.

382
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,640
- Bye.
- Bye.

383
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,080
I’ll try to watch the video with this

384
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,520
to see if we can find some results.

385
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,520
- OK, go ahead.
- OK.

386
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,200
If the progress is this slow,

387
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,760
the research will never be done
within this year.

388
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,320
Are you going to use the footage
from the regular shooting?

389
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,160
It’s quite difficult.

390
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,280
Um.

391
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,200
Where did you get this footage from?

392
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,760
My girlfriend sent it to me.

393
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,680
Just let me know
if you’ve got anything in mind.

394
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,720
I’m so shy. But isn’t the leading male
coming to watch it too?

395
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,760
It’s just a little review.
Let’s not disturb him.

396
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,840
It’s good that he’s not here.

397
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
Let’s start it.

398
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,840
Okay.

399
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,120
I’ve been through so much
in terms of relationships.

400
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,240
And don’t say that I’m intruding.

401
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,640
Such romantic love
only happens in dreams.

402
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,880
Thinking back,

403
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,760
my man used to love me so much too.

404
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,280
But after that, we broke up.

405
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,240
Just like what the fortune teller said.
We’re really not a match.

406
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Were you using tarot cards or astrology?

407
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,440
How did we get to this topic?

408
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,560
You want to know, right?

409
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,640
If you’re interested,
I’ll take you there.

410
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,520
But

411
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,360
it’s girls only.

412
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,520
Alright.

413
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,080
You’re a fortune teller too?

414
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,040
Um.

415
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,680
I used to be well-known in this area.

416
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,520
But my sales have been rising,

417
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,600
so I haven’t had the time to continue.

418
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,920
But I’ll give you a special treat today.

419
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,480
Sure.

420
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,040
Alright, I’ll start first.

421
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,080
So we know if it’s accurate or not.

422
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,000
Um.

423
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,600
Alright, you can start off
by choosing three cards.

424
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,560
I’m going to open it now.

425
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,480
(TEAMPERANCE)

426
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,000
These three cards

427
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,240
seem to be giving a sense of confusion,

428
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,320
it’s an on-and-off thing going on.

429
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,120
If something good happened,
you’ll have to be aware

430
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,800
that something bad will follow up.

431
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,280
Next.

432
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,640
Pai’s turn.

433
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,560
Sure.

434
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,240
Alright, choose three cards.

435
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:14,180
(FOUR OF CUPS THE DEVIL
THREE OF SWORDS)

436
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,280
Well,

437
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,800
you’re about to know the truth
about something.

438
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,920
It’s about a third person.

439
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,640
And there will be a girl from the past
involved.

440
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,440
You should take it slow.

441
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,560
That’s what the cards say.

442
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,280
And my cards are very accurate.

443
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,600
(Prapai, my friend and Pupaa
are in the same university)

444
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,720
(She said that this girl
is Pupaa’s first love)

445
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,440
Pai.

446
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,680
This is another box
that Pupaa left for you.

447
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,360
Thank you.

448
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,880
(Use the magnet in the box
to stick it to the doll)

449
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,320
(Then take the two dolls
and put them together)

450
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,520
(And there I am, right next to you)

451
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,600
This is not working.

452
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,440
I have to do something.

453
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,500
(FOUR OF CUPS)

454
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,020
(THREE OF SWORDS)

455
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,160
Oh.

456
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,600
The cards are stuck together.
Let me see.

457
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,020
(THE WORLD)

458
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,280
So then that means the prediction
will be...

459
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,320
Pupaa is not cheating on her.

460
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,720
Oh no.

461
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,960
I have to tell Prapai.

462
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,920
But if I tell her, she’ll say that
the card is not accurate.

463
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,600
So then I guess I won’t tell.

464
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,400
Never mind.

465
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,920
Are you for real, mom?

466
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,860
(THE WORLD)
(THREE OF SWORDS)

467
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,000
(Prapai)

468
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,320
(Rejected)

469
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,040
(The other party canceled the call)

470
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,800
(Did you call me?)

471
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,680
Pupaa.

472
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Can you explain this to everyone?

473
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
Oh.

474
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,160
(Did you call me?)

475
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,440
Ah.

476
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,360
Pon, I want to talk to you.

477
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,440
What is it?

478
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,560
Next week...

479
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,840
Well, I want to ask
for a one-week leave.

480
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,640
Are you going on a trip
with your boyfriend?

481
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,240
Not really.

482
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,960
I don’t mind.
You can take the week off if you want.

483
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,060
The job is done.

484
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,520
We’ve only got the client
and the finances that need sorting.

485
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,640
Your part is all done.

486
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,120
Thank you so much.

487
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,040
So when are you going to go?

488
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,720
Tomorrow.

489
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,920
Oh, quite a short notice.

490
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,860
Whatever.

491
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,120
Just don’t forget to finish
all your work before you leave.

492
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,680
And if there’s anything
that needs to be done immediately,

493
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,040
you can leave it with me.

494
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,600
I’ll take over it.

495
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,480
There’s nothing left.

496
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,800
But the remaining miscellaneous tasks,

497
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,600
I’ll finish them off today.

498
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,200
Thank you.

499
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,360
Pon, Mr. Japan is waiting for you.

500
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,680
Sure.

501
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,120
Pai.

502
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,200
Yes?

503
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,920
I heard you’re taking a leave.

504
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,480
Oh, yes. I was about to tell you.

505
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,760
How about your short film project?

506
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,000
It’s due in three days.

507
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,080
Have you completed
the submission steps?

508
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,320
Oh, yeah.

509
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,920
I forgot all about it, Faye.

510
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,880
What should I do?

511
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,120
Then

512
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,860
you can put all the information
of the project

513
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,400
and save it in a thumb drive for me.

514
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,480
I’ll do it for you.

515
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,680
Really?

516
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,440
Um.

517
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,200
Thank you so much, Faye.

518
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,000
Sure.

519
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,240
This is the first project of my own.

520
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,000
I’ll get you lots of souvenirs.

521
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,800
Sure.

522
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
(Love marks, care level)

523
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
(Obedience level, smile level)

524
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,240
(Responsibility level, gentleness level)

525
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,000
Hey, what are you doing here?

526
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,240
Huh?

527
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,840
Is your student card with you?

528
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,040
Hello, I don’t... I...

529
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,960
No, no.

530
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,200
Only students here
are allowed to get in.

531
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,240
Huh?

532
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,360
I just wanted to go in to see my friend.

533
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,680
Can I please go in?

534
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,280
No way, no.

535
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,880
- Can I please go in?
- No.

536
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,640
Hey, man.

537
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,960
Is everything alright?

538
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,280
She’s my friend’s sister,

539
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,640
coming to taste my new recipe.

540
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,320
She just arrived in China.

541
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,240
Can you let her in?

542
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,120
I see. She’s coming for you.

543
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,320
Yes, yes.

544
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,080
Please come in.

545
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,480
OK, thank you.

546
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,640
Are you Thai?

547
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,120
You’re also Thai?

548
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,840
Yes.

549
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,280
I’m so lucky.

550
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,600
What are you doing here?

551
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,760
I’m here to see my boyfriend.

552
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,920
I’m so lucky to have met you.

553
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,240
Otherwise I’ll be in trouble.

554
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,040
It’s alright.

555
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,120
I own a restaurant in the university.

556
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,520
You can come by sometime
when you have the chance.

557
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,000
Don’t worry.
I’ll never miss anything about food.

558
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,040
So what’s your name?

559
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,480
My name is Prapai.

560
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
Oh, Prapai. My name is Yang.

561
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,240
Yes. Thank you anyway.

562
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,760
- Sure.
- I’ll see you around.

563
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,640
- Bye.
- Great.

564
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,960
Kwang.

565
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,720
You’re Kwang, right?
You’re really Kwang.

566
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
Did she really follow him to China?

567
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,480
I never thought I’d see you here.

568
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,800
Do you remember me? I’m Prapai.

569
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,520
I’m glad that you’re my friend, Pai.

570
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,880
Should I call you my best friend,
or my ex’s best friend.

571
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,600
Stop joking.

572
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,080
Follow me.

573
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,480
I’m so lucky to meet you.

574
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,640
Otherwise I’ll be in big trouble.
I’ll probably be sleeping right here.

575
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,080
Pupaa, did you hear the news?

576
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,400
That the upcoming seminar,

577
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,960
a great Professor will be joining.

578
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,040
Yes, I know. Dr. Gu Weiyi, right?

579
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,360
You’re always in the room
doing experiments.

580
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,480
How did you know?

581
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,160
Because he’s my idol.

582
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,040
I have to keep up with his news.

583
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,800
I guess you’re not going to miss
the seminar for sure.

584
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,480
Professor already selected
our senior Xiaowei though.

585
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,640
But I have a way
for you to attend the seminar.

586
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,440
How so?

587
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,480
If you want to know,

588
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,160
you have to treat me a meal in return.

589
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,160
You have to tell me first.

590
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,520
Sure. But don’t you fool me.

591
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,040
Well, Xiaowei got the opportunity
to go to Germany.

592
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,920
And her visa was just granted.

593
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,120
Therefore...

594
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,640
If you try to talk with
the Chinese Professor about it,

595
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,100
nobody will suit better

596
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,720
in that vacant position other than you.

597
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,640
These are the documents for the seminar.

598
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,480
You can have a read through.

599
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,960
So that you could impress
the Chinese Professor.

600
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,500
Wow.

601
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,400
So you actually found a way for Pupaa
to go to the seminar with you, right?

602
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,280
So you guys can spend your time
together, right?

603
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,720
The fact that you’re so kind to Pupaa,

604
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,840
I guess his girlfriend in Thailand
will have to be...

605
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,000
Pupaa.

606
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,600
Prapai.

607
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,120
How did you get here?

608
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,760
Because I missed you.

609
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,280
I hope she didn’t hear what I said.

610
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,600
I was talking nonsense.

611
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,640
Hello.

612
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,240
- Hello.
- Hi.

613
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,280
Wow, they all look so good.

614
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
Wow.

615
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,120
Pupaa, the man of his words.

616
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,200
I’m actually treating my girlfriend.

617
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,600
Whatever.

618
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,360
At least I get to have some,
that’s all that matters.

619
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,640
Normally we come here so often.

620
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,240
But excluding Pupaa.

621
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,840
This guy is always doing experiments.

622
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,840
He probably lives on the chemicals.

623
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,040
Here, this soup is delicious.
I’ll give you some.

624
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,560
Never mind, I’ll do it.

625
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,240
Alright, you can do it.

626
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,800
If you’re the one serving the soup,

627
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,400
I’m sure it will taste even better.

628
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,360
Thank you.

629
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,480
Hold on.

630
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,800
Kwang, you should have some too.

631
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,680
Here you go.

632
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,400
Sure.

633

Not at all. Happy birthday.

639
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,280
Happy birthday. Best wishes to you.

640
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,000
You’re from Thailand? Thank you.

641
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,960
No problem.

642
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,240
Let’s eat.

643
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,120
- Alright, let’s eat.
- Um.

644
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,480
Be careful it’s hot.

645
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,120
It’s so hot.

646
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,280
I told you to be careful.

647
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,120
Here.

648
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,600
Thank you so much.

649
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,200
It looks delicious.

650
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,200
She gave us a cake.

651
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,320
It’s delicious.

652
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,680
Pupaa.

653
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,240
You haven’t introduced Prapai to us yet.

654
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,480
When you said you had a girlfriend,

655
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,480
I thought

656
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,840
you got one from an experiment.

657
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,200
Am I right, Kwang?

658
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,320
Right?

659
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,080
You don’t have to introduce her to me.

660
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,720
I’ve known Prapai
for longer than Pupaa has.

661
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,080
What?

662
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,800
Yes. But Kwang left in freshmen year.

663
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,120
And after that, we haven’t contacted
each other since.

664
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,760
I never thought I’d meet you here.

665
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,040
I moved to the same high school
as Pupaa.

666
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,800
What a coincidence!

667
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,560
It’s like the six degrees of separation,
right?

668
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,280
Um.

669
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,280
We were really close, right, Pupaa?

670
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,760
So how’s Ta been?

671
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,520
You know Ta too?

672
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,400
When we were young,
we went everywhere together.

673
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,080
We like the same things.

674
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,840
I never thought it’s been this long,

675
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,200
and we’re still the same.

676
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,360
You mean you both like Pupaa?

677
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,240
And when Kwang was young,

678
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,480
you were with Pupaa.

679
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,440
So Kwang was Pupaa’s first love?

680
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,200
Right?

681
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,760
Right?

682
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,000
(Special scene)

683
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,480
Pupaa.

684
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,920
Let’s go have lunch.

685
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,920
You can come back and do it later.

686
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,720
No, thanks.

687
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,440
I could possibly calculate
a couple of equations while you’re gone.

688
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,520
What are you doing?

689
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,920
Oh, alright.

690
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,160
Do you want me to get you anything?

691
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,080
No, thanks. I’ve prepared my own snack.

692
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,280
Okay.

693
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,600
Work hard.
