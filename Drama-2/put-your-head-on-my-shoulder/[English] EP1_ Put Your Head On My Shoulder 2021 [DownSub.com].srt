(Valentine’s Day)

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,140
I always had a bad memory

34
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,760
about Valentine’s Day.

35
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,720
Happy Valentine’s Day.

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,640
Thank you.

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,720
Happy Valentine’s Day.

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,040
Oh, wrong person.

39
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,320
- What?
- Who?

40
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:41,900
Then who?

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,040
There, she’s over there.

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,840
Thank you.

43
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:54,020
Happy Valentine’s Day.

44
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,080
What is it about Valentine’s Day?

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,080
It’s not even our festival.

46
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,080
This is so annoying.

47
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,760
(Wawa)

48
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,120
Hello, Wawa.

49
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,600
Hey, Pai, is my purse on the bedside?

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,080
Umm.

51
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,340
I forgot to bring it with me.

52
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,560
Can you help bring it to me?

53
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,280
Oh, but...

54
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,060
Please, I’ll wait for you

55
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,380
on the side of the field.

56
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,400
Thank you so much.

57
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,780
Ah, ah.

58
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,060
You’re so hot.

59
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,020
Come on.

60
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,140
You’re the best.

61
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,800
Hey, move out!

62
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,580
If I dodge to the right,

63
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,960
my momentum will cause me to fall,

64
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,040
and roll onto the field, injuring me.

65
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,260
But if I dodge to the left,

66
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,600
there’s still not enough distance
to reduce my speed to 0.

67
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,520
I’ll crash into them.

68
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,440
There’s only one way left.

69
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,280
I’m still perfectly fine.

70
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,720
Are you alright?

71
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,200
Wawa.

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,800
Oh, I can see your smile from afar.

73
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,380
I just had a scary incident.

74
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,040
Just like in the movies.

75
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,320
What are you talking about?

76
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,560
Here you go, your purse.

77
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,300
You’re all dressed up.

78
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,280
Where are you going? On a date?

79
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,680
Not really.

80
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
I’m going to go now. See you.

81
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,200
Pupaa, Pupaa, please take my gift.

82
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,920
Please take my flowers, too.

83
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,600
Mine too.

84
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,920
- Sorry, I don’t accept gifts from anyone.
- I really like you, Pupaa.

85
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,560
I’m sorry, I have to go now.

86
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,720
So arrogant.

87
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
- Please take it.
- Take it.

88
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,020
Just take it.

89
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,440
Sorry, I don’t accept gifts.

90
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,240
Didn’t you hear me? I said no.

91
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,160
Wait, I didn’t say I like you.

92
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,120
You look good,
but you’ve got a bad character.

93
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Ta.

94
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,520
Come here, let me hug you.

95
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,160
Ta!

96
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,680
Why are you so loud?
I was having a good dream.

97
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,400
Go shower.

98
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,320
Can I have 10 more minutes?

99
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,120
If you’re 10 minutes slower,

100
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,900
the statistics of your shower time

101
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,640
will be on average 20 minutes,

102
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,160
and another ten minutes
in finding clothes

103
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,560
and getting dressed.

104
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,340
Calculating all the time together,
you will be ready at 8:10 AM.

105
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,320
But if you don’t get up now...

106
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,280
Okay, okay. I give up.

107
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,400
Normally you wouldn’t say anything.

108
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,240
But when having to calculate something,
it’s like you’re rapping.

109
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Go shower.

110
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,120
How about the important props
for today’s shoot?

111
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,480
Don’t worry. I got it all covered.

112
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,240
You’re the best.

113
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,560
Having a great friend is just the best.

114
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,400
Let me give you a kiss.

115
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,480
Ta, I’m not playing.

116
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,720
Go, go shower.
You’ve only got 3 minutes left.

117
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,400
Go.

118
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,880
Alright.

119
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,120
Oh Ta, and wear that shirt, alright?
I picked it out for you already.

120
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,640
So we don’t waste any more time.

121
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,560
Yes, sir.

122
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,920
Pai!

123
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,080
Can I have a sanitary napkin?

124
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,180
Maesa.

125
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,120
You scared me.
I thought something bad happened.

126
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,440
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

127
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,480
You’re not even doing your own work,

128
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,360
and you’re still helping
on a guy’s work.

129
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,040
No, that’s my work.

130
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,340
Don’t trick me.

131
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,920
I can just tell it’s Ta’s work.

132
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,640
You’ve been in university
for 4 years already,

133
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,720
Hasn’t it changed you a bit?

134
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,020
Just having Ta talk to you nicely,

135
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,800
and you’re willing to help him already.

136
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,200
You’re even helping him
with the final project poster.

137
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
I don’t think it’s right.

138
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,260
I think in this lifetime,

139
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,320
you won’t be able to escape from him.

140
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,920
Thank you.

141
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,280
(Ta)
See, speak of the devil.

142
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
He’s calling you right now.

143
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,520
What’s up, Ta?

144
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,760
Hello, beautiful Prapai

145
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,880
Where are you? I’m waiting for you.

146
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,120
What are you waiting for?
I said I’m not free today.

147
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,960
What am I going to do
if you’re not coming?

148
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,840
You can let someone else help you.

149
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,600
Man, it’s my final project.
Are you really not going to help me?

150
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,200
You’re the only one who can help me.

151
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,640
Don’t exaggerate.

152
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,280
I’m not exaggerating.
I’m waiting for only you.

153
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,000
I told you not to wait. Just do it.
Just do the shoot.

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I’m really busy. I can’t go.

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Alright, I understand.
I know I’m not important.

156
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,360
Never mind.
I’ll find someone else as a replacement.

157
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,800
Even though it won’t be the same.

158
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,840
Hey, stop making me feel bad.

159
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,220
I’m not saying it to make you feel bad.

160
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,960
I really mean it.

161
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,200
You go and do your thing.
I’m going to stop bothering you now.

162
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,360
I’m not going to go.

163
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,840
They can still do the shoot without me.

164
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,120
I thought you said I was the only one.

165
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,160
There’re so many people here.

166
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,960
Excuse me, have you seen Ta?

167
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,720
No? It’s alright.

168
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,920
Excuse me, have you seen Ta?

169
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,440
Oh, he’s over there.

170
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,120
Over there?

171
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,680
- Yes.
- Thank you.

172
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,020
See?

173
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,760
I have to ask about Ta from a girl.

174
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,560
Ta.

175
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,080
I love you.

176
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,960
I’m sorry.

177
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,200
But I think of you as a friend.

178
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,660
No wonder he was rejecting
all the girls this morning

179
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,760
He doesn’t like girls.

180
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,640
Alright, the feeling should be
something like this.

181
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,600
- Alright.
- All clear.

182
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,840
Alright, go get ready.
We’ll continue the shoot.

183
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,840
Alright.

184
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,800
Well, you settled well
into the role, Pupaa.

185
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Did you think it was real?

186
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,600
Don’t tease me. I’m helping you.

187
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,120
I’m just joking.

188
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,960
If someone like you was to fall in love,

189
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,600
there would be snow in Thailand.

190
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
You’re crazy.

191
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,480
How many times do I have to hear
people confess their love today?

192
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,640
Why does this world have to have
Valentine’s Day?

193
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,360
I hate this stupid day.

194
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,200
I think there are about 6 or 5 hearts
on your back?

195
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Why are there so many?

196
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
I didn’t get any.

197
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,480
- How about a full turn?
- Just so so.

198
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,240
Happy Valentine’s.

199
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,000
Thank you for being my friend.

200
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,240
Why are you saying that?

201
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,540
It’s true.

202
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,040
I move schools a lot.
I don’t have many friends.

203
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,600
I’m happy that I got to be your friend.

204
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,600
I’m happy that I’m your friend too,
Kwang.

205
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,840
I love you. Happy Valentine’s Day.

206
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,400
Here you go.

207
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,680
What else? Show me.

208
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,760
Sure.

209
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,720
A heart, right?

210
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,440
Yeah.

211
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,160
I love you too. Give me a heart too.

212
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,000
Who loves you? I’m not giving you one.

213
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,560
I’ll give you one. Here you go.

214
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,160
Thank you.

215
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,680
I got another one.

216
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,000
Ta, let’s go back home together again.

217
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,360
Prapai, my Valentine’s is here.

218
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,320
Don’t be such a sweet mouth.
Who’s your Valentine?

219
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,520
I got to leave early today.
I’ve got something going on.

220
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,120
This is Prapai.

221
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,920
My best friend since high school.

222
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,540
Well, this is Pupaa.

223
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,400
A friend that I really love too.

224
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,600
Ta, I love you.

225
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,760
Hi.

226
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,900
You rejected him
and you still have the guts

227
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,880
to call him your best friend.

228
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,000
Look at you.

229
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,440
Not ashamed at all.

230
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,820
Why?

231
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,320
Why are you so nervous
in front of two handsome men?

232
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,720
Don’t be nervous.

233
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,320
He’s a nice guy.

234
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,600
You’re always like this.

235
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,480
Why are you frustrated?

236
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,280
You know what I’m talking about.

237
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Why don’t you learn to care
about other people’s feelings?

238
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,360
Excuse me, Ta.

239
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,360
Yes?

240
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,860
We’ve set up the camera already,

241
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,180
but we’re not sure if it’s in position.

242
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,600
Can you please come take a look?

243
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,840
Of course.

244
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,960
I’ll be back.

245
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,600
Let’s go.

246
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,760
Hey you, wait a minute.

247
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,460
I want to tell you that

248
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,360
I wasn’t going to confess my love to you
this morning.

249
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,280
I know already.

250
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,880
I heard you shouted after me,
telling me I’m a bad person.

251
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,800
Actually,

252
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,440
girls have to be very brave
to confess their love to someone.

253
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,600
Isn’t it a little too mean
to reject her like that?

254
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,200
Isn’t it better
to not give any hope at all?

255
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,180
So when Ta rejected you,

256
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,920
you thought what he did was right.

257
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,440
Such a great guy,
accepting the truth on his own.

258
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,080
I guess I should take him as an example.

259
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,160
It’s alright, I understand.

260
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,800
Things like this is very sensitive.

261
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,400
You’ll have to give yourself some time.

262
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,800
Everything will be better.

263
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,720
I don’t think you understand.

264
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,160
Why do you need to care so much?

265
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,600
Guess who it is?

266
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,600
Guess who it is?

267
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,240
Ken, what are you doing?

268
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,840
I’m just playing with you.

269
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,840
Do we know each other?

270
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,800
Prapai, you don’t know us.

271
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,480
But we know you very well.

272
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,960
Ta loves to tell us about you.

273
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,900
When you were young,

274
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,480
you were always teased about your name.

275
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,920
Either being called wind or fart.

276
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,840
3.141592653589…

277
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,000
What are you saying?

278
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,000
It’s the value of pi.
[*Thai sound of Pai is the same as pi]

279
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,120
It’s the ratio of the circumference
to the diameter of any circle.

280
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,240
A value that has no end.

281
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,120
It hides many secrets of the universe.

282
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,720
Sounds very interesting.

283
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,360
But it’s quite difficult,
because Ta told me

284
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,920
Prapai has never had a boyfriend.

285
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,040
What are you telling Prapai about me?

286
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,680
Nothing.

287
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,080
What about you?
What did you tell your friends?

288
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,640
Don’t believe them.

289
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,600
They were framing me.

290
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,600
Let’s continue the shoot
before it gets late.

291
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,440
Let’s go.

292
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,920
Great, let’s go.

293
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,920
What a good morning.
I can finish work early.

294
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,040
Ta, I have to go in 15 minutes.

295
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,340
Please, just one scene, please.

296
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,280
Just one easy scene.

297
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,440
Do you see the main couple over there?

298
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,020
When I say action,

299
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,040
you just ride the bicycle and pass by.

300
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,600
But I have to go.

301
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,880
Just an easy scene.
Please, it’ll be quick.

302
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,400
In the meantime,
you can just practice riding.

303
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,080
Thank you. Bye.

304
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,520
How’s it going?

305
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,000
Hmm.

306
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,120
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

307
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,600
Hand me the gift, please.

308
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,960
Quickly, Pupaa.

309
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,820
Once I say action,

310
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,000
hand her the gift
as if you’re giving her your feelings.

311
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,800
- Ready?
- Yes.

312
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,120
Come on, let’s get ready for the shoot.

313
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,560
- Come on, everyone, we’re ready.
- Rehearsal time.

314
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,000
Alright, we’re all ready?

315
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,200
And action.

316
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,080
Ta, I have something to confess.

317
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,880
I think of you more than just friends.

318
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,680
Will you be my boyfriend?

319
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,280
Umm, we can try.

320
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,080
So what’s next?

321
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,840
Hey, Pai, careful!

322
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,940
(∑F=ma)

323
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,800
I’m sorry that I broke your prop.

324
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,760
Are you alright?

325
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,500
What were you thinking?

326
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,240
We could’ve passed it in one take.

327
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,560
Not even a take.

328
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,920
Are you going to be okay
going on set like this?

329
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,320
I don’t think so.

330
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,260
Hey, Pupaa.

331
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,480
Can you take Prapai to treat her wound?

332
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,240
Never mind, I have somewhere else to go.

333
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,160
You can just let someone replace me.

334
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,920
Wawa, since when did you get here?

335
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,560
I’ve been here since morning.

336
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,240
Can you help play Prapai’s role?

337
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,600
Yeah, sure.

338
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,760
Great, come on, let’s go.

339
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,360
Come on, everyone, let’s reset.

340
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,560
So we can rehearse one more time.

341
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,760
Otherwise,
we’ll be finishing the shoot late.

342
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,940
Where’s the bike?

343
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,600
(Chai Advertising)

344
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,200
Come on, just try Prapai.

345
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
So you can finally start on
something new.

346
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,760
What are you doing?

347
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,920
Hello, I’m here for the job interview.

348
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,360
You’re the one who sent the application?

349
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,120
Yes, it’s me.

350
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,040
You can go wait inside.

351
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Sure.

352
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Are you the CEO, Mr. Chaiyakorn?

353
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,200
You can call me Chai, it’s fine.

354
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,200
Sure.

355
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,320
Show me some of your work.

356
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,920
Oh, yes.

357
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,320
- Here you go.
- Okay.

358
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,320
This is...

359
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,760
What is this? What did you study?

360
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,960
Oh, I studied accounting.

361
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,760
But I’ve also been practicing
on advertising.

362
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,640
Even though advertising isn’t my major,

363
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,280
but I am always ready to learn
and improve myself.

364
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,760
Are you not here to interview
as an accountant?

365
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,360
Excuse me?

366
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,240
But you sent an e-mail saying
you majored in accounting.

367
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,400
Oh, I’m applying
for a creative position.

368
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:49,960
Okay.

369
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,960
Did you say okay?

370
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,600
I don’t think I can take you in.

371
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,160
Right now our creative positions
are full.

372
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,640
What day is it today?

373
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,560
(Ta)

374
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,080
(Prapai)

375
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,540
Just like this.

376
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,480
- Ta.
- I’m busy.

377
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,600
Can’t you see I’m giving a brief?

378
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,600
(Prapai)

379
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,560
You already did your homework, right?

380
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,200
Hey, Ta, can you come to pick me up?
I just got robbed.

381
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,760
I shared you the location already.

382
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,560
Hello? Wait.

383
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,140
I thought you went back already.

384
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,540
Since young,

385
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,240
why have I always been unlucky
on Valentine’s Day?

386
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,120
Why is he here?

387
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,960
Don’t use your hands
to wipe your tears like that.

388
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,240
It will get you infected.

389
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,880
Also, your hands are dirty.
If you rub your eyes so hard like that,

390
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,180
your eyelids will get infected.

391
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,640
And if not treated well,

392
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,920
you might get a tetani wound.

393
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,560
Oh my,
is there anything worse than this?

394
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,040
Oh no, my lipstick.

395
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,560
But this is caused from being hit,

396
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,560
not caused from any pressure.

397
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,440
Never mind,
I think you should go to the hospital

398
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,460
Never mind?

399
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,420
Do you know how long I’ve been saving up

400
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,920
for this lipstick?

401
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,160
This is the limited 1790 one.

402
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,100
I’ve only used it twice.

403
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,960
I didn’t even buy it on sale.

404
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,280
I think your wound matters more
than your lipstick.

405
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,560
It’s alright,
I can go treat my wound at home.

406
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,480
Sorry for being mad about the lipstick.

407
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,800
Come on,
let’s go back and help Ta’s work.

408
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,560
You wait here.

409
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,400
Excuse me, do you have any antiseptic?

410
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,120
We’re out.

411
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,680
So do you have any sodium chloride
or hydrogen peroxide?

412
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,680
It’s over there.

413
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,460
They were out of antiseptic.

414
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,440
We’ll use these instead.

415
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,400
(Sodium chloride)

416
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,760
(Hydrogen peroxide)

417
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,840
(Hydrogen peroxide+sodium chloride)

418
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,400
Put your arm up.

419
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,040
Hey, what are you doing?

420
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,280
Cleaning your wound.

421
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,360
With this?

422
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,720
If you don’t clean the wound,
it will be infected.

423
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,240
You’re going to have
to cut your arm off.

424
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,480
You can scream if it hurts.

425
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,600
All done.

426
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,760
Thank you for helping me.

427
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,400
Ta wasn’t free.

428
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,400
So I came to help you.

429
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,280
I’m not your lovely music box,

430
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,280
why do you even care?

431
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,760
Come on, let’s go.

432
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,360
Are you alright?

433
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,040
If I’m not alright,
are you going to carry me?

434
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,560
No, thanks. It’s a waste of energy.

435
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,560
I called a car to pick us up already.

436
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,920
What? I’m hurt.

437
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,920
You’re going to let me carry everything?

438
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,360
Alright, the next scene will be you
leaning against each other.

439
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,640
- I’ll show you first.
- Alright.

440
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,480
Come on.

441
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,080
Hey, Wawa,
can you help me with the demonstration?

442
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,200
Umm.

443
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,840
Come.

444
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,440
Both of you will be sitting down.

445
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,920
The girl will lean on the guy first.

446
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,880
The guy will look at her slowly.

447
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,040
And smile slowly.

448
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,960
And then lean against her too.
Like this.

449
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,120
- Okay?
- Okay.

450
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,400
Come on, let’s do a rehearsal.

451
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,960
Sure.

452
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,200
Check their hair and make-up too.

453
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,480
- Okay, you remember what I told you, right?
- Yes, we do.

454
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,160
Okay, let’s give it a try.

455
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,920
We’re here.

456
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,520
I’ll stop here for a moment.

457
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,660
Why did you come here?

458
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,480
Aren’t you rushing back to get to Ta?

459
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,640
But my phone is broken.

460
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,140
I can’t contact anyone.

461
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,880
I need to come here to fix it up first.

462
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,040
I’ll give you only 15 minutes.

463
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,160
Because we need to take another
35 minutes to get back.

464
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,200
You’re not going to help me choose?

465
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,720
No, thanks. Hurry up.

466
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,960
Ta must be waiting.

467
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,720
Everything is about Ta.

468
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,760
And pressuring me, too.

469
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Which one should I pick?

470
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,440
Are you interested in this one?

471
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,280
OPPO Find X2 Pro is the newest model.

472
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,280
With a billion color
120Hz super sensing screen.

473
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,920
It can be fully charged
within 38 minutes.

474
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,680
It also supports 5G.

475
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,520
I’ll take this one. It’s lovely.

476
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,760
Aren’t you going to listen
to more of its properties?

477
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
It’s alright, I’m in a bit of a rush.

478
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,160
I’m sure it will be great.
I’ll take this one.

479
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,040
Of course.

480
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,420
A little bit.

481
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,720
You’ll have to bear with it.

482
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,920
Ta.

483
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,320
I’ll be back.

484
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,000
Where have you been?
You weren’t helping me.

485
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,000
Oh, how did you come together?

486
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,680
What trouble did you get into?

487
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,620
You already looked rough when you left.

488
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,760
You look even worse now.

489
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,480
You think I got into trouble?

490
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,960
You know what I had to face today?

491
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,160
Why are you so mean?

492
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,520
Wawa.

493
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,520
I’ll help you with that.

494
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,000
Oh, Prapai.

495
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,200
Can you help me with the other one?

496
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,360
I’ll do it. Don’t force yourself.

497
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,200
You’ll be in other people’s way.

498
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,480
Everyone.

499
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,720
Red lights and no brakes.

500
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,600
Why?

501
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,280
Let’s come together, and cheers.

502
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,640
Let’s play a game.

503
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,640
Yeah, come on.

504
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,440
This game is called

505
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,800
Guess the Name of a City

506
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,840
that Ends With “-buri”.

507
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,440
That’s so easy.

508
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,000
I’m a little dumb here.

509
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,840
Petchburi.

510
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,840
Saraburi.

511
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,880
Nonthaburi.

512
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,880
Chantaburi.

513
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,880
Petchburi.

514
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,880
- Already said that.
- Repeat.

515
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,080
You’ve got to down that glass.

516
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,720
All of it?

517
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,560
All of it.

518
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,640
Bottom’s up.

519
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,680
Quickly.

520
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,920
- I’m up for it.
- Good job.

521
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,640
Your arm...

522
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
It’s fine.

523
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,200
I’m sorry.

524
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,520
You’ve said sorry to me
too many times today.

525
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Thank you.

526
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,080
Look at this, for your graduation trip.

527
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,080
Ken’s prepared for it already.

528
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,680
Tum, you’re sneaky.

529
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,440
It’s nothing.

530
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,520
You two can come too.

531
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,520
- Sure.
- No, thanks.

532
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,880
It’s a graduation trip for the club.

533
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,960
The juniors set it up for us.
It’s going to be only us.

534
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,360
It’s just for fun. Come with us.

535
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,440
Come on.

536
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,040
We’re going to the beach.

537
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,040
Yeah, it’s going to be fun.

538
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,600
If the girls are going,
you’re all welcome.

539
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,400
Great job.

540
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,000
Come on, Pai,
let’s go have fun together.

541
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Please, come with us.

542
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,440
So Pai is...

543
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,120
Shouldn’t go.

544
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,160
This is our club’s activity.

545
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Those who are not involved shouldn’t go.

546
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,240
(Special scene)

547
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,640
I’m still hurt.
You’re going to let me carry that?

548
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,240
You’re crazy.

549
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,760
Take back your bag.

550
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,360
Never mind, you can use it for now.

551
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,240
I don’t need it anymore.
