30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,160
Prapai and Time
have nothing between them.

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,320
Because her boyfriend is right here.

32
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,840
I’m sorry

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,280
for letting you fight alone for so long.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,860
I have proof to show

35
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,600
who is the real director of the film.

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,640
You’re here just in time.

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,560
Please help out.

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,280
Sure.

39
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,200
Pupaa, I saw an announcement today.

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,000
They said the topic is about
the memory of love.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,280
So I’m thinking of competing.

42
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:06,680
I don’t want any prize,
I just want it to be our story.

43
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,280
Don’t worry.

44
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,120
I’m here now.

45
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,760
I would like to tell you again

46
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,800
that Time and Prapai
have nothing between them.

47
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,320
Because I’m Prapai’s boyfriend.

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,000
Time just wanted to help
reveal the truth.

49
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,920
Let’s just say Prapai helped the company
and I created this work.

50
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,160
It must be the company’s work.

51
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,320
I submitted under the company’s name.

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,680
And what’s the problem with that?

53
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,600
First of all,

54
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,080
according to the footage

55
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,680
you weren’t the one who started it.

56
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,600
It was Prapai.

57
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,400
You stole her work.

58
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,200
Second of all,

59
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,360
you said this is the company’s work.

60
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,280
This is also another evidence.

61
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,920
Pupaa.

62
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,800
I was thinking of
going to talk with Wawa.

63
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,880
I think she’ll be great
with playing as me.

64
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,680
Pai, how’s your project going?

65
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
Well,

66
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,200
I’m in the process of
looking for the actors.

67
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,460
But I’ve only got time
after work to do so,

68
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,840
so I’m not rushing it.

69
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,920
Will you be in time to submit it?

70
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,640
Let me know if you want time off.

71
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,600
I don’t want to disturb working hours.

72
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,840
I planned to film it next week.

73
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,880
It should be in time.

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,200
I’m so excited.

75
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,660
This is the first time

76
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,000
that I’ve worked on anything to compete
in something like this.

77
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,280
This is what I want everybody to know.

78
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,280
I’ve tried
calculating the possibilities.

79
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,360
If we really decided to sue,

80
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,300
these evidence wouldn’t be enough

81
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,000
to accuse the company.

82
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,260
Because the company’s lawyers

83
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,960
would also have to fight hard.

84
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,080
But I want everyone to know,

85
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,560
and decide for yourselves,

86
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,680
whether this work

87
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,720
should belong to who.

88
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,880
Everyone.

89
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,640
No matter who did it,

90
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,920
it is done by
one of C Agency’s employees.

91
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,840
We’ve got many talented employees.

92
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,200
Prapai is someone who has a dream.

93
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,940
And the dream that made her successful

94
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,360
all came from learning with C Agency.

95
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,620
Thank you so much, C Agency,

96
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,720
for making me see
both sides of the world.

97
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,800
This work represents
the story of my love.

98
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,960
That’s why I wanted a name in it.

99
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,520
And that all my friends helped me,

100
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,520
they were all willing to help,
without anything in return.

101
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,440
I want to announce right here.

102
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,380
From now on,

103
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,280
I’m not an employee of C Agency anymore.

104
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,680
I quit.

105
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,240
Miss Faye, what is going on?

106
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,080
What is the truth?

107
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,640
Yeah, What’s the truth?

108
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,680
Please answer.

109
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,080
Is it really Prapai’s,
and not from the company?

110
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,120
- What happened? What’s going on?
- What’s happening?

111
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,400
Can you please answer?

112
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Please explain to us.

113
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,160
I guess that’s the real superhero.

114
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,240
- Please give us an answer.
- Please answer.

115
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,160
I finally quit.

116
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,680
It’s best you came out
from a place like that.

117
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,040
I never thought
someone I knew for many years

118
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,000
would do this to me.

119
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,160
What am I going to do next?

120
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,280
You don’t have to think about it now.

121
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,200
Just take some rest.

122
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,480
It’ll be better tomorrow.

123
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Isn’t it strange?

124
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,560
Every time I have a problem,

125
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,760
you’re always here to help me in time.

126
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,400
I missed you so much.

127
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,200
Thank you for coming back.

128
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,360
I missed you too.

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,360
Oh yeah.

130
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,960
I have somewhere
I want you to go with me.

131
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,160
Oh.

132
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Pupaa.

133
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,120
Why are you hiding there? Come here.

134
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,000
Quickly.

135
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,920
Quick.

136
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,160
What did you wish for?

137
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,480
I wished for you to come back to me.

138
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,920
And here you are.

139
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,000
Come here quickly.

140
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,640
You’re the one who wished for it.

141
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,420
You should be dancing alone.

142
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,800
Why do I have to dance with you?

143
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,120
Oh.

144
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,500
I thought you said whatever I do,
wherever I go,

145
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,680
we’ll do so together.

146
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,520
Wait, hold on.

147
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,300
Are you really going to let me
dance alone?

148
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,600
Dance with me, please.

149
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,160
Pretty please.

150
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,680
Hey.

151
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,240
You don’t love me, do you?

152
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,440
Hey.

153
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,400
But

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,240
I don’t know how to dance.

155
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,360
Never mind, we can follow them.

156
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,320
Come on. Come, come.

157
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,400
Right here.

158
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,880
Excuse, we’re ready now.

159
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,480
You’re ready, right?

160
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,000
Yes.

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,720
Then let’s start.

162
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,520
Sure.

163
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,840
So

164
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,960
how did you know about my problem?

165
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,880
Did Ta tell you?

166
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Oh, Ta, I told you not to tell.

167
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,560
I need to punish him.

168
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,680
Ta didn’t tell me.

169
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,760
You’re the one who told me.

170
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,480
Me?

171
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,800
When did I tell you?

172
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,320
When you told Ta not to tell me.

173
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,600
Ta is so sneaky.

174
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,960
Why didn’t you tell me about it?

175
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,960
Aren’t we dating?

176
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,400
Next time whenever there’s a problem,
you have to tell me everything, alright?

177
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,480
I know.

178
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,840
During that time
you had your own problems.

179
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,680
So I didn’t want to bother you
with mine.

180
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,040
Well, how did yours go?

181
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,720
All done.

182
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,560
Huh?

183
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,760
All done?

184
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,480
I thought you said it would take a year.

185
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,640
Someone like me doesn’t need a year.

186
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,160
Of course, genius.

187
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,680
So what are you going to do next?

188
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,640
Hold on.

189
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,200
Hello. This is Prapai.

190
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,680
Yes.

191
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,840
Yes, I’m a creative worker.

192
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,880
But I’m not working for
C Agency anymore.

193
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Really?

194
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,840
Sure. See you tomorrow.

195
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,440
Goodbye.

196
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,680
Pupaa, someone contacted me for work.

197
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,840
They said they wanted to do
an advertisement.

198
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,720
But they don’t want to work
with an agency.

199
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,600
So they wanted me to work with them.

200
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,840
If I get this job,
I’ll take care of you.

201
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,960
(EGAT Learning Center)

202
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,380
(Welcome)

203
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,880
Hello.

204
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,240
I’m here.

205
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,240
The meeting room?

206
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,320
Sure, I’ll be right there.

207
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,160
Yes. Goodbye.

208
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,120
Let’s go.

209
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,800
So in summary,

210
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,660
EGAT Learning Center

211
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,320
wants to promote to everyone
about energy

212
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,380
and the process of electricity

213
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,080
to the community and the environment.

214
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,700
And emphasize EGAT’s reputation

215
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,920
to the nationwide level, right?

216
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,720
Yes.

217
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,760
I feel like I’m
one of the target consumers here too.

218
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,740
Yes.

219
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,040
If you have any questions,
you can always ask me.

220
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,160
Sure.

221
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,960
I’ll have a look around the place
and see what we can bring out.

222
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,280
Then I’ll propose the idea to you soon.

223
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,620
That’s great.

224
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,760
Our leader here will be personally
showing you around.

225
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,240
He’s new and just joined our team.
He’s very dedicated.

226
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,280
And he wanted to deal with the project
by himself.

227
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,120
Oh, here he is.

228
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
- Ken.
- Ken.

229
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,680
Hello.

230
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,800
After you went to China,

231
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,840
Professor recommended me
to someone from here.

232
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,140
I thought it was a stable job
and also interesting,

233
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,160
so I gave it a try.

234
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,400
That’s great.

235
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,480
You’re also a leader.
That’s so cool, right, Pupaa?

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,920
Nah, you’re overreacting.

237
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,080
I still need to learn a lot more.

238
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,800
And I also have to know
a broader range of knowledge.

239
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,320
The higher the position,
the higher the expectations.

240
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,120
So I have to do everything on my own.

241
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,800
So what’s interesting here?

242
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,000
You want to know, right?

243
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,320
Follow me, I’ll take you around.

244
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,240
Let’s go.

245
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,080
Pupaa, let’s go.

246
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,840
Let’s go.

247
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,960
There’s a lot more.

248
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,680
Really?

249
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,400
Hey, Pupaa.

250
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,320
What’s wrong with Prapai?

251
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,280
Hey, Pupaa.

252
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,480
Pupaa, let’s go.

253
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,440
Leave her alone.

254
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,400
Let’s go over there.

255
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,520
Let’s go.

256
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,120
Pupaa.

257
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,000
Look at this, a hologram.

258
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,960
It’s great.

259
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,400
Just like what you did.

260
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,400
Um.

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,520
Let’s go look at something else.

262
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,280
Wow.

263
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,680
I want to take you to see something.

264
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,480
- Hey.
- Alright, let’s go.

265
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
Pupaa, look at this. It’s so scary.

266
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,760
- Pupaa, look. Pupaa?
- Come on.

267
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,520
Pupaa.

268
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,640
The only thing I can never win
for Pupaa

269
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,560
is science, I guess.

270
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,280
Hey.

271
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,120
Go follow her, what’s wrong?

272
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Prapai.

273
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,000
Prapai, hold on. Prapai.

274
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,600
What’s wrong with you?

275
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,160
Aren’t you having fun?

276
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,360
I don’t understand anything.

277
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,600
It must be too hard for someone like me.

278
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,360
It’s not that hard.

279
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,640
Have a look at this.

280
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,280
♪Where is true happiness♪

281
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,360
♪In the far away sea♪

282
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,000

♪Please tell me, tell me♪

284
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,600
So you’re not with Tum anymore?

285
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,080
Um. Tum got a job at the amusement park.

286
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,480
Um.

287
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,200
It suits him well.

288
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,480
Wait.

289
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,440
Hold on.

290
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,840
Isn’t he a scientist?

291
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,200
Why do scientists
work in the amusement park?

292
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,320
So you don’t know
that Tum is crazy about machines.

293
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,840
And now the amusement park
is not the same anymore.

294
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,020
All the new rides

295
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,000
need physicians to help design and plan.

296
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I also heard Tum is going
on a business trip overseas too.

297
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,720
At big amusement parks.
I’m so jealous of him.

298
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,720
Wow. That’s great, right?

299
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,100
Oh yeah.

300
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,040
What about you research?
The one Professor said it’s great...

301
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,400
Do you want to go back now?

302
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,200
Huh?

303
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,600
Why do you want to go now?

304
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,920
Ken must be busy.

305
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,560
Oh, right.

306
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,160
I’ll go now.

307
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,880
Okay.

308
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,520
Let’s go.

309
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,360
Good luck.

310
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,080
Bye then.

311
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,200
- Bye.
- See you.

312
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
Do you want me to see you off?

313
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,360
It’s alright.

314
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,200
Bye.

315
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,960
Just a minute.

316
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,960
Hello.

317
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,440
Pupaa,

318
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,560
I want you to think about it again.

319
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,520
You’ll still make it
if you come back now.

320
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,040
I’ve made my mind.

321
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,080
And you’ll regret it later.

322
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,120
I won’t.

323
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,800
I have to go now.

324
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,120
Who were you talking to?

325
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,000
Is it about the research?

326
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,240
Nothing. Let’s go back.

327
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,960
Let’s go.

328
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,320
Oh.

329
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,760
You have a guest?

330
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,320
Yes, I do.

331
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,880
Very much like me.

332
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,240
Do you remember Prapai?

333
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,160
Hello.

334
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,680
Oh.

335
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
What are you doing here?

336
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,600
I wanted to become one of your students.

337
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,720
No, no. I don’t want this.

338
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
Honey, please help.

339
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,560
Think of it as tutoring a student
enrolling into a university.

340
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,200
But you...

341
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,040
I don’t need to be extra clever,

342
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,720
I just want to be able to talk
with Pupaa.

343
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,280
That’s the difficult part.

344
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,560
We’re going to learn something important
about the galaxy,

345
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,080
about our Earth.

346
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,660
And those people who have been

347
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,600
creating these new theories.

348
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,080
The three rules of Newton.

349
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,480
If I had to guess,
I think it’s about ice, right?

350
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,000
That’s not it.

351
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,880
Newton experimented on energy.

352
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,760
He was the one who discovered gravity.

353
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,880
He was sitting under a tree,

354
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,400
and an apple fell on his head.

355
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,600
It made him realize...

356
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,720
It’s so delicious.

357
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,880
Let’s talk about this one.

358
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,120
The closets planet to the sun.

359
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,600
The first is called the Mercury.

360
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,880
The next one is Venus.

361
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,400
That means our Earth is...

362
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,840
What are you laughing at?

363
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,520
Oh.

364
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,580
Talking about it, it made me think about

365
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,000
the cartoon Sailor Moon.

366
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,240
Have you heard of it?

367
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,320
Transform.

368
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,720
I can’t stop but laughing at it.

369
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,400
I can’t do this anymore.
I’ll have to excuse myself.

370
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,120
Oh.

371
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,680
How about this?

372
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,560
I’ll talk about prism
and the refraction of light.

373
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,800
Oh.

374
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,080
It’s the refraction of white light,

375
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,840
refracting into a rainbow.

376
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,320
It’s called a spectrum.

377
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,040
Seems like you have some knowledge
about this topic.

378
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,720
Just a bit.

379
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,840
Hello.

380
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,320
Prapai.

381
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
It’s time to come home.

382
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,440
Well.

383
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,240
I know you’re at Professor’s house.

384
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,480
Here, let me speak to him.

385
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,320
Pupaa.

386
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,800
I’m sorry she’s been disturbing you.

387
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,640
It’s alright.

388
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,440
Oh.

389
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,520
About the project in China...

390
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,200
Everything is completed.
There’s nothing left.

391
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,240
I’ll go meet you at the laboratory
sometime.

392
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,600
Um.

393
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,760
Thank you.

394
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,120
Here, water.

395
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Thank you.

396
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,360
Oh.

397
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,120
Are you going already?

398
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,200
Oh.

399
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,440
Yes. He knows.

400
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,560
I’ll have to excuse myself.
Goodbye, bye.

401
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,340
Um. From the looks of it,

402
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,960
he hasn’t told her
about the scholarship.

403
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,860
It’s so hard to understand
the love between kids these days.

404
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,760
Isn’t it?

405
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,520
But in the end,
Prapai will have to know anyway, right?

406
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,000
I don’t even want to think about it
when she figures out.

407
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,800
Oh.

408
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Using my brains drains me so bad.

409
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,560
Come here.

410
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,960
I told you already

411
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,840
that you don’t have to know
about science.

412
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,040
Just be yourself
and do what you do best.

413
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,940
Well, recently,

414
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,840
whenever I ask you about the research,

415
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,960
you never talk to me about it.

416
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,840
I just want to be someone
you can tell anything to.

417
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,200
There’s nothing.

418
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,760
Don’t worry about it.

419
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,320
I’m just tired from working
on the research for so long.

420
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,000
So I just wanted to stop thinking
about it.

421
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,460
Then you can go to bed.

422
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,880
They say sleeping is the best way
to relax your brain.

423
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,920
You should be sleeping a lot.

424
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,960
I’m really relaxing my brain.

425
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,480
I haven’t heard this kind of melody
for a while now.

426
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,880
It’s lovely. New song?

427
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,800
What’s up?

428
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,320
I think it’s time to go.

429
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,640
Or we’ll be stuck in traffic.

430
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
Where do we have to go?

431
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,620
Oh, you forgot?

432
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,200
We’ve got an amusement park to review.

433
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,800
Stand up now.

434
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,120
Oh.

435
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,440
Okay.

436
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Follow me.

437
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,420
We’re done with today’s review.

438
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,880
Don’t forget to come and have some fun.

439
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,600
That’s great.

440
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
Time, great job.

441
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,440
That should do, right?

442
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,360
Sure.

443
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,660
Great.

444
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,160
You can have a look
at the footage first.

445
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,840
It’s great.

446
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,840
Hold on.

447
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,280
Will it be okay
if I have a favor to ask?

448
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,320
What is it?

449
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,800
Hey, where is Tum?

450
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,120
He’s the one who made this appointment.

451
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
I don’t like people not being on time.

452
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,460
We’re not in school anymore.

453
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,120
Why is he so irresponsible?

454
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,000
We’re all grown now.
Watch me, when he comes,

455
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,560
I’m going to embarrass him.

456
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,440
I really don’t like it
when people are irresponsible.

457
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,280
Oh, there he is. He’s there.

458
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,680
Go on, Ken, you can do it.

459
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,080
Watch me, watch me.

460
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,040
I’m here.

461
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,840
Hey, why are you late?

462
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,240
I was stuck in traffic. Sorry.

463
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,040
Oh.

464
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,680
I said just do it.

465
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,760
Just do it like what you just said.

466
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,200
- You want me to do it?
- Yeah.

467
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,000
Hey.

468
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,160
Don’t be late again.

469
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Um.

470
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,720
Good.

471
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,560
What’s wrong with him?

472
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
Never mind.

473
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,480
What happened?

474
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,800
He’s just late. Never mind.

475
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,560
I think you should find a way
to win her heart

476
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,040
before Time makes a move.

477
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,840
For example, practice some singing
and playing the guitar.

478
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,040
I don’t know how to sing.

479
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,120
Don’t worry.

480
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,560
Professor Ta will teach you.

481
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,000
Great.

482
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,160
1, 3, 2. Not this 2.

483
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,280
2, 2, this finger here.

484
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,440
Um.

485
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,520
Try again.

486
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,080
Strum it slowly.

487
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,560
I never knew
being a musician is this hard.

488
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,360
Can you do it?

489
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,560
Or you’re starting to understand
your competitor?

490
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,440
I didn’t want to understand.

491
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,440
I’m doing it for Pai.

492
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,000
You can take the guitar and practice.

493
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,160
I’ll be going back to Chiang Mai,
and I won’t be using it.

494
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,560
Hey,

495
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,760
what do you think I should do
about Wawa?

496
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,320
You’ll have to ask yourself.

497
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,840
What makes you happy?

498
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,580
For me,

499
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,440
long distance relationship
really doesn’t work out.

500
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,120
You can do it.

501
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,720
Um.

502
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,440
What are you doing?

503
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
Did you need anything?

504
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,200
I thought I heard a guitar.

505
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,760
Oh, I was listening to music.

506
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,400
Really?

507
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,440
Um.

508
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,280
Huh?

509
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,280
What’s up?

510
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,640
Huh?

511
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,080
Nothing.

512
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,960
Um.

513
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,840
Okay, bye.

514
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,640
So this is all I’ve got.

515
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,280
If you want any changes,
please let me know.

516
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,040
It seems alright.

517
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,080
Did you want to edit any details?

518
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,920
Um.

519
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,520
I don’t think so.
Prapai has her own proofreader.

520
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,640
I’ll continue with coordinating
the work.

521
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,240
I’ll have to excuse myself too, Prapai.

522
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,440
Ken.

523
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,120
Huh?

524
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,000
Just a minute.

525
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,360
Well,

526
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,360
Pupaa’s been acting strange lately.

527
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,560
Do you know anything?

528
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,320
Um.

529
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
I don’t know.

530
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Tell me right now. What do you know?

531
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,520
I really don’t know.
Your phone’s ringing, Prapai.

532
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,600
I have to go now.

533
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,320
Oh.

534
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,800
Ken.

535
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,880
This guy.

536
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,280
What’s up, Mr. Idol?

537
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,960
Can you come to see me?

538
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,320
Huh?

539
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,720
Why do I have to go see you?

540
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,160
I’m not working for C Agency anymore.

541
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,480
I’m not your servant anymore.

542
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,800
I have a client
who wants to do some advertising.

543
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,760
So I thought I’d introduce them to you.

544
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,920
Do you want it?

545
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,840
Can I trust you?

546
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,000
You’ve tricked me so many times.

547
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,120
I’m not stupid anymore.

548
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,120
If you don’t want it, then that’s fine.

549
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,880
Hey.

550
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,080
Where do I go?

551
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,720
Amusement park. Tonight. 7:00 PM.

552
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,680
What?

553
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:42,560
(Siam Amazing Park)

554
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,440
Am I being played on again?

555
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,800
Hey.

556
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,000
I thought you said
you’re meeting me for work.

557
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,240
What are you going to do to me again?

558
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,960
I’m not going to trick you.

559
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,080
I have something for you.

560
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,360
Please, can you just listen to me?

561
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,280
I’m for real this time.

562
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,040
I wrote a song.

563
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,000
I want you to be the first to hear it.

564
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,640
Because if I hadn’t met you,

565
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,160
there wouldn’t have been this song.

566
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,600

581
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,680
When will Pupaa be signaling us?

582
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,800
Or did we miss it?

583
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,280
Um, maybe.

584
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,000
I really like you.

585
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,960
Can you like me?

586
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,080
Oh.

587
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,800
Pupaa.

588
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,320
What are you doing here?

589
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,160
I’m here to take you home.

590
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,160
Hey.

591
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,200
Were you always here?

592
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,080
Even though you saw me
confess my love to Prapai.

593
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,680
And you didn’t even come over to stop?

594
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,240
When I listened to your song,

595
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,080
I just feel that everyone has the right
to confess their love.

596
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,920
And I want Prapai

597
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,080
to have the right
to choose the love she deserves.

598
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,640
Time.

599
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,000
The song you just sang was beautiful.

600
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,720
I’m sure your fans will love it.

601
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,040
It’s...

602
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,160
It’s not my song.

603
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,880
But it will be the song
for everyone that loves you.

604
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,960
Hey.

605
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,580
How can you reject the dream

606
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,800
of all the girls in the country?

607
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,120
You’re such a

608
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,000
weird girl.

609
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,840
I guess so.

610
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,660
Weird girls like me

611
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,040
don’t suit a nationwide superstar
like you.

612
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,440
But

613
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,880
I thank you for the good feelings
you have for me.

614
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,800
But

615
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,840
my heart

616
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,500
has been used by a scientist

617
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,160
in solving all the equations already.

618
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,960
Even though I failed
with confessing my love this time,

619
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,320
I wish the best for you.

620
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,520
Um.

621
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,200
Thank you.

622
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,720
Um.

623
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,320
Can I hug you?

624
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,640
To our friendship.

625
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,880
Thank you so much.

626
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,000
Um.

627
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,440
What were you talking about for so long?

628
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,320
I told him

629
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,240
that the song he sang today

630
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,880
was very touching.

631
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,440
But

632
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,600
I don’t like singers.

633
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,440
I like scientists.

634
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,720
(Coupon)

635
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,480
Hey.

636
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,440
Hey. It’s time.

637
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
It’s show time.

638
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,480
You also have a surprise for me?

639
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,560
What if

640
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,640
I chose Time and didn’t choose you?

641
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,760
What would you do?

642
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,200
I knew you’d choose me.

643
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,560
You know too much.

644
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,760
Congratulations.

645
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,240
As you both already have a happy ending.

646
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,720
I have a favor to ask.

647
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,520
I’ll have fried pork skin,
northern chili paste and chili dip.

648
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,520
Pai.

649
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,040
Thank you.

650
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,440
Wawa.

651
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,680
Wait, hold on.

652
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,840
I thought it was only you and Pupaa.

653
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,720
Well,

654
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,520
come sit down with us first.

655
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,360
Ta won’t go to Chiang Mai.

656
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,560
He wants to stay here.

657
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,680
Are you okay with this, Wawa?

658
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,520
Ta wants to stay, but his dad doesn’t.

659
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,320
My dad doesn’t want me to stay
and so what?

660
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,280
It’s not about me.

661
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,160
Stop acting like a kid.

662
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,600
Your dad built this business

663
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,160
and you should go back and help him.

664
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,480
I don’t want to work
for my dad’s business.

665
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,600
I want to build my own business.

666
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,800
Your own business?

667
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,940
Everything you’re and using right now

668
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,760
is all from your family’s money.

669
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,120
If you stay with me,

670
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,840
I believe I can do it.

671
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,880
Please, Wawa, don’t leave me.

672
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,280
I’ll tell you something, Ta.

673
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,720
I never said that we’re back together.

674
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,360
And especially with a kid like you,

675
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,880
I’m not with you.

676
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,520
Is this

677
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,240
how you see me?

678
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,600
Yes.

679
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,280
Wait, hold on, Wawa.

680
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,760
Hey.

681
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,760
What are you thinking?

682
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,640
If you were Ta, what would you do?

683
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,960
I would stay in Bangkok.

684
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,920
We can work anywhere.

685
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,840
But we can’t find love anywhere.

686
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,480
If there’s success,

687
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,280
but with no one by your side,

688
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,680
it won’t mean a thing.

689
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,080
But if you don’t go back,

690
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,200
it means you’ve cut the relationship
with your family.

691
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,080
What would you do?

692
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,280
I would make them understand.

693
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,880
But if they don’t understand,

694
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,440
I will still choose love over anything.

695
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,600
I believe, one day, they’ll understand.

696
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,240
What if you were Wawa?

697
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,480
What would you do?

698
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,800
I would probably want to be
with the one I love.

699
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,600
But

700
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,320
I don’t want to be a burden in his life.

701
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,560
Ow.

702
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,160
Why is this so difficult?

703
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,560
I’ll go to the restroom first.

704
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,400
Um.

705
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,240
(Kwang)

706
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,480
Hello?

707
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,800
Do you have anything with Pupaa?

708
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,280
Is that Prapai?

709
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,600
Um.

710
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,920
It’s good that it’s you.

711
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,380
I want to ask you

712
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,800
the fact that you made Pupaa
leave his future like this,

713
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,120
are you really going to be happy?

714
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,920
(Special scene)

715
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,560
Hello, Professor.

716
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,520
Pupaa, your girlfriend is at my house
right now.

717
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,840
She’s trying
to let me teach her science.

718
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,080
But she has no foundation.

719
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,880
My head is exploding.

720
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,240
There’s one thing she might know.

721
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,240
What is it?

722
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,120
Prism and light refraction.

723
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,360
And I’ll try to get her home.

724
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,200
Um.
