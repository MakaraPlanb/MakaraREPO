30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,000
Mr. Pupaa, you’re back home.

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,320
Don’t worry. I will do it for you.

32
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,160
Here you go.

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,120
You’ve been tired from work.
Do you want to take a seat?

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,040
Come on, come sit down.

35
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,960
Just sit down here,
so you can get comfortable.

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,360
Just wait a moment.

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,680
I’m coming.

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,400
Here’s some cold water.

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,760
Have a sip so you can feel fresh.

40
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,280
I’m not thirsty.

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,720
Even if you’re not thirsty,
you have to drink it.

42
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,960
You’ve been hot outside,

43
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,680
have a sip. You’ll be dehydrated.

44
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,400
Good job. I’ll give you a massage.

45
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,360
Here you go. Does it feel good?

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,560
What’s wrong with you today?

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,920
What’s happening?

48
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,640
Nothing.
I just wanted to be a good roommate.

49
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,240
What do you want? Tell me.

50
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,560
Well, right now I’m unemployed,

51
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,320
and I don’t have any cash.

52
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,440
So I’m going to do all the chores
instead of paying rent.

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,680
Pupaa, please, I beg you.
Don’t kick me out, please.

54
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,080
I really have nowhere to go.

55
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,720
I’ll do everything for you.

56
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,880
Including sweeping the floor, mopping,
washing the dishes and laundry too.

57
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,840
I’ll do your underwear too.

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,720
What did you say?

59
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,840
See, here. You don’t have to feel bad.

60
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,680
I’ve washed
my brother’s underwear before.

61
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,240
Don’t mess with me. Stop right there.

62
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,960
No.

63
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,920
I won’t give it to you, unless
you promise me you won’t kick me out.

64
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,760
- Give it to me.
- No.

65
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,160
I’m not giving it to you.

66
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,440
You must be responsible for this.

67
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,420
(BOTTEGA VENETA)

68
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,600
I never said
I was going to kick you out.

69
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,200
Always thinking things yourself.

70
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,920
Tookta made me scared.

71
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,480
You’re the one who wants to go.

72
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,720
So you’re saying you want me to stay?

73
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,500
Anyway,

74
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,440
you’ve got to stay to pay for the sofa.

75
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,480
You can’t go anywhere yet.

76
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,160
So stingy.

77
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,320
You know I’m unemployed.

78
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,160
Hey you, I’m already hungry.
Do you want to go get something to eat?

79
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,720
What should we eat?

80
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,520
It’s so so.

81
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,760
How about some milk tea?

82
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,560
Milk tea? Sure. I’ll go buy it for you.

83
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,280
Okay.

84
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,600
You can continue shopping.

85
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,840
If I had the money,

86
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,880
I’d buy everything.

87
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,200
First of all, you need to get a job.

88
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,200
I know.

89
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,440
Is the sofa here already? So fast.

90
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,000
Hello, Prapai, good girl,

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,720
and my best friend Pupaa.

92
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,160
Ta, how did you get here?

93
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,280
Why can’t I be here?

94
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,280
We normally sleep
in the same room anyway.

95
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,080
This room is nice.

96
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,520
I’ll have a look around.

97
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,360
Hey.

98
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,640
Rule number two, no visitors.

99
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,400
You used to tell me Ta is an outsider.

100
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,720
Why are there rules?

101
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,720
Oh, so you guys are staying together?

102
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,640
I thought Prapai was just over
to hang around at your place.

103
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,600
So this is it.

104
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,080
What’s it about this time?

105
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,720
How did you come stay with him?

106
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,640
You asked her over?

107
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,920
Such a friendly person.

108
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,680
But living alone with a guy?

109
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,080
Ta, it’s not like that.

110
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,440
Then how is it?

111
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,120
Explain it to me.

112
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,240
I was the one who asked her to stay.

113
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,040
You think I believe what you just said?

114
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,000
Isn’t it a little too much?

115
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
When I asked you about Pai,

116
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,800
you never told me anything.

117
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,320
Am I still your friend?

118
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,640
If we’re going to talk now,
you’ll be full of emotions.

119
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,280
Let’s wait until you calm down.

120
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,080
I have to use my emotions.
I’m asking you for real,

121
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,280
what are you thinking with Pai?

122
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,880
You like her, right?

123
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,680
So you planned to let her stay here.

124
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,040
And planned not to let me meet her.

125
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,400
How can you do this to a friend?

126
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,060
I told you already, didn’t I?

127
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,960
To keep your distance.

128
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,060
Because I know,

129
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,760
whoever gets close to her

130
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,560
will fall in love with her.

131
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,520
Darn it.

132
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,760
What does it have to be like this?

133
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,000
Darn it.

134
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,380
It’s like karma is after me.

135
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,560
Real bad.

136
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,880
I’m sorry.

137
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,280
I was too angry.

138
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,120
Are you hurt?

139
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Never mind.

140
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,880
According to Newton’s Law,

141
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,000
actions equals reactions.

142
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,640
So we’re equal.

143
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,360
If Prapai has someone caring like you,

144
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,920
I should be happy, right?

145
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,360
Right now, even if she just befriends
with me again,

146
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,560
for me,

147
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,880
it’s more than enough.

148
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,640
Pupaa, what did Ta do to you?

149
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,920
Why does he have to be this harsh?

150
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,000
Such a gangster.

151
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,040
Come on, let’s get you treated.

152
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,840
Someone wants to talk to you.

153
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,120
I don’t know either
how to make you believe what I’m saying.

154
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,560
That I really regret everything.

155
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,500
But if there is anything that I can do

156
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,760
to make you forgive me,

157
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,880
you can tell me.

158
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,840
I’m willing to do everything.

159
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,720
I just want us to be friends again.

160
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,760
I really mean everything, Pai.

161
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,000
You know I can’t be mad
at anyone for long.

162
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,800
But talking about being friends again,

163
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,560
I don’t think I can do it now.

164
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,720
It’s alright. I can wait.

165
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,440
Because for me,

166
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,120
you’re always my best friend.

167
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,560
Nosy. Always on your friend’s side.

168
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,480
And you knew he’d punch you,
why didn’t you move?

169
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,040
You could’ve punched him back.

170
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,080
Do you think you’re the good guy
in the movies?

171
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,920
Why are you quiet?

172
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,440
Why aren’t you talking?

173
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,440
You make me feel...

174
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,440
cold that I’m numb.

175
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,840
Do it yourself then.

176
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,200
Wawa.

177
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,720
Ta, what happened?

178
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,960
I’m sorry.

179
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,280
Where did you go?

180
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,720
Never mind. It’s not your problem.

181
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,880
It’s not my problem?

182
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,560
But I’m your girlfriend.

183
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,800
You left me all alone all day.

184
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,920
And you’re saying it’s not my problem?

185
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,560
Isn’t it too selfish?

186
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,160
Why are you like this?

187
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,920
Do you know you’re a bad boyfriend?

188
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,920
Yes, I’m a bad boyfriend.

189
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,040
I’m bad and why did you want to date me?

190
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,720
Did I force you to like me?

191
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,120
You didn’t force me.

192
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,120
I’m the only one running after you.

193
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,400
If I knew that
it would be this tiring and useless,

194
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,280
I wouldn’t have since the beginning.

195
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,000
Here you go. It’s still hot.

196
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,320
Where did you buy it from?

197
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,920
Don’t you think
I have any cooking skills?

198
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,200
Is putting it in the microwave
called having cooking skills?

199
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,120
You caught me.

200
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,040
Is it good? Can I try?

201
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,160
Go get a new spoon.

202
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
I just want to taste only a little bit.
Can I have some?

203
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,320
You’ll eat all the eggs if I go.
I want to eat the egg too...

204
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,720
Yes, mom?

205
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,720
How did you know?

206
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,480
Ta didn’t tell you?

207
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,000
I should be asking you how you knew?

208
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,480
I already got a job,
as a Professor’s assistant.

209
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,440
I have to get to work now.
Talk to you later.

210
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,400
I’m sorry I made you hide this
from your mom.

211
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,560
I’m not hiding anything.

212
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,480
I just don’t want my mom to bother me
during my research.

213
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,240
Thank you anyway.

214
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,360
Then I better get to work.

215
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,120
Wait a minute, hold on.

216
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,440
What do you need?

217
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,320
Are you really going to go like this?

218
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,280
Wait for me.

219
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,840
What are you doing?

220
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,120
Taking responsible
for being the reason you got this.

221
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,920
Stay still or it won’t look good.

222
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,800
I’m going to work now.

223
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,680
Hold on.

224
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,000
I’m not even done.
Why is he in such a rush?

225
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,040
What are you thinking with Pai?

226
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,120
You like her, don’t you?

227
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,480
(What do I feel?)

228
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,360
They say

229
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,040
love is more complicated than science.

230
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,120
You don’t need to be shy.

231
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,040
Love and teenager always come together.

232
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,760
Back when I was young,

233
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,440
I was everyone’s go-to person
to help out about love.

234
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,160
What do I have to do, Professor?

235
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,800
You have to prove it.

236
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,280
It’s not that difficult.
You can use science.

237
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,200
First of all, observe.

238
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,080
Then make an assumption,
collect all your data.

239
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Analyze your data, and then...

240
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Conclude.

241
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,960
What are you guys talking about?

242
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,080
Sounds like something serious.

243
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,680
About the scholarship, right?

244
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,640
There’s an opening for a
scholarship to do research.

245
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,240
Pupaa, if you’ve decided your
research hypothesis,

246
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,640
then send me the proposal.
I’ll have a look at it for you.

247
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,400
Yes, sir.

248
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,800
Meena, you’re doing your research
for your masters’ degree, right?

249
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,080
You can submit yours as well.

250
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,960
So maybe I can submit
for the scholarship for you.

251
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,880
Sure.

252
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,160
If you understand now,
then go try to figure it out.

253
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,040
Yes, sir.

254
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,160
Oh Tookta.

255
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,280
Hello.

256
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
I have something to disturb you
for a bit.

257
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,600
I have a business seminar to attend
with the diamond team,

258
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,320
so I would like to leave Tintin with you
for a night.

259
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,440
In return to the rent
I’m supposed to get.

260
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,240
But Pupaa said

261
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,720
Pai can stay without paying rent.

262
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,320
Sure. I’m available anyway.

263
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,080
Thank you so much.

264
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,880
I’m sorry I have to bother you.

265
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,920
Tintin has Chinese and Science homework.

266
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,280
I’ll leave you with that.
I have to go now.

267
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,280
I’ll be late for the ride.

268
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,240
I’ll come pick him up tomorrow.

269
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,080
Ahh, ahh...

270
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,600
Goodbye.

271
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,280
Maybe she’s really in a rush.

272
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,480
Come on Tintin,
let’s go watch television.

273
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,280
Yes, put it in there. You’re so good.

274
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,640
What are you doing?

275
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,120
I’m just teaching Tintin homework.

276
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,760
Tookta had an urgent meeting.

277
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,080
So she asked me for help
in babysitting Tintin.

278
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,440
You don’t need to worry.
I’ll take care of Tintin myself.

279
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,960
I won’t let him disturb you.

280
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,600
Let’s see.
Can you read me the last sentence?

281
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
I’m in the house

282
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,040
with dad and mom.

283
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,520
Good job. You’re really good.

284
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,400
Pai, I’m hungry.

285
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,920
Are you hungry?

286
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,880
Pupaa cooks delicious food.

287
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,800
Try asking him to cook for you.

288
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,280
Pupaa, I’m hungry already.

289
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,480
Tintin,
you can go wait on the dining table.

290
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,840
Wow.

291
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,680
You’re awesome.

292
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,440
Tintin, let’s eat.

293
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,600
Let’s have a bite.

294
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,680
Mom.

295
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Dad’s cooking is delicious.

296
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,520
Tintin, why are you calling us that?

297
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,840
I’m practicing my Chinese,

298
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,760
I’m in the house with dad and mom.

299
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,440
I’m in the house with dad and mom.

300
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,760
It’s not like that, Tintin.

301
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,880
Come on. Let’s eat.

302
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,160
I’ll feed you.

303
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,440
Open wide.

304
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,240
Is it good?

305
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,680
Rock, paper, scissors. The other side.

306
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,280
Rock, paper, scissors.

307
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,440
Rock, paper, scissors.

308
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,160
Let me give you a kiss.

309
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,960
Rock, paper, scissors.

310
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,000
I’ll let you kiss me on this side.

311
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,960
Hey, what are you doing?

312
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,560
Assumption number one, getting jealous
when someone gets close to her.

313
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,920
Keep it down.
I can’t concentrate on my studies.

314
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,080
Why are you pissed?

315
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,280
You’ll be frowning like a bulldog.

316
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,680
Come on, Tintin. Let’s go to bed.

317
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So we don’t disturb him.

318
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Hold on.

319
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,240
What now?

320
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,360
You’re a girl.
How can you let a boy into your room?

321
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,080
He’s a kid.

322
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,720
Come on, you come sleep with me.

323
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,960
Are you going to be alright?
You don’t like kids, do you?

324
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,280
But it’s up to you.
Let me know if you need help.

325
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,160
Come on.

326
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,200
Goodnight. Bye.

327
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,520
Mom, I’m hungry.

328
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,040
You can go wash your face
and brush your teeth.

329
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,800
Then we’ll have some sandwich.

330
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,200
What are we going to play today, mom?

331
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,120
What are we going to play today, mom?

332
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,520
Don’t be too noisy.

333
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,080
I need to concentrate on my work.

334
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,120
Then I’ll take Tintin outside.

335
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,600
So we won’t disturb you.

336
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,960
Yay. Go outside.

337
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,800
How can both of you be going alone?

338
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,080
How are you going to
take him to the toilet?

339
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,680
I’ll take him out.

340
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,000
I’m not in a rush with my work anyway.

341
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,000
I’ll go get dressed then.

342
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,020
(ICONSIAM Shopping Center)

343
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Are you hungry?

344
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,280
Cake.

345
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,820
(Coffee Beans by Dao)

346
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,440
Let’s see. Wow, they all look good.

347
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,840
Hey, look at this. Chocolate cake.

348
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,440
Assumption number two,
your heart beats faster when she’s near.

349
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,960
What cake would you like?

350
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,560
We’ll take this one.

351
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,560
This chocolate cake is the best.

352
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,560
Can I have a bite, mom?

353
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Of course.

354
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,240
Come here, open your mouth.

355
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,840
Is it good?

356
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,200
Mom, let dad have a bite.

357
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,920
He doesn’t like this flavor.

358
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,960
It won’t hurt to try, will it?

359
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,280
Excuse me, can I have another fork?

360
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,080
It’s actually really good.

361
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,260
Assumption number three,

362
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,280
she unbelievably changes you.

363
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,040
I’ll go have a look over there.

364
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,200
Dad, can I get a toy?

365
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,880
This one?

366
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,960
It doesn’t seem to help
with your development at this age.

367
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,000
So that means I can get a different one?

368
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,860
Yay.

00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,820

371
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,460

373
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,920
Enjoying it like a kid, hey?

374
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,720
I remember when I was young,

375
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,560
we were trying to catch it.

376
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,440
Have you played it before?

377
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,640
Of course.

378
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,840
But my friend always beats me to it.

379
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,880
But I think soon
we won’t need a book anymore.

380
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,680
It would be floating
right in front of us for sure.

381
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Did you mean a hologram?

382
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,560
Yes, yes. I saw it in a movie before.

383
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,120
If we get to see those
who we’ve lost once again,

384
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,680
even though
if it’s just a virtual image,

385
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,400
I think it will help a lot for those
who are longing.

386
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,080
I got an idea for my research topic.

387
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,040
I will develop hologram
to become more realistic.

388
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,240
Maybe by including more
computer technologies.

389
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,160
It should be a great research topic.

390
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,720
Thanks to you.

391
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,640
I think we should head back.

392
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,880
Tookta should be coming
to pick up Tintin soon.

393
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,480
Where’s Tintin?

394
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,320
Should we split up?

395
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,640
Tintin, Tintin.

396
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,600
Mom, mom.

397
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,760
Oh, this isn’t mom.

398
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,440
Where are mom and dad?

399
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,360
It’s alright. Don’t cry.

400
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,800
Tintin, are you alright?

401
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,520
Why did you go wandering around?
I was worried.

402
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,440
I’m sorry, dad.

403
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,240
Is this your child?

404
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,800
No.

405
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,080
Dad, where’s mom?

406
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,440
Tintin, Tintin.

407
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,360
Where did you go? I was worried sick.

408
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,200
Are you alright?

409
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,960
Are both of you

410
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,240
taking your kid out for a walk?

411
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,240
No. No, we’re not.

412
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,620
Mom and dad, I want to go home now.

413
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,000
Let’s go home.

414
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,320
Okay, let’s go home.

415
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,680
I’ll have to excuse myself.

416
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,320
Me too.

417
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,040
Wait for me.

(BOTTEGA VENETA)

419
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,880
About your senior colleague.

420
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,080
I think she’ll misunderstand.

421
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,440
We just ran out like this.

422
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,560
You should explain to her.

423
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,800
Otherwise, I’ll be the one to blame.

424
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,440
Um.

425
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,960
Even if it was a bit hectic today,

426
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,440
but it was a good day, right?

427
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,480
What’s the difference
between these two images?

428
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,660
Cheese and...

429
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,900
Cheese? You know cheese?

430
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,480
I’ll get it.

431
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,000
What else is there?

432
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,860
Eyes.

433
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,700

434
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,480
Here you go.

435
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,880
What else?

436
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,800
Oh hello, Tookta.

437
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,960
- Hello.
- Come on in.

438
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,340
- Oh Pupaa, both handsome and smart.
- Oh hello, Tookta.

439
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,920
And also loves kids.

440
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,840
He’s so perfect.

441
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,440
Did Tintin cause any trouble?

442
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,360
Oh, not at all.

443
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,120
He was a great kid and very sweet.

444
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,360
Good job, son.

445
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,380
Otherwise,

446
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,040
I wouldn’t dare to disturb them anymore.

447
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,720
Next time,

448
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,440
if you’re busy,
you can drop him off with us.

449
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,000
Thank you.

450
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,160
Here you go.

451
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
I’ll get his shoes for you.

452
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,440
Alright.

453
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,240
Tintin.

454
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,600
Tintin, help me carry this.

455
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,680
- I’ll head out now. Thank you.
- It’s alright.

456
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,240
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

457
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,320
Come on, son,
let’s get back to our room.

458
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,840
Open the door.

459
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,280
- Bye.
- Bye.

460
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,360
Hello.

461
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,720
That’s me.

462
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,920
You’re interested in
being a creative worker, right?

463
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,840
Yes.

464
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,840
Alright. Then tomorrow at 10 a.m.

465
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,880
Come in to talk to me.

466
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,760
Bring your portfolio with you.

467
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,840
I’ll send you the details via e-mail.

468
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,360
Sure. See you tomorrow.

469
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,160
Hey, I got a job.

470
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,800
They called for an interview.

471
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,240
So what do you want to eat today?
My treat.

472
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,520
Anything will do.

473
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,940
Assumption number four,

474
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,000
I can’t not be happy when she is.

475
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,280
Come on, let’s do this, Prapai.

476
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,800
If you said
you didn’t graduate from this area,

477
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,360
your ideas are actually really good.

478
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,920
Thank you.

479
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,600
But you didn’t graduate directly
from this area,

480
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,440
you know you have to start
from zero, right?

481
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,240
Learn everything,

482
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,000
and work harder than others.

483
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,120
Because you don’t have experience.

484
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,160
I’m willing to learn.

485
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
I’m willing to learn everything.

486
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,600
Currently our department is very busy.

487
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,320
We’ll work together through this.

488
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,800
You’re taking me in already?

489
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Um.

490
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,720
Really? Thank you so much.

491
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,560
Thank you for giving me the opportunity.

492
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,560
I’m so excited.

493
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,880
I’m sorry.

494
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,280
I was a little too excited.

495
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,760
Thank you so much.

496
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,760
If you want to thank someone,
you should thank her.

497
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,240
Because she suggested me to contact you.

498
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,880
Thank you, Faye.

499
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,320
It’s alright. Work hard then.

500
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,800
Yes, I’ll do my best.

501
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,780
Yes.

502
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,160
I should invite Pupaa to celebrate.

503
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,000
But if I ask him,
it won’t be a surprise then.

504
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,040
It’s time to show your cooking skills,
Prapai.

505
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,760
Hello, Professor.

506
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,400
Oh Pupaa, hello.

507
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,440
How is that thing going?

508
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,800
I’ve got a topic already.

509
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,400
But I’m still doing more research.

510
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,000
(Digital Holographic Interferometry)

511
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,760
I didn’t mean the research topic.

512
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,320
I meant your love story.

513
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,240
I’m still in the process
of collecting data.

514
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,880
But I’m not sure of the conclusion yet.

515
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,400
You will have to keep collecting data.

516
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,880
Do you need a hand?
It doesn’t look easy.

517
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,600
I don’t think so.
I don’t think it’s that hard.

518
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,840
I’m talking about the research topic.

519
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,760
It looks very complicated.

520
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,680
Sure, I will try looking for one.

521
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,080
Oh, Meena.

522
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,160
Hello.

523
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,400
You’re here.

524
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,240
I just finished talking with Pupaa.

525
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,640
The kid from yesterday looked cute.
Is he your son?

526
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,800
He’s my neighbor’s son.
She asked to babysit him.

527
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,200
Then why were you with Pai yesterday?

528
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,520
Or do you live together?

529
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Pai also knows Tintin,
so we went together.

530
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,460
And,

531
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,360
I’m not quite familiar
with being with kids.

532
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,480
I think you seem to be well with kids.

533
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,400
I don’t see this side of you much.

534
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,080
It looks cute.

535
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,880
I’ll have to excuse myself.

536
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,040
Professor, goodbye.

537
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,160
Alright.

538
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,360
I’ll just have to wait
until it’s cooked.

539
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,960
Cooking isn’t that difficult.

540
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,840
This way, please.

541
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:23,280
Please gather around here.

542
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,640
(Special scene)

543
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,560
Hold on, why is this like this?

544
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,920
This uniform is not good.

545
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,960
Pupaa.

546
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,800
- Yes, Tookta?
- Pai quit her job

547
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,680
and she doesn’t have the money
to pay rent.

548
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,080
Are you okay with that?

549
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,760
But I don’t think I’m okay.

550
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,160
She’s going to stay
without paying for anything at all.

551
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,640
Isn’t she taking too much
advantage from us?

552
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,760
I’m okay with it.

553
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,440
I’ll let her stay with me
without paying yet.

554
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,560
If I’m okay,

555
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,200
then I don’t think
there should be any problem.

556
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,320
The problem is I’m losing my income.

557
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,760
Yay. Pai won’t get kicked out anymore.

558
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,360
I have to go now.
