30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,600
If the wedding is in a church,

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,280
with a blue and white backdrop...

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,600
Prapai, you can’t get married.

33
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,800
Pupaa.

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,720
Have you changed your mind from me?
It’s only been a month.

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,960
Did I miscalculate the time?

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,680
Hold on, calm down first.

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,100
This is the groom-to-be.

38
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,560
But the bride-to-be is not Prapai.

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,560
Hey there, my best friend Pupaa.

40
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,120
Let’s take a seat first.

41
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,840
Just sit down.

42
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,400
I’ll introduce him to everyone.

43
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,840
This is Pupaa, my best friend.

44
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,200
He’s a genius in physics in university.

45
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,280
And once he’s graduated,
he’s about to become a doctor.

46
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,560
And soon he’ll be a professor.

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,120
I’m sorry.
I was very impolite a while ago.

48
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,640
It’s alright.

49
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,280
If anybody thought that their girlfriend
is about to get married,

50
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,600
I’m sure they’ll be mad like this.

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
You can’t help it, can you?
Prapai is very cute.

52
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,960
We broke up already.

53
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,600
I didn’t break up with you.

54
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,600
You broke up by yourself.

55
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,480
Oh.

56
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Pupaa just got here.

57
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,920
Do you want to order anything else?

58
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,120
You guys can enjoy your meal.

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,920
I’ll have to excuse myself. Bye.

60
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,540
Oh.

61
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,240
- Prapai.
- Prapai.

62
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,960
- Wait, wait for me.
- Where are you going?

63
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,880
Prapai.

64
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
I’m really sorry.

65
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
I got to go now, Nuna.

66
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
I’ll see you later.

67
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,400
Pai.

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Pai.

69
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,960
Prapai, hold on.

70
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Why aren’t you back
getting the scholarship in China?

71
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,800
If you’re there,
you’ll have a better future.

72
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,240
You’ve got good people
to help you with work.

73
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,480
And you’ve also got someone
who understands science like you do.

74
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,280
- Prapai.
- Don’t tell me

75
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,960
you gave that scholarship to Kwang?

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,720
What are you trying to do?

77
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,760
I...

78
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,800
Pai. Pai, wait for me.

79
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,200
She’s just the same.

80
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,800
She won’t even listen to me.

81
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,680
So what are you going to do next?

82
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,760
Don’t worry.

83
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,480
I’ve got many back up plans.

84
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,400
Kwang.

85
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,520
When you get to read this letter,

86
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,200
I would probably
be back in Thailand already.

87
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,040
Did you know?

88
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,760
When I met you again,

89
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,840
how happy I was?

90
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,160
I missed when we went everywhere
together,

91
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,960
went out for snacks together.

92
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,080
And I actually know

93
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,320
that you don’t really hate me, right?

94
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,160
After everything I’ve done to you.

95
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,480
When you suddenly moved school,

96
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,400
I had something to give you.

97
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,760
But I didn’t get the chance to do so.

98
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,120
You may think I’m childish,

99
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,640
but Kwang, for me,

100
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,340
no matter what happens,

101
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,320
you will always be my friend.

102
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,160
(Best friends forever)

103
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,640
I hope you’re happy every day.

104
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,600
Prapai.

105
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,200
Hello. What’s up, Ta?

106
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,120
Do you want to talk to Wawa?

107
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,920
No, I need to talk to you about work.

108
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh yeah, what’s up?

109
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,720
There’s a new job.
I sent you an e-mail already.

110
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,800
The client wants

111
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,080
a surprise wedding proposal plan.

112
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,800
He said

113
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,520
just come up with some ideas.
Maybe something that you like.

114
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,280
Sure, I’ll have a think about it.

115
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,160
Um.

116
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,480
- Um.
- I’ll hang up now.

117
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,560
My dream wedding?

118
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,000
Why are you here?

119
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,200
I’m here to buy some stuff.

120
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,200
I didn’t see anyone out front,
so I came in.

121
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,160
Pai.

122
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,360
There’s going to be a guest coming.

123
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,920
Who is it, mom?

124
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,720
My friend’s son.

125
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,280
They’re looking for an accountant.

126
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,040
He should be here soon.

127
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,640
Alright.

128
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,280
Prapai, hello.

129
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,080
Hello.

130
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,360
How are you?

131
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,800
I’m fine.

132
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,880
We met so often when we were young.

133
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,840
We’ve met before?

134
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,640
Yes.

135
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,240
When we were young, we met so often.

136
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,040
- When we were young?
- Yes.

137
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,360
Or...

138
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,680
Excuse me.

139
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,080
Do you have any snacks?

140
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,400
Please excuse me for a moment.

141
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,320
Sure.

142
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,520
Here.

143
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,120
- Sorry, I want one in a box.
- So...

144
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,160
It’s over there. Just take it.

145
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,480
So what are you doing now?

146
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,360
I own a company.

147
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,480
I heard from your mom
that you graduated from accounting.

148
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,600
Yes.

149
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,760
That’s great.

150
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,520
I’m looking for an accountant.

151
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,000
How much are these?

152
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,520
You want this too?

153
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,200
Who are you going to use it with?

154
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,760
This one.

155
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,480
I’m not taking it.

156
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,200
Prapai.

157
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,400
You can help him out first.

158
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,480
We can talk when you’re done.

159
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,040
Sure.

160
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,720
She won’t suit working as an accountant,
being this slow with numbers.

161
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,280
I don’t think so.

162
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,640
I think Prapai can do it.

163
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,000
Prapai, please come work with me.

164
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,320
Soon computers will be replacing
all the accounting tasks.

165
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,640
I think

166
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,760
you should keep working
with your creative job.

167
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,120
Prapai.

168
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,160
When you’re done,
let’s go grab something to eat.

169
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,520
So no one can disturb our conversation.

170
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,440
Sure. I want to talk about
when we were young too.

171
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,040
If you’re going to take her out,

172
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
you should take her
to a pork skewer place.

173
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,960
Because whenever she has
pork skewers and sticky rice,

174
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,760
her eyes will sparkle.

175
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,280
But if you’re taking her for a drink,
take her somewhere there’s iced cocoa.

176
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,120
And if she’s not in a good mood,

177
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,640
make sure to add extra sugar.

178
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,000
Because sugar will make her happy.

179
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,600
Who are you?

180
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,040
Why do you sound so close with Prapai?

181
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,960
I’m her boyfriend.

182
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,840
What?

183
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,720
Oh no.

184
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,840
You’re the reason for making Prapai
come back home?

185
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,360
It’s been over a month.
Why did you just come?

186
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,240
I heard you’re a scientist.

187
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,400
Yes.

188
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,880
I’m

189
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,200
working on a project about hologram.

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,800
Hologram?

191
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,760
And why are you here?

192
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,320
I want to get back together with Prapai.

193
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,360
You want to get back with my daughter?

194
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,080
And you made her this upset? Never.

195
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,920
Just go.

196
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,760
- Prapeng.
- Yes?

197
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,640
Send him off.

198
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,440
Pai.

199
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,680
No wonder why you just came back home.

200
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,880
And since you’ve been back,
you’ve been sad and lonely.

201
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,320
Did you think I don’t know you’re upset?

202
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,960
I’m worried about seeing you like this.

203
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,520
There used to be this kid,
a very good one.

204
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,600
But he moved to somewhere else.

205
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,320
I think Jo isn’t that bad.

206
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,280
But if you don’t like him,
Ta is always a good option.

207
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,720
Mom.

208
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,520
I don’t want to talk to you anymore.

209
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,280
Ow, Prapai.

210
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,120
Pai.

211
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,180
Huh?

212
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,000
Pupaa already made the effort
to come to see you here.

213
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,720
Aren’t you going to give him a chance?

214
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,920
I don’t know.

215
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,040
I can’t just block him from his future.

216
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,920
Forget it. You can sleep first.

217
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,320
I’ll continue with some work.

218
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,340
The client wants

219
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,800
a surprise wedding proposal.

220
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,880
He said

221
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,760
just come up with some ideas.
Maybe something that you like.

222
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Use stars instead of flowers.

223
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,640
Maybe a live band would be nice.

224
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,440
Don’t stress out.

225
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,000
Ta.

226
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,720
- Hey, come in.
- Hello, brother.

227
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,680
Come on in.

228
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,660
Here, Ta,

229
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,560
mom said to drop you off some food.

230
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,280
Wow, let’s see.

231
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,280
Don’t forget this.

232
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,560
Wow.

233
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,480
This is

234
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,280
northern chili paste.

235
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,280
Tell her thank you.

236
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,320
And tell her that
her chili paste is the best.

237
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,320
Because you’re such a sweet mouth,
that’s why she loves you so much.

238
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,120
But

239
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,240
there’s also pork chili paste too?

240
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
I don’t like it.

241
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,920
Oh really?

242
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,960
I saw Pai tell her to bring it too.

243
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,200
What are you smiling at?

244
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,560
It’s not for you.

245
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,320
I bought it only for Ta.

246
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,160
We can share.

247
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,680
No way, Ta.

248
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,360
He’s the one who made Pai sad.

249
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,640
Oh, brother.

250
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,880
You don’t know anything, do you?

251
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,920
Do you want to know the truth?

252
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,540
(Welcome)

253
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,520
I can somehow understand.

254
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,920
I’m really sorry
for my sister’s weird thoughts.

255
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,640
I believe if I had the opportunity
to explain this to your mom,

256
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,640
I’m sure she’ll understand.

257
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Pupaa,

258
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,240
it’s going to be difficult
to explain for her to understand.

259
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,580
But if you want

260
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,160
her to at least listen,

261
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,800
there is a way.

262
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,520
How?

263
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,240
With mom,

264
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
you’ve got to talk about numbers.

265
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,840
Numbers?

266
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,600
He’s back.

267
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,960
Master.

268
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,840
It’s been so hard these days.

269
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,480
Can I have three numbers?

270
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,040
The exact three numbers, please.

271
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,200
Why are you asking for only three?

272
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,960
Just ask for all six.

273
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,160
Master, please give me six numbers.

274
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,880
Two is enough.

275
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,760
If the two numbers are correct,
I’ll take it anyway.

276
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,920
I’ll take two then.

277
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,740
Is it?

278
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,120
Hold on.

279
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,320
God bless.

280
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,000
Here.

281
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,400
Whatever number you want,
just have a look.

282
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,000
Can you see it?

283
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,200
I can see number 1.

284
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,040
Number 1 is here.

285
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,040
Look.

286
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,840
Yes.

287
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,880
There’s 1 and what else?

288
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,040
What number do you think?

289
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,120
Are you here to try your luck too?

290
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,000
No, I’m not. Well,

291
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,580
I just wanted to

292
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,640
study numbers in other ways too.

293
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,080
For additional knowledge.

294
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,880
Really?

295
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,560
So what number do you see?

296
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,680
It depends on the angle
you’re looking from.

297
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,080
If you look from this direction,
it’s a 6.

298
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,680
But if you look from
the other direction, it’s a 9.

299
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,560
So which one is the correct one?

300
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,200
You’re no use.

301
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,500
Hey.

302
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,440
If you’ve got your number,
bring it out.

303
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,600
Here you go.

304
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,240
It’s going to be your day tomorrow.

305
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,960
Don’t think too much.

306
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,040
Just take both numbers.

307
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,840
Auntie, from the statistics
that I’ve calculated,

308
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,200
you should buy the number 19.

309
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,640
Because this number
is very common in the lotto.

310
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,960
Meaning there is a higher possibility
for this number to win.

311
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,480
I was planning to buy this number.
You didn’t have to tell me.

312
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,240
I’ll have 1 ticket of the number 19.

313
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,080
Sure.

314
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,920
Auntie.

315
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,680
You should buy the whole set.

316
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,760
From my calculation,
it may be a higher risk,

317
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,120
but the results will also be high too.

318
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,560
Will it be a good idea?

319
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,200
Sure.

320
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,600
Here, just take it.

321
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,760
Do you want it?

322
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,000
Here you go.

323
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,520
Good luck.

324
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,040
- There’re so many rats around.
- You’re the one eating them.

325
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,960
- All the snacks in your room.
- No.

326
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,640
Hey.

327
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,280
Why

328
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,640
is mom with Pupaa?

329
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,080
Mom, you have to calm down first.

330
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,240
Announcing the two winning numbers.

331
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,600
They are

332
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,520
1,

333
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,880
9.

334
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,480
I won more than 10,000 baht
of the lottery.

335
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,400
You’re the best.

336
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,880
I saw right through you
since the beginning.

337
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,720
Really?

338
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,980
Two days ago,

339
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,040
you said he was the one
who made me upset.

340
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,280
That’s between you two.

341
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,680
That can be a misunderstanding.

342
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,440
But I think Pupaa

343
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,120
isn’t the kind of person
to hurt someone, right?

344
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,520
Yes.

345
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,080
That’s right, Pai.

346
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
You should give him a chance.

347
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,760
Sure. Just go love each other even more.

348
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,520
I’m out.

349
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,200
Oh dear, why is she always like this?

350
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,000
I’m sure she’s going to go to her dad.

351
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
Go on, follow her.

352
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,240
Alright.

353
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,520
I’ll excuse myself now.

354
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,040
Pupaa, get her back.

355
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,040
Oh, mom, you’re fast at changing sides.

356
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,420
I knew since the beginning

357
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,640
that Pupaa really loves Pai.

358
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,880
Hey. Did you think
you’re the only one who knows it?

359
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,840
Tookta.

360
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,600
Hello there, madam.

361
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,560
Has that girl moved out?

362
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,440
Did you mean Prapai?

363
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,600
She moved back to Chiang Mai months ago.

364
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,640
But

365
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,360
Pupaa isn’t here too.

366
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
Where did he go?

367
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,240
From what I heard,

368
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,240
it seems like

369
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,920
he’s gone to

370
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,160
Chiang Mai.

371
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,560
What?

372
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,960
- Hold it up straight.
- Yes.

373
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,840
Otherwise it’ll be wonky.

374
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,880
That’s enough.

375
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,600
(Yi Peng Lanna Festival)

376
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,080
I think it’s straight already, dad.

377
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,080
Why did you follow me again?

378
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,880
What’s happening, dear?

379
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,560
Nothing. Let’s go, dad.

380
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,640
Hello.

381
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,000
I’m here as a volunteer.

382
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,040
I’m driving to announce the festival.
I don’t need a volunteer.

383
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,200
Also

384
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,440
the seats are full.

385
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,600
I can sit at the back of the truck.

386
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,920
Then up to you.

387
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,320
Let’s go, dear.

388
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,600
Sure.

389
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,160
For how long
are you going to make me feel bad

390
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,920
for making you suffer?

391
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,720
Dad, can you drive slower?

392
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,440
I get car sick.

393
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,560
I’ll be sick.

394
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,480
Just please slow down.

395
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,960
Dad.

396
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,920
Greetings, everyone,

397
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,520
it’s going to be the annual
Yi Peng Lanna Festival tomorrow.

398
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,420
I would like to invite everyone

399
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,400
to the festival tomorrow.

400
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,800
Don’t forget to bring
your kids and family.

401
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,120
Here, let me try.

402
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,320
Greetings, everyone.

403
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,880
Hello, please gather around.

404
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,160
Hello.

405
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,320
It’s going to be the annual
Yi Peng Lanna Festival tomorrow.

406
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,600
I would like to invite everyone
to the festival.

407
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,880
For me,

408
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,440
this is the first time
to attend this kind of festival.

409
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,880
I’m really excited.

410
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,060
I think tomorrow

411
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,640
will be a very impressive day.

412
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,280
So I would like to invite everyone,

413
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,080
and all your loved ones,
to come to the festival.

414
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,080
Personally for me,

415
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,280
I’ll go let go of the lantern
with my loved one too.

416
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,120
What are you saying?

417
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,980
Yay.

418
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,420
Hey.

419
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,000
What are you talking about?

420
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,820
Yeah.

421
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,020
(Yi Peng Lanna Festival)

422
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,280
Prapai.

423
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,720
I’ll have to excuse myself.

424
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,200
Please take care of your health.

425
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,920
Goodbye.

426
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,720
Come on, dear,
let’s get inside the house.

427
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,160
Sure.

428
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,040
Dad.

429
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,280
Look, you can see the stars tonight.

430
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,600
That one there is the Cygnus.

431
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,400
And that one over there is the Vega.

432
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,000
You probably learnt a lot
when you were in Bangkok.

433
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,200
Including love too.

434
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,360
I’m your dad.

435
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,480
Why won’t I be able to tell?

436
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,800
I just don’t understand
why you’re pushing him away.

437
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Because

438
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,880
I’ve caused him
to ruin his future many times.

439
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,720
I don’t want to be the reason anymore.

440
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,340
Has your mom ever told you

441
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,040
about our love story?

442
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,000
A million times, dad.

443
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,180
If I had got to find a better chance

444
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,560
at Bangkok,

445
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,320
you wouldn’t be here.

446
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,120
But I think

447
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,720
the fact that I kept trying
with your mom

448
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,440
until we got married

449
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,280
is the bravest decision I’ve ever made.

450
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,320
Prapai.

451
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,240
I want to see you happy.

452
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,280
I want you to trust your partner.

453
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,160
It’s not about what we think.

454
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,800
But sometimes,
you’ve got to trust him too.

455
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,600
Both of you should fight it together.

456
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,120
The future is far ahead,

457
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,200
it’s not even here yet.

458
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,880
You can think of it then.

459
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,880
But if in the future, you’re not happy,

460
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,280
you’ve always got our home.

461
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,240
You little naughty one.

462
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,320
You were in Bangkok for so long,
I missed you every day.

463
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,120
I missed you too.

464
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,740
Wow.

465
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,680
How are we going to find them
with this much people?

466
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,080
Let’s split up.

467
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,000
Um.

468
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,640
I’ve finally found you.

469
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,760
Let’s go float the kratong.
[*water lantern]

470
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,800
Did you know?

471
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,400
The fact that you’re here,

472
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,160
keeps reminding me that
I’m blocking your future.

473
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,560
But I admit

474
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,840
that when I see you,
I feel more confident

475
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,240
that I still love you.

476
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,160
So then I’ve made my decision

477
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,000
that this time,
we’ll solve the problem together.

478
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,560
But I’ve proved to you

479
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,000
that I can be successful
in this career path

480
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,760
by having you with me.

481
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,840
The reason that I can come
to see you in Chiang Mai now,

482
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,160
is because my research project

483
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,640
is a joint project
between Thailand and China.

484
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,480
And we’ve formed a team for both sides
of the project already.

485
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,800
Don’t return this anymore, alright?

486
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,520
If I don’t have you,

487
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,840
I wouldn’t have achieved this.

488
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,640
So don’t run away from me anymore.

489
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,900
Oh.

490
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,620
Look over there.

491
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,480
How about

492
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,440
your mom?

493
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,360
Don’t worry.

494
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
You’ve got me.

495
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,680
How did you get here, Ta?

496
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,920
This is my spot.

497
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,580
When I was a kid, I always ran away

498
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,720
from my mom to be here.

499
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,400
But it’s a surprise seeing you here.

500
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,520
My kratong flipped.

501
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,920
If you want to float it,
then you can do it alone.

502
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,000
Hey, why in such a rush?

503
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,240
Here.

504
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,720
Let’s float it together.

505
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,440
What did you wish for?

506
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,140
I wished for the person next to me

507
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,000
to be with me forever.

508
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
I’ve finished the first job
of the company already.

509
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,560
And the client has already paid.

510
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,920
Here it is, my first proof.

511
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,940
That I’m grown enough

512
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,240
to take care of someone.

513
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,480
I promise I will make our
long distance relationship work,

514
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,000
no matter what happens,

515
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,600
if you’re willing to try with me.

516
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,720
Then

517
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,440
I’ll have to book a ticket
to Chiang Mai every month from now on.

518
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,080
You ready?

519
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,680
Um.

520
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,720
Hey,

521
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,080
what did you wish for?

522
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,440
No one tells a secret like this.

523
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,120
Otherwise it won’t come true.

524
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,760
You didn’t wish anything with God
again, right?

525
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,560
I’m not telling you.

526
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,200
You’re not going to tell me?

527
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,340
Um.

528
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,640
I’m not.

529
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,200
Where has she gone?

530
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,320
Mom.

531
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,800
I’m going to go meet a girl.

532
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,520
Hold on.

533
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,000
Help me find your sister first.

534
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,200
I don’t know where she’s gone.

535
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,800
Oh mom.

536
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,840
Why are you so worried about her?

537
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,040
She’s probably with Pupaa right now.

538
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,640
Just the two of them?

539
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,840
Of course, mom.

540
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,360
Pupaa won’t do anything to her.

541
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,320
Trust me. If he was to do,
he’d probably done it ages ago.

542
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,680
What did you say?

543
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,120
Nothing, I didn’t say anything, mom.

544
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,800
Prapeng, Prapeng.

545
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,880
Oh, well, well...

546
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,080
They’ve been living together
for many months already.

547
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,360
Huh? What did you say?

548
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,120
Calm down, mom.

549
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,440
Well,

550
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,320
these days,

551
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,880
no one really minds anymore.

552
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,840
I should get going.

553
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,360
Hold on, who said I don’t mind?

554
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,680
Your sister is the one
being taken advantage of.

555
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,080
This is not happening.

556
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,200
Mom, what are you doing?
Calm down, mom.

557
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,920
Pupaa.

558
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,280
Mom.

559
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,560
Hello.

560
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,480
Hello.

561
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,600
You really are with my son.

562
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,720
For how long are you
going to block my son’s future?

563
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,800
Mom.

564
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,720
Excuse me.

565
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,520
Come on, calm down first.

566
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,040
- Hello.
- Prapai, where are you?

567
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,080
Mom, I’m busy now.

568
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,200
I’ll call you later.

569
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,320
No, you can’t.

570
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,280
It’s important. We must talk now.

571
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
How could you two be living together?

572
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,680
Pupaa has to be responsible for this.

573
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
Responsible?

574
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,320
Then you’d have to come to talk with me.

575
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,600
I want to ask you too,
what kind of parent are you

576
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,900
for letting your daughter

577
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,920
to be with my son?

578
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,920
How can you say that?

579
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,080
I’ll go see you now.

580
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,520
Come with me.

581
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,800
Are you going straight to them?

582
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,760
Pupaa.

583
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,240
Mom and I want to hear it from you.

584
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,240
Dad, mom.

585
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,200
Right now, I’ve got the project
working together with China already.

586
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,240
It’s a joint project
between both countries.

587
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,120
And this project wouldn’t have happened

588
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,200
if I didn’t have Prapai with me.

589
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,680
Really?

590
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,680
Did she tell you to lie to us?

591
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,600
No.

592
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,000
Who, who was the one
shouting at my daughter?

593
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,720
- Mom, calm down first.
- Calm down, mom.

594
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,680
- Move it.
- Mom.

595
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,600
- She’s talking about your daughter.
- You.

596
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,960
Don’t give up.

597
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,840
What are you saying, Peng?

598
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,400
- Move, Prapai, just move.
- Mom.

599
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,540
- Mom, calm down first, mom.
- Mom.

600
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,480
Mom, please calm down first.

601
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,600
Move.

602
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,120
- Mom.
- Pupaa.

603
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,400
Pond?

604
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,320
Jitra?

605
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,280
Hey.

606
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,640
Jitra.

607
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,880
Jitra.

608
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,520
It’s been so long.

609
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,480
I know.

610
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,160
We haven’t met for so long.

611
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,920
You still look the same.

612
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,440
Still as beautiful as before.

613
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,680
Thank you.

614
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,480
I really didn’t know
that Pupaa is your son.

615
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,400
He’s changed so much
from when he was young.

616
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,400
I know.

617
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,960
Your daughter changed a lot too.

618
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,820
I thought it sounded familiar

619
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,040
when I first heard her name.

620
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,520
How did it come out like this?

621
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,360
Isn’t it good
that it turned out like this?

622
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,320
Finally, everything went well.

623
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,800
Who would’ve known

624
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,240
that the person I’ve been dreaming of
since young would be you?

625
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,880
Does this mean it’s called

626
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,920
“six degrees of separation”, right?

627
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,000
Maybe yes.

628
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,360
Or it can also be called fate.

629
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,000
Ta, where is Pupaa?

630
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,720
Pupaa?

631
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,600
He’s gone back to Bangkok already.

632
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,400
I heard he had something important.

633
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,000
Why did he leave without telling?

634
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,880
How about the client

635
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,320
who wanted the wedding proposal?

636
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,040
He said he really loved your idea.

637
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,680
His girlfriend doesn’t like flowers
like you.

638
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,400
We can talk about the location later.

639
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,200
Sure.

640
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,800
Hello. What’s up, Time?

641
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,880
What do you want?

642
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,560
Don’t be excited.

643
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,200
I’m not calling to flirt with you.

644
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,800
You’re outdated.

645
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,760
I have a fan meeting here tomorrow.

646
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,680
So I just called to invite you.

647
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,120
This client happens to be
a fan of Time.

648
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,560
He wants to go to the fan meeting too.

649
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,960
You can tell me
how many tickets you want.

650
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,400
Just go, for the client.

651
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,520
Just go, go.

652
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,360
Who do you want me to go with?

653
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,320
My boyfriend went back to Bangkok
already.

654
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,360
Right. See you tomorrow.

655
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,440
Hey, didn’t you listen to me?

656
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,480
You never change, do you?

657
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,000
If we have clients,

658
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,160
we’ll have money.

659
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,840
And when we get money,

660
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,200
we’ll be rich.

661
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,320
I should get back to work.

662
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,080
(Valentine’s day)

663
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,720
In the end,

664
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,480
Valentine’s day is still a bad day
for me.

665
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,080
(Time)

666
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,840
Here, I give you one.

667
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,560
Thinking about it, the client is weird.

668
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,440
Making an appointment at a fan meeting?

669
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,840
It’s so romantic.
Valentine’s day fan meeting.

670
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,080
You can say so.

671
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,080
You’re here with Wawa.

672
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,600
Here’s yours.

673
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,480
(Happy Valentines’ Day)

674
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,280
(Happy Valentine’s Day Pupaa)

675
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,000
The concert is about to start.

676
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:21,400
(Time)

677
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,600
This final song

678
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,200
is a very important song.

679
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,180
And it is very meaningful for me.

680
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,800
Tonight,

681
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,960
someone asked me to sing this song

682
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,760

(Outstanding Optical Physics

745
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,920
Sorry.

746
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,360
(Special scene)

747
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,400
We’re going to meet an idol soon.

748
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,120
Do you remember what I taught you?

749
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,320
Yes, I do.

750
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,920
Good job.

751
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,640
Happy birthday, Dr. Gu Weiyi.

752
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,800
Thank you.

753
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,440
Go on, dear.

754
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,520
We should thank you.

755
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,640
If you didn’t give me the chance

756
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,920
to do research with you,

757
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,640
we wouldn’t have Kanit.

758
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,680
Our son was born
on the same day as you.

759
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,480
Really?

760
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,720
Happy birthday, little Kanit.

761
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,240
This is the cake that me and my mom
made for you.

762
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,200
And when I grow up,
I will be a scientist,

763
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,740
so I can become a genius scientist

764
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,360
like you and my dad.

765
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,060
They made this cake together

766
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,680
for you as a gift.

767
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:33,240
He said he will be a scientist
when he grows up.

768
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,640
Hope your wish will come true, Kanit.

769
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,960
Gu Weiyi, come on.

770
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,360
I’ll go celebrate with my family.

771
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,320
Wish you every happiness. Bye.

772
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,920
Bye.

773
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,680
I’ll be right back.

774
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,740
Let’s see what Dr. Gu Weiyi

775
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:06,880
send to you.

776
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,160
What is it?

777
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,160
Have a look.

778
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,360
- Be careful.
- I’ll hold it for you.

779
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,040
- Set it up over there.
- Let’s set it up.

780
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,720
Let’s see how it’s set up.

781
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,760
Oh Kanit, what is this?

782
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,640
- It’s popcorn. Yay.
- Yay.

783
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,920
Let’s go experiment with it.

784
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,880
Let’s go.

785
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,280
- Go on, let’s go.
- Go.

786
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,160
Mom, the popcorn experiment
is a success.

787
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,320
Great.

788
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,280
Mom, I’m going to do more experiments.

789
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,360
Sure.

790
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,840
And here it is,
the warmth to our hearts.

791
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,080
Gu Weiyi, stop sending stuff
for experiments from now on.

792
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,320
Oh, dear Kanit.
