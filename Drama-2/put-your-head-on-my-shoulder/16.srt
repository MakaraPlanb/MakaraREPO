So that means

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,960
Kwang is Pupaa’s first love?

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,400
Right?

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,920
Right?

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,940
Dear customers,

35
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,400
we have a special offer today.

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,040
Couples will enjoy discounts.

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,760
Any couple here?

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,480
Well, here.

39
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,840
Oh, great.

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,160
Please share a fishball together.

41
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,080
We’ll take a Polaroid photo for you.

42
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,120
Then you can enjoy our discount.

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,840
Wow.

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,120
Now it’s your chance.

45
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,960
Which one do you want to choose?

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
This one then.

47
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,120
Eat it. Eat it together.

48
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,880
Eat it, eat it.

49
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,640
Quick, so we can get the discount.

50
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,480
Eat it, eat it.

51
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,800
Get in close. Eat it, eat it.

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,240
Eat it, eat it.

53
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,360
Are you alright?

54
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,440
I’m alright.

55
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,520
I’ll take you to the restroom.

56
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,600
Let me take her.

57
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,400
The restroom is this way, please.

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,600
Thank you.

59
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,960
How did you know Pupaa?

60
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,000
Pupaa is Ta’s roommate.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,880
But we’ve known each other
for only a couple of months.

62
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,960
So you don’t know him that well, right?

63
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,920
Are you Pupaa’s first love?

64
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,320
First loves are hard to forget.

65
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,000
Kwang.

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,360
You’ve changed a lot.

67
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,680
You don’t seem like that person
you used to be.

68
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,120
Did I do anything to upset you?

69
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,240
You can tell me everything.

70
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,040
For me,

71
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,160
you’ll always be my best friend.

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,800
Best friend?

73
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,320
Are you dreaming?

74
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,720
We like the same person,

75
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,520
how can we be best friends?

76
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,960
Actually,

77
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,800
we were never best friends.

78
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,640
You also have something
you’ve been hiding from me.

79
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,200
What are you talking about?

80
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,120
I’m talking about the Valentine’s Day
when you wanted to confess your love to Ta.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,560
You knew about this,

82
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,640
and you still confessed your love
to him?

83
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,680
Is it true?

84
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,480
You ask.

85
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,520
Alright.

86
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,920
We’ll wait for her to come.

87
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,760
I just remember

88
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,720
I have a tutor class with a junior.

89
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,240
I’ll have to excuse myself.

90
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,120
See you at the dorm.
I’ll head out first.

91
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,240
I’ve got to go.

92
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,800
I’m out. See you at the dorm.

93
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,000
Prapai.

94
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,360
Have the last piece, you’ll have a
good-looking boyfriend. [*Thai saying]

95
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
It makes me think of the past.

96
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,040
Whenever there’s a last fishball,

97
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,120
Prapai would normally say she’s full,
and give it to Ta.

98
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,280
First loves are hard to forget, right?

99
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,640
The love in the past
is just another dimension of love.

100
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,147
In the present dimension,
what’s most important is

101
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:36,800
the love we have right now.

102
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,560
It’s better than living in old memories.

103
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,920
Kwang is not my first love.

104
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,840
Kwang and I were never together.

105
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,840
You don’t have to stress about it.

106
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,640
Um.

107
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,840
Let’s go.

108
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,280
Take your shoes off first.

109
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,120
I need to take this call.

110
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,320
Oh, why are you back so late?

111
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,200
Come on in, come on.

112
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,240
Just make yourself feel at home.

113
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,880
Where’s Pupaa? Why isn’t he here?

114
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,040
Uh.

115
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,120
Never mind.

116
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,600
The stuff.

117
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,720
I’ve prepared it for you already.

118
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,640
Don’t need to worry about it.

119
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,120
Just think of it
as a “welcome gift” from me.

120
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,600
Just feel at home.

121
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
I hope you’ll enjoy.

122
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,080
I’m out.

123
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,040
I’m going out to a party.

124
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,560
Have fun. Be as loud as you want.

125
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,960
Take your time.

126
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,880
Bye.

127
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,800
What is he talking about?

128
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,040
Pupaa.

129
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,920
- Are you cheating on me?
- Did you buy it?

130
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,840
Are you crazy?

131
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,000
I didn’t do anything.

132
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,840
Don’t need to worry about it.

133
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Just think of it
as a “welcome gift” from me.

134
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,760
Krit.

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,200
You’re going to sleep on the floor?

136
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,080
Yeah. How can I let my girlfriend
sleep on the floor?

137
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,520
I feel bad.

138
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,160
You can sleep on the bed.

139
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,200
It’s alright, I can sleep on the floor.

140
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,040
I’ll sleep on the floor.
You sleep on the bed.

141
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,200
I can sleep on the floor.

142
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,280
I feel bad. You can sleep on the bed.

143
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,960
It’s alright. I’ll sleep on the floor.

144
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,200
No, sleep on the bed.

145
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,440
It’s alright.

146
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,480
Sleep on the bed...

147
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,960
I think

148
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,920
I better sleep on the floor.

149
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,200
Yeah. Yes.

150
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
You can’t sleep?

151
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,240
Um.

152
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,080
Probably because I’m not familiar.

153
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,560
I never thought you and Kwang
would know each other.

154
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,080
If I went to visit Kwang in Bangkok,

155
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,160
I would’ve known you beforehand.

156
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,440
Let’s do this then.

157
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,160
Hello.

158
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,800
My name is Pupaa.

159
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,240
I’m 22 years old.

160
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,040
I was born in Chiang Mai,
and grew up in Bangkok.

161
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,120
My greatest idol is Einstein.

162
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,480
When I was 12,
I wanted to study physics.

163
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
I like the value of pi.

164
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,160
And the girl that I like
is called Prapai.

165
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,880
I first met her when I was jogging.

166
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,440
Back then, I thought she had no manners.

167
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:12,240
And this is the first time
that I’ve been anyone’s boyfriend.

168
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,240
And she will be the only one.

169
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,120
If there’s anything I’m doing wrong,
just let me know.

170
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,160
No.

171
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,680
This is the first time
of me having a boyfriend too.

172
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,400
We’re both new to this.

173
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,040
Let’s learn it together.

174
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,880
It’s nice to meet you, Pupaa.

175
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,520
Nice to meet you.

176
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,320
Hello, Ta.

177
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,320
Can I ask you something?

178
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,960
Why did you break up with Kwang?

179
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,120
Why are you randomly asking me this now?

180
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,600
I met Kwang.

181
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,120
She’s doing the research with Pupaa
here in China.

182
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,480
Hold on.

183
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,640
You flew after Pupaa to China?

184
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,000
And you also met Kwang?

185
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,800
Wow, why is it such a coincidence?

186
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,520
I feel like Kwang is upset with me
about something.

187
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,360
When she quit school,
she didn’t even tell me about it.

188
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,560
She didn’t even answer my calls.

189
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,320
You were dating her then,

190
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,480
do you know anything at all?

191
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,880
I knew about her move
the same time you did in class.

192
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,000
Well, it’s been ages now,

193
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,200
I’ll tell you about it then.

194
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,120
Kwang dumped me.

195
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,920
Huh?

196
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,960
You weren’t the one who dumped her?

197
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Not at all.

198
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,280
After I said yes to her,

199
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,200
we were always fighting.

200
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,920
Because Kwang doesn’t like me
playing with you.

201
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,560
And the day before Kwang left,

202
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,120
she came to break up with me.

203
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,400
She also sarcastically said

204
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,080
that from now on,

205
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,280
I could spend all the time with you
as much as I wanted.

206
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,000
Why didn’t you tell me?

207
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,040
You left me misunderstanding for years.

208
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,560
It’s not a good story to be telling
about being dumped by a girl.

209
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,800
Instead of going around
and people be saying

210
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,460
“Look at that. That’s Ta.

211
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,920
He’s dating the most popular girl.

212
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,520
Both pretty and hot.”

213
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,120
It’ll become

214
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,420
“Oh, that’s Ta.

215
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,400
The one who got dumped.”

216
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,880
“Both pretty and hot”.

217
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,720
What’s her name again?

218
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,920
Kwang, right?

219
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,680
The name sounds familiar.

220
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,920
It’s no one.

221
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,840
I’m talking to Prapai.

222
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,120
Are you and Wawa dating?

223
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,880
I’m sorry. I won’t disturb you anymore.

224
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,720
You guys have fun dating.

225
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,440
Okay. Talk to you later.

226
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,680
Keep fighting, Pai.

227
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,520
Anyway,

228
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,440
you and Pupaa are meant to be.

229
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,760
Sure.

230
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,080
I still don’t understand.

231
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,880
But anyway.

232
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,480
(Weaver girl)

233
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,680
The Cowherd must be
with the Weaver girl.

234
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
How long have you and Prapai
been together?

235
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,160
It’ll be two months in a couple of days.

236
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
But you’ve been here
for over a month and a half now.

237
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,600
No wonder.

238
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,160
This means you haven’t had
much time together, right?

239
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,120
You two are very different.

240
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,960
You wouldn’t know that there’s much more
you both won’t work out.

241
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Being different doesn’t mean
we’re not compatible.

242
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,800
Well, Pupaa.

243
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,160
I’ve seen your email.

244
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,280
It’s great.

245
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,520
But you’ve just been with
our research team

246
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,000
for less than two months.

247
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,320
Lots of people who have
been here for long

248
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,880
are waiting for their turn
to attend the seminar.

249
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,440
And they’re also working on
some great researches.

250
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,880
Professor.

251
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,320
OK, enough.

252
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,860
I understand that you want to

253
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,800
finish this project as soon as possible.

254
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,120
But I’ve made my own choice.

255
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,000
So this is why

256
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,000
you’d do everything

257
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,360
to be able to attend the seminar.

258
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,360
But being like this,

259
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,880
I don’t think you’ll be going back
to Thailand anytime soon.

260
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,980
(Weaver girl)

261
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,440
We see the Cowherd every day.

262
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
Now we finally see the Weaver girl.

263
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,560
I bought you some snacks from Thailand.

264
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,120
These are crispy dumplings.

265
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,240
It’s fish stuffings.

266
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,880
You can have them when you’re hungry.

267
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,160
Thank you.

268
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,960
Come on, I’ll take you somewhere.

269
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,800
You can see the stars so clear here.

270
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,760
But which one is
the Cowherd and the Weaver girl?

271
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,520
Can you show them to me?

272
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,280
Did you mean

273
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,460
the Vega and the Altair constellation

274
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,040
that you once told me, right?

275
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,560
Here it is.

276
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,200
Do you see the Milky Way

277
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,960
that the Queen drew the line

278
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,440
to prevent the love between the two
as well?

279
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,240
But I see the Cygnus

280
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,600
that gathered together
to become a bridge for the two to meet.

281
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,800
It’s very clear.
Do you want to take a look?

282
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,400
It’s just a fairy tale.

283
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,200
Am I right, Pupaa?

284
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,860
This telescope’s

285
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,280
focal length is really good.

286
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Pupaa, have a look.

287
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,240
You can see the holes on the moon.

288
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,840
The Ptolemaeus,

289
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,160
the Alfonso star and the small Herschel
can also be seen.

290
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,480
Pupaa, I’m thirsty.

291
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,440
Can you go grab me some water?

292
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,680
Sure.

293
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,000
Kwang.

294
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,320
I don’t know what kind of relationship
you and Pupaa were in,

295
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,600
but right now,
Pupaa and I are together.

296
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,400
How long can you both stay together?

297
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,720
You’re very different.

298
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,920
And once you go back,
you won’t be together anymore.

299
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,320
Don’t you ever think

300
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,280
that Pupaa wants someone
who can be with him in his world?

301
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,480
Not with someone who doesn’t even
understand what he’s saying.

302
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,240
I let you go once,

303
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,400
because I thought
you were my best friend.

304
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,640
But this time,
I really can’t let you win.

305
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,680
I’m the one
who won’t let you win again.

306
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,840
Prapai.

307
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,560
Let’s go.

308
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,640
Kwang,
can you put the telescope away for me?

309
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,520
Look at that cloud.
It looks like ice cream.

310
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,520
The scientific name of that cloud
is called a Cumulus.

311
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,320
Really?

312
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,320
Look at that one.

313
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,320
It looks like a surfing turtle.

314
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,480
Don’t you think?

315
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,940
Clouds that gather together like that

316
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,840
are called Stego-cumulus.

317
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,200
Pupaa.

318
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,120
Can we stop by here first?

319
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,200
I’m hungry.

320
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,280
I have to get back to work now.

321
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,160
Oh, don’t you want to eat with me first?

322
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,560
You can go ahead. I’ll see you later.

323
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,120
Pupaa needs someone
who can be with him in his world.

324
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,840
Not someone who doesn’t even
understand what he says.

325
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,680
Oh, you. You’re the one
who came to visit your boyfriend.

326
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,320
Oh hello, Yang.

327
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,040
Hello, Hi.

328
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,960
I’m Prapai.

329
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,880
Have you met your boyfriend?

330
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,160
Yes, I have.

331
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,720
Here, it’s hot from the stove.

332
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,200
Thank you so much.

333
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,760
Yeah.

334
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,600
Yang, this is delicious.

335
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,120
It tastes like the one
in the popular restaurant at the mall.

336
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,160
Does Thailand sell pork skewers
in the mall these days?

337
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,440
Yes. The one at Icon Siam

338
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,560
they have a food court,
gathering all the famous food in one.

339
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,520
How long have you been here?

340
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,960
I’ve been here for 12 years already.

341
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,000
But I’ll probably be going back
to Thailand soon.

342
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,520
Going back to your family?

343
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,520
No, I’ll probably close down here.

344
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,840
Oh.

345
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,040
Why’s that?

346
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,080
Your food is delicious. What a pity.

347
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,400
Students don’t come to my place
so often anymore.

348
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,160
Or they prefer to go outside.

349
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,320
And the rent here keeps getting
more and more expensive.

350
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,600
I don’t think I can stay
for much longer.

351
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,920
Yang.

352
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,040
Recently

353
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,320
I’ve been doing a project about Bangkok.

354
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,720
When I was doing the research,
I was able to travel all over Bangkok.

355
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,480
And I found loads of food all around.

356
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,000
How about this?

357
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,360
Let’s do some planning

358
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,800
to promote Thai food
to the students here.

359
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,080
I think if they get the chance
to have a taste of your food,

360
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,360
they’ll love it.

361
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,120
I think this is a great idea.
Thank you.

362
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,680
No worries.

363
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,380
(Thai delicacy)

364
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,760
I’ll head out to find something to eat
at the canteen.

365
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,720
I’ll come too. I’m hungry too.

366
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,600
How was the food you just made?

367
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,040
I think no one here has made it yet.

368
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,720
And I think it can help my shop
to become popular again.

369
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,240
Exactly. That’s what I also think.

370
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,560
It’s great to have you here.

371
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,640
Sure.

372
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,160
What are you doing to my girlfriend?

373
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,000
Is this your boyfriend?

374
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,400
Why is he so jealous?

375
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,840
Pupaa.

376
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,080
This is Yang.

377
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,560
He’s Thai.

378
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,120
I’m just helping him plan
some promoting strategies.

379
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,560
Oh really?

380
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,400
I’m sorry. Do you need more help?

381
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,920
I’m studying here.
I have some information about the place.

382
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,600
Pupaa.

383
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,160
I think you should use your time

384
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,480
on the research.

385
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,280
Hey.

386
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
If it’s about helping Yang, don’t worry.

387
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,400
I can handle it just fine.

388
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,520
But if you’re hungry

389
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,680
you’ll have to try his food.

390
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,920
- Come on, take a seat.
- Please sit down.

391
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,320
Yang makes delicious food.

392
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,400
I can guarantee you on it.

393
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,600
What do you sell?

394
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,440
(Without your love like yesterday)

395
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,520
(It’s like sugar without any ants)

396
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,160
Hello.

397
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,720
I am in a holiday leave.

398
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,200
If you want to contact about work,

399
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,280
please contact directly to the company.

400
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,840
It’s me.

401
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,440
Oh.

402
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,360
It’s Time?

403
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,880
What’s up? What do you want?

404
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,280
If I don’t want anything, I can’t call?

405
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,400
It’s not like that.
So what are you up to?

406
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,320
When are you coming back?

407
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,440
Maybe in about a week?

408
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,520
Then you won’t be back in time for when
I’m shooting for the Qixi Festival?

409
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
What day is it?

410
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,840
Oh.

411
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,520
It’s on the 7th of July.

412
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,800
On the day of love?

413
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,520
Time, thank you so much

414
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,280
for telling me something important
like this.

415
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,640
I love you.

416
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,480
(Valentine’s Day)

417
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,400
Prapai.

418
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,080
Pupaa isn’t available yet.

419
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,120
So he wanted me to give this to you.

420
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,240
Here.

421
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,160
Thank you.

422
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,360
Happy eating.

423
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,480
Sure.

424
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,520
The thing that will attract any nation

425
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,320
are freebies.

426
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,880
It’s getting close to the Qixi Festival.

427
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,200
I think we should
make use of this festival

428
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,840
and have a promotion,
giving out limited products.

429
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,080
To improve the restaurant’s awareness

430
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,920
and make it more popular.

431
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,200
But what are we going to use
to give out to the customers?

432
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,840
Don’t worry.
I’ve thought about this already.

433
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,760
Are you a cook?

434
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,080
Even if I’m not good at cooking,
but I’m good at eating.

435
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,600
I think I know what food is good.

436
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,200
Both its presentation and taste.

437
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,780
It’s like tasting hot chocolate,

438
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,080
hot cocoa, or hot ovaltine.

439
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,080
We don’t really know the difference.

440
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,920
The ratio of the differences
of the ingredients.

441
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,840
Yes.

442
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,520
Hot cocoa uses cocoa powder and sugar.

443
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,360
Hot chocolate uses chocolate chunks

444
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,600
or chocolate with hot water.

445
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,080
And hot ovaltine adds in malt powder.

446
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,300
Things like this,

447
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,920
us scientists don’t have time for it.

448
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,040
Am I right, Pupaa?

449
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,600
What if we add in science to help out?

450
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,920
(Qixi Festival Promotion)
Everyone, please come here.

451
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,760
To celebrate the Qixi Festival,

452
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,080
we run a promotion.

453
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,440
called travelling in Bangkok.

454
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,040
It only lasts for a week.

455
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,800
OK, please let me introduce

456
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,600
about delicious Thai food.

457
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,080
First, we have mango sticky rice.

458
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,000
Where does it come from?

459
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,080
It’s from the Chinatown.

460
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,360
And the second one,

461
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,920
boat noodles.

462
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,160
Boat noodles.

463
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,780
(Boat noodles (Bangkok))

464
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,000
Where does this come from?

465
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
The monuments in Bangkok.

466
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,140
(Tom Yum Kung (Giant Swing))

467
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,660
(Mango Sticky Rice)

468
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,360
Great job!

469
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,800
Bring your loved ones.

470
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,040
Except the delicious food,

471
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,240
we also have many gifts.

472
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,120
I’ll take one.

473
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,840
I want one too.

474
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,080
Don’t worry.

475
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,840
We’ve prepared enough for everyone.

476
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,640
Except the gifts,

477
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,680
we also made some new drinks,

478
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,980
What’s the name?

479
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,280
It’s called Chanali, a Thai drink.

480
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,720
- Enjoy it.
- Have a try, please.

481
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,080
Have a try, please.

482
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,320
Have a try first.

483
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,160
Chanali is a traditional drink

484
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,040
- in Thailand.
- Please have a try.

485
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,520
Have a taste, everyone.

486
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,120
Please have a try.

487
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,280
Don’t rush.

488
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,120
You did great.

489
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,720
I have to thank you for inspiring me
to come up with the idea.

490
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,680
Me?

491
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,160
Um.

492
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,640
The special drink,

493
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,400
mixing chocolate with chili,

494
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,640
it’s just like love.

495
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,400
There are not only sweetness,

496
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,240
but also some spiciness

497
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,800
to spice up the love.

498
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,160
Please have a try.

499
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,000
Is that chili in it?

500
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,760
Oh my god, it tastes so good.

501
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,280
It really does.

502
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,040
Where does this drink come from?

503
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,200
It’s not mine, but this girl’s idea.

504
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,520
She’s not only pretty but talented.

505
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,640
Oh,

506
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,640
what were the group of guys saying?

507
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,280
They asked
what food do you think is the best?

508
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,520
And what did you answer?

509
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,640
I said everything tastes good for you.

510
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,960
Do you want to go back together tonight?

511
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,080
I think you could go back first.

512
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
I’ll probably be in the laboratory
until late.

513
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,120
I want to finish it
as soon as possible, so I can go back.

514
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,840
Pupaa.

515
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,640
Huh?

516
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,400
Tomorrow’s Qixi Festival.

517
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,920
It’s like Valentine’s day here.

518
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,440
What should we do?

519
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,960
Just a minute.

520
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,440
Hi, Professor Jin.

521
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Pupaa, I’d like to know

522
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,460
why you’re so desperate

523
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,400
to attend the seminar.

524
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,000
Dr. Gu Weiyi is my idol.

525
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,360
I want a chance to talk with him.

526
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,680
Maybe I can learn something new

527
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,000
and apply it in my research.

528
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,600
I understand.

529
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,160
But now there’s no vacancy

530
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,880
for the scientist attenders.

531
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,280
I have an idea

532
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,920
to let you attend this seminar.

533
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,800
Not as a researcher,

534
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,520
but as my assistant.

535
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,320
I wonder if you’re interested.

536
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,280
I’m interested, thank you so much.

537
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,920
Professor.

538
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:41,280
Could I take my girlfriend with me?

539
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,080
A plus one is allowed this time.

540
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,440
Just take her with you.

541
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,760
Thank you.

542
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,680
Okay, bye.

543
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,680
Prapai.

544
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,440
Huh?

545
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,040
I have to go to a seminar
in a different city tomorrow.

546
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,440
I also have to stay the night.

547
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,400
It’s alright.

548
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,800
I understand.

549
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
But you

550
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,800
must not go mess with anyone.
Do you understand?

551
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,000
Why would I mess with someone else
in front of you?

552
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
In front of me?

553
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,240
Do you mean

554
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,480
I can go with you too?

555
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,320
Yes.

556
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,680
Professor said I can take a plus one.

557
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,240
Really?

558
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,720
But

559
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,080
it won’t be fun

560
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,920
like going to shoots
and meeting good-looking celebrities.

561
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,280
Do you mean Time?

562
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,480
For me,

563
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,000
Time’s not that handsome.

564
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,480
I like someone with a straight face,

565
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,520
someone calm like you.

566
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,320
Come on, let’s go to bed.

567
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,440
So we can wake up early tomorrow.

568
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,480
Sure.

569
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,400
Goodnight.

570
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,960
Goodnight.

571
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,120
Thank you for dropping me off.

572
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,720
You’re always welcome.

573
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,160
I’ll see you later.

574
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,760
Okay.

575
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,800
Hello, dad?

576
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,760
Pai, you’re also here?

577
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,800
Pupaa said he can bring a relative.

578
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,440
But this event might be a bit difficult
for you to understand.

579
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,280
Especially what Dr. Gu Weiyi
is going to say.

580
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,800
Who is it? Dr. Gu...

581
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,200
Dr. Gu Weiyi.

582
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,000
He’s a very successful physician.

583
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,080
I’ve been following him for a long time.

584
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,800
Pupaa, did you bring your computer?

585
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,400
Yes, I did.

586
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,640
A senior who was going to make a speech

587
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,920
had an accident on his way here.

588
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,840
He can’t come.

589
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,020
So I need you to take his place
and give a speech.

590
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,320
Just present your research project.

591
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,680
OK.

592
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:14,540
(Academic Technology Symposium)

593
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,680
Don’t worry.
And you don’t need to stress about it.

594
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,040
Anything about science,

595
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,320
you can talk about it perfectly fine.

596
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,040
These are the results of the
different materials diverging light.

597
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,500
And don’t forget to talk about

598
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,800
the use of computers
to calculate light waves.

599
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,880
To improve accuracy too.

600
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,320
Next is the hologram project

601
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,720
presented by Pupaa and his team.

602
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,560
It’s your turn.

603
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,560
Go for it.

604
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,860
(Academic Technology Symposium)

605
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,640
Support is important.

606
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,880
But for scientists,

607
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,480
we might need more than
just holding hands for support.

608
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,440
I think

609
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,880
you should have some knowledge
about science.

610
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,480
Otherwise you’ll only be going on dates,

611
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,160
and having just lunch with him.

612
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,320
Because the time spent by scientists

613
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,320
are mainly in the laboratory.

614
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,840
Prapai.

615
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,120
How was I?

616
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,480
I don’t understand
what you were saying anyway.

617
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,760
You did a great job presenting.

618
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,080
Well-organized, no mistakes
and easy to understand.

619
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,440
But I think the information about

620
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,080
the recording of the light waves
for linear materials...

621
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,720
Yes, I think I didn’t mention
all the details I wanted to.

622
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,600
Can you really tell?

623
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,080
Yeah.

624
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,560
Pupaa, I’m going to go to the restroom.

625
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,560
Pupaa.

626
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,080
Maybe we’re down on our luck today.

627
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,160
Your senior didn’t make it here,

628
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,360
and Dr. Gu also will not come.

629
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,760
It’s such a pity.

630
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,600
You could have talked to him
face to face.

631
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,720
It’s fine, I won’t give up.

632
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,960
I will finally meet him someday.

633
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,640
As long as you have confidence.
Go for it.

634
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,040
Thank you.

635
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,720
I should go take a walk somewhere
that’s for me.

636
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,280
Hey, hey miss.

637
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,960
Where are you going?
Don’t go over there.

638
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,880
It’s getting dark.
You’ll be easy to get lost.

639
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,520
Miss, why are you

640
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,640
not listening to me? Come back!

641

(Academic Technology Symposium)

642
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,640
Later,

643
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,040
I’ll introduce you some professors

644
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,520
from other key universities.

645
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,840
OK.

646
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,240
Let’s go together.

647
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,920
Excuse me, what are you looking for?

648
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,840
Have you seen a girl, not very tall?

649
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,560
Oh, yes, I have. She went this way.

650
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,200
I warned her, but she didn’t listen.

651
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,840
I don’t know how she went there.

652
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,600
It’s dangerous going alone in the dark.

653
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,440
There are no lights.

654
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,280
I don’t know how is she now.

655
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,360
Why didn’t she listen?

656
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,560
(Special scene)

657
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,760
If we wanna ask you out for lunch,

658
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,920
what should we order?

659
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,000
No, you can’t. She’s my girlfriend.

660
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,800
She can only have lunch with me.
