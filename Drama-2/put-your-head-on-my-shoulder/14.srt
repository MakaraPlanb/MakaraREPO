Stop.

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,720
Don’t even think about it.

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,120
I think you shouldn’t. I beg you.

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,800
If something happens to you
because of the cat

34
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,680
and the entire shooting gets ruined,

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,360
I won’t be able to pay for it.

36
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,140
There’s so much more work
you’ve got waiting.

37
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,240
If something happens,

38
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,120
I don’t even want to think about it.

39
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,160
But hey.

40
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,360
I’ve been on a sling shot
over a 3-storey building before.

41
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,200
Just climbing a tree to get a cat,
it’s no problem.

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,920
No, you can’t.

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,960
Time, that’s enough.

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,560
If you climb and fall,

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,000
everyone else will be in trouble.

46
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,200
Let’s let Pupaa handle this.

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,640
Pupaa, I’ll leave this to you.

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,280
Sure.

49
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,520
Take this.

50
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
Um.

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,760
Be careful.

52
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Wow.

53
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,160
He’s so cool.

54
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,920
Joobjoob.

55
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,440
Joobjoob, come here.

56
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,400
Joobjoob.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,920
Joobjoob.

58
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,280
Joobjoob.

59
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Meow, meow.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Meow, meow.

61
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,160
Joobjoob.

62
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,480
Joobjoob.

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,320
What do you want?

64
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,880
I can’t understand you.

65
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,400
Use this cat language translation
application.

66
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,000
Prapai.

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,160
Can you give me the cat hat in the bag?

68
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Sure, hold on.

69
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,800
Here you go.

70
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,760
(Congratulations!
We’re happy to inform you)

71
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,040
(of your acceptance
to Beiqing University)

72
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,160
Hey, hey.

73
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,760
Hey.

74
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,480
Hey, get off me. It’s heavy.

75
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,080
Give Joobjoob to me first.

76
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,040
Come on.

77
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,360
Joobjoob, come here.

78
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,640
Joobjoob.

79
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,280
Are you alright?

80
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,960
I’m fine.

81
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Thank you.

82
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,040
Are you alright?

83
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
I’m alright.

84
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Lucky someone’s been a good mattress.

85
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,000
How about you, are you alright?

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
At least you’re alright.

87
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,520
Even if you weren’t here,

88
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,040
I won’t fall onto Prapai anyway.

89
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,760
You really don’t know
how to thank others, do you?

90
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,320
Hey, that’s enough.

91
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,160
At least you’re alright.

92
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,360
Both you and Joobjoob.

93
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,640
Anyway,

94
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,520
thanks to your cat hat

95
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,720
and the translation application.

96
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,080
Here, your phone. Take it back.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
Come on, everyone.

98
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,460
Let’s continue the shooting.

99
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,440
We’ve wasted a lot of time already.

100
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,920
Let’s get started.

101
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,520
Pupaa.

102
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,440
Do you remember me?

103
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,840
We met at the mall last time,

104
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,040
at the event.

105
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,000
I do.

106
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,760
I still don’t have the thought
of joining the entertainment industry.

107
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
Don’t say no so fast.

108
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,920
When I saw you and Time a minute ago,

109
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,920
I know you’d both be a great partner.

110
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,160
We’re not the same type of people
for sure.

111
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Please excuse me.

112
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,480
You’re a perfect match.

113
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,880
What a pity.

114
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,640
Hey,

115
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,400
don’t even think about it.

116
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,840
If you want me, you can’t have him.

117
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,360
Don’t push me to choose.

118
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,000
Hey, don’t say that.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,920
Bye, Joobjoob. We’ll see you later.

120
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,320
It’s nice to meet you.

121
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,400
See you, Pon.

122
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,040
Bye.

123
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,080
Bye, Prapai, bye, Pupaa.

124
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,840
Bye.

125
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,440
Let’s go.

126
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,360
I have to thank everyone today

127
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,880
for finding the evidence
to prove the rumor wrong.

128
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,560
If it wasn’t because all of you,
there wouldn’t have been today.

129
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,600
There wouldn’t have been today’s shoot.

130
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,800
And we wouldn’t have met.

131
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,560
Thank you so much.

132
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,520
You’re welcome.

133
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
- Time.
- Yes?

134
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,920
That staff over there

135
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,820
was the person who gave me the evidence

136
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,920
to post to help you.

137
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,640
Why?

138
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,600
The cute girl over there?

139
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,440
No.

140
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,360
The cute guy next to her.

141
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,640
I’ll have to excuse myself first.

142
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,720
Sure.

143
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,880
Bye.

144
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,880
Hey.

145
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,160
You were the one who sent the evidence
to my fans, right?

146
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,040
Pupaa.

147
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,120
Did you really help Time?

148
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,720
Thank you anyway.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,040
You don’t need to thank me.

150
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,840
I wasn’t helping you.

151
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,120
I just didn’t want Prapai

152
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,600
to be upset because of this.

153
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,620
And the reason you kept a secret

154
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,120
and not take the scholarship in China

155
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,800
is because you didn’t want
to make Prapai upset too, right?

156
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,040
Pupaa.

157
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,080
You got a scholarship in China?

158
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Yes, he did.

159
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,680
When the phone fell,

160
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,120
I picked it up and saw the text.

161
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,600
So

162
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,560
why did you reject it?

163
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,120
This is your opportunity.

164
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,800
If I accept this scholarship,

165
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,440
I have to go do the research in China
for at least a year.

166
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,440
And if that happens,

167
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,720
we would probably be the Cowherd
and the Weaver girl for real.

168
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,240
You want that to happen?

169
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,480
I want you to do what you like.

170
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,840
If it wasn’t because of me,

171
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,840
you would have
accepted this scholarship, right?

172
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,400
Just take it.

173
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,840
Why are you thinking too much?

174
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
It’s only a year.

175
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Pupaa.

176
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,880
How about this?

177
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,480
If you accept this scholarship,

178
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,240
I will give you extra marks.

179
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,480
Also,

180
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,100
I will let you be my real boyfriend.

181
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,040
Right now.

182
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,320
You’re my girlfriend now.

183
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,120
You can’t look at other guys now, okay?

184
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,280
Don’t worry.

185
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,960
I promise to wait for only you.

186
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,480
Let’s go home.

187
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,320
I’m going now, bye.

188
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,440
One year?

189
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,480
I’m not going to lose this opportunity,
Pupaa.

190
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,560
Watch out.

191
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,200
Oh.

192
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,160
What are you doing?

193
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,960
I just wanted to see

194
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,520
if you’re up yet.

195
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,840
Breakfast is on the table as usual.

196
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
I’m going to the laboratory today.

197
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,360
I might come home late in the evening.

198
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
See you.

199
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,400
Um.

200
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,320
(Love marks)

201
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,960
(Care level, obedience level)

202
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,040
(Smile level, responsibility level,
gentleness level)

203
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,960
I just hope that Pupaa
will change his mind.

204
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,040
Yeah.

205
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,760
Rejecting such a good opportunity
like this,

206
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,000
it would be such a pity.

207
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,040
But if Pupaa really means it,

208
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,960
I am willing to offer myself
to go instead of him.

209
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,040
Why should we send you
to humiliate our country?

210
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,680
I’m just joking.

211
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,720
I will accept this scholarship.

212
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,360
You’ve made the right decision.

213
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,000
I have to thank my girlfriend

214
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,040
for supporting this decision to be made.

215
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,320
Hey.

216
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,040
So now she’s your girlfriend?

217
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Wow.

218
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,320
Getting both a girlfriend
and a scholarship,

219
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,200
there’s nothing better than this.

220
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,320
But

221
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,040
Professor,

222
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,120
what is the least amount of time
needed for this research?

223
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,800
From my estimation,

224
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,360
it should be no less than a year.

225
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,360
One year is too long.

226
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,040
I will finish it faster than that.

227
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,200
Why?

228
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,160
Are you in a rush to do something else?

229
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,040
Well,

230
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,760
I don’t want my girlfriend to be alone
for too long.

231
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,440
Such a sneaky guy.

232
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,840
Since we’re all here together,

233
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,760
let’s get to work.

234
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,840
Sure, Professor.

235
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,080
Sit down, sit down.

236
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,400
Let’s go.

237
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
I’ll catch up.

238
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
Ken.

239
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
What’s up?

240
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,840
I’m worried about you and your girl.

241
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,800
You’ve just started dating,
and now you’re about to go away.

242
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,380
Be careful it won’t last,

243
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,440
before everything even starts.

244
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,160
It’s alright.

245
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,720
I trust Pai.

246
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,560
Pai trusts me too.

247
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,640
Trusting each other is good.

248
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,680
But once you’re not together,

249
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,480
nothing can be guaranteed, right?

250
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,880
So

251
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,760
what do I have to do?

252
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
Anything physical is more stable.

253
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,280
This means you have to actually own her.

254
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,320
Physical attachment will make her
never forget you.

255
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,160
Own her?

256
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,920
How do I do that?

257
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,840
Oh boy, Pupaa.

258
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,040
Well,

259
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,160
like this.

260
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,800
Like this.

261
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,740
(ICON SIAM)

262
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,460
(ICON SIAM)

263
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,920
I want this one.

264
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,720
Can I please have one coconut cake?

265
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,920
Thank you.

266
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,480
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

267
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,000
Thank you.

268
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,080
Let’s have it together.

269
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,360
Alright.

270
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,680
Here.

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,040
You never miss this kind of thing,
right?

272
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,720
Everyone comes here to make a wish.

273
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,240
(Prapai)

274
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,840
(Pupaa)

275
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,120
(Pupaa, Prapai)

276
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,040
Even if our bodies are apart,

277
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,940
but our hearts

278
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,280
will always be together.

279
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,280
Let’s go feed the fishes.

280
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,320
You can go first.
I need to go to the restroom.

281
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,280
Alright. I’ll buy the fish food for you.

282
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,320
Just catch up with me.

283
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,400
(Prapai forever)

284
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,960
(Hope no one messes with Prapai)

285
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,320
Mom, they are about to kiss.

286
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,120
Don’t disturb them.

287
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,200
Pupaa.

288
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,600
Well,

289
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,400
I feel like I owe you something.

290
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,680
I just want to congratulate you.

291
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,440
Good luck.

292
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,600
You’re a smart person.
You’ll surely be successful.

293
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,800
And

294
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,960
I also have to apologize to you

295
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,520
for saying bad things to you.

296
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,800
And I also nearly hurt you.

297
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,880
That’s all I have to say.

298
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,360
Meena.

299
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,200
Wawa.

300
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,120
Hold on, Wawa.

301
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,440
What’s wrong with you?

302
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,440
You haven’t answered any of my calls.

303
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,000
I thought something happened to you.

304
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,120
What do you want?

305
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,000
I saw it and thought of you.

306
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,120
So I bought it for you.

307
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,920
I think

308
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,600
you’re giving it to the wrong person.

309
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,960
Wawa.

310
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,640
What do you mean?

311
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,880
You know, Ta.

312
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,800
You can lie to anyone,

313
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,120
but you can never lie to yourself.

314
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,640
You know what you’ve done.

315
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,280
Why are you acting like you don’t know?

316
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,000
Wait a minute, Wawa.

317
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,440
Wawa, wait.

318
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,440
Can we just talk, Wawa?

319
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,320
Wawa.

320
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,520
I need to go to the restroom.

321
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
(How to kiss a girl)

322
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,480
(1. Approach her without notice)

323
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,680
(2. Slowly put your face closer)

324
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,120
What are you looking at?

325
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,160
Nothing.

326
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,560
What’s wrong, Wawa?

327
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,120
Hey, what happened?

328
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,840
Hold on. Calm down first.
What happened?

329
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,280
I know.

330
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,760
(1. Approach her without notice)

331
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,200
So how is it?

332
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,360
So how is it?

333
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,240
What are you going to do next?

334
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,480
Give me a minute.

335
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,440
I understand it’s hard to say.

336
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,800
Just calm down first.

337
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,720
You’ll have to talk to him.

338
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,760
I’ll go get it.

339
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,280
Wawa.

340
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,480
Pai.

341
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,920
Just give me a moment.

342
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,400
Hey.

343
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,360
It’s alright, Wawa.

344
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,120
Don’t cry.

345
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,480
Ta never loved me, Pai.

346
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
It might be a misunderstanding.

347
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,400
I saw it myself.

348
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,120
How can it be a misunderstanding?

349
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,440
Ta gave the flowers to her.

350
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,200
Come here, don’t cry.

351
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,880
Don’t cry.

352
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,080
Hello.

353
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,920
Ta.

354
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,560
What’s going on between you and Wawa?

355
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,040
How did you know?

356
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Wawa is at my place right now.

357
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
And she’s using my time with Prapai.

358
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,120
Okay, I’ll be right there.

359
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,960
Come quick.

360
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,840
Come, take a seat.

361
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,880
Do you want anything to eat?

362
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,480
Anything sweet is a must
to heal a heartbreak.

363
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,120
Sure. Just give me a minute.

364
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,160
- Thank you.
- Here’s your dessert.

365
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,240
Here you go.

366
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,680
I’ll be right back.

367
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,720
You can dig in.

368
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,440
It’s late already.

369
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,480
Why is Wawa still here?

370
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,360
Wawa just got her heart broken.

371
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
She doesn’t look very well.

372
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,360
I feel bad for her.

373
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,440
But

374
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,440
Wawa has been heartbroken
for two months already.

375
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,000
According to
Ebbinghaus’ forgetting curve,

376
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,880
it says that she should be in the...

377
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,760
But Wawa is my friend.

378
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,680
But I don’t have much time left
with you.

379
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Alright. I understand.

380
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,400
Then

381
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,240
I’ll need about half an hour.

382
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,560
I’ll talk to Wawa about it.

383
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,800
I’ll go get it.

384
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,800
Ta.

385
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,280
Ta, what are you doing here?

386
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,680
He’s here to take you home, Wawa.

387
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,560
Who said I was going to go home?

388
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,640
I’ll take care of this.

389
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,600
- All yours.
- Um.

390
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,280
Come on.

391
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,680
What? Where are we going?

392
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,840
Let’s get this sorted.

393
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,880
Will it be a good idea
to let them be together like that?

394
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,720
It’s alright.

395
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,240
Ta said he’ll take care of it.

396
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,080
Wawa, what’s wrong with you?

397
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
Nothing.

398
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,080
Aren’t you going to ask
what I’m mad at you about?

399
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,800
So what are you mad at me about?

400
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,680
I think I’ve been very good lately.

401
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,920
I haven’t gone partying,

402
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,120
and I didn’t go out to meet anyone.

403
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,840
Because I’m waiting to be with you.

404
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,920
When are you going to stop lying, Ta?

405
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,960
Aren’t you tired of it?

406
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,280
When did I lie to you?

407
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,560
- Just get out. I don’t want to listen.
- Wait a minute, Wawa.

408
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,760
Come on, let’s get into the room.

409
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,920
Pupaa.

410
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,720
Pupaa.

411
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,480
Ta.

412
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,080
Can you stay still?

413
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,360
Pupaa.

414
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,440
Girls are strange, aren’t they?

415
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,920
They’ve got one thing on their mind,

416
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,480
but they act out differently.

417
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,280
When I question, I’m wrong.

418
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,240
When I don’t, I’m still wrong.

419
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,040
I don’t know what to do anymore.

420
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,080
The problem between you and Wawa,

421
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,960
I think you guys should go back
and sort it out.

422
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,720
Because the problem between me and Pai

423
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,280
is that we don’t have any time left
together.

424
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,880
Come on, Pupaa.

425
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,120
Don’t be so mad.

426
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,680
This is a problem that everyone
has to experience.

427
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,840
There’s always a goodbye after a hello.

428
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,920
Always a depart after a meet up.

429
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,240
Obstacles will make your love stronger.

430
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,360
Stop it. If you’re not going to sleep,
then go outside.

431
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,200
Alright, I’ll stop talking.

432
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,280
Ta.

433
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,680
You told me to shut it,
and why are you calling me?

434
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,120
I have something to ask you.

435
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,960
I envy both of you.

436
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,680
Pupaa is a loyal lover.

437
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,280
He’s also smart.

438
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,040
But Ta also loves you.

439
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,840
I’ve known him for a long time.

440
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,800
Trust me.

441
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,880
Things might not be
how you think they are.

442
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,160
Get some sleep.

443
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,520
Goodnight.

444
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,560
Hey.

445
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,200
You’re done packing already?

446
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,640
Not yet.

447
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,240
Are you missing anything important?

448
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,080
So we can go buy it now.
You’ve still got time.

449
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,440
There’s one thing.

450
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,560
Hey.

451
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,760
I have something for you.

452
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,480
It’s a shirt.

453
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,360
Yours is the Cowherd one.

454
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,720
(Vega Altair)

455
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,680
And mine is the Weaver girl.

456
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,880
(Cowherd and Weaver girl)

457
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,440
So when you wear it there,

458
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,240
the girls will know you’ve got a
Weaver girl waiting for you.

459
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,920
Don’t worry.

460
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,440
I won’t have eyes on anyone except you.

461
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,640
I’ve never liked anyone
like this before.

462
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,560
You’re so brave

463
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,280
to always be on my mind like this.

464
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,800
You’re the weak one.

465
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
Just go.

466
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,520
And don’t ever come back again.

467
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,480
I will.

468
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,920
I will go.

469
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,960
I’ve changed my mind.

470
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,320
You will have to be with me.

471
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,360
For the rest of your life.

472
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,600
We’re not meant for each other.

473
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,920
I’m pregnant, with your brother’s child.

474
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,160
If that time we met,

475
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,600
you were the one
who put your hands out.

476
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,480
Wait a minute.

477
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,120
Excuse me.

478
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,800
Cut.

479
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,360
What’s the problem again, superstar?

480
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,000
Always so picky.

481
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,640
This isn’t what the script says.

482
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,440
It’s like this, Time.

483
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,280
The director twitched the script a bit.

484
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,760
The fans like to watch
these sort of stories.

485
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,840
A forcing love is impossible.

486
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,280
It’s also against morality.

487
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,160
You should be liking this kind of act.

488
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,200
I probably do.

489
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,800
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have
made a mistake to date you.

490
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,160
Let it go, Time.

491
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,120
What’s past is passed.

492
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,000
Once the work is over,
you’ll both go separate ways.

493
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,280
Let’s no bring up the past.

494
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,600
I beg you.

495
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,080
Time.

496
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,800
If you do this role,

497
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,200
the ending will be so perfect.

498
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,400
It’s like a dark love story

499
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,800
flipping into a happy ending.

500
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,560
You understand me, right?

501
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,360
It’s interesting.

502
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,560
Changing from a dark love story
to a bright one.

503
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,320
If you understand it now, then great.

504
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,680
We’ll continue the shoot.

505
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,560
Everyone, reset everything.

506
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,960
This smile of yours.

507
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,080
You’re about to cause me
another problem, right?

508
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,320
Don’t see me as a troublemaker.

509
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,720
I promise

510
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,920
I won’t cause any trouble.

511
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,400
Great.

512
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,440
Come on, let’s continue our work.

513
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,200
Hello. It’s Prapai speaking.

514
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,520
Wow.

515
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,360
From your voice,

516
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,920
I guess your heart is way over
at China.

517
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,920
Oh, Ta, it’s you?

518
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,880
What’s up?

519
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,040
I just thought you might not be okay.

520
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,080
So I just called to check.

521
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,880
Don’t worry.

522
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,600
Even if Mr. Pupaa isn’t here,

523
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,000
I will take care of you.

524
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,640
Don’t even get me started.

525
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,080
You better go spend your time with Wawa.

526
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,360
Oh.

527
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,440
I’ve tried.

528
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,720
But Wawa is still mad at me.

529
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,760
She’s never, never mad at me.

530
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,400
I don’t know what to do, either.

531
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,040
I can’t help you.

532
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,600
You caused a lot of problems yourself.

533
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,200
You’ve also done lots of bad things
to her.

534
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,600
So you have to be patient,

535
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,760
and try harder than others.

536
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,560
Alright?

537
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,520
Why do you look like a sad dog?

538
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,160
Hey, don’t bother me.

539
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,960
I’m not in the mood
to fight with you today.

540
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,000
I won’t mess with you.

541
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,400
But I’ve got one place
to bring you to today.

542
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,920
Because after a dark moment,

543
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,840
you will have to face a
bright happy one too.

544
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,640
What are you daydreaming about?

545
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,600
I’m not going.

546
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,200
I’m not asking you.

547
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,200
Hey.

548
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,320
(lab)

549
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,960
Hello.
Do you have any equipment with light?

550
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,240
No.

551
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,320
Alright.

552
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,400
Please come in.

553
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Thank you.

554
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,280
You dragged me here to follow Prapai?

555
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,400
Aren’t you worried about your friend?

556
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,600
Look, she’s entering the tiger’s cave.

557
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,800
Let’s follow her. Come on.

558
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
Hold on.

559
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,000
Do you have any equipment with light?

560
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,800
- No.
- No.

561
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,760
Are you sure?

562
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,400
Yes, I’m sure.

563
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,440
Please go in.

564
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,560
How are we going to order
in the dark like this?

565
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,120
They’ll be someone to help you order.

566
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,800
Are you allergic to anything?

567
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,240
No. I can eat anything.

568
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,040
Great.

569
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,560
- Hello.
- Hello.

570
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,360
What would you like?

571
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,760
I’ll have 2 serves of today’s special.

572
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,120
- Sure.
- And also

573
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,960
one of them without coriander.

574
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,600
- Sure. Please wait a moment.
- Sure.

575
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,280
What is wrong with you?

576
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,560
I’m sorry. It’s dark, I can’t see.

577
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,960
Keep your ears open.

578
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,320
I’m trying.

579
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,560
Hey.

580
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,200
Do you remember the rooftop
we shouted together last time?

581
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,800
It’s become my new secret place.

582
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,160
Every time I feel bad,

583
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,640
I head over there,

584
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,880
and just shout.

585
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,800
Thank you.

586
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,860
Hey, it’s alright.
We’re friends anyway.

587
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,760
What if I want to be more than friends?

588
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,960
You mean brothers and sisters, right?

589
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,720
You want to be my brother, right?

590
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,240
You know I don’t mean that.

591
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,440
Pupaa has already gone to China.

592
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,200
And I can be with you anytime.

593
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,400
You’ll know

594
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,880
that the person who should be with you

595
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,160
is me, not him.

596
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,320
But Pupaa isn’t going forever.

597
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,680
He’ll be gone for only a year.

598
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,520
And time flies in a year.

599
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,760
But from my experience
in the entertainment industry,

600
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,320
many couples

601
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,760
that have shootings overseas

602
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,040
all broke up.

603
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,480
Even if they love each other so much.

604
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,020
Everyone needs to have a life

605
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,720
of their own,
and when their times of life differs,

606
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,800
long distance relationships ends
anyway.

607
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,240
Let’s go to China.

608
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,280
To see if the university here

609
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,360
and over there differ much.

610
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,240
So we can go meet our friend
who’s doing research there too.

611
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,120
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

612
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,320
It’s Ta. I’m Ta.

613
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,160
Sit down.

614
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,160
Thank you.

615
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,480
Wawa.

616
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,640
Excuse me, which way is the restroom?

617
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,920
This way, please.

618
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,120
Prapai, just break up with him.

619
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,920
And come be with me.

620
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,880
I don’t think so. I like girls.

621
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,760
Shit.

622
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,280
Who are you?

623
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,200
What is this?

624
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,600
Is this Time, the superstar?

625
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,640
Wow, I didn’t expect to see him here.

626
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,560
Oh, I can remember his voice.

627
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,960
His handsome voice is just like this.

628
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,320
- I’m sure it’s Time.
- Time.

629
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,440
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

630
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,160
Where are you, Time?

631
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,360
- Time.
- Can you sign for me?

632
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,320
Time.

633
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,400
- Excuse me.
- Can I take a photo?

634
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,920
Hey, Time.

635
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,520
What are you guys doing?

636
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,920
I’m not playing. I’m here to help you.

637
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,240
Don’t do this again.

638
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,480
How will I ever look at him
in the face again?

639
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,160
You too.

640
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,640
You’re also joining him?

641
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,680
- We’re sorry.
- We’re sorry.

642
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,680
Never mind. Let’s head out.

643
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,920
What happened yesterday?
Why didn’t you come home?

644
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
Where were you? Explain to me.

645
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,400
(Time,
I’m sorry on behalf of my friends.)

646
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,520
No, I’m not going to calm down.

647
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,920
Nothing happened.

648
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,360
Isn’t this called cheating?

649
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,720
She’s just a friend.

650
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,920
A friend?

651
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,880
Pai.

652
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,560
Let’s not care about
other couples’ problems.

653
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,280
- We’re over.
- Honey.

654
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,560
Listen to me.

655
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:30,960
Listen to me.

656
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,320
Honey, listen to me.

657
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,440
What happened?

658
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,080
I don’t want to be talking about
other people’s problems.

659
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,720
But because it’s you,

660
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,520
here’s the story.

661
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,680
They were both living here.

662
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,720
But one day she found out
he was cheating.

663
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,080
I was so confused when did he do so.

664
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,160
I see them together every day.

665
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,320
Even they’re this close together,
he could still cheat.

666
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,720
If they’re not living together,
won’t he be cheating on dozens?

667
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,760
Oh, right.

668
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,360
Pupaa is in China.

669
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,200
You have to be careful, Prapai.

670
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:16,680
Because Pupaa is smart, handsome
and just so perfect.

671
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,880
It’s easy for...

672
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,840
I’ll have to excuse myself now.
Bye.

673
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,560
Hey, I just wanted to warn you.

674
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,960
Pupaa.

675
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,040
You’re still working?

676
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,880
Ye... yes.

677
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:48,320
How about we have a dinner together?

678
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,840
OK.

679
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,280
Hello, Pupaa.

680
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,640
Prapai.

681
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,400
Let’s break up.

682
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,280
(Special scene)

683
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,520
When I’m not here anymore,

684
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,480
can you take care of Prapai for me?

685
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,000
Aren’t you afraid me and Prapai

686
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,120
will have feelings for each other again?

687
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,080
If she finishes work late,

688
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,200
can you help pick her up?

689
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,360
If she gets mad,

690
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,120
can you buy her some delicious food?

691
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,200
If she...
