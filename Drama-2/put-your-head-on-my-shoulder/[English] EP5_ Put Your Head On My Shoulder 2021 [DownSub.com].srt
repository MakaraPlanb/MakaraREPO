30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,400
Don’t say I gossip too much, Prapai.

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
He’s the best of the science faculty.

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,040
How did you guys know each other?

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,880
Are you secretly dating him?

34
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,120
That’s nonsense.

35
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,440
Pupaa is a friend of Ta.

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,000
They’re in the basketball club together.
We’ve met only a couple of times.

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,760
Only a couple of times, but he asked you
to the graduation party?

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,440
Isn’t it strange?

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,160
What did you say?

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,840
The faculty’s graduation party.
I don’t really want to go.

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,780
But I told a friend
that I have a date already.

42
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,800
So I...

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,760
You’re just using me as a shield, right?

44
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,240
Normally I’m only with guy friends.

45
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,240
So I don’t have any girl friends.

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,060
So if I agree to go,

47
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,200
you won’t kick me out, right?

48
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,680
Umm.

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,840
Alright, it’s a deal.

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,160
But clean up all this mess first.

51
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,240
Yes, sir. I will clean up everything.

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,080
But Pupaa has never had
rumors with any girls.

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,480
Of course, he likes guys.

54
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,000
You’re going to be
the focus of the audience.

55
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,600
I think this one. This one here.

56
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,960
And this shoe too. Here.

57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,100
I think this dress and this shoe.

58
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,320
Perfect.

59
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,680
Isn’t it too high?

60
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,100
This is what you should wear.

61
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,960
So you suit your handsome date.

62
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,160
Exactly.

63
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,680
Balance is important.

64
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,680
What did you say?

65
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,960
When wearing high heels,

66
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,760
the body’s center of gravity
will shift forward a bit,

67
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,360
making it difficult to balance.

68
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,880
So,

69
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,200
you must make your center of gravity
be closest to your center.

70
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,080
Easy for you to say. Do you want to try?

71
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,120
I can’t wear your size.

72
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,600
You actually want to wear it, don’t you?

73
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,320
One more thing,

74
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,360
wearing heels this high,

75
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
the area to hold your weight
is going to be less.

76
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,960
The front of your heels will have to
carry up 40% of your original weight.

77
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,280
Wearing it throughout the entire night

78
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,800
is going to make your muscles sore.

79
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,200
Can you stop talking so much?

80
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,420
Because I’m going to a party,

81
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,720
I just want to be pretty.

82
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,640
Wait and see how I look tomorrow.

83
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,040
I will shock you with my beauty.

84
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,960
Pai.

85
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,600
Oh, why are you leaving early today?

86
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,500
I’m in a hurry

87
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,400
to go to a graduation party.

88
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,600
Who are you going with?

89
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,400
With a friend.
He asked me to go with him.

90
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,700
Oh.

91
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,400
We’re all grown.
You’re really calling him a friend?

92
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,320
Don’t mess up your work though.

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,760
Faye, it’s not like that.

94
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,700
Alright, alright.

95
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,520
It’s your personal life.
I won’t be nosy.

96
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,840
Let’s talk about work.

97
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,560
I know you wanted to do something
related to advertising, right?

98
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,400
I wanted to show you this.

99
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,120
What do you think of this idea?

100
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,480
(Welcome to Bangkok)

101
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,640
I think I’ve seen something similar
from other countries.

102
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,560
In this case, how do you think

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,040
we should change this,
so they don’t think we copied from them?

104
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,120
What should we do?

105
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,560
Travelling in Bangkok?

106
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,800
What about a campaign on
Living Life in Bangkok?

107
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,923
“Living Life” in Bangkok?

108
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:41,440
Sounds interesting.

109
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,160
What next?

110
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,360
I haven’t thought about it yet.

111
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,680
But if I can think of an idea,
I will let you know.

112
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,760
Once you have an idea, just text me.

113
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,960
Sure.

114
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,880
Go glam up. Your date will be waiting.

115
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,000
Don’t tease me. Please excuse me.

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,400
Have fun.

117
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,560
Goodbye.

118
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,360
Prapai means late.

119
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,680
Pupaa.

120
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,440
You look great today.
Aren’t you going in?

121
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,080
I’m waiting for my partner.

122
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,520
But it’s late already.
Do you want to go in with me first?

123
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,060
Hey, how do I look?

124
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,440
I’ve practiced my walk too.

125
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,280
Meena, this is Prapai.

126
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Hello.

127
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,120
Yes, hello.

128
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,240
I didn’t accidentally step on her foot,
right?

129
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,760
Why does she seem like
she doesn’t like me?

130
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,500
It’s late, let’s go inside.

131
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,480
Be careful.
I thought you said you practiced.

132
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,920
I’m sorry I’m late again.

133
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,380
If you know you’re going to be late,

134
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,480
just let me know in advance.

135
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,880
Girls always take time
in dressing up for parties like this.

136
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,760
Am I pretty?

137
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,960
Well,

138
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
it’s alright.

139
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,360
Can I look as good as you?

140
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,240
Prapai.

141
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,960
Hey, Pupaa.

142
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,840
What about Wawa?

143
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,440
I’ll go find my friends first.

144
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,500
Ta.

145
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,280
When are you going to stop
being like this?

146
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,440
And what’s your problem?

147
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,040
Of course. Wawa is my friend.

148
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,000
You’re dating her.

149
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,120
You have to be responsible
for your actions.

150
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,120
How about you?
How did you come with Pupaa?

151
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,940
Well,

152
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,400
you’re so close with my friend nowadays.

153
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,800
So I don’t think you should be
telling others what to do,

154
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
if you can’t even do it yourself.

155
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,240
Ta, actually I was the one
who asked her...

156
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,440
Sure.

157
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,720
From now on, I will not mess with you.

158
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,320
I think that’s enough.
Are you going to finish all that?

159
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,400
Yes, I will. Don’t stop me.

160
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,200
You’ll get fat.

161
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,440
I don’t care.
Because desserts make me happy.

162
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,160
Like this one,
makes me 5 minutes happier.

163
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,400
This one, makes me 10 minutes happier.

164
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,920
And this one,
makes me 15 minutes happier.

165
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,480
So I’ll take it.

166
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,560
- Hello.
- Hello.

167
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,480
How are you all? Are you having fun?

168
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,720
But before we continue on having fun,

169
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,480
let’s do a replay on the past.

170
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,660
In this session,

171
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,040
- Photo gallery, a memory of the past.
- Photo gallery, a memory of the past.

172
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,360
Let’s hear for a round of applause.

173
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,640
After our small video
of the memory of the past,

174
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,720
it’s time for what everyone is
for waiting.

175
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,680
- No, waiting for.
- No, waiting for.

176
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,480
But we would like to invite everyone

177
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,920
to the dance floor.

178
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,280
Let’s not waste any more time. Music.

179
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,160
Let’s go.

180
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,520
Come on.

181
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,480
Where are you going?

182
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,040
I can’t dance.

183
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,120
Come here, I’ll teach you the moves.

184
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,040
Follow me.
It’s not as difficult as math.

185
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,960
I don’t know how to dance like this.

186
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,480
What a good dancer.

187
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,440
Do you care for a dance?

188
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,800
Can I borrow your partner?

189
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,120
Sure, I’m about to take a break.

190
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,160
Please excuse me.

191
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,320
Where are you going? Come dance with me.

192
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,960
Let go of me, Ta.

193
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,520
Ever since I told you how I felt,

194
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,360
you’ve always rejected me.

195
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,000
Can you not make a scene?

196
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,880
Please excuse me.

197
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,720
You want to play
with my feelings, right?

198
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,120
You always shout at me.

199
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,360
But did you know that
everything happened because of you?

200
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,640
Ta, that’s enough.

201
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,440
I beg you, Ta.

202
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
Don’t hurt anyone anymore.

203
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,600
I’m going to go now.
Take care of yourself.

204
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,440
I’m sorry I ruined your night.

205
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,960
I should be the one saying sorry.

206
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,640
If I hadn’t invited you to this party,

207
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,520
you wouldn’t have to face this.

208
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,760
And I don’t really like parties
like this anyway.

209
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,680
You can go back to Ta.

210
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,960
Ta will be mad at you too.

211
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
I invited you to this party.

212
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,720
So I should be taking care of you.

213
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
Can you walk?

214
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,920
Yeah.

215
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,680
Hop on.

216
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,920
No worries, I can walk.

217
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,720
No need to feel bad.
This isn’t the first time anyway.

218
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,640
Come.

219
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,500
I told you about your heels.

220
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,880
It’s too high to carry your weight.

221
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,840
If it hurts, then stop trying.

222
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,720
Wait for me here.

223
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,240
I’ll put on some medicine,
so it won’t swell tomorrow.

224
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,320
Actually, he’s really gentle.

225
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Ouch.

226
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,320
Be gentle. Are you insane?

227
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,440
I’m just massaging the medicine for you.

228
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,240
Ouch. I said be gentle.
I’m not going to let you do it anymore.

229
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,680
Be gentle.

230
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,800
Ouch. I said be gentle.

231
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,960
Ouch. That’s enough. Stop.

232
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,620
Ouch.

233
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,800
Be gentle.
Why do you keep pushing so hard?

234
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,800
What are you doing, mom?

235
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,440
Can you hear that noise?

236
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,160
It’s the girl’s voice.

237
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,240
Or is he hurting her?

238
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,120
Should we go in and help her?

239
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,160
I don’t think we should disturb them.

240
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,440
Maybe they are doing...

241
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,960
What does that mean?

242
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,720
You’re still too young to know.

243
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,880
Go on, back to your homework.

244
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,440
Be gentle.

245
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,880
Ouch.

246
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,000
Be gentle.

247
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,640
Ouch.

248
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,960
Thank you. I think I’m better now.

249
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,240
This handkerchief helped me
so many times already.

250
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,720
Cleaned my tears and saliva.

251
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,400
I’ll wash it and return it to you.

252
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,800
Ta.

253
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,420
Are you alright?

254
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,040
You don’t look so well.

255
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,800
Is everything alright?

256
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,400
I ruined everything.

257
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,120
It’s alright. I’m always beside you.

258
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,120
Rule number four,
do not enter my personal space.

259
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,400
If you violate it again,
be prepared to pack your bags.

260
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,960
You’re close again, Prapai,
you nearly did it again.

261
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,960
Stop it, Prapai, he’s your gay friend.
Stop thinking like that.

262
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,000
(Thank you for last night)

263
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,080
(I hope you can find a better guy)

264
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,720
(And not get stuck with Ta)

265
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,440
Will he think that I’m saying Ta is bad?

266
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
No, no.

267
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,200
(Thank you for last night)

268
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,120
(I’m glad I have you as a roommate)

269
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,880
Oh my god, Prapai. You’re dead.

270
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,360
Pretend as if you saw nothing.
Maybe pretend sleepwalking?

271
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,120
Hey.

272
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
What is this?

273
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,160
I just wanted to thank you.

274
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,120
Who taught you
how to fold airplanes like this?

275
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,040
Like this.

276
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Both sides.

277
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,920
Yeah, both sides.

278
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Fold both sides.

279
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,320
And then fold it in like this.

280
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,760
It will help reduce wind resistance.

281
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,240
And it will help with
navigating the direction.

282
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,320
Sounds like I’ve heard it before.

283
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,760
But I can’t really remember.

284
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,000
How is it again?

285
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,440
Like this.

286
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,040
You don’t have to be so close.

287
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,480
Of course, I’m a girl.

288
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,720
Hey, slow down. I can’t catch up.

289
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,160
How is it again?

290
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,640
Fold it down.

291
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,680
Fold it down.

292
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,760
Then fold the right and then the left.

293
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,240
Fold it down.

294
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Fold it down like this.
And then the left too, fold it down.

295
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,040
Wow, your folding skill is great.

296
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,200
So I’ll get back to work now.

297
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
Oh.

298
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,040
Don’t you want to take it with you?

299
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,920
Then can I have it? Yours is better.

300
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,560
I’m out.

301
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,720
Who is this girl? Do you know?

302
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,280
Oh wow.

303
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,080
Hey.

304
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,080
Why...

305
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,560
He’s here now. Go ask him.

306
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,240
I’m scared.

307
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,480
Hello, Professor.

308
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Hello there.

309
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,040
Ask him. Ask.

310
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,280
Is there something going on?

311
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,880
Last night’s party was fun, yeah?

312
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,360
But who’s that girl?
You never mentioned her.

313
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,260
Well,

314
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,860
just a friend of mine.

315
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,160
So I invited her to the party.

316
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,980
This is a big issue.

317
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,480
I don’t think you’re just friends.

318
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,200
(How can you do this?
You’re not from this department.)

319
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,720
Ta, that’s enough.

320
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,760
(This guy is disgusting.
Pupaa is so much better.)

321
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,800
Ta, I beg you.

322
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,200
(Who is this girl?
Why did Pupaa help her?)

323
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,080
I’ve got a friend
who’s become viral on social media.

324
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,380
Just like in the Chinese series.

325
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,480
This is so romantic.

326
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,880
Should I even be happy about this?

327
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,080
If he knows that it’s going viral,

328
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,000
I’ll probably be dead.

329
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,640
Stupid Ta. Getting me in trouble again.

330
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,960
Hey, I have to go now.

331
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,240
Have you seen those photos?

332
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,560
Yes, I have.

333
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,120
I’m sorry.
I didn’t want to get you in trouble.

334
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,240
Why are you apologizing?
It’s not your fault.

335
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,600
Aren’t you worried?
Everyone’s gossiping about you.

336
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,720
No, people just say whatever.

337
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,120
When a new rumor comes,
they’ll forget about it.

338
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,840
Wow, you’re so strong.

339
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,600
But I don’t have the guts
to go to university anymore.

340
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,280
You’re stressing out too much,
your wrinkles are showing.

341
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,920
I’m wrinkly?

342
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,640
Wait a minute.

343
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,680
- Come here first.
- What?

344
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,680
Sit down there.

345
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,560
Sit down.

346
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,160
I know you’ve been through a lot too.

347
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,080
We’re in the same position.

348
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,800
Here, I’ll do a mask for you.

349
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,880
I just want to thank you.

350
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,160
Come on.

351
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,120
Hey.

352
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,440
Hey.

353
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,440
What are they doing?

354
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,060
What are you doing?

355
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,520
Nothing’s happening.
Let’s continue with your homework.

356
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,720
Why are the hormones
of teenagers these days so strong?

357
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,980
Ouch.

358
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,920
Hey, that hurts.

359
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,640
It’s huge.

360
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,200
It’s tiny. How is it big?

361
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,440
Hey, it’s coming.

362
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,160
OK, OK, calm down.

363
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,880
- I know, I’ll catch it. Stop.
- It’s going to fly.

364
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,280
Hurry up.

365
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,040
- Fairy Prapai will help you now.
- Kill it.

366
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,040
Let me see, little roach.

367
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,080
Hurry up. It’s flying.

368
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,640
- Don’t worry.
- Hey. You touched it. No!

369
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,120
Little roach,
do you want to go be with big sister?

370
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,240
- No.
- Do you?

371
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,800
I’ll let you go.

372
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Throw it away.

373
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,240
What are you laughing at?

374
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,720
Nothing. I wasn’t laughing.

375
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,040
You’re the one who made this room messy.

376
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,360
That’s why the cockroach is here.

377
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,120
From now on,
you will have to double the chores.

378
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,840
What? Why are you blaming me?

379
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,080
Stupid guy.

380
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,380
Pupaa, which one

381
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,680
do you think is better?

382
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,900
I’ve been sleeping late lately.

383
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,640
Both my eyes are like pandas now.

384
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,400
Look at this. It has vitamin C.

385
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,320
It will help with pigmentation problems.

386
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,400
And it’s also made from
natural extracts.

387
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,440
I knew I had to ask you.

388
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,120
Then I’ll buy it
and we can use it together.

389
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,480
Hey, your shirt still has a tag.

390
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,200
Oh true. Can you take it off for me?

391
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,360
All done.

392
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,560
Thank you.

393
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
Bye.

394
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,000
Hello, Tookta.

395
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Hi there.

396
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,400
Did you just drop off Tintin?

397
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,280
Yes, I did.

398
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,900
It’s great that
during the mornings Tintin

399
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,280
doesn’t cry like other kids.

400
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,160
He’s great. I’m so sleepy.

401
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,520
How can you not be sleepy?

402
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,480
You were playing catch
so late last night.

403
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,320
You heard us?

404
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,960
I’m sorry to disturb you.

405
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,500
He was running around,

406
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,640
I had to catch him all night.

407
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,920
It’s giving me the tingles.

408
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,280
Don’t worry. I understand you.

409
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,640
But you should take care of yourself.

410
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,320
I know you’re still young,
but you need to use protection.

411
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,760
The brand I’m representing
also has condoms.

412
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,480
I’ll give you some to try out,

413
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,960
so you don’t get pregnant.

414
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,000
Wait a minute.

415
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,360
I don’t think you understand me.

416
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,280
You don’t have to be shy.
I’ve got one child already.

417
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,120
I know it’s natural.

418
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,080
You’re misunderstanding me.

419
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,040
I meant I was playing catch
with a cockroach.

420
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,280
Oh really?

421
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,780
Yes, it’s true.

422
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,000
Why would I be having something
with Pupaa?

423
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,560
Why not?

424
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,800
Girls and guys living together
can always have something going on.

425
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,780
Oh.

426
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,200
No, we can’t. I’ll probably be cursed.

427
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,960
Why so?

428
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,600
Pupaa doesn’t like girls.

429
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,480
Oh my god.
I think you’re misunderstanding.

430
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,520
No, I’m not.

431
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,300
Pupaa’s type

432
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:35,000
must be tall,
good-shaped like a basketball player.

433
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,160
Oh my god. I couldn’t tell.

434
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,120
My radar is broken.

435
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,480
I know, right?

436
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,480
But you can’t tell anyone at all.

437
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,840
Alright, I won’t tell.

438
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,720
Thank you. I have to go to work now.

439
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,840
Goodbye.

440
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,680
Bye.

441
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,120
Prapai.

442
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,280
Oh, how can I help you, Faye?

443
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,640
About Living Life in Bangkok
that you said you’d help me with,

444
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,040
how is it going?
Have you had any other ideas?

445
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,960
I haven’t had time to think about it.

446
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,160
I thought you promised me.

447
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,520
I’m sorry. I’m a bit busy these days.

448
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,200
Prapai, I understand

449
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,320
that you only live once,

450
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,480
but don’t let it ruin your work.

451
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,340
See,

452
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,360
I’ve been talking to Pon,
the creative director.

453
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,760
He seems interested.

454
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,800
Really?

455
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,920
Umm.

456
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,880
I’ll try to finish off the idea.

457
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,680
Then send me the idea tonight.

458
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,920
Sure.

459
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,840
Alright, I won’t disturb you now.
You can continue working.

460
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,400
Be careful the devil Pla will scold you.

461
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,520
Wait, calm down first, Pai.

462
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,520
What do you think you’re doing, Ta?

463
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,640
Listen to me first.

464
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,640
The other day at the party,

465
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,320
I was really drunk.

466
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,280
I didn’t know what I was doing.

467
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,800
I’m really sorry.

468
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,000
Hold on, Pai, listen to me.

469
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,600
I’m really sorry. Can you forgive me?

470
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,280
Pupaa.

471
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,120
You’re here in time.

472
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,920
How was your work? Are you tired?

473
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,320
Just a bit.

474
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,160
You can stop following me.

475
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,160
Pupaa will misunderstand
that I like you.

476
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,080
Are you two dating?

477
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,240
No, we’re not. I’ve got to go.

478
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,480
Even if me and Pupaa are not dating,

479
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,960
it doesn’t mean I have to forgive you.

480
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,240
I’ve heard you apologize too often.

481
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,200
I’ve always forgiven you.

482
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,760
But from now on,
your apologies mean nothing.

483
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,880
Hey you. Why didn’t you help me?

484
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,000
I thought we were friends.

485
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,720
Your roommate is in trouble.
Don’t you think of helping?

486
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,160
Hey.

487
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,020
Or you’re afraid Ta
will misunderstand you,

488
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,280
so you didn’t help me?

489
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,720
So you’re going to keep
making up excuses like this?

490
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,880
Facing the truth

491
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,120
will end things better.

492
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,760
Take off your shoes and put them away.

493
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,400
Excuse me,
the restaurant is closing now.

494
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,480
Okay.

495
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,360
(How can you do this?
You’re not from this department.)

496
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,160
(This guy is disgusting.)

497
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,120
Stop looking at it.

498
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,200
Here you go.
Pai wanted me to give it to you.

499
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,540
I thought it was getting close
to the submission date.

500
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,780
So I printed it for you.

501
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,760
I’ll hold on to it for you first,
so it doesn’t get dirty.

502
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,240
Thank you.

503
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,480
You’ve always been nice to me.

504
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,680
You know that drinking causes trouble,
and you’re still drinking?

505
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,160
Have you met Prapai?

506
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,360
Yeah, I did.

507
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,000
She seems happy.

508
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,000
It seems like
she’s doing it for real this time.

509
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,880
It’s impossible to forgive me.

510
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,800
You know she can’t be mad
at anyone for long.

511
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,840
Give her some time.

512
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,680
I think she’ll be better soon.

513
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,320
Aren’t you mad at me?

514
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,040
There’s a meeting
in the condominium today.

515
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,720
You have to go with me.

516
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,960
Why do I have to go?

517
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,080
You’re the owner of the room.
Why don’t you go?

518
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,840
If you don’t want to stay here,
then you don’t have to go.

519
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,360
I’ll go. Who said I wasn’t going?

520
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,200
Alright.

521
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,040
I am going to introduce you
to the waste management policy.

522
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,760
The community is rushing
to implement it.

523
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,680
Everyone will be receiving
the instructions next month.

524
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,000
The project that I introduced...

525
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,740
Look at Pupaa.

526
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,680
- Won’t stop staring at Mr. Jo.
- That is...

527
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,040
The idea of 3R1S

528
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,040
What does 3R1S contain?

529
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,080
- This is his type.
- That is...

530
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,480
Reduce, reuse and recycle.

531
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,880
What is reduce?

532
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,880
Reduce is to minimize the usage

533
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,280
to reduce the amount of wastes.

534
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,320
Reuse is to put...

535
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,360
That’s good. So he can move on from Ta.

536
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,160
to be able to reduce and reuse
without any expenses.

537
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,960
Your policy is great.

538
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,200
I’m glad there’s someone
who’s strict on this.

539
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,200
Thank you.

540
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,620
If we can really

541
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,400
make it into a
zero waste community, it would be great.

542
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,440
I would like to do that too.

543
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,100
Hey you, Jo is my boyfriend.

544
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,160
Stop trying.

545
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,760
Is there a problem? Can we calm down?

546
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,760
I think there’s a misunderstanding.

547
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,280
You can stop hoping,
so you don’t have to feel worse.

548
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,680
Let’s go. Don’t get into trouble.

549
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,680
We’re in the same building.
We’ll probably meet up often.

550
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,940
There’re so many more better guys,

551
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,800
I’ll help introduce them to you.

552
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,040
What did you say?

553
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,560
Let me tell you something,
Jo likes women.

554
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,560
Yes, and so?

555
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,040
Stop pretending.

556
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,020
I heard it all

557
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,840
that your friend said you like Jo.

558
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,920
I know you don’t want to
let anyone know about this,

559
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,360
but I’ll tell them
that you actually like me.

560
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,960
So everything will end.

561
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,480
And when you’re with me,
you can just be yourself.

562
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,360
What are you doing?

563
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,680
I’m 100% man.

564
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,240
If you don’t believe me,
do you want to try?

565
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,920
(Special scene)

566
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,000
Ta, that’s enough.

567
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,960
I beg you, Ta.

568
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,920
Oh boy, Ta.
You got me into trouble again.

569
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,240
I have to go now.

570
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,640
I’m sorry.

571
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,880
I didn’t want you to get into trouble
because of me.

572
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,760
You’re stressing out too much,
your wrinkles are showing.
