30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Hello, tree.

31
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,880
My name is Prapai.

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,920
It’s so nice.
You have many friends around you.

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,400
Unlike me.

34
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,760
Even though I’ve got so many people
around me,

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,640
but why do I feel like I’m all alone?

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,640
Even though today’s Valentine’s day,

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
but I have to be all lonely here.

38
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,920
Sometimes,

39
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,640
I don’t even know what I’m doing here.

40
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,880
Prapai.

41
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,040
Prapai.

42
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,520
Hey, I’ve passed this way before.

43
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,600
Hey.

44
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,120
Hey, it’s the same tree.

45
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,040
Hey.

46
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,880
This is the same route.

47
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,640
Hey, why is my battery out now?

48
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,520
Calm down, Prapai.

49
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Concentrate. Just calm down, calm down.

50
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,820
That should be the Triones,

51
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,560
or the Big Dipper.

52
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,880
If you can find
the Triones constellation,

53
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,600
you’ll be able to find
other constellations too.

54
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,080
This means that this is the North.

55
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,560
If I follow this star,

56
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,120
I will be able to find you,
right, Pupaa?

57
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,240
Prapai.

58
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,400
Prapai.

59
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,280
Prapai.

60
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,200
Prapai.

61
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,080
Prapai.

62
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,600
Prapai, Prapai.

63
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,960
It’s me, Pai.

64
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,640
It’s me, Pai.

65
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,000
Pupaa.

66
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,920
It’s okay, I’m here now.

67
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,680
Why did you come out here all alone?

68
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,000
I was worried sick.

69
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,520
I don’t understand
what you guys are saying.

70
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,880
So I didn’t want to be there.

71
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,920
So I just came out for a walk.

72
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,200
But I kept walking round and round
and I got lost.

73
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,640
I’m sorry.

74
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,560
It’s alright.

75
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,800
Pai, what’s wrong?

76
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,920
No, nothing.

77
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,840
I don’t believe you.

78
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,800
You’re looking at something
on my shoulder.

79
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,160
- Hey, get it out.
- Don’t move, don’t move.

80
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,000
- What is it? Get it out, get it off.
- Okay, okay. I got it.

81
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,800
- Get it off me.
- Oh, tiny caterpillar. Come here.

82
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,760
Please get out.
Don’t mess with my Pupaa.

83
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,840
- It’s gone.
- Is it gone?

84
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,640
Um.

85
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,440
It’s already late. Let’s go back.

86
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,320
I’ll take you out of here.

87
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,080
Come on, let’s go.

88
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
I always have to let you help me.

89
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,600
Who said so?

90
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,440
You just helped me
get the caterpillar off.

91
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,400
And that chili chocolate
the other day too.

92
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,880
No matter how smart the scientist is,

93
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,120
we can’t think of that.

94
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,640
Everyone has their own expertise.

95
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,440
And you’ve done what you’re good at
pretty well.

96
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,120
Therefore,

97
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,880
you don’t have to understand
what I study.

98
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,400
Hey, is that them?

99
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,880
Stop, stop.

100
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,600
You guys can continue.

101
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,280
Let’s go.

102
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,160
- Let’s go back.
- Um.

103
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,600
- Be careful.
- Um.

104
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,600
I’ll go take a shower first.

105
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,080
I’m all sticky.

106
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Um.

107
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Here, can you take it?

108
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,520
Here, your clothes.

109
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,960
Thank you.

110
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
Hey.

111
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,040
Hey.

112
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,700
That’s a huge mirror.

113
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,400
Why didn’t you tell me?

114
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,880
I was about to.

115
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,320
Well.

116
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,840
How about this? When you shower,

117
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,160
I’ll go wait outside.

118
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,480
Don’t be dumb.

119
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,080
It’s so hot outside.

120
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
And you’ve been working hard all day.

121
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,320
Then how are you going to shower?

122
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,480
You’re going to let me see everything?

123
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,360
Are you crazy?

124
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,760
I’ll just shower like this.

125
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,920
You’ve been lost for a long while.

126
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,200
I guess you’re hungry.

127
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,440
Go have some dinner.

128
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,840
And I’ll sort out this bathroom issue.

129
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,520
Um.

130
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,680
Dinner is there.

131
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,520
Okay.

132
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
Wow.

133
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,120
It’s so good.

134
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,080
The bathroom is all done.

135
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,120
What a Pupaa idea.

136
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,200
Happy Valentine’s day.

137
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,400
Thank you.

138
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,840
Here, I’ll put it on for you.

139
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,920
What a pity it’s past midnight.

140
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,800
There’s nothing to feel bad about.

141
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,960
It’s just a name of a day.

142
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,040
I love you every day

143
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,960
anyway.

144
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,200
So then this necklace

145
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,160
means never changing love.

146
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,720
Right?

147
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,120
Actually,

148
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,120
there’s not substance
that does not change.

149
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,560
Because everything has a reason to be.

150
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,060
But human was the one who invented

151
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,200
value of numbers.

152
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,840
The value of pi is a constant number
that will never change.

153
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,320
I...

154
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,280
May I?

155
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,720
Your shirt...

156
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,680
- You...
- You...

157
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,040
- Yes?
- Yes?

158
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,800
- You go first.
- You go first.

159
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,200
I’ll go get you some water.

160
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,480
I guess you’re thirsty.

161
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,480
Sure, sure.

162
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,560
I’m really thirsty. Thank you.

163
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,440
Don’t worry.

164
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,000
I’ll be back as soon as possible.

165
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Then,

166
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,400
can you give this to Kwang for me?

167
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,280
And also

168
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,520
open this when I’m gone.

169
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,960
Hey. Come on, I’ll drop you off.

170
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
It’s alright. You go ahead.

171
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,760
Pupaa, I saw an announcement today.

172
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,040
They said there’s going to be
a short film competition.

173
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,800
Its topic is about memory of love.

174
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,840
So I was thinking of competing.

175
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,560
Hello.

176
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,240
Hello, Prapai.

177
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,480
Hello, Pupaa.

178
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,040
Have you had anything to eat?

179
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,080
Not yet. I’ve been working.

180
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,520
Oh.

181
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,160
How have you been? Busy?

182
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,400
A little busy.

183
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,120
But once I add in a few data here,
it should be done.

184
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,400
Um.

185
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,800
You don’t have to worry about me.

186
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,000
Focus on your research.

187
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,720
Keep fighting.

188
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,080
Bye.

189
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,680
Cartoon.

190
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,560
Prapai.

191
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,920
What’s going on here?

192
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,940
Of course something’s going on.

193
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,440
Our company competed
in a short film competition and won.

194
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,400
Isn’t it great?

195
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,360
A short film?

196
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,240
Won a prize?

197
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,200
Yes. Look here.

198
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,760
Time’s acting skills is great.

199
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,520
But what’s better is Faye’s idea.

200
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,280
Her script writing skill is great.

201
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,080
Such a great creative director.

202
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
This is so good.

203
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,960
Faye?

204
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,960
Yes.

205
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Faye is so happy.

206
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,880
The boss is so proud of her.

207
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,480
It’s so good.

208
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,680
Cartoon, Cartoon, come here.

209
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,400
Time, what do you want to eat today?

210
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,760
I’ll let you have anything.

211
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,400
I’ll give you one cheat day today.

212
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,100
Why are you suddenly being nice to me?

213
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,040
What do you want?

214
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,320
You’ve been doing great.

215
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,760
So I just wanted to give you an award.

216
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,120
Doing great at what?

217
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,400
Do you remember

218
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,120
that you went to

219
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,760
play in C Agency’s short film?

220
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,680
There’re a million views right now.

221
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,120
It covered up all of your rumors.

222
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,640
Either the rumor about drugging a girl,

223
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,580
hurting your fans,

224
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,480
and the latest, about your ex.

225
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,760
There’re so many series projects
contacting you for work.

226
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,200
What a flow of cash.

227
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,400
Look at the news.

228
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,840
Here, look at it.

229
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,620
(C Agency won first prize)
Faye, the director of the short film,

230
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,360
said there’s going to be a press round
of the winning team.

231
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,160
And also a Q&A session.
I’ve locked your schedule.

232
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,000
Until then, we can wear our new clothes
to promote too.

233
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,960
And also...

234
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,320
Time.

235
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,520
Thank you for calling
to congratulate me.

236
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,040
Whenever you want to create
any more advertisements,

237
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,400
you can always call me.

238
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,360
Faye.

239
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,560
I assure you I will do my best
like I did in the short film.

240
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,720
Sure. Goodbye.

241
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,400
Why is it you
who directed the short film?

242
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
Oh, Pai, you’re back?

243
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,400
I need an explanation.

244
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,720
An explanation of what?

245
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,240
A great feedback
from the viewers like this.

246
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,000
I’m so proud, I have nothing to say.

247
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,720
But I was the one
who created this project.

248
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,960
But who submitted it for you?

249
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,560
Actually,

250
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,040
you didn’t seem to care
about this project that much.

251
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,080
The project wasn’t even submitted,
and you went off on a holiday.

252
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,240
And the fact that
you got Time to play for you

253
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,200
is because you’re working
in this company.

254
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,960
Otherwise, you wouldn’t have known Time.

255
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,640
Right?

256
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,560
I want to talk to Pon.

257
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,600
Sure.

258
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,280
Yim, have you seen Pon?

259
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,760
I haven’t seen him, Pai.

260
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
(Prapai)
Prapai,

261
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,920
(I have a big meeting with the Professors)
I have a big meeting with the Professors.

262
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,480
(I may be busy all day)
I may be busy all day.

263
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,960
(Cheer for me too)
Cheer for me too.

264
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,160
I’ll call you when I’m done.

265
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,880
Pon, where have you been?

266
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,400
She said she was going to find you.

267
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
I don’t know where she’s gone now.

268
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,360
I don’t know what’s the fuss.

269
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,760
Pon.

270
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,200
The short film competition,

271
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,920
you know I was the one
who did it, right?

272
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,000
Let’s go talk somewhere else.

273
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,040
I need an explanation.

274
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,360
Otherwise, I’ll go talk to the boss.

275
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,440
Are you threatening us?

276
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,800
I just went to see my lawyers.

277
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,040
They say that any work

278
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,480
that is produced
by an employee of a company

279
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,360
is considered as
an asset of the company.

280
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,600
So if Faye wants to say that,
she is not wrong.

281
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,520
But the actors, photographers

282
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,240
are all my friends.

283
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,720
Time

284
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,400
isn’t also contracted
under the company’s name.

285
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,280
But we included everyone
in the end credit, including you.

286
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,020
Someone your age,

287
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,480
having a name in the production
that won an award is great already.

288
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,600
You knew about this since the beginning,
right?

289
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,120
Do you think what you did was right?

290
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,520
The system of working in a company
is like this.

291
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,440
You alone couldn’t have done it.

292
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,800
You’d still need the resources
from the company.

293
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,440
The fact that you’re able to work
for a leading company like this,

294
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,560
even if you didn’t even graduate
from this area,

295
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,360
it’s not easy, and you know that.

296
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,960
Make sure you keep your job.

297
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,480
(Movie Night)
This is the Q&A party invitation.

298
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,880
I want you to go.

299
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,300
Because you

300
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,880
also “contributed” in this project.

301
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,600
And the other staff,

302
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,000
I’ll arrange a party later.

303
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,080
(Movie Night)

304
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,280
Come on, let’s go.

305
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,920
How did you know I’m here?

306
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,480
Are you a stalker?

307
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,000
No, no.

308
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,000
I’m a superhero.

309
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,080
Are you that free
to be coming to me here?

310
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
I don’t want you to be alone.

311
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
In situations like this,

312
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,920
it’s better to have me messing around
than you being alone.

313
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,840
Am I right?

314
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Alright, let’s just go.

315
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,200
I want to go now. Let’s go.

316
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,280
Get in.

317
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
The experimental data
are very accurate.

318
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,960
And the result is inspiring.

319
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,880
But why didn’t you try
different brightness levels?

320
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,080
Maybe we’ll find out other phenomena

321
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,000
that might help us with the research.

322
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,960
Using different divergent materials

323
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,600
to see the best result.

324
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,760
But it may take some time.

325
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,280
No, it won’t.

326
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,280
I’ll finish the experiment
in the shortest possible time.

327
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,640
Um, good, keep it going.

328
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,960
We’ll head out for lunch.

329
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,800
See you.

330
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,760
OK.

331
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,600
Welcome.

332
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,880
What would you like?

333
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,520
I’ll have one latte, and one iced cocoa.

334
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,560
Extra sweet.

335
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,400
Sure.

336
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,120
You know me well.

337
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,680
- Extra whip cream too, please.
- Sure.

338
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,760
Hey. You really are stressed,
aren’t you?

339
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,200
Um.

340
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,320
(Movie Night)

341
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,520
I’m going to attend
to congratulate on your project too.

342
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,680
They even had the guts
to invite me to go.

343
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,400
You don’t have to say much.

344
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,380
Just sue them.

345
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,240
I’ll get the lawyers for you.

346
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,240
Oh.

347
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,560
From what they said,
it’s going to be difficult.

348
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,320
I guess Pon was right.

349
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,240
All work created by a company’s employee
belongs to the company.

350
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,960
But it should be under your name.

351
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,360
Not Faye’s.

352
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,040
Just quit from that company.

353
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,600
And just post it on social media.

354
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,720
I’ll think of the caption for you.

355
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,680
“The secret of the latest work
and a hot celebrity like Time”.

356
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,440
“Famous company falsely claims
employees work”.

357
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,400
How about this one?

358
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,760
“Revealing the story

359
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,000
behind company’s senior and leaders,
cooperate in a scandal”.

360
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Hey.

361
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,500
A superstar like me
thinking of a caption for you,

362
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,520
don’t you like any of them?

363
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,600
I’ll get fired that way.

364
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,720
Do you know?

365
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,600
I’ve always dreamed of
working in Bangkok.

366
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,640
I’ll probably have to keep this job.

367
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,160
Just like Faye said.

368
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,600
And you’re just going to let it go
like this?

369
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,520
What do you want me to do?

370
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,640
Forget it.

371
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,920
I guess it’s just my bad luck.

372
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,640
Does Pupaa know about this yet?

373
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Or are you and Pupaa

374
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,280
over?

375
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,320
Watch your mouth.

376
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,440
He’s just still busy,

377
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,480
so I haven’t told him yet.

378
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,200
That sucks.

379
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,000
Girlfriend always comes first.

380
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,480
Don’t talk about Pupaa like that.

381
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,840
Thank you.

382
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
Thank you.

383
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,800
(Pupaa)

384
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
Hey, what are you doing?

385
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,480
- Let me see.
- Give it to me.

386
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
Who called?

387
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,920
Hello. What’s up, Pupaa?

388
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,240
Hello, Prapai.
I’m done with the experiment.

389
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,960
The experiment went well today.

390
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,060
Just only a few experiments left

391
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,480
for additional data.

392
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,480
Um.

393
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,920
I want you to come back already.

394
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,760
Don’t worry.
This should be the last part.

395
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,200
If I don’t go back soon,

396
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,120
I bet someone’s going to steal you
from me.

397
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,600
Prapai, are you alright?

398
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,960
Oh, nothing. I’m okay.

399
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,000
Wait for me.
I’ll be back as soon as possible.

400
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,280
What’s wrong with you?

401
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,880
Oh, nothing.

402
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,160
I got bit by a dog.

403
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,600
Pupaa. Hello?

404
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,360
Are you still there?

405
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,480
Just turn on the camera,
I have something to say to Time.

406
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,800
Um.

407
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,960
Hi.

408
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,400
How did you know I’m with her?

409
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,600
The possibility.

410
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,080
Seems like you really miss me.

411
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,800
Stop messing with Prapai.

412
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,000
If I don’t, what are you going to do?

413
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,120
Look. We’re really close to each other.

414
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,720
Hey.

415
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,480
Hey, is that your new girlfriend?

416
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,960
No, she’s not.

417
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,920
She’s one of the team members.

418
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,640
If you can have someone close to you,

419
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,480
then Prapai doesn’t have to
feel bad about it too.

420
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,640
Prapai, I’ll be back
as soon as possible.

421
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,680
Um. I’ll wait for you.

422
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,720
If you’ve got anything, just tell me.

423
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,960
24 hours. I’ll have my phone on.

424
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,240
I know.

425
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,160
If I’ve got anything,
I’ll text you right away.

426
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,640
Alright, you can get back to work.

427
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,240
Okay.

428
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,120
Prapai.

429
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,680
Pupaa is always busy
with the experiment.

430
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,880
Don’t just always keep texting Pupaa.

431
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,880
Just do what you can on your own.

432
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,240
Hey, if you’re that busy,

433
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,400
I’ll take care of Prapai for you.

434
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,480
Your girlfriend just...

435
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,480
I’ve got to go now. Bye.

436
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,720
Think about it, I was the one
who came up with this project.

437
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,220
I was the one who cast the actors.

438
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,400
I also asked you for help
to be the set’s photographer.

439
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,620
But then

440
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,200
Faye just put her name
under the project.

441
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,220
If you have the chance,

442
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,920
you’ve got to help me prove it.

443
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,000
(Pupaa)

444
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,160
Sure, always.

445
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,760
Just let me know when.

446
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,440
Um.

447
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,800
But Pupaa doesn’t know
about this, right?

448
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,120
No. You must not tell Pupaa.

449
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,080
Currently he’s doing
a very important research,

450
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,080
I don’t want him to
lose concentration with this problem.

451
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,040
If Pupaa knows about it

452
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,400
and has a problem with his research,

453
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,800
you’re dead.

454
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,000
I know.

455
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,880
But actually, you really want Pupaa
to come back, don’t you?

456
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
Why is love so difficult to understand?

457
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,680
You’ve really changed.

458
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,640
I’ve never thought I’d hear anything
like this from you.

459
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,880
I’m being honest here. I’m not playing.

460
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,200
So what’s your problem? Tell me.

461
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,640
My dad wants me to go back to Chiang Mai

462
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,800
to continue his legacy
of the family’s business.

463
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,020
You know well

464
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,840
that my relatives are fighting for this.

465
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,640
And I don’t want to do it too.

466
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,720
Oh, so then what did Wawa say?

467
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,640
She told me to go.

468
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,480
Huh?

469
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,680
What do you think Wawa really thinks?

470
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,920
Why does she have to push me away?

471
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,120
Girls are difficult to understand.

472
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,300
(Wat Kalayanimitra)

473
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,680
Oh, dear God,

474
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,640
I hope Pupaa comes back to me soon.

475
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,400
If Pupaa comes back within today
or tomorrow,

476
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,280
I will bring you 100 boiled eggs.

477
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,760
No, I’ll do it again.

478
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,320
If Pupaa comes back within today
or tomorrow,

479
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,960
I will...

480
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,040
I will dance in order to honor you.

481
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,320
(Ticket number 23)

482
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,680
Ticket number 23.

483
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,440
Hey.

484
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,480
When talking about true love,

485
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,200
they say you’ll find one
in your hardest times.

486
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,600
How did you get here?

487
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,160
Why? Can’t I come to the temple too?

488
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,840
Can I read yours?
You’ve read mine already.

489
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,760
Let me see. Let me read it too.

490
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,960
Here, I’ll read it for you.

491
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,040
(Ticket number 25)
Ticket number 25

492
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,160
says that I’ll be able to win the heart
of a girl with short legs,

493
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,360
who’s short, clumsy, and eats a lot too.

494
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,960
This is very accurate.

495
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,520
So cute.

496
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,240
Hey, shorty, come here.

497
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,360
It looks so real.

498
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,600
A lot better than the first one.

499
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,640
I agree.

500
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,380
I think Pupaa’s project

501
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,840
will win a big reward this time.

502
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,360
Awesome, really awesome.

503
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,280
Congratulations, Pupaa.

504
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,520
You haven’t changed at all.

505
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,640
You always do your best in everything.

506
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,240
Thank you.

507
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,400
Um, the experiment is successful.

508
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,120
Can I go back to Thailand?

509
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:58,360
I have some emergency.

510
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,440
Well.

511
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,920
Actually

512
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,960
I was about to talk to you with this.

513
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,440
OK.

514
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,480
It’s difficult to have such

515
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,640
an excellent student like you.

516
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,280
So our university

517
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,240
will offer you scholarship

518
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,960
for you to further your study here

519
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,800
until you graduate with a Ph.D.

520
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,160
This is the application form.

521
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,560
Think about it.

522
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,040
OK.

523
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,160
(Application Form for
Beiqing University Scholarship)

524
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,160
Yes, mom?

525
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,280
Mom.

526
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,960
Hello.

527
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,120
How long are you here for?

528
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,080
I’ll be off
to another business trip soon.

529
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,520
I have a transit flight at this city,
so I just came by.

530
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,320
Mom.

531
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,840
Do you know any lawyers?

532
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,200
Especially those who specialize
in copyright laws.

533
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,080
Is there a problem with your experiment?

534
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,280
Why do you need a lawyer?

535
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,720
Nothing.

536
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,680
The work

537
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,480
just needs some information
from the lawyer.

538
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,600
Then I’ll send you the contacts

539
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,480
of the lawyer of my company to you.

540
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,000
Thank you.

541
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,960
Are you going to fly straight back
to Thailand?

542
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,440
Or are you going to continue
staying here?

543
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,800
Well,

544
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,880
I prefer to be back in Thailand.

545
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,480
Why so?

546
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,360
The curriculum here is better,
and the equipment is better.

547
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,160
There’s more creativity
and more chances for success here.

548
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,200
I think you should know best about this.

549
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,920
Mom,

550
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:51,400
why did you and dad choose to work
far away from each other?

551
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,720
What if someone has a problem,

552
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,440
and can’t be together.

553
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,800
Don’t you feel anything?

554
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,240
Even if our family is far apart,

555
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,200
but the relationship never fades.

556
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,420
But the reason that we are not together,

557
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,640
is because we have responsibilities.

558
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,200
If we could choose,
we probably wouldn’t choose to do this.

559
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,440
Thank you, mom.

560
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,680
You’re not having this problem, are you?

561
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,160
I know what I have to do next.

562
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,480
I have to get back to work now.

563
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,400
Take care of yourself.

564
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,240
Goodbye, mom.

565
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,960
(Pupaa)

566
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,360
Prapai.

567
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,400
Just handle what you can by yourself.

568
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,840
(Pupaa)

569
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,040
My clever Prapai, keep fighting.

570
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,440
Hey, did you know?

571
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,680
When it happened, I was so mad.

572
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,280
I couldn’t think of a solution.

573
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,760
All I thought was it would’ve
been better if you were here.

574
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,640
But Ta and Time said they’ll help me.

575
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,740
But when they help

576
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,040
they’ll also be effected by it.

577
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,000
Kwang was right.

578
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,760
I shouldn’t let others
be helping me all the time,

579
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,520
waiting for others to help.

580
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,480
I need to rely on myself.

581
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,920
I will bring back what belongs to me.

582
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,960
My clever Prapai, keep fighting.

583
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,960
Don’t forget to cheer for me, Pupaa.

584
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,700
(I want to ask about some legal advice)

585
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,460
(My girlfriend’s work
was stolen by her boss)

586
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:30,960
(by claiming it as her own)

587
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,520
(Seek for the truth and find evidence)

588
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,520
(Ta, call me when you’re awake)

589
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,560
I’m glad you like it.

590
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,040
Hello, Mr. Tum, Mrs. Add.

591
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,440
- Thank you.
- Please.

592
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,920
Please.

593
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,440
Squeeze in more.

594
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,000
Look here.

595
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,360
This one here.

596
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,120
Time, Time. Come here.

597
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,280
Time, this camera, please.

598
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,760
- Sure.
- Come on.

599
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,280
The other side, please.

600
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,500
This camera too.

601
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,400
- Hello there, Time.
- Hello.

602
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,840
Please feel comfortable.

603
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,920
Thank you.

604
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,520
I’ll have to excuse myself.

605
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,920
Great.

606
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,960
Thank you.

607
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,880
Why are you dressed like this today?

608
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,840
I’m just a regular employee
who contributed in this project.

609
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,400
Dressing up won’t look too good.

610
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,600
If you want to dress accordingly,

611
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,460
you’ll have to

612
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,600
dress up as Wonder Woman.

613
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,640
So you can find the bad guys here.

614
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,840
Do you want a superhero to help?

615
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,200
Don’t you dare do anything.

616
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,200
I warn you.

617
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,160
Otherwise, we’re done.

618
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,400
Is there something going on?

619
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,200
Nothing.

620
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,080
Maybe I’m seeing things.

621
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,040
We nearly got caught.

622
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,480
Thank god we hid first.

623
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,240
Keep it quiet, or we’ll get caught.

624
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,400
The plan will be wrecked.

625
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,600
We’re undercover like this,

626
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,320
it’s impossible to be caught like this.

627
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,160
So pretty.

628
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,260
(Q&A PARTY)

629
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,920
(Film by Fuangfah Suriya
C Agency Co., Ltd.)

630
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,640
It’s time for the Q&A session.

631
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,000
May I please invite all guests here.

632
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,880
Who would like to ask
the first question?

633
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,320
The lady at the back, please.

634
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,040
What was your inspiration
to create this short film?

635
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,600
The meaning of love.

636
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,800
Over the past years,
I have been collecting information,

637
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,360
both from direct experiences

638
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,440
and many stories.

639
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,920
I’ve written many stories.

640
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,160
But I think this one is the best by far.

641
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,720
So I decided to do it.

642
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,200
There might be a following episode too.

643
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,880
But I don’t think so.

644
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,120
Because I was the one
who did this short film.

645
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,380
Hold on.

646
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,360
Is it true?

647
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,000
I thought of everything.
Faye has nothing to do with it.

648
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,740
Really?

649
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,420
That’s impossible.

650
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,960
What are you talking about?

651
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,600
Everyone, excuse me.

652
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,000
If you want the evidence,

653
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,620
I’ll prove it to you.

654
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,440
Because I have all the information
about it.

655
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,080
You can just copy all the information
into the thumb drive for me.

656
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,640
I’ll sort it out for you.

657
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,960
Did you...

658
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,720
Prapai.

659
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,360
It’s not nice to be accusing me
like this.

660
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,720
If you don’t have other evidences,

661
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,200
I might have to sue you.

662
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,160
Is it so?

663
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,040
What’s the matter?

664
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,440
I can be the witness.

665
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,200
I am the photographer
of this short film.

666
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,880
And this girl here is the leading role.

667
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,840
We can prove to you that
Prapai was the one who directed it,

668
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,040
and planned everything herself.

669
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,320
You’ve known Prapai for a long time,

670
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,760
why would you do this to her?

671
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,320
You guys are all going
against me, right?

672
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,440
You’re all friends.

673
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,540
You have to be on her side.

674
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,880
There’s not enough weight here.

675
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,120
Hey sis,
why are you accusing us like this?

676
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,900
Security.

677
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,280
Take out the uninvited guests.

678
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,080
Wait, what is this?

679
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,280
Stop.

680
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,160
- Hey, let go.
- Let go.

681
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,720
What if I’m the one proving it?

682
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,720
The work that everyone is seeing

683
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,360
What?

684
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,920
is all done by her.

685
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,280
Why is it like this?

686
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,800
Prapai, the fact that I let you
help out a few projects

687
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,680
doesn’t mean that this project is yours.

688
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,100
Do you know the consequences

689
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,280
of your actions
for accusing your company?

690
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
You too, Time.
Do you think people will believe you?

691
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,080
I know your relationship with her
is not just friends.

692
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,680
Oh really?

693
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,680
What?

694
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,400
Is that true?

695
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,600
That’s Lisa, Time’s ex.
Why is she here?

696
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,600
Is that his ex-girlfriend?

697
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,520
What?

698
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,420
Oh my god.

699
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,240
Hello, Lisa.

700
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,400
I heard a rumor about Time.

701
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,760
He’s planning to open up
about his new relationship

702
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,080
during the Q&A session of my short film.

703
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,840
I just wanted to tell you.

704
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,440
In case you wanted to congratulate him.

705
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,640
Lisa, hi.

706
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,400
Hello.

707
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,920
Lisa just came to congratulate

708
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,600
with our agency.

709
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,480
And also Time.

710
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,640
Are you both not mad at each other
anymore?

711
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,560
So you’re here to congratulate Time
with his new girlfriend, right?

712
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,900
Prapai, the girl

713
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,880
who had the problem with the fans.

714
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,760
She’s the one

715
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,880
who got drunk and he took her out.

716
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,640
So that means

717
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,600
there’s really something going on
between you two, right?

718
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,000
So when did you guys start dating?

719
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,400
Did you date with her before

720
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,120
or after you were dating Lisa?

721
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,360
Time, can you please answer?

722
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,620
So everything you just said,

723
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,400
was to protect your new girlfriend,
right?

724
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,480
Is that right?

725
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,240
Am I right?

726
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,480
- So you’re helping your new girlfriend?
- Is that true?

727
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,920
Time, please answer.

728
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,400
- Does she just want the work?
- Really?

729
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,760

Everyone please listen to me.

Me and Prapai are just friends.

And we have nothing more than that.

733
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,960
That means you think of her
only as friends?
