30
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,560
Wawa.

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
Great job.

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,800
Because I’ve got good support here.

33
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,640
Prapai.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,120
I’ll drop off Wawa myself today.

35
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,040
I want to be a good boyfriend.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I’m sorry, Pai,

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,140
I forgot to tell you last night.

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,000
Ta and I are dating now.

39
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,520
Then I’ll let you drop her off.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,620
But it seems like it’s going to rain.

41
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,320
Do you want to come with us?

42
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,640
No worries. You guys can go.
I can go by myself.

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,880
Do you want me to drop you off
at the front?

44
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,280
I said no.

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,920
I have something to do.
I have to go now.

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,260
Then I’ll go shower first.

47
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,580
Wait for me here.

48
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,260
Okay.

49
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,400
Let’s go shower.

50
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,880
You and Wawa,

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,880
when did you like each other?

52
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Why are you asking?
Are you jealous of me?

53
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,880
I thought you liked Pai all along.

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,440
Pai and I have known each other
for too long.

55
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,840
I’ll never have feelings for her.

56
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,160
Maybe people see us being close,
so they just think like that.

57
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,920
I’m going now.

58
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,760
Hey you, what are you doing here?

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Are you alright?

60
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,000
No, I’m not.

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,400
I’ve been left out again.

62
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,320
Pupaa is also heartbroken from Ta too.

63
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,720
I guess we’re in the same shoes.

64
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,120
You’re probably as sad as I am.

65
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,480
I want to be strong like you too.

66
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,800
It’s good that it’s raining.

67
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,520
So no one can see my tears.

68
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,640
Don’t you need it?

69
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,960
It’s fine.

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,680
My hair is wet anyway.

71
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,240
Pupaa.

72
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,560
Wait for me, Pupaa.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,060
We can go together.

74
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,440
You don’t need to act cool.

75
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,840
You.

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
I’ll hold it for you.

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,560
Oh, the rain stopped.

78
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,040
Just like what they say,

79
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,840
there is no rainbow without rain.

80
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,160
If the rainbow was here,

81
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,000
it should be a good sign to start over.

82
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,680
Look at this.

83
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,760
A rainbow.

84
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,040
Isn’t it strange?

85
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,600
Whenever I’m in a bad position,

86
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,080
you’re always here to help me.

87
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,640
It makes me feel what I’ve experienced
wasn’t so bad.

88
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
You can keep it.

89
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,840
So you don’t forget

90
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,680
that you can always start over.

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Thank you.

92
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,800
Yes, mom?

93
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,920
How are you, Prapai?
This semester is nearly over, right?

94
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,520
I’m doing well.

95
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,320
Just a little busy
with the final project.

96
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,800
What about your job search?
How is it going?

97
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,320
I’ve had interviews
with a couple of places already,

98
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,000
but still waiting for them
to contact back.

99
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,080
Pai, it’s very difficult
to find a job in Bangkok.

100
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,200
If it’s too much,
you can come back home.

101
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,400
Mom, your daughter is a talented girl.

102
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,380
They’ll contact back soon.

103
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,560
Don’t worry.

104
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,880
I’m not worrying.
I know a lot of people.

105
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,440
I can help refer you as an accountant
to a good company.

106
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,560
Mom, are you even listening to me?

107
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,000
Don’t worry. I can get a job on my own.

108
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,140
Up to you.

109
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,240
If it’s too much, just come back home.

110
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,360
Yes, mom.

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,960
Take care of yourself.

112
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,560
I miss you.

113
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,400
I miss you too, mom.

114
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
See?

115
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,960
There’re so many other guys
for you to like.

116
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,720
Now you’re ending up
like an old vegetable.

117
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,280
I wasn’t stressing about that.

118
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,400
Really?

119
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,880
I think I’m over with Ta.

120
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,280
I really am this time.

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,840
I’ve heard you say this
since first year.

122
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,280
You’re graduating soon,
but you’re still saying the same thing.

123
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,840
Good morning, new Prapai. Fighting.

124
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,760
(Start a new day with a smile)

125
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,520
(Start a new day with a smile)

126
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,600
(Ta)

127
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,680
The formula uniform circular motion
should help.

128
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,640
V=2πrf.
[*V=velocity π=pi r=radius f=frequency]

129
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,520
Oh my god.

130
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,360
Amazing.

131
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,480
Why did I not think of this formula?

132
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,360
This is great.

133
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,760
Who are you?

134
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,880
Oh, Pupaa, you’re here already?

135
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,680
Oh, Pupaa.

136
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,480
The person Meena keeps talking about,
right?

137
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:47,940
Yes, sir.

138
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,160
The person I said whose brain waves
is faster than electricity.

139
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,960
I believe so.

140
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,840
What are you doing now?

141
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,440
I am currently doing some research.

142
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,400
Your ideas are very interesting.

143
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,020
Does this mean that you accept Pupaa

144
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,760
to help with the research?

145
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,400
Let’s say...

146
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,420
Summarize this work for me.

147
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,160
If you do well,

148
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,520
I’ll take you in.

149
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,480
Sure, professor.
I will finish it as soon as I can.

150
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,000
Goodbye.

151
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,440
He’s so motivated.

152
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,800
I love it.

153
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,400
Excuse me, can I sit here?

154
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,280
Oh, this seat is taken.

155
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,720
Alright.

156
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,660
(Maesa, where are you?)

157
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,840
(Pai, I’m still presenting.)

158
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
How did you get here?

159
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,960
I soiled your handkerchief.

160
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,120
I’ll go wash it for you.

161
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,680
It’s alright, I’ll wash it myself.

162
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,600
You won’t wash it clean enough.

163
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,520
Alright.

164
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,100
Hey you, who is this girl?

165
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,040
She invited Pupaa too.

166
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,160
I don’t know either.

167
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,480
You put in the wrong number. It’s 23046.

168
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,960
Not 406.

169
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,720
You’re right.

170
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,680
Wow.

171
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,280
Your eyes are like a hawk.

172
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,600
So,

173
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,720
do you think this is correct?

174
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,720
It’s wrong.

175
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,240
How is it possible?

176
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,680
Pupaa is helping her with her work.

177
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,400
Normally he never talks to anyone.

178
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,520
What does this part mean?

179
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,000
I don’t know too.

180
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,400
Pupaa,
can you please teach us this part?

181
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,840
I’m not quite familiar with this topic.

182
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,200
How about this one here?

183
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,580
- A girl is flirting with you.
- History subject...

184
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,200
You should be uncomfortable.

185
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,080
I’m not quite sure too.
You should ask your professor.

186
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,880
I’ll help you.

187
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,520
What are you reading?

188
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,040
I’m reading Prince Rupert’s Drop.

189
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,280
Prince Rupert’s Drop. What’s that?

190
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,520
You really want to know?

191
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,840
It is one of the physical phenomena
of glass.

192
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,000
A molten glass.

193
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,960
When dropped into cold water,

194
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,100
it will become the “glass’ tears”.

195
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,200
Shaped like a tadpole.

196
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,080
It is stronger than other glasses.

197
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,480
Layering it with an object of 8 tonnes
won’t even break it.

198
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,900
But if it’s squeezed or pressed

199
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,760
at the end of the tail by only a bit,

200
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,240
it will shatter completely.

201
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,280
Many things on this earth
that seems strong,

202
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,320
it is truly very fragile.

203
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,640
Wow, I can picture what you’re saying.

204
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,140
What are they talking about?

205
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,680
They don’t even see us.

206
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,420
Let’s go.

207
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:03,980
That’s it.

208
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,960
Success.

209
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,920
I’m hungry.

210
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,840
Let’s go have lunch.

211
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,320
My treat today.

212
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,000
You helped me a lot.

213
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,040
Never mind.

214
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,160
No, it’s not okay.

215
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,860
You helped me

216
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,840
with completing my assignment.

217
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,440
I’ll pay for you. Don’t be shy.

218
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,680
Normally...

219
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,760
You don’t have to worry.

220
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,400
Let’s go eat.

221
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,360
This place is the best.

222
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,480
I’m sure you’ll love it.

223
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,520
Come on, let’s go.

224
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,480
Come on, quickly.

225
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,760
Come on, pack up.

226
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,480
Get up. Quickly.

227
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,120
Quick, quick.

228
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,720
Come on.

229
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,320
I’ll have papaya salad.

230
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,120
Just like my usual.

231
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,040
And some steamed clams.

232
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,160
Pork spicy salad.

233
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,400
And garlic stir-fried with frog.

234
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,440
How about you? Do you want anything?

235
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,400
I’ll have a grilled fish.

236
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,080
And also a sharing spoon.

237
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,800
That’s all you’re having?

238
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Do you want a hot and sour soup?

239
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,840
It’s their signature dish too.

240
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,640
No, thanks, I don’t like spicy food.

241
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,000
How about this one?

242
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,560
No, I don’t eat intestines.

243
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,560
It can cause hyperlipidemia.

244
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,480
How about sticky rice?

245
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,760
- No.
- No.

246
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,120
I don’t eat carbs for dinner.

247
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,240
If that’s all you want,
then it’s up to you.

248
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,120
I’ll also have one bowl
of sticky rice too.

249
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,720
Thank you.

250
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,520
Give me your hand.

251
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,280
Give me your hand.

252
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,280
The other side too.

253
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Don’t worry, I use food grade.

254
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
I’m digging in.

255
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,280
Oh, my lovely papaya salad.

256
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,200
This is delicious.

257
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,180
You’re really

258
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,960
not respecting our traditional dish.

259
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,200
Can I have some?

260
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Wait.

261
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,600
This dipping sauce is delicious.

262
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,560
You’re eating too spicy.
Be careful of your kidneys.

263
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,880
How do you eat that?

264
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,720
That fish looks bland.

265
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,560
But this one I haven’t tried.

266
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,760
I’ll let you try first. Try it.

267
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,400
How is it? Is it good?

268
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,120
What is it?

269
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,200
It’s garlic stir-fried with frog.

270
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,160
Here’s water.

271
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,500
Have some water.

272
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,160
Hello, Wawa.

273
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,680
Do you want to have dinner?

274
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,760
You don’t want it anymore?

275
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,920
Do you want to try this papaya salad?

276
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,960
What a coincidence.

277
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,500
Me and Wawa
are about to have dinner here.

278
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,680
Can I sit with you?

279
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,680
It’s more fun
having dinner with lots of people.

280
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,080
Excuse me, can I order, please?

281
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,780
Thank you.

282
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,680
I’ll have one grilled pork neck.

283
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,520
And one spicy pork salad.

284
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,640
And I’ll have another
set of plates and cutleries, please.

285
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,160
I called you many times
and you wouldn’t pick up.

286
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,120
Now I know you’re busy.

287
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,800
Yes, I’m very busy.

288
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,340
Busy with doing my project.

289
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,560
So I can finally start something new.

290
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,940
Nowadays,

291
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,320
since you’ve had new friends,
you’ve forgotten an old friend like me.

292
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,980
How about the poster
you said you’d do for me?

293
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,920
Is it nearly done?

294
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,880
I’ve already sent it to you ages ago.
If you checked my e-mails,

295
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,640
you would’ve seen it.

296
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,400
I called you many times
and you wouldn’t pick up.

297
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,000
If you answered my calls,
I would’ve known.

298
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,920
Am I right, Pupaa?

299
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,280
Ta.

300
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,880
You didn’t tell me Pai and Pupaa
were coming too.

301
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,760
I didn’t invite them,
I accidentally met them here.

302
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,840
Take a seat. I already ordered for you.

303
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,760
Sit here.

304
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,880
These two suit each other, don’t they?

305
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,600
Have this first.

306
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,560
I don’t like spicy food.

307
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,240
It’s alright.
I’ll have the grilled pork neck.

308
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh, Pai.

309
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,640
How was your interview the other day?

310
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,760
Let’s not talk about it.

311
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,760
I applied for the creative position,

312
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,720
but they were looking for an accountant.

313
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,560
You’re graduating from accounting,
shouldn’t you be doing accounting?

314
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,680
Better salary and a more stable job.

315
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,120
It’s difficult to find jobs
in the advertising area.

316
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,760
It’s a lot of work too.

317
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,480
The creative job is better off
as a part-time job for you.

318
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,920
There’s something in this world called

319
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,760
“Prince Rupert’s Drop”.

320
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,760
It’s the melting of glass
into a tadpole shape,

321
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,700
and drop it into cold water,

322
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,400
making it rain made by glass.

323
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,360
Tears.

324
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,160
Yes, tears of glass.

325
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,040
What’s next?

326
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,840
It’s just like work.

327
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,000
We may see some jobs
as being more stable,

328
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
but there are also downsides to it.

329
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,360
Exactly.

330
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,700
Pai,

331
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,580
are you interested

332
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,800
in physics nowadays?

333
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,880
Obviously.

334
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,360
Because Pai is close with Pupaa.

335
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,040
She should know a lot about physics
from him.

336
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,960
Yes.

337
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,600
I just

338
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,740
want to know more about other things,
other than food

339
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,240
and something nonsense.

340
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,040
So others can’t look down on me.

341
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,400
Do you want some flowers?

342
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,920
They look beautiful.

343
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,240
Do you want it?

344
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,240
I’ll have one rose.

345
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,700
Yes, sir.

346
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,720
Thank you. Here you go.

347
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,440
Do you have any more roses?

348
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,240
I’m out. There’s only the yellow one.

349
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
The magnolia is fine.

350
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,060
Thank you.

351
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,060
Thank you.

352
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,640
Here, for you.

353
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,840
I bought it especially for you,
stop being mad at me.

354
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,440
If you don’t want it, I’ll take it.

355
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
I have to go now.

356
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,480
Pay for me.

357
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,080
You said it’s your treat.

358
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,480
Pupaa, wait for me.

359
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,520
I met Prapai at the library.

360
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,480
And I helped her with her work.

361
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,680
So she thanked me with a meal.

362
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,640
What else do you want to know?

363
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,200
I didn’t say anything.

364
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,320
Prapai is a friendly person.

365
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,960
She gets close with people easily.

366
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,980
And she’s not quite careful

367
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,040
with distancing herself from guys.

368
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,660
Anyway,

369
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,360
can you help distance yourself?

370
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,740
But it’s interesting

371
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,760
you didn’t know about it.

372
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,880
About what?

373
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,000
Prapai is allergic to pollen.

374
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,480
Who told you?

375
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,720
You should learn to notice more details.

376
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,440
Ta seems to care about you a lot.

377
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,880
Since I’ve known Ta,

378
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,880
I’ve never seen him take care of anyone
as much as with you.

379
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,760
You know you’re really lucky.

380
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,720
Most of his exes,

381
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,600
I have to take care of them for him.

382
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,880
Wawa, what happened? Why are you crying?

383
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,800
Did I say something wrong? I’m sorry.

384
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,880
Ta doesn’t care about me as you said.

385
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
He doesn’t sound like
he wants to talk when he calls me,

386
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,320
he said he’d call back but he never did.

387
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,720
The reason he’s being nice to me today

388
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,400
is because he wants to make you upset.

389
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,720
Calm down.

390
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,040
Stop crying.

391
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,800
Let’s calm down.

392
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,080
Pai, can you help me?

393
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,960
At least make him open up to me.

394
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,680
I know he listens to you.

395
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,400
Can you help me, please, Pai?

396
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,480
I really like Ta.

397
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,800
Please help me.

398
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,480
Alright, I’ll find a chance
to talk to him.

399
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,280
Don’t think too much.

400
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,320
Stop crying. Look at you, all messy now.

401
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,560
That’s enough. Come on, let’s go home.

402
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,120
No more crying.

403
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,880
Come on, smile.

404
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,720
Just start over. You can do it, Prapai.

405
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,280
I’m here to submit my seminar assignment
for Professor Samitree’s class.

406
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
Just leave it there.

407
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,720
Thank you.

408
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,760
Hello there.

409
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,720
I’ve read the work you’ve handed in.
You’re fantastic.

410
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,560
You’ve read it already?
But I just submitted it.

411
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,280
Oh, who’s that? Isn’t it Pupaa?

412
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,640
No, I’m not.

413
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,360
Anyway, please pass on the message.

414
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,840
I’m accepting him
into the research team.

415
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,600
He can start next week.

416
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,160
Yes, sure.

417
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,960
(Faye)

418
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,440
Hi, hello.

419
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,960
Is Prapai not there?

420
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,200
Oh, Prapai?

421
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,240
Yes.

422
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,320
Alright,
I’ll let Prapai know to call you back.

423
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,160
Thank you.

424
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,560
This is my number.

425
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,080
What? Hello?

426
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,120
I’m Pupaa.

427
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,040
Oh, Pupaa.

428
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,400
Our phones must have swapped.

429
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,920
Where are you?
I’ll bring your phone over.

430
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,360
OK, I’ll go to you. Wait for me.

431
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,920
Pupaa.

432
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,320
Here you go.

433
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,040
We have the same phone.

434
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,880
Our bags too.

435
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,640
We even met at the library
the other day too. What a coincidence.

436
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,760
Just a statistical possibility.

437
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,700
Oh,

438
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,060
someone called Faye called you.

439
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,840
You should call back.

440
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,240
Oh yeah, someone called you too.

441
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,880
He said

442
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,840
you’re fantastic.

443
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,260
You should go help with the research,

444
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,480
and you can start next week.

445
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,520
That’s all?

446
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,080
Aren’t you happy? You just got a job.

447
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,320
I am happy.

448
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,920
But I already calculated
that I will be getting the job anyway.

449
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,400
I’ve got to go now.

450
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,080
Such a show-off.

451
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,100
So confident.

452
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,760
Hello, Prapai.

453
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,120
Hello, what’s up, Faye?

454
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,140
How are you?

455
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,600
You haven’t contacted me
since you finished your internship.

456
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,800
I’m doing well.

457
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,560
Are you interested in a full-time job?

458
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,480
At the advertising agency?

459
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,400
Yes, exactly.

460
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,860
Ann, the person you did your
accounting intern with,

461
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,120
she left to take care of her child.

462
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,940
You used to do intern here,

463
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,520
so you already know the process here.

464
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,120
I wanted to ask you
to come join the team again.

465
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,800
So we don’t need to find someone new
to start over.

466
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,080
In accounting?

467
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,260
Can I think about it first?

468
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,000
I’ll contact back as soon as possible.

469
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,360
OK, sure.

470
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,900
That’s great. Your project is done.

471
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,320
You’ve got a job offer.

472
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,720
Prapai, you should
take this opportunity.

473
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,240
It’s so difficult
to find a job these days.

474
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,460
But if it’s a job that you don’t like,

475
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,360
you’ll have to stick with it
for a few more years.

476
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,960
I think you should take a break
for a while.

477
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,360
One day you’ll be offered the job
you want to do.

478
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,840
Where did Wawa go?

479
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
Yeah, right.

480
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,880
She has a date.

481
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,780
Since she’s been dating with Ta,

482
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,080
she hasn’t met up with friends at all.

483
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,440
New, can you not mention Ta?

484
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,540
I’m so frustrated.

485
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,000
I don’t know why she likes him.

486
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,840
Exactly.

487
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,840
What about that physics guy,
would he be better?

488
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,980
Exactly.
You being at the library with Pupaa

489
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,600
has become a rumor.

490
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,700
If you guys know the truth,

491
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,640
you won’t be teasing me like this.

492
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,280
Hi, mom.

493
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,420
Pai, how are you?

494
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,240
Has any company contacted you yet?

495
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,600
It’s fine if there hasn’t been any.

496
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,520
I met with Orn, one of my seniors,
the other day.

497
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,040
She’s an executive
at a well-known company.

498
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,640
I heard that the company is...

499
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,280
I’ve got an offer already, mom.

500
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,480
You don’t need to worry.
You don’t need to help me find a job.

501
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,200
I’ve got a job in Bangkok already.

502
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,280
And I’m not ready to go back
to work in Chiang Mai too.

503
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,880
Alright, mom? Thank you. Bye, mom.

504
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,080
Just like that?

505
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,880
That’s all I can do.

506
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,120
It’s great. At least you’ve decided.

507
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,360
Let’s cheers. Congratulations to Pai
on getting a job.

508
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,320
Yay, to Pai.

509
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,780
To the life after graduation.

510
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,280
Yay!

511
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,720
(Room for rent)

512
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,080
Welcome.

513
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,800
This is the living room.

514
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,520
We can go have a look inside.

515
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,200
Sure.

516
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,120
This is the bedroom.

517
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,640
Is everything okay?

518
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,840
Yes, okay.

519
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,360
Please come in.
Please come to this room.

520
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,120
You can have a look. The room is big.

521
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,960
Very comfortable.

522
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,880
You can invite your family over.
It’s very comfortable.

523
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,440
They forgot to pack it up with them.

524
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,520
It’s nothing much.

525
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,280
Have a look around.
The closet is also spacious.

526
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,800
I’m sorry. It’s nothing.

527
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,320
It’s my grandmother’s photo.
She forgot it here.

528
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,480
It’s nothing.

529
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,520
Oh, please wait.

530
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,880
I’ll take you to the other room.

531
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,600
Sure.

532
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,560
Hello.

533
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,960
How are you?
Have you got a new place yet?

534
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,120
None of them look good.

535
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,800
I’ve been everywhere already.

536
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,520
Some of the places
don’t even look like their photos.

537
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,880
But the good ones are very expensive.

538
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,640
I’ve seen a place I like.

539
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,740
But

540
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,600
the neighbors are unbelievable.

541
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,040
I just can’t.

542
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,280
I haven’t found any.

543
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,520
Thank you.

544
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,000
I have to go now.

545
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,120
I need some sugar right now. Bye.

546
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,400
Excuse me,
don’t think I’m being rude or anything.

547
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,080
I overheard you’re looking for
a room to rent, right?

548
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,080
Yes, I am.

549
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,200
I’m renting out a room.

550
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,720
You’re really lucky to have met me.

551
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,480
Because my client just canceled on me.

552
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,960
And the condominium is right next door.

553
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,840
You can have a look and decide later.

554
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,800
This one. This exact room.

555
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,480
Wow.

556
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,200
This room is spacious.

557
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,760
Do you like it?

558
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,520
You can have a walk around.

559
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,080
Wow, the view is great here.

560
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,560
You see, it’s lovely, isn’t it?

561
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,960
Where is the bedroom?

562
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,760
The bedroom is here. Come have a look.

563
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,840
Here it is.

564
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,400
Isn’t the bedroom big?

565
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,160
It’s very spacious.

566
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,360
Do you like it?

567
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,400
This place is really nice.

568
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,400
Isn’t it?

569
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,640
What about the neighbors?

570
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,480
I’m the one who lives next door.

571
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,720
You don’t need to worry.

572
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,940
The owner bought it ages ago,

573
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,040
it’s been a while
since they’ve been here.

574
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,720
This room is just everything.

575
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,520
But there’re two bedrooms,

576
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,880
and I’m living alone.
It may be too big for me.

577
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,160
Such a pity.

578
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,880
Well,

579
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,480
how about this?

580
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,600
I’ve never been so generous with anyone

581
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,680
to rent out only one room.

582
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:45,280
But I feel I have a connection with you.

583
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,920
So I’ll let you rent out one room.

584
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,880
Really?

585
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,620
Yes.

586
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,640
But you have to pay
for the first month’s rent first.

587
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,000
I’m already helping you a lot.

588
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,340
I don’t know what to do

589
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,480
if you’re not taking the offer.

590
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,760
And now I have to go pick up my child
from school.

591
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,120
Alright, I’ll pay for it now.

592
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,920
I’m so happy.
We’re going to be neighbors.

593
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,400
Me too.

594
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,300
I’ve set your work

595
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,240
and project schedule for you already.

596
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,460
And for the daily tasks,

597
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,640
I’ll call to remind you again.

598
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,920
Yeah, thank you.

599
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,040
Are you free this week?
Can you help me move?

600
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,120
Why are you moving?

601
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,940
Pai already moved out.

602
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,920
So I think I’m moving back home.

603
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,160
She moved out so fast,

604
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,400
maybe she found the place she likes.

605
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,560
I don’t know. I heard she got a job.

606
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,120
So she decided to move closer to work.

607
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,360
So now I have to travel more.

608
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,440
So where does she work?

609
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,400
Why don’t you ask her yourself?

610
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,840
Then I’ll go help you move this week.

611
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,520
Umm.

612
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,920
Why are you all packed up?

613
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,840
I want to concentrate on my research.

614
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,000
So I’m planning to move
to my condominium.

615
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,640
This is broken.
Why are you taking it with you?

616
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,400
It’s in the process of getting fixed.

617
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,400
Fixing?

618
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,160
Umm.

619
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,480
More of keeping it for the memories.

620
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,960
Or you’re afraid of missing me?

621
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,400
Don’t you worry, Pupaa.

622
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,080
No matter where you are,

623
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,360
I will follow you everywhere.

624
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,400
Yeah, right.

625
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,480
Don’t challenge me.

626
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,200
Do you need any help?

627
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,680
I’m all done. It’s fine.

628
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,640
I was just asking.

629
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,000
The owner of this room left it for rent,

630
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,480
and hasn’t been here for ages.
You can do whatever you want.

631
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,040
So cute.

632
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,080
And this...

633
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,120
little piggy.

634
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,960
But there’s one room you must not open.

635
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,440
You must not open.

636
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,800
Hello.

637
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,800
How is it going?
Your new place, new life.

638
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,920
It’s really great.
It’s like living a new life for real.

639
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,840
I feel so lucky to have met Tookta.

640
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,360
Really? I’ll go visit you sometime.

641
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,840
Stop right there,
you didn’t even help me with packing.

642
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,760
Because I had a job interview.

643
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,480
Who knows.

644
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,200
Whatever. Just be there alone then.

645
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,120
Hey, whose voice was that?

646
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,480
What voice? There’s nothing here.

647
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,280
Or the place is...

648
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,600
Nonsense.

649
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,720
There’s no ghost. Nonsense.

650
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,080
I’ve got to get up early tomorrow.
I’ll talk to you later.

651
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,360
It’s my first day too.

652
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,960
Got to go now.

653
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,140
Or Tookta offered a low rent

654
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:51,880
because...

655
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,200
In horror films,

656
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,880
if I left the room now,
I wouldn’t make it back.

657
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,800
(Special scene)

658
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,760
I’ll have one rose, please.

659
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:36,860
Yes, sir.

660
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,920
Thank you.

661
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,200
Here you go.

662
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,560
Do you have any more roses?

663
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,080
I’m out. There’s only the yellow one.

664
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,360
The magnolia is fine.

665
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,020
Thank you.

666
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,380
Thank you.

667
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,320
Here you go.

668
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,640
I bought it especially for you,
stop being mad at me.

669
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,480
If you don’t want it, I’ll take it.

670
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,040
I have to go now.

671
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,800
Pay for me.

672
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,280
Oh, you’re going already?

673
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,880
Pupaa, wait for me.
