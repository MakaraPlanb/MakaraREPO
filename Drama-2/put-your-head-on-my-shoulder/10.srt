30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
Seems like you always have something
to call on for Prapai.

31
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,560
If you have nothing else urgent,

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,920
I’ll have to take Prapai back now.

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,920
Because we were
in the middle of something.

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,760
Prapai’s job for today

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,120
is to hang out with me.

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,720
That’s enough.

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,320
We’ll all go together. Come on.

38
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,680
How are you? Do you need an inhaler?

39
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,680
Hey.

40
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,800
Are you okay?

41
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,520
Time. Come on this way.

42
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,180
(SAFETY FIRST)
Hey, wait for us.

43
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,800
What in the world is this?

44
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,520
Ah, Time!

45
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,920
Ah.

46
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,520
Calm down.

47
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,080
Everyone, calm down.

48
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
Sorry, excuse me.

49
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,340
(Exit)

50
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,840
How about Time? What should we do?

51
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,440
Once he gets out from the crowd,

52
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,360
he’ll call you anyway.

53
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,480
Let’s go.

54
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,920
It’s over.

55
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,560
Let’s go.

56
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,400
Hello, what’s up?

57
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,640
Hello. Where are you?
Come help me, quick.

58
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,920
Where are you?

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I’m hiding behind the bin ghost
in the haunted house.

60
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,320
I can’t get out at all.

61
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,520
Bin ghost?

62
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,280
What are you doing there?

63
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,840
Just come quick.

64
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,720
OK, OK. I’ll be there as soon as I can.

65
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,600
Let’s go. Come on.

66
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,300
(BIG DOUBLE SHOCK)

67
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,760
Oh my, there’re so many people.

68
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,020
If tomorrow there’s a viral

69
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,680
going on about
“an actor stuck in a haunted house”,

70
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,320
I think it’s going to be a big problem.

71
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
Calm down, I’ll go in for him.

72
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,960
Time. Where did he go? Time.

73
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,920
Why is it you?

74
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,400
You think I wanted to help you?

75
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,400
Wait, hold on.

76
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,480
Do you remember?

77
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,520
I helped you out at the club.

78
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,160
This time you have to help me.

79
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,600
Time.

80
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,240
Where did you go?

81
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
You can come out now.

82
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
I know.

83
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,360
Can I ask you something?

84
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,720
You like Prapai, right?

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,960
Silence.

86
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,920
I guess you haven’t confessed,
being this quiet.

87
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,520
If you don’t stop talking,

88
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,480
I’m going to go outside
and call all your fans to come in here.

89
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,920
Hold on, calm down.

90
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,760
Don’t forget. If this goes viral,
Prapai will be the one in trouble.

91
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,160
Then you have to promise that
you won’t be calling her for nothing.

92
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,280
No.

93
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,360
Then I’m out.

94
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,040
Okay. Deal.

95
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,000
Alright. I promise.

96
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,040
Keep your promise.

97
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,160
I know.

98
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,040
Then now how are we going to get out
through the crowd?

99
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,200
Have you got a plan?

100
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,840
(Time)

101
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,360
Time

102
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,320
just posted a photo
at the front of the amusement park.

103
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,200
I have to go now.
Otherwise, I’ll miss him.

104
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,360
Time. Time.

105
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,240
Hey.

106
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,400
Thank you anyway.

107
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,960
We have nothing between us anymore.

108
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Never mind.

109
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,280
Prapai, I’ll go drop you off.

110
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,880
Never mind. I’ll go drop her off myself.

111
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,080
You don’t have to worry.

112
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,800
Come on, let’s go.

113
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,880
Hello?

114
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Time, what are you doing
at the amusement park?

115
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,600
And why did you post that photo?
People will go crazy.

116
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,560
I know. I’m going home now.

117
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,320
Hey, it’s her.
She’s the one who came with Time.

118
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
These people are so annoying.

119
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,360
Let’s go.

120
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,880
Hey, if we follow her,
we might get to meet Time.

121
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,640
Come on, let’s follow them.

122
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,640
Where did she go?

123
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah, where did she go?

124
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,560
Let’s go that way.

125
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,880
I think they’re all gone.

126
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,240
I have to thank you very much for today.

127
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,920
For following me here.

128
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,640
You’ve got to thank your phone.
You forgot it.

129
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,760
Oh, right.

130
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,000
But I’m sorry

131
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,280
for ruining your date for practice.

132
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
It’s actually a good day today.

133
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,240
I’ll just take it as a new kind
of practice for a date.

134
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
(Siam Amazing Park)

135
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,960
Full of fashion and style.

136
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Living Life in Bangkok.

137
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,680
Cut.

138
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,360
Okay. I’m all clear.

139
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,440
That’s great.

140
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,880
We’re done!

141
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Thank you, everyone.

142
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,620
I guess you’ve learnt a lot
from the staff

143
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,760
about professionalism.

144
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,160
Sure.

145
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,600
- Okay.
- Thank you.

146
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,000
Are you okay?

147
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,820
Well, we’re all done shooting.

148
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,240
Shall we go and celebrate?

149
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,400
There’s a restaurant nearby.

150
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,280
Great idea. Everyone is welcome.

151
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,440
Do I have to go?

152
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,880
Yes, you can go.
But don’t forget to find new locations

153
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,560
for the next meeting.

154
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,720
Sure.

155
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Time.

156
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,400
Yes?

157
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,080
Come join us.

158
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,960
Sure.

159
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,380
Alright.

160
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
Okay.

161
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,440
(I’ll be late tonight.
Having dinner with the team.)

162
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,880
See you soon.

163
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Cheers.

164
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,840
Huh.

165
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,880
Ha ha.

166
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,440
Everyone, let’s play a game.

167
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,160
Sure.

168
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,840
This game is called “Truth or drink”.

169
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,160
We’ve got a bottle here.
We’re going to spin it.

170
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,480
Wherever the bottle stops,

171
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,560
that person must answer a question.

172
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,280
But it has to be true.

173
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,560
And who doesn’t answer, they must drink.

174
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,680
- Spin it.
- Let’s start.

175
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,480
Pon.

176
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
I have a question. Can I ask?

177
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,420
Pon.

178
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,680
Are you seeing anyone in the office?

179
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,480
Are you? Are you?

180
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,080
Yes.

181
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,680
I’ll just spin. I’m shy.

182
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,880
You love

183
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,720
only yourself, right, Mr. Superstar?

184
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,680
Are you teasing me, servant?

185
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,840
- Alright. My turn to spin now.
- Sure, go ahead.

186
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,840
Come on.

187
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,400
Prapai.

188
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,840
Then I can just ask, right?

189
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,080
Just ask, Time.

190
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,840
Bring it on.

191
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,960
You

192
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,480
already like someone, right?

193
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,520
Wow, a harsh one.

194
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,240
I... I...

195
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,560
I don’t know.

196
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,240
That’s not the answer.

197
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,960
But why

198
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,660
my heart raced
when I was at the amusement park?

199
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,040
I think it should be
because of those scary rides.

200
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,960
Or maybe because
you’ve had too much today.

201
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,000
Ta.

202
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,200
Can I have Wawa’s number?

203
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,840
Yes. I think it must be
because of those rides.

204
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,760
No, I don’t.

205
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:45,360
I don’t like him. No, I don’t.

206
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,880
And you’re not my type.

207
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,120
Bottoms up.

208
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,000
It’s either someone missing him.

209
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,160
Or talking behind his back.

210
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,160
You’re crazy.

211
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,880
(Prapai)

212
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,400
(I’ll be home late tonight.
Having dinner with the team.)

213
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,680
Come on, everyone. Let’s go home.

214
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,080
I’m leaving now, everyone.

215
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,560
Pai, I’m going now.

216
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Let’s go home.

217
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Hello.

218
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,440
How can I help you?

219
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
Are you drunk? Where are you?

220
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,200
I’m...

221
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,200
Where am I?

222
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,040
I’m around

223
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,880
Prasert-manukitch road.

224
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,880
Or is it Pradit-manutum road?
I’m close by to the highway.

225
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Just keep going straight
and you’ll get there.

226
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
Where are you? Send me the location.

227
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,200
I’m here.

228
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,600
Hey.

229
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,540
Interrupting people having fun

230
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,200
is not polite.

231
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,400
Where’s the restaurant?

232
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,760
I’ll go pick her up.

233
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,440
No. It’s going to be ages
before you get here.

234
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,720
It’ll be a waste of time.

235
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,240
I’ll go drop her off.

236
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,440
Hold on.

237
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,080
Professor, I have to go now.
See you later.

238
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Hey, can you clean up after me?

239
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
We’re at the car.

240
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,720
Just go sit in the car properly.

241
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,880
Okay.

242
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,840
Hey, how can you just
cut in front of the car?

243
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
Hey, what are you doing?

244
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,760
I told you
I would take care of Prapai myself.

245
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,120
Pupaa.

246
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,640
Time.

247
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,880
How can there be a double of you both?

248
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,920
Hey, servant.

249
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,000
You choose.
Who do you want to drop you off?

250
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,360
Work is done.
I’m not working anymore.

251
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,560
Pupaa, you’re here already?

252
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,360
Come on, let’s go home.

253
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,320
You alright?

254
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,880
Walk properly.

255
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
I can walk on my own. Don’t touch me.

256
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,920
Be careful of how you walk.

257
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,880
You’re the one not being careful.

258
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,240
You keep messing around close to me.

259
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
You keep making me miss you.

260
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,960
What did you say?

261
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,640
Hello. Who is this?

262
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,600
Hey, Pai.

263
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,440
This is me, Prapeng. Where are you?

264
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,000
You’re out drinking?

265
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,920
Hey, who’s drinking?

266
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,880
I’m not drinking.
What are you talking about?

267
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,000
You want a fight?

268
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
- Give it back.
- Hello?

269
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,280
I’m Prapai’s friend.

270
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,360
- She drank a lot. I’ll drop her off.
- Give it to me.

271
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,040
- Who’s that? What’s your name?
- Give me my phone.

272
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,200
What friend?
And you’re dropping her off?

273
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,720
Mom, mom. A guy is taking Pai home.

274
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,280
What are you doing to my daughter?
I’m going to call the police.

275
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,920
Hello, auntie.

276
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,000
You don’t have to worry.
I’m dropping her off as well.

277
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,600
There’re many of us together.

278
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,960
What are you saying, many of us?
There’re only me and you and you and me.

279
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,000
Just the two of us.

280
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,440
Prapai is drunk
and she’s talking nonsense.

281
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,640
I don’t know what she’s saying.

282
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,760
Wait, are you her roommate?

283
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,480
Yes, I am.

284
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,760
What is your name?

285
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,680
My name is Pa.

286
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,640
Oh. what a naughty daughter I’ve got.
Thank you, Pa.

287
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,520
Please take care of her.

288
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,160
Pa, come help me carry, Prapai.

289
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,760
I’ll have to go carry Prapai now.

290
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Why did you cover my mouth?

291
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,920
Yeah, right. Because I’m not beautiful.

292
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,440
I’m not stylish or your type like Wawa.

293
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,000
That’s not my type.

294
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,300
But I’m super hot.

295
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,240
Look at me, look.

296
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,960
♪Since when did I fall for you♪

297
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,020
♪And then you took over my heart
completely♪

298
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,680
♪It started as just an experiment,
but it didn’t take long for our hearts♪

299
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,660
♪Became one♪

300
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,920
See?
You’re starting to fall for me, right?

301
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,360
What are you doing?

302
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,840
Don’t move.

303
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,960
I never expected you liked Wawa.

304
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,280
Someone like you,

305
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,640
will you ever understand the feeling
of falling in love?

306
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,280
I do.

307
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,680
You’re the one who doesn’t understand.

308
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Time

309
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,880
is the new variable, I see.

310
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,640
I wasn’t wearing this last night.

311
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,080
Did I change? Why can’t I remember?

312
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,200
Or...

313
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,920
No!

314
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,040
Hold on.

315
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
How did I get home last night?

316
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,040
You’re up now. Go do the laundry.

317
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,660
I already put it in the basket for you.

318
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,820
Don’t leave it for long.

319
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,200
It will stink up the room.

320
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,800
Last night... My clothes...

321
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,920
Next time
don’t go drinking like this again.

322
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,160
If you want to go, take me with you.

323
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,440
You didn’t take off...

324
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,080
I made you some lemonade.
Have some so you don’t get hungover.

325
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
You’re in Bangkok, not Beijing.

326
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,800
Aren’t you hot wearing that?

327
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,920
The a/c in the laboratory is cold.

328
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,920
I have to get to work now.

329
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,360
Pupaa, you’re here? Come take a seat.

330
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,320
Why are you wearing a sweater?
It’s so hot.

331
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,400
Never mind.

332
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,280
How was last night’s experiment?

333
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
More complicated than expected.

334
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,000
I cannot make anything
of the main variable (Prapai).

335
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,640
And it seems like
there’s a new variable (Time) too.

336
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Now that’s fun.

337
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,120
If it’s getting this intense,
you have to show some ownership.

338
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,680
You can’t let it be like this.

339
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,680
Have you looked through
her social media?

340
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,020
I meant

341
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,760
have you looked at the exponentials?

342
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,680
Yeah.

343
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,480
Why should I be looking?

344
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,280
Oh, don’t you know anything at all?

345
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,840
Social media.

346
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,480
I mean the exponentials

347
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,920
will relate you to your fixed variable.

348
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,720
You should also study
your new variable too.

349
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,400
You should do some research.

350
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,800
So you can follow.
Just like how they say,

351
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,920
I can see...

352
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Right through you.

353
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Perfect.

354
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,400
Pai.

355
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,000
Pai.

356
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,840
Prapai.

357
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,000
Why are you gazing?

358
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,480
You look like you’re in love.

359
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,360
Are you out of your mind?
I was just thinking of other stuff.

360
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,280
But

361
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,320
how do you tell if someone’s in love?

362
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,240
No, I was just...

363
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Well, I’ve only liked one person, Ta.

364
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,920
And I’ve got one kind of reaction.
I just wanted to know

365
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,140
what other reactions there are.

366
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,400
Are there any other reactions?

367
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,720
Well, when you’re close to them,
your heart will beat faster.

368
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,640
And whenever you see them with someone,
you’ll be feeling frustrated.

369
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,880
Something like that.

370
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,240
And most importantly.

371
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,520
Whoever you think of first,

372
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,120
that’s the one.

373
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,000
Do I like Pupaa?

374
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,480
I should do an experiment.

375
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,600
My heart’s not beating fast.

376
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,720
Hey, nice watch.

377
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,520
It can measure heart rate, right?

378
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,280
Can I borrow?
I was thinking of getting one.

379
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,960
Thank you.

380
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,840
I’m out.

381
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,920
What else do you want?
If not, then just go to your room.

382
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,120
What about my watch?

383
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,960
Oh, your watch.

384
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,520
Prapai.

385
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,480
Are you sick?

386
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,580
An average heart rate

387
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,720
would be around 60-100 beats per minute.

388
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,200
But yours is up to 130.

389
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,840
Is it broken?
It just dropped, didn’t it?

390
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,600
My heart is beating fine.

391
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,280
I don’t think it’s broken.
It’s fall-proof.

392
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,360
I don’t know. I’m going to go sleep now.

393
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,920
Oh no, Prapai.

394
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
You really do like Pupaa.

395
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,520
But he has someone he likes already.

396
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,840
Where are you going?

397
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,080
I’m going to look for
some interesting locations

398
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,400
around Bangkok.

399
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,560
Doing some research for work.

400
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,000
I’ll head out now.

401
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Hold on.

402
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,200
Who are you going with?

403
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,240
Alone of course.

404
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,920
Where are you going?

405
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,720
Going with you.

406
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,760
You keep messing about going alone.

407
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
I’m free today. I’ll go with you.

408
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,760
Hurry up.

409
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,080
Yeah, one more photo.

410
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,720
Hey, look over there.

411
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,280
So many fishes.

412
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,200
Excuse me,
can you take a photo for us, please?

413
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,840
Sure.

414
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,040
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

415
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,840
Sure.

416
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,400
- OK. 1, 2.
- Let’s do this pose.

417
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
1, 2, 3.

418
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,000
Thank you.

419
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,040
All done.

420
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,720
Do you want a couple of photos too?

421
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,440
- No, thank you.
- Yes, please.

422
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,960
Hold my camera.

423
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,960
Sure. Let’s take one here.

424
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,440
Squeeze in a bit more, please.

425
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,640
A bit more, please.

426
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,720
Smile.

427
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,720
Can you get a little closer?

428
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,560
- Can the girl smile a bit more?
- There you go.

429
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,800
You can hold her from behind. 1, 2, 3.

430
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,880
Great.

431
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,040
Alright. I think that’s enough.
Thank you so much.

432
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,880
- Alright.
- Thank you.

433
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,160
What am I thinking?
I’m just his experiment subject.

434
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,000
Pai.

435
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,420
What’s your social media name?

436
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,520
I’ll tag you in the photo.

437
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,640
You should find me
when you search “Prapai”.

438
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,680
(Prapai)

439
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,840
(Pupaa. 341 likes. 10 comments.)

440
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,160
(Who is this Pupaa’s girlfriend?)

441
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,960
(Who is Pupaa’s girlfriend?)

442
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,620
(You seem like a lovely couple)

443
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,320
(Wow, what’s going here?)

444
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,280
It would be nice,
if Pupaa and I were really dating.

445
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,760
Will it ever be possible?

446
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,800
Pupaa.

447
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,400
Will you like me?

448
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,960
This is amazing, Meena.

449
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,400
I’m stunned.

450
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,400
Genius. This is genius.

451
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,680
Yes, yes. Just as I expected.

452
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,240
I love it. I’m so excited.

453
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,480
Great job.

454
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,140
Just adjust it a bit more.

455
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,960
Just only a bit left. Good work.

456
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,320
Hello, Professor.

457
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,240
Hello. Come on.

458
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,740
How is yours going?

459
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,560
Let me have a look. Let’s update.

460
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,360
Here you go.

461
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,240
Good. Let’s see.

462
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:39,120
I think that your research topic
is interesting.

463
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,380
But it’s very complicated.

464
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,480
If you want the scholarship,

465
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,800
you will need to do a lot more research.

466
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Go do some more research.

467
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,280
Sure.

468
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,720
Pupaa. You’re still here?

469
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,760
Yeah.

470
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,440
Are you stressed about the scholarship?

471
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,640
Yes.

472
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,480
Can I have a look?

473
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,060
You’ll have to modify a few formulas.

474
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,760
And some information is not complete.

475
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,720
Do you want me to help?
I’m free tomorrow.

476
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
Sure.

477
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,880
Hold on.

478
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,720
Where are you going
all dressed up like this?

479
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,080
Going to work with Meena.

480
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,120
Meena?

481
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,480
Or are there many experimental partners?

482
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,760
What did you say?

483
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,280
Nothing.

484
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,800
I didn’t say anything.

485
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,760
I’ll leave now.

486
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,600
I don’t see you dressing up like that
when going out with me.

487
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,700
(ICON SIAM)

488
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,480
I think this formula
should be used there.

489
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,960
Hey, can I have one cup of cocoa?

490
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,000
I think
apart from the wave interference,

491
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,360
you also need some information on
mediums needed for light transmissions.

492
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,040
I’m also looking into that.

493
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,340
For this research,

494
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,640
if you work with the engineering team
or programmers,

495
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,120
- it should be great.
- Are they speaking Thai?

496
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,240
But seeing your research topic,

497
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,480
I’m starting to worry about my own.

498
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,960
Yours is more interesting than mine.

499
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:51,920
I don’t think so.

500
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,980
I think yours is interesting too.

501
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,160
It seems beneficial.

502
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,000
- So much complimenting going on.
- Um.

503
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,600
I need to take this call.

504
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,680
Alright.

505
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,600
Prapai.

506
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,640
How did you know it’s me?

507
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,760
I knew as soon as you walked in.

508
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,040
Everyone will look at you anyway,
all dressed like this.

509
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,040
Why did you follow me?

510
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,720
Are you crazy? I didn’t follow you.

511
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,400
I just wanted some dessert.

512
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,680
So I came to buy a cocoa drink.

513
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,360
And I’m not that nonsense,

514
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,800
having to follow you around.

515
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,080
Really?

516
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,560
Did you have a plan with your friend,
Pupaa?

517
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,600
No.

518
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,560
No, I just happened to pass by.

519
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,620
Is your girlfriend upset?

520
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,800
That I’m here with you alone.

521
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,080
- We’re not dating.
- We’re not dating.

522
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,200
I won’t disturb you anymore.
I’ll have to excuse myself.

523
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,280
Dating Agency Love Adventure...

524
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,160
Every time...

525
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,620
Hey you...

526
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,120
Please enjoy...

527
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,920
It’s late and he’s not back yet.

528
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,160
I reckon he’s doing the experiment
with all the girls.

529
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,280
What’s wrong with you?

530
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,320
You don’t have to mind me.

531
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,280
I’m not a smart person.
I don’t speak the same language as you.

532
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,260
Alright.

533
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,980
I won’t have the ice cream you bought.

534
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I’ll go eat my yogurt.

535
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,880
You can’t.

536
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,320
Why can’t I have it?

537
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,360
What right do you have to stop me?

538
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,720
We have no special relationship.

539
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,920
We do.

540
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,080
What are we?

541
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,760
Tell me.

542
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:07,040
We’re roommates.

543
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,640
You goon.

544
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,080
You stupid scientist.

545
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,140
(Best before 2020.03.21)

546
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,480
(Best before 2020.03.28)

547
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,320
It’s out of date.

548
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,080
(I left for work since 7.10 a.m.)

549
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,640
(Breakfast is on the table)

550
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,960
(Pupaa)

551
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,320
You’re calling to make me feel better,
right?

552
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,000
(Pupaa)

553
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,680
Alright, I’ll answer.

554
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,400
Hello. What’s up?

555
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,360
I forgot one of my documents
for my research.

556
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,320
It’s on the table in the room.

557
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,480
Can you bring it to the laboratory?

558
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,000
Alright.

559
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,600
Alright. Thank you.

560
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,360
Hey, Tum, I’m hungry.
Let’s get something to eat.

561
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,760
Sure. What do you want?

562
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,920
How about this?

563
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,120
♪What snack is not your snack♪

564
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,520
♪What snack is it♪

565
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,520
♪It’s my snack♪

566
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,400
Ha. Perfect.

567
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:14,560
Hey.

568
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,520
- Prapai.
- Oh, hi.

569
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,240
What are you doing here?

570
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,560
I came here to give Pupaa his documents.

571
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,920
Why are you the one giving it to him?

572
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,120
I have to go now.

573
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,400
From my observation,

574
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,000
I think there’s something going on
between these two.

575
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,040
Or is Pupaa’s variable Prapai?

576
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,000
Sounds reasonable.

577
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,360
Let’s tell Professor.

578
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,520
How’s your experiment going?

579
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,920
Meena knows about the
dating experiment too?

580
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,520
It’s not going as expected.

581
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,960
Why don’t you change your variable?

582
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,760
So you don’t have
to waste any more time.

583
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,000
I will try.

584
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,980
If you need any more help, let me know.

585
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,960
I’m willing to help with everything.

586
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,720
Ta da. Snack’s here.

587
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,840
So Meena is Pupaa’s variable?

588
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,880
What about the text I sent to Professor,
saying it was Pai?

589
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,720
Oh yeah.

590
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,520
Who?

591
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,640
Pai, Ta’s friend.

592
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,200
Didn’t she bring you the documents?

593
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,040
So this is your type then.

594
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,160
We have to report to Professor
immediately.

595
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,280
The “real” variable is someone close by.

596
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,200
Who said so? I don’t like her.

597
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,480
I’ll go get something to eat.
I’m a bit hungry now.

598
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,600
That was too direct.

599
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,200
This is how it should be. Great.

600
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,320
Where are you going?

601
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,080
Don’t mind me.

602
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,400
An “experimental scrap” like me,

603
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,320
won’t be in your way anymore.

604
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,160
You’re misunderstanding.

605
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,640
The experimental partner
who’s not going as planned

606
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,040
is an experimental scrap, isn’t it?

607
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,600
I think you should calm down
and we’ll talk about it.

608
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,560
No.

609
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,080
I’m moving out.

610
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,560
(Special scene)

611
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,480
Sorry for disturbing you late
at night, Tookta.

612
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,280
But can you please help me?

613
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,560
Thank you.

614
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,400
It’s okay. I’ll do it.

615
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,520
Please help change her.
