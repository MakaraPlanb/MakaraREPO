What’s up?

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,360
How’s your research in China?

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,920
Tell me about it.

33
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,240
The results are impressive. That’s all.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,520
Then why did you reject the scholarship
in China?

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,440
How did you know?

36
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,920
Why didn’t you tell me?

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,640
It’s not important.

38
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,040
So I didn’t tell.

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,160
Not important?

40
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,120
You’re saying that your future
is not important?

41
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,920
It’s what I have to deal with on my own.

42
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,160
You don’t have to stress out about it.

43
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,960
How can you
not let me stress out about it?

44
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,120
Because the fact that you rejected
that scholarship

45
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,120
is because of me.

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,080
Prapai.

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,200
I just want to be with you

48
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,200
when you’re facing problems.

49
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,960
If I’m studying over there

50
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,640
and you face another problem,

51
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,200
how will I take care of you?

52
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,880
I don’t want to be successful
but not have you with me.

53
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,240
Pupaa.

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,400
I want you to go back
and take that scholarship.

55
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,920
I don’t want to be a burden
in your life.

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,720
Prapai.

57
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,920
I don’t think we’re on the same page.

58
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,200
Move.

59
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,960
Aren’t you going to have breakfast?

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,560
It’s none of your business.

61
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,760
I want you to rethink what I said.

(EGAT Learning Center)

63
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,800
Hello, what’s up, Ta?

64
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,120
Prapai, I’m sorry.

65
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,760
Suddenly my dad just let my family
come drag me.

66
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,840
Huh?

67
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,000
Drag you to where? And are you okay?

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,560
I’m fine.
But right now, I’m in Chiang Mai.

69
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,400
It’s such a bad luck.
I’m really sorry, Pai.

70
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,400
Chiang Mai?

71
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,480
How about my work today?

72
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,760
I’ll send you the contacts
of the photographers I know.

73
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,880
There should be someone
who would take an urgent job.

74
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,760
Does Wawa know about this?

75
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,400
Wawa hasn’t answered my calls at all.

76
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,400
She wasn’t home when I went to see her.

77
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,160
I think you should talk with your dad
and sort things out.

78
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,240
And I’ll tell Wawa for you.

79
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,520
Thank you so much, Prapai.

80
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
You’re my best friend.

81
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,060
No.

82
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,600
No dad, no!

83
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,720
- Ta, Ta.
- Dad!

84
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,120
- Give me my phone, dad!
- Ta.

85
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,960
Ta.

87
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,120
Hello, I’m Prapai calling from...

88
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,360
I’m sorry, I don’t accept morning jobs.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,320
Sorry.

90
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
Hello, I’m Prapai.

91
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,960
I got your number from Ta.

92
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,880
May I ask if you accept urgent jobs?

93
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,520
Urgent as in two hours.

94
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,440
You can? Thank you so much.
I’m really glad.

95
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,600
I’ll share you the location.

96
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,280
Sure, thank you.

97
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,640
Goodbye.

98
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,480
How about the model?

99
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,760
Ta, you’re causing me trouble again.

100
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Wawa.

101
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,080
Hello, Wawa, I have
a favor to ask from you.

102
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,280
It’s really urgent.

103
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,520
Excuse me.

104
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,600
I don’t think this angle is right.

105
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,040
Can you make it look wider?

106
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,280
It doesn’t seem very hi-tech.

107
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,120
Sure, sure. I’m sorry.

108
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,200
Sure, thank you.

109
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,040
Sure.

110
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,880
Hey, help me here.

111
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,840
Wawa.

112
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,200
I’m sorry for wasting your time.

113
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,700
If it was Ta,

114
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,680
I would’ve been done two hours ago.

115
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,240
Did you know Ta is in Chiang Mai yet?

116
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,200
Oh.

117
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
Is he gone already?

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,960
Good for him.

119
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,440
Are you okay?

120
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,120
What can I do if I’m not?

121
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,600
If Ta has to be in Bangkok
because of me,

122
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,440
he would have to have a problem
with his family.

123
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,440
His parents would think I’m a burden.

124
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,200
Someone who’s destroying
their son’s future.

125
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,400
The fact that his parents aren’t welcome
isn’t called perfect.

126
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,120
Mom, how did you get here?

127
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,680
Why can’t I come?

128
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
We need to talk.

129
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,200
About you rejecting the scholarship.

130
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,320
Why did you not discuss this
with us first?

131
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,280
I normally decide everything
on my own anyway.

132
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,400
And this time, I’ve made up my mind.

133
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,280
Do you have anything else
you’re hiding from me?

134
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,800
Tell me everything.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,360
What is all this stuff? Whose is it?

136
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,880
Is she the reason you’re back here?

137
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,960
Is she here?

138
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,200
I want to see what kind of person she is

139
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,560
for letting you ruin your future
like this.

140
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,600
Hello.

141
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,960
Is it because of you?

142
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,680
For making you reject that scholarship.

143
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
It’s good you’re here now.

144
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,640
Pack your things and leave.

145
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,240
Mom.

146
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,680
You can’t do this to her.

147
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,960
She has nothing to do with this.

148
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,200
And she’s not moving anywhere.

149
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,160
Pupaa.

150
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,760
This is my house.

151
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,960
I have the right to kick out
or let anyone stay.

152
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,440
You, I give you only one day.

153
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,480
Mom, I beg you.

154
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,160
Please leave.

155
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,440
Pupaa.

156
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,700
Can you just go back first?

157
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,320
And we’ll talk later.

158
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,520
Tookta.

159
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,840
Come in.

160
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,280
Sure.

161
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,240
I told you to look after this place.

162
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,320
Why is it like this?

163
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,680
I’m sorry.

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,120
It’s my fault too.

165
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,920
It’s not Tookta’s fault.

166
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,560
I was the one who asked to stay.

167
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,960
And about Pupaa,

168
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,120
I’m sorry for being the problem.

169
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,960
I really am sorry.

170
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,200
It’s not about you.

171
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,880
I was the one who decided
to reject this scholarship.

172
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,600
Why are you apologizing?

173
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,160
How can you say it’s not my fault?

174
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,920
The reason that you’re back here

175
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,800
is because I’m facing a problem,
isn’t it?

176
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,480
You really are the problem.

177
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Pupaa.

178
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,660
Why did you ruin your future

179
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,920
just because of one girl?

180
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Is she worthy of you
to give everything up?

181
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,480
Yes.

182
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,560
She is worthy enough.

183
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,160
Pupaa.

184
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,520
I never taught you to be
this kind of person.

185
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,240
I taught you to love your future,

186
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,040
to have a goal and achieve it.

187
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,880
Not to let someone get in the way
like this.

188
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,320
And be like you and dad?

189
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,280
Thinking just only about your goals,

190
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,400
but our family is never together.

191
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,640
If it’s going to be like that,
I don’t want it.

192
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,560
Pupaa.

193
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,400
Madam, I think
we should go take a break.

194
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,120
Pupaa.

195
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,720
Prapai.

196
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,160
I agree with your mom.

197
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,200
I want you to achieve your goal.

198
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,040
And I don’t want to be a burden to you.

199
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,920
Prapai.

200
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,120
I just want to be with you.

201
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,120
If I’m successful but without you,

202
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,840
then I don’t want it.

203
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,120
And so what?

204
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,200
So you just ditched everything?

205
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,200
Ditch your dreams,

206
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,600
and ditch away your future like this?

207
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,160
I don’t think I can take it.

208
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,160
I’m sorry.

209
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,000
I didn’t leave it.

210
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,120
I can also do researches in Thailand.

211
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,200
Trust me.

212
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Trust what I’ve chosen will be fine.

213
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,640
How can it be fine?

214
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,640
Your mom thinks I’m the problem,

215
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,360
and I think that too.

216
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,160
You told me once
that I’m your entire world,

217
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,280
because you still love me.

218
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,360
What if one day
you don’t love me anymore?

219
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,060
You would probably be mad at me

220
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,760
for making you reject that scholarship.

221
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,760
There will never be that day, Pai.

222
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,320
Nothing is ever certain, Pupaa.

223
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,800
Why don’t you trust me?

224
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,920
(Mom:
I sent you your favorite dried fruits.)

225
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,400
(Wait for the delivery in 2 days)

226
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,800
(Mom)

227
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,680
Hi, mom.

228
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,280
I sent you a mail.

229
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,680
If you receive it,
don’t put it in a damp place.

230
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,480
You just texted me that.

231
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,400
Why are you calling too?

232
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,000
Ow.

233
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,720
I don’t know. Can’t I call my daughter?

234
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,280
Why are you quiet?

235
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Is something wrong?

236
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,960
Did you get fired?

237
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,720
Why do you think it’s that bad?

238
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,420
Well,

239
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,680
you don’t have a boyfriend.

240
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,640
You’ve only got work problems.

241
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,640
Or do you have a boyfriend?

242
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,960
Mom.

243
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,960
Can I ask you something?

244
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,520
If I have a boyfriend,

245
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,160
and my boyfriend is in the way
of my future,

246
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,920
will you still support us
being together?

247
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,640
If you have a boyfriend,
your boyfriend will have to support you.

248
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,480
But if you have a boyfriend
and he’s ruining your future,

249
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,720
then I don’t want it.

250
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,440
Pai, I have to go now.

251
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,360
I have to do the accounting today.

252
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,520
I’ll hang up now.

253
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,880
You can care for me
for only three seconds, right?

254
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,160
If you have a boyfriend,
your boyfriend will have to support you.

255
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,880
But if you have a boyfriend
and he’s ruining your future,

256
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,160
then I don’t want it.

257
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,400
Is it because of her
that you rejected the scholarship?

258
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,280
The fact that his parents aren’t welcome
isn’t called perfect.

259
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,240
The fact that you’re making Pupaa
throw away his future like this,

260
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,920
are you really going to be happy?

261
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,600
Prapai.

262
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,920
Pupaa, you and I are like stars
that orbit to meet each other.

263
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,000
But we’re not in the same orbit.

264
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,200
Even if I haven’t been with you
for long,

265
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,160
but I know well

266
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,080
that you are a very talented person.

267
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,560
You still have a future
with the research far ahead of you.

268
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,760
Don’t let me be the rock
blocking your path.

269
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,600
Shall we go back to our own paths?

270
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,140
You can go back on your path,

271
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,200
and I will go to mine.

272
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,920
(Pupaa)

273
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,720
(Let’s break up)

274
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,880
You’re so weak.

275
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,040
You’re just returning home,
and I have to come with you too?

276
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,960
Stop talking. Just be quiet.

277
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,440
(Pupaa)

278
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,400
Hey, don’t answer it.

279
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,120
Are you for real?

280
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,800
Sigh.

281
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,680
Well, we’re both in the same shoes.

282
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,400
Then let’s...

283
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,480
Hey,
don’t ever think I’ll like you again.

284
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,840
What are you talking about?

285
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,040
I mean

286
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,680
since I’m back,
I’m out living on my own.

287
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,800
I opened my own company,
and now I’m short of staff.

288
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,200
If you’re interested,

289
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,440
I’ll give you good pay and great bonus.

290
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,760
Deal.

291
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,040
Better than having no job.

292
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,360
Great job.

293
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,600
But

294
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,880
you’ve been standing here
for half an hour already.

295
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,920
Do you want to spend the night
at mine tonight?

296
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,160
Just calm down first
and then you can come back.

297
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,560
Stop teasing me.

298
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,840
I’m scared my mom would know
I’ve had a problem.

299
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,240
My mom is so good
at pointing things out.

300
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,520
What am I good at?

301
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,920
Nothing.

302
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,960
Hello, mom.

303
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,920
Hello, auntie.

304
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,960
Why didn’t you tell me
you’re coming home?

305
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,920
- I miss you and I miss home too.
- Really?

306
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
Hey.

307
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,840
Did you get fired?

308
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,200
It’s alright, dear.

309
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,360
I think your boss
made the wrong decision

310
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,720
for firing a clever person
like my daughter.

311
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,520
Oh, it’s alright.

312
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,560
I made the right decision to come home.

313
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,320
I’m just tired and bored of Bangkok.

314
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,080
Hey.

315
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,240
Is this really Prapai, my daughter?

316
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,760
Or are you someone else?

317
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,880
Peng, come out here.

318
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,840
Is this really your sister?

319
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,440
Peng, that’s too much.

320
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,840
I’m your sister.

321
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,280
Being mean like this, it’s really her.

322
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,520
But she came home by herself like this.

323
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,040
I think there’s something going on.

324
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,360
Right?

325
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,040
Why?

326
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,120
Can’t I miss home and want to come back?

327
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,360
Or because Ta is back in Chiang Mai,

328
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,640
so you’re back here too?

329
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,400
What does that have to do with it?
No, it’s not.

330
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,320
Just tell me you’re dating.

331
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,720
- No, we’re not.
- No.

332
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,280
Come on, let’s get inside. I’m tired.

333
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,320
Peng, bring in the bags.

334
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,080
Ta, bye.

335
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,800
Bye.

336
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,720
Goodbye, auntie.

337
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,400
Bring in the bags.

338
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,320
Prapai.

339
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,020
There’s a delivery for you.
Can you please come down and get it?

340
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,840
Sure.

341
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,600
(Chiang Mai)

342
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,240
Hello.

343
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,400
Ta, do you know where Prapai is?

344
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,960
Calm down, my friend.

345
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,920
Don’t worry. She’s home.

346
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,600
In Chiang Mai. Are you coming?

347
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,640
No.

348
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,200
Me going there now won’t help anything.

349
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,840
The problem hasn’t been solved.

350
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,920
Your girlfriend is upset.
Aren’t you rushing to make it up to her?

351
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,380
What are you thinking?

352
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,400
I will go to her for sure.

353
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,760
But when everything is sorted.

354
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,600
Up to you, Mr. Scientist.

355
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,960
Until then,
if your girlfriend runs away,

356
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,760
don’t say I didn’t warn you.

357
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,480
Um. That’s all.

358
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,160
Prapai, wait for me.

359
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,040
Hello, Professor.

360
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,760
I can see a future in your old project.

361
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,920
What a pity.

362
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
I don’t regret it at all,
being back here.

363
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,680
But

364
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,300
if you need any help in anything,

365
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,440
you can tell me.

366
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,360
Um.

367
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,200
I’m going now, Meena.

368
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,200
Hello, Meena.

369
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,160
Pupaa.

370
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,600
I have a new research project.

371
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,120
If you don’t hate me anymore,

372
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,760
do you want to work with me?

373
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,160
I’m willing to help.

374
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,800
Working with you

375
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,480
always gives me new knowledge.

376
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,800
But I have one thing for you
to help me with.

377
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,000
Sure. What is it?

378
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,160
Pupaa, do you want
to grab something to eat?

379
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,520
It’s alright. You can go first.

380
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,640
Once I’m done with this, I’ll catch up.

381
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,840
How many times have you said this?

382
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,160
I never see you take a break.

383
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,440
I have only one month.

384
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,120
Why one month?

385
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,280
If it’s over a month, the variable
will not be in control anymore.

386
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,660
One month is the longest time

387
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,560
that I can control that variable.

388
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,800
I want to prove to someone

389
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
that I can be successful
no matter where I am.

390
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,120
Aren’t you going to eat anymore?

391
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,920
I see that you’re working so hard
on the project,

392
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,480
how can I not?

393
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,720
And also,
we’ve got limited time, don’t we?

394
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,920
What are you waiting for? Let’s do it.

395
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,600
Sure.

396
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,040
No, Prapai.

397
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,420
You’re the one who chose this path.

398
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,120
You can’t ruin it.

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,160
When did Bangkok make you weird?

402
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,120
Hey, how did you get in here?

403
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,960
Why didn’t you knock?

404
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,360
You’re useless.

405
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,400
I’m the one who has to ask you.
Why did you come back?

406
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,800
Normally when mom wants you
to come back,

407
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,200
you always say no and never come.

408
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Who always says no?

409
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,920
So then what’s going on?

410
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,160
You don’t have to say nothing.

411
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,680
I can tell.

412
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,560
The person who made you come home
and look all upset.

413
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,360
Who is it? Your boyfriend?

414
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,040
What boyfriend? I don’t have one.
I’m single.

415
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Ow.

416
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,320
I broke up already.

417
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,440
Oh.

418
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,040
The physics guy left you already?

419
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,880
Are you crazy?

420
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,600
How did you know?

421
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,040
Don’t act innocent.

422
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,840
I can tell in seconds.

423
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,120
You know too much.

424
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,000
Don’t worry.

425
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,580
It’s only one guy.

426
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,520
I’ll help find you a new one.

427
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,000
Stop. I don’t want it.

428
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,680
Hello, Ta. What’s up?

429
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,160
Prapai, our first job is here.

430
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,520
Really?

431
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,040
Alright, I’ll be there right away.

432
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,000
Okay, come quick.

433
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,120
See you.

434
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,160
Hey, I need to go do some stuff.

435
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,480
I’m out. See you.

436
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,640
Ow, Pai.

437
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,760
Why are you standing here? Move it.

438
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,360
This is my room. Get out.

439
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,480
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

440
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,640
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

441
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,240
- Alright.
- My pleasure.

442
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,600
A great start.

443
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,240
This is just the beginning.

444
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,160
We’ve still got more busy jobs coming.

445
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,560
Like your office here,
don’t you want to clean up a bit?

446
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,960
The messiness will ruin your reputation.

447
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,320
Do you want anything?

448
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,440
If you want it, you can take it.

449
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,680
Say it’s a deposit for your pay.

450
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,640
There’re so many things I want.

451
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,840
Do you use a hairdryer?

452
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,960
You’ve got short hair.

453
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,160
Why are you asking so much?

454
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,400
Do you want it?

455
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,560
Yes.

456
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,400
Oh, Pai.

457
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,040
Huh?

458
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,720
Ow.

459
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,440
I thought you said you’re going to work.

460
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,640

461
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,800

- No.

in my research project.

00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,480
I learned from the Chinese professors

470
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,840
that you were offered
with the scholarship.

471
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,760
But you turned it down.
I want to know why.

472
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:09,320
It’s because of my personal reason.

473
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,600
I just hope

474
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,080
my girlfriend can be with me

475
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,000
when I succeed.

476
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,640
I see.

477
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
How about this?

478
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,100
I need some time to have

479
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,680
a discussion with the professors.

480
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,320
I’ll contact you later.

481
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,560
OK, I’ll wait.

482
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,240

I’ll go pick you up. See you later.

what’s the reason

495
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,480
that made you come back here?

496
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,200
I told you already

497

that I wanted a break after I graduated.

501
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,400
The person who gave this to you
probably has someone new already.

don’t throw it on me.

Who are you talking about?

508
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,520

Did you break up with Prapai?

519
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,160
I guess you’re not here
to just only say hi.

520
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,800
What if I said

521
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,600
Professor still kept that scholarship
for you?

522
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,000
What would you say?

523
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,160

No.

Whatever I’ve decided,

526
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,600
I still mark my words.

527
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,240
What if I said

528
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,960
they’re giving that scholarship to you

529
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,480

It’s a success.

531
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,520
I’m here as the
representative of the research team,

532
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,720
to manage between
the Thai and Chinese team.

533
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
Thank you.

534
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,240
I’ll have to disturb you now.

535
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,960
Because you’re like this,

536
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,640
that’s why people love you.

537
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,600
You never treat people with prejudice,

538
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,600
no matter what I did to you.

539
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
That’s why I...

540
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,920
I’m sorry.

541
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,320
I would still have to tell you
the same thing.

542
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,520
I love only Prapai.

543
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,320
No matter now or in the future.

544
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,640
The answer will still be the same.

545
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,840
Any assumptions made in science
must need clear evidence.

546
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,440
Prapai was never my assumption.

547
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,320
She’s the conclusion to my theory.

548
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
It’s like the magnetic field,

549
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,560
even though there are different poles,

550
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,300
but that difference

551
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,520
attracts me and Prapai together.

552
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,560
And it must be only Prapai.

553
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,300
Here.

554
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,000
These are the documents Dr. Gu Weiyi
told me to pass on to you.

555
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,640
Form a research team
and prepare to continue.

556
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,460
(Pupaa, I’ve seen your project.
My team is interested in cooperating.)

557
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,980
(I hope you can form your own team soon
and we’ll have a meeting, Dr. Gu Weiyi)

558
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:40,300
(How to conquer beautiful girls)

559
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,160
Did you get the book I sent you?

560
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,280
Yes, I did.

561
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,960
My mentor won his love with this book.

562
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,680
And I’m together with Momo
because of this book.

563
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,960
Now I’m giving it to you,

564
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,380
hope the suggestions are helpful.

565
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,320
OK, I’ll study this book well.

566
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,840
Bye, talk to you next time.

567
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,320
Perfect in being a Professor
in academics,

568
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,720
and family management.

569
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,100
Why didn’t you tell me you’re coming?

570
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,160
So I can go pick you up.

571
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,160
It’s alright.
It’s not that difficult to travel here.

572
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,020
Also I just finished
my master’s degree project.

573
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,440
So I wanted to come visit.

574
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,040
And

575
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,040
have you seen anyone else?

576
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,280
You’re still being Prapai, aren’t you?

577
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,360
If you want to know,
why don’t you ask yourself?

578
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,600
I didn’t want to know.

579
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,760
I think he’ll probably be in China,

580
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,360
doing his Ph.D. and being successful,

581
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,560
just like how you wanted already.

582
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,320
That’s good.

583
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,240
He should have a great future.

584
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,240
I guess I have to move on too.

585
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,160
Oh, I have to go to a meeting with Ta.

586
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,880
Do you want to go visit him?

587
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,680
Is he alright?

588
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,880
You should go see him for yourself.

589
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,920
Don’t worry,

590
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,480
he’s always been busy with work.

591
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,000
He doesn’t have time to see other girls.

592
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,840
Who is it? Is it Pai?

593
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,480
Wawa.

594
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,400
How did you come here?

595
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,560
She came with me.

596
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:42,880
Hey. How’s the work I edited
and sent back to you?

597
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,120
The client said the video is fine.

598
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,120
But they just want to change the music.

599
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,480
They’ll send the song to us.

600
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,440
Sure. No problem.

601
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,920
And is there anything else?

602
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,720
There’s one more thing.
Do you remember Nuna?

603
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,160
Yeah, I do.

604
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,280
The girl in the top class
that you were dating for three months

605
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,560
in grade 10.

606
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,280
You don’t have to talk about
my good stories like this.

607
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,360
Anyway, she’s opening
a northern cuisine restaurant close by.

608
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,080
And she invited our friends over.

609
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,940
Sure. Great idea.

610
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,440
I’m missing everyone.

611
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,120
Wawa, come with us.

612
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,560
But I don’t know anyone.

613
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,640
You know me and Pai.

614
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,520
Um.

615
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,880
Um.

616
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,920
Yay.

617
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:49,280
Ta, come pick me and Wawa up at home.
She’s staying with me.

618
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,680
Sure.

619
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,200
I used to pick you up anyway.

620
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,840
Right now,

621
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,080
I can still do too.

622
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,080
Great.

623
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,720
(Chiang Mai)

624
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,800
Ta, can you come pick me up?

625
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,200
Huh? Where are you?

626
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,120
I’m in Chiang Mai.

627
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,400
Why so sudden?

628
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,520
Because I’ve prepared everything

629
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,800
for Prapai to see already.

630
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,760
I can’t go pick you up right now.

631
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,800
I’m about to go to
my friend’s restaurant.

632
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,080
Then tell the taxi
to come to Ruamchok road.

633
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,920
Prapai’s also here. I got to go.

634
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,600
Okay. I’ll be there soon.

635
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,760
- Wait a minute.
- Alright.

636
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,920
- Do you remember Prapai?
- Yes, I do.

637
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,320
Prapai, over here.

638
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,840
Nuna, I missed you.

639
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,000
I missed you too.

640
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,400
Congratulations.

641
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,040
Thank you. Take a seat.

642
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,320
- Hello.
- Hello.

643
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,160
I heard you and Ta
opened an event company together, right?

644
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,560
Yes.

645
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,280
But it’s still a small company.
We just started.

646
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,840
Great. My boyfriend and I are
getting married at the end of the year.

647
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,280
I’ll have to ask you guys for help.

648
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,800
Sure. I’ll do my best.

649
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,600
Great job.

650
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,680
I’ll go to our friends over there
for a moment.

651
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,080
- Sure.
- Yeah.

652
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,360
What wedding themes are popular now?

653
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,160
Give us some suggestions.

654
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,440
We have no idea yet.

655
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,120
I think there should be lots of flowers.

656
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,080
(Pupaa)
Not bad.

657
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,400
Maybe some flowers on the backdrop.

658
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,840
So what color do you want?

659
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,360
- Us?
- Blue and white?

660
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,680
Yes, blue and white.

661
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,120
Blue and white, right?

662
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,000
The colors seem to match well.
Sounds nice.

663
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,200
Hello, Ta.

664
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,560
I’m on Ruamchok road now.

665
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,480
Send me the location.

666
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,760
Huh?

667
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,400
Wawa? You’re there too?

668
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,880
- Hotels, by the beach or at the church.
- Um.

669
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,760
Are you coming to see Prapai?

670
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,400
Then I’ll send you the location.

671
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,840
- Sure.
- Just a minute.

672
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,520
But I think if the wedding
is at the church, it will be so nice.

673
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,640
Whatever you say.

674
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,440
Sure. I’ll be there as soon as possible.

675
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,280
Excuse me,
can you please go to this restaurant?

676
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
I think, maybe a floral theme?

677
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,680
We’ll have lots of flowers
on the backdrop.

678
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,440
- Um.
- Have you chosen any colors yet?

679
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,680
What color do you want?

680
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,000
If the wedding is in a church,

681
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,640
with a blue and white backdrop,

682
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,520
I think it will be a great wedding.

683
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,600
I think so too.

684
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,080
Prapai. You can’t get married.

685
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,000
Pupaa.

686
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,320
(Special scene)

687
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,480
You’ve got a mail.

688
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:01,960
Thank you.

689
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,880
No thank you.

690
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,440
Hello. What’s up, Ta?

691
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,240
Hello, Mr. Pupaa.

692
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,120
Can you please stop sending stuff
to my office?

693
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,480
My office is packed now.

694
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,440
Just give it to Prapai for me.

695
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,160
My research is getting together now.

696
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,880
Soon I’ll be going to Chiang Mai.

697
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,520
Okay.

698
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,400
Come quick.

699
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,200
What is all this?
