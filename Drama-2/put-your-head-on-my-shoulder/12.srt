00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
So...

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,400
You...

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,800
Will you be my girlfriend?

34
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,480
I’ll tell you something.

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,320
You and Pupaa

36
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,880
will never understand each other.

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,360
You don’t know anything about science.

38
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,800
Because all you do

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,280
is find places to eat

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,080
and just do nonsense.

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,120
I...

42
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,920
I’m not sure.

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,080
Why?

44
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,080
What’s the problem?
You can tell me anything.

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,440
Maybe I can analyze it for you.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,440
Hey, this is my thought.

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,880
How can you think instead of me?

48
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,560
If you’re my girlfriend,

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,640
I will cook for you every day.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,840
You’re saying all I think about is food?

51
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,480
That’s not what I meant.

52
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
Well.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,240
So...

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,240
What is your answer?

55
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,560
I’ll wait and see first.

56
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,800
Starting from

57
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,360
being an intern boyfriend.

58
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,920
You’ve used me
as part of your experiments too.

59
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,560
If you do well,

60
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,880
I will give you more marks.

61
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,320
But if you do something wrong,

62
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,720
I will deduct your marks.

63
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,280
And

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,520
I will conclude the marks at the end.

65
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,880
To see whether your marks

66
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,440
are enough to get a scholarship from me.

67
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
Sure.

68
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,800
I’m sure I’ll get full marks from you.

69
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,580
I’ve always been a scholar since primary

70
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,280
until I graduated from university.

71
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
So

72
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,280
I won’t miss this scholarship too.

73
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,280
So what I did today, I’ll take it
as part of adding up my marks.

74
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Alright.

75
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,680

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,400

102
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,960

103
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,960
It’s not like that.

104
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,280
I’m not confident with my feelings yet.

105
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,880
I’m not quite comfortable yet too.

106
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,880

107
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,840

Thank you guys for coming.

110
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,960
I have to go now.

111
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,320
Bye.

112
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,520
See you.

113
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,120
Hey, I have something.

114
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,720
But I don’t know
if I should tell Pai or not.

115
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
What is it?

116
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,640
My friend

117
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,120
used to be in the same school as Pupaa.

118
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,480
And she told me

119
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,320
Pupaa was very popular back then.

120
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Yeah, sure.

121
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,520
He’s smart and handsome.

122
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,880
But Pupaa only had one girlfriend.

123
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,200
She’s pretty, smart, and perfect.

124
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,000
They suit each other so much.

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,480
But it’s been ages.

126
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,800
No, the point is

127
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
ever since they broke up,

128
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,680
Pupaa has never dated any other girls.

129
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,760
So I’m not quite sure

130
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,360
if Pupaa is over

131
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,600
with their relationship or not.

132
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
I think

133
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,960
we don’t have to tell Prapai.

134
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,680
Maybe Pupaa is over her already.

135
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,400
We don’t have to say much.

136
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,800
You’re so good at convincing people.

137
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
I’ve been working here for so many years,
I can’t even do it like you.

138
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,640
I think I should let you teach me how.

139
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,640
What are you talking about?

140
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,700
Prapai.

141
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,680
The work I told you to prepare,
is it done?

142
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,280
Oh, I’m doing it now.

143
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,640
Finish it quick,
because you won’t have time tomorrow.

144
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,680
Yes?

145
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,520
There’s a shooting with Time tomorrow.

146
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,480
You must go too.

147
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,760
Will it be okay for me to go?

148
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
Alright.

149
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
You’re so good.

150
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
You can have this present today.

151
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,280
Actually I’ve got another one.

152
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,760
But I’ll let you see it at work.

153
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,720
And you’ll see.

154
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,440
Did you give me a present
or are you cursing me?

155
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,820
(Puwadol Project)

156
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,820
(100% completed)

157
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,080
Done.

158
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Finally.

159
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,560
Thanks to both of you.

160
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,360
For helping me finish my research.

161
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,240
The research is done.

162
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,760
But what I want to know

163
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,600
is about the other thing.
How’s it going?

164
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,000
Give us some update.

165
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,480
I’m so excited.

166
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
I really want to know.

167
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,480
I asked her to be my girlfriend.

168
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
But

169
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,640
we’re currently in the intern phase.

170
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,520
Intern phase?

171
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,440
It’s alright. I can do it myself.

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,240
- Your bag.
- Your bag.

173
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Hey.

174
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,640
Is something wrong with her?

175
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,200
I don’t know what’s wrong with her.

176
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
But what I know

177
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,160
is that I’m so hungry.

178
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,240
Let’s go get something to eat.

179
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,320
This meal is on me.

180
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,560
Let’s use up all his cash.

181
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,120
Let’s go.

182
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,320
Pupaa’s treat.

183
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,280
Pupaa’s treat.

184
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,160
Hop on the car quick.
Otherwise, we’ll be stuck in traffic.

185
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,120
What are you doing here, Ta?

186
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,120
I’m picking you up for work.

187
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
I’m free today.

188
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,400
Or do you want to go anywhere?

189
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,680
You can tell me. I’ll take you there.

190
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
No, thanks.

191
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,400
I’ll catch a taxi myself.

192
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,440
My car is better than a taxi.

193
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,480
You can trust me.

194
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,200
It’s also free.

195
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,520
Are you trying to win me back, Ta?

196
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
No.

197
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,680
I just wanted a chance.

198
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,440
If you don’t give me the chance,

199
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,040
I can create it myself.

200
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,040
I really want to change myself.

201
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,680
You can wait and see.

202
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
I’m sorry.

203
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,720
But I’m going on my own today.

204
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,560
Ta.

205
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
You can go on your own if you want.

206
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,560
But I’ll bring the bag for you.

207
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,000
So you don’t have to carry it around.

208
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,600
Why don’t you understand?

209
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Here.

210
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,320
I don’t like this one.
Do you have anything else?

211
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Here.

212
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,280
Oh.

213
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
I also want water...

214
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,640
Room temperature mineral water.

215
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,720
If you want anything else, let me know.

216
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,680
Hold on.

217
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,480
Don’t you want to argue?

218
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,960
Why do I have to fight with you?

219
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,600
May I introduce everyone

220
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,680
to our beloved idol.

221
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,320
(Living Life in Bangkok)
Let’s all give it up for Time.

222
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,960
Hey, look, Time even has a male fan.

223
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,320
He’s so handsome.

224
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,560
Because Time is so handsome.

225
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,640
Any girl or guy will love him.

226
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
Isn’t it true?

227
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,280
And for this moment,

228
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,240
it’s the time that we will give back
to Time’s fan clubs.

229
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,040
We will choose one of our audiences

230
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,200
to compete in a game with us on stage.

231
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,760
Who shall it be?

232
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,640
So I’ll pick out the guy
in the middle here.

233
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,120
Please come on stage.

234
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Please stand in the middle.

235
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,920
What is your name?

236
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Pupaa.

237
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,680
This is Pupaa.

238
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,720
Before we start,

239
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,600
I’ll have to ask you a question.

240
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,840
To see if Pupaa here

241
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,440
is really Time’s fan or not.

242
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,120
If he really is a fan,

243
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,440
he must know

244
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,440
what is Time’s favorite toy.

245
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Rubiks cube.

246
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Rubiks cube.

247
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,840
That’s correct.

248
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,080
You’re actually interested in me, right?

249
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,200
Or are you really my fan?

250
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,080
Oh, he really is a real fan.

251
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,720
And from this question,

252
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,080
it will lead us to today’s game.

253
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,760
Today we will let our lucky fan

254
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,680
compete in completing a rubiks cube
with Time.

255
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
But

256
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,280
it will not be a normal competition.

257
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,680
Because we will let them
play with the rubiks cube

258
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,200
and answer our questions too.

259
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,840
Wow.

260
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,080
Is this a good idea?

261
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,560
I know you are an expert
in playing the rubiks cube.

262
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,680
But you will have to give your fan
a chance.

263
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,440
Let’s start. I don’t want to waste time.

264
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,520
When you’re ready, go.

265
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,120
What do you hate most
between coriander and shrimp paste?

266
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,400
- Coriander.
- Shrimp paste.

267
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,960
The beach or the mountains?

268
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
- The beach.
- The mountains.

269
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,160
Cute and sexy, what would you prefer?

270
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Cute.

271
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,080
Wow, who’s going to win?
Who’s in the lead?

272
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,480
Time is the winner.

273
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,360
Wow, a real rubiks cube expert.

274
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,160
I’ll take them back now.

275
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,440
So Time is our winner today.

276
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,560
Thank you, our fan, for joining.

277
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,400
But it’s not over yet.

278
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,400
Because we have a special prize.

279
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,640
I believe it will be a prize
that the other fans

280
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,320
will sure be jealous of.

281
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,920
Because the prize is

282
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,920
a hug from Time.

283
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,960
- Hug now.
- Hug now.

284
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,680
Hug now.

285
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,320
Hug now.

286
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,320
Hug now.

287
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,200
Hug now.

288
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,360
Hug now.

289
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,360
You’ve lost in the rubiks competition.

290
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,400
Be careful you’ll lose
in something else.

291
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,440
Prapai and I are dating now.

292
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,520
I’ll wait and see,

293
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,360
how long you guys would last.

294
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,640
Thank you very much.
Let’s thank him.

295
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,720
His skill is just on point, right?

296
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,520
Hey,

297
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
are you Pupaa?

298
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
Yes.

299
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,720
You look pretty good.

300
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,480
Do you want to join the industry?

301
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,200
I think

302
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,280
I won’t suit the entertainment industry.

303
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,720
I don’t think so. This is perfect.

304
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Trust me.

305
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
Yeah?

306
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
Here she comes.

307
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,520
Hey, what are you doing?

308
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,440
Let’s teach her a lesson.

309
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,000
The coriander that Time hates.

310
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,200
Now you’re just
as disgusting as coriander.

311
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,200
So don’t ever come near
our Time anymore.

312
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Do you understand?

313
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,600
I can’t promise you that.

314
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,280
It’s my job.

315
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,400
Stop lying.

316
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,160
You’re basically attached to him.

317
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,800
Hey, what are you doing?

318
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,880
Leech
[*homophony with sea cucumber in Thai]

319
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,120
sucking the life out of people

320
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,120
is suitable for you.

321
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,040
You’re sucking the life out of Time.

322
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,880
Hey, what are you doing?

323
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,400
Stay still.

324
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,560
What are you doing?

325
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,400
Lucky that it’s just a sea leech.

326
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,320
If it’s a blood-sucking leech,

327
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,120
you would’ve all died.

328
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,840
Why are you flirting with Time
when you’ve got a boyfriend?

329
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,960
Shame on you.

330
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,240
Liking a celebrity is not wrong.

331
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,840
But if you’re going to hurt others
like this,

332
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,680
you don’t have to like me.

333
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,640
Go spend your time
focusing on your studies.

334
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,280
Time.

335
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,720
Why are you saying this?

336
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
It’s all because of you.

337
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,880
Hey, stop it.

338
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,200
Please don’t do this.

339
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,560
Are you alright?

340
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,160
Why are you doing this, Time?

341
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,400
I haven’t done anything.

342
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Let’s go.

343
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,120
Will it be good leaving them like this?

344
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,720
I think they seem very upset.

345
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,360
They won’t back off anyway.

346
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,680
It’ll be even more dangerous
if we stayed.

347
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,960
And you, are you okay?

348
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,920
Prapai, are you alright?

349
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,480
I’m fine. How about you?

350
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
I’m fine.

351
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,480
Hey.

352
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Excuse me.

353
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,080
Can you please

354
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,080
stop at a pharmacy for me?

355
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
Pupaa.

356
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,020
Can I ask you

357
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,800
to go and buy some medicine?

358
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,480
Um.

359
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
Hey, I’m sorry for getting you injured.

360
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,000
And you even have to fight
with your fan clubs.

361
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,800
Apology not accepted.

362
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,760
You have to be responsible

363
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,040
for making my soft and smooth skin

364
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
have scars.

365
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,400
How do you want me
to be responsible for it?

366
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,160
By being my girlfriend.

367
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,760
When are you going to stop
making fun of me?

368
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Here.

369
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,280
I’ll treat the wound for you.

370
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,440
Huh?

371
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,920
Stop messing with Prapai.

372
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,320
So what?

373
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
Mr. Intern.

374
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,000
Don’t worry.

375
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Because it won’t take long

376
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,400
for me to be her real boyfriend.

377
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,640
(New)

378
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,000
Hello?

379
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,760
Oh, now you’re answering.

380
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,200
Prapai, so what exactly is happening?

381
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,480
Is the rumor between you and Time real?

382
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,480
Isn’t the rumor over?

383
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,320
I told you no one drugged me.

384
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,040
That rumor is over ages ago.

385
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,640
So you haven’t read
the latest news, right?

386
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,560
Oh my god.

387
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,480
And you even dare to wake up so late?

388
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,300
Prapai.

389
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,360
You have to read the link
I just sent you. Now.

390
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,600
Um.

391
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,880
Hey.

392
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,360
(Hot news!!! Violence against fan clubs)

393
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,720
(Hot news!!! Violence against fan clubs)

394
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,320
I thought he was a good person.

395
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,960
But I just knew he’s a hypocrite.

396
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,360
He’s always been like this.

397
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,480
Always uses violence.

398
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,800
Do you think you’re that famous?

399
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,960
I’ve worked with him before.

400
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,440
He’s got a really bad attitude.

401
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
What was he thinking?

402
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,880
Hurting his fan clubs.

403
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,320
You’re a celebrity.

404
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,600
I’m going to be someone else’s
fan club now.

405
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,320
I shouldn’t have supported him.

406
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
I think

407
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,400
I want the staff named Prapai

408
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,640
to be at the press conference with us.

409
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,120
So everyone can know the truth.

410
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,840
I told you already

411
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,200
to not get her involved.

412
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Time.

413
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,880
If you want to be the good guy,

414
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,080
go be one on television.

415
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,360
This is real life.

416
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,640
How many jobs have been canceled?

417
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,920
Do you know how much you’ve lost?

418
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,640
But if you get her involved,

419
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,800
she will be in the spotlight.

420
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,520
It will never end.

421
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,600
I’m used to it.

422
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,400
But she’s not.

423
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,800
So what do you want me to do?

424
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,480
Just let it quiet down.

425
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,480
Everything will just fade away.

426
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,160
Like every other rumors on social media.

427
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,440
Pon.

428
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Well.

429
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,240
Actually

430
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,400
Time didn’t hurt his fan clubs.

431
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,080
I was being attacked

432
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,720
so he came in to help me.

433
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,200
Don’t tell anyone this.

434
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Keep quiet.

435
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,840
Otherwise, it won’t be only Time
who’s in trouble.

436
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,360
We’ll be in trouble too.

437
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Understand?

438
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,680
Yes.

439
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,600
I’m not okay with this.

440
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,920
His reputation is destroyed.

441
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,800
Yes, I understand.

442
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,120
Right now we are finalizing

443
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,840
whether we should change him or not.

444
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,840
There are still many advertisements

445
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,600
that have not been launched.

446
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,960
He’s a spokesperson for tourism.

447
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,840
But he has rumors about violence.

448
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,120
Who’s going to come?

449
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,800
You understand, right?

450
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,680
But...

451
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,520
How about this, Pon?

452
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,440
I want a list
of an alternative spokesperson.

453
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,480
Because if this falls,

454
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
then it shall fall.

455
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,000
But our team will finalize this
as soon as possible.

456
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,200
Yes.

457
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,640
(Time, come to see me
when you see this text)

458
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,400
(I’m waiting at the same place)

459
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Come here.

460
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Here.

461
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,160
Does it look tasty?

462
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,360
Are you alright?

463
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,920
I’ve experienced this a hundred times.

464
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,480
It’ll quiet down soon.

465
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,360
This is easy-peasy.

466
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,080
And also,

467
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,600
I get to eat these tasty food

468
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,120
without having to go on a diet.

469
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,000
(Man Manager)

470
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,480
Aren’t you going to answer that?

471
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,240
Maybe it’s urgent.

472
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,080
No.

473
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,160
There’s nothing urgent.

474
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,280
All of today’s jobs have been canceled.

475
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,640
I’m free today.

476
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,920
But I bought a special medicine
with me today.

477
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,400
Here.

478
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Desserts will make you feel better.

479
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,160
Thank you.

480
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,520
You can make anything feel better.

481
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,600
Where’s the spoon?

482
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,560
Well, can you use your hands?

483
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,120
Use your hands like this.

484
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,480
You want me to use my hands?

485
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,880
I didn’t bring it with me.
Just use your hands.

486
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,120
You servant.

487
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,400
What’s wrong?

488
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,720
Is there a problem at work?

489
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,680
I’m uncomfortable about Time.

490
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,000
I still think I’m the reason
for this problem.

491
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,400
I want to help explain.

492
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,560
But the people at work
won’t let me talk.

493
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,760
My battery is out.

494
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,560
Can you charge it for me?

495
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,000
I read it from somewhere.

496
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,640
They said

497
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,640
hugging is the best way
to recharge someone.

498
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,080
You smell so nice.

499
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,320
You smell nice too.

500
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,380
(Those who fall in love with each other)

501
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,880
(often have special senses between them)

502
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,240
(E-mail inbox)

503
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,280
Why hasn’t there been any replies?

504
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,800
Pupaa’s not here?

505
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,080
Pupaa.

506
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
Hey.

507
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,880
Why are you standing here
alone in the dark?

508
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,040
Tomorrow is the last day
for the scholarship application.

509
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,640
I haven’t received any responses.

510
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I think

511
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,920
they’re trying to reply back
to those who received the scholarship.

512
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,400
A lifetime scholar like you

513
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,800
won’t ever miss the chance.

514
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Hey.

515
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,080
Don’t look so stressed.

516
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,000
If you stop looking so stressed out,

517
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,640
I might give you an extra mark.

518
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,680
Come on, give me a smile.

519
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
See?

520
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,520
I told you that you look good
when you smile.

521
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,160
But if someone smart like you

522
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,600
didn’t get the scholarship,

523
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,280
there must be something wrong.

524
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,120
But if you’re still stressed.

525
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,720
I have a way

526
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,160
that will boost your confidence.

527
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,720
This is the place I told you about.

528
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,280
It really works here, I promise.

529
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,800
When I got into accounting,

530
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,360
I came to wish it here as well.

531
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,400
I vowed 100 boiled eggs.

532
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,960
I can remember it by heart.

533
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
But

534
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,040
you didn’t want to go into accounting.

535
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,800
Why would you wish for it?

536
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,520
It’s better than
not being accepted anywhere.

537
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,080
Come on, let’s go pray.

538
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,440
Take off your shoes too.

539
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,760
Why are you sitting still?

540
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,120
Take this.

541
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,720
Repeat what I say.

542
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,600
I don’t believe in things like this.

543
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,920
If you want to pray, then you can do it.

544
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,080
Sit down.

545
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,920
Just repeat after me.

546
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,000
Dear god.

547
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,080
I hope that Pupaa

548
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,640
gets his scholarship.

549
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,360
I’ll promise you 100 boiled eggs.

550
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,000
Remember his face.

551
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,480
He looks like this.

552
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,120
Please give him the scholarship.

553
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,080
God bless him.

554
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,080
Repeat what I said.

555
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,600
You were too fast.

556
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,360
I couldn’t catch up.

557
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,800
Then repeat after me again.

558
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,520
I hope I get the scholarship.

559
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,800
I hope

560
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,960
I get the scholarship.

561
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,840
God bless me.

562
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,800
Pupaa.

563
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
You’re up?

564
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,480
Um.

565
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Hello?

566
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,840
What’s up, New?

567
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,160
Pai, have you seen the news?

568
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,960
What news is it this time?

569
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,840
Oh, you haven’t seen it again?

570
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
Look at it now.

571
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,200
Just open it
and you’ll see it right away.

572
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,960
The entire world has seen it.

573
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,960
Oh, alright.

574
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,840
(Look at this, and tell us.
Did he hurt them?)

575
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,200
(Being a fan doesn’t mean
you can do whatever you want.)

576
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
(Why did you do this?)

577
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,800
Have you seen this news?

578
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,640
It’s so good.

579
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,160
A fan of Time

580
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,760
uploaded a footage from the incidence.

581
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,520
Time is now free.

582
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,240
And so I don’t have to feel bad
for him too.

583
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,800
So

584
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,200
I hope you get good news today too.

585
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,120
I’m off to work now.

586
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
Keep fighting.

587
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,920
- Bye.
- Bye.

588
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,800
Excuse me.

589
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,720
On the day of the fight,

590
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,040
did you see what happened?

591
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,120
Oh yes, I did.

592
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,720
They threw leeches everywhere.

593
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,400
I even took them home.

594
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,040
Delicious.

595
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,160
And did you capture any photos
or footage?

596
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,320
I have a clip. I recorded it.

597
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
This is amazing, Meena.

598
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,280
I’m so proud of you.

599
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,840
Thank you so much, Professor.

600
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,880
Anyway,

601
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,240
prepare all your documents

602
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,700
for the scholarship application.

603
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,760
There’s nothing much left
at the laboratory anyway.

604
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,200
Take your time

605
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,560
in preparing the documents
for your scholarship application.

606
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
Sure, Professor.

607
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,400
This scholarship though,

608
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,040
even if it wasn’t a big scholarship,

609
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,240
but it will be good for you
in the future.

610
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,400
I want you to work hard for it.

611
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,400
- Thank you.
- Good job.

612
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,360
You don’t have
to be disappointed, Pupaa.

613
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,240
Congratulations, Meena.

614
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,800
You’re really clever.

615
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,560
I will have to learn a lot from you.

616
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,680
Why are you sitting here alone?

617
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,840
Why did you bring all this?

618
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,120
Oh.

619
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,840
Because I promised God for you.

620
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,920
You bought it for nothing.

621
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,640
I didn’t get the scholarship.

622
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,520
100 boiled eggs.

623
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,720
How will I finish it?

624
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
I think

625
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,720
100 boiled eggs is not enough

626
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,000
to lure God.

627
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
Next time

628
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,280
I’ll bring 1,000 eggs.

629
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,360
Okay?

630
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Hey.

631
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,400
My shoulder is available.

632
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,160
If you want to use it, you can.

633
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,320
It’s alright.

634
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Don’t think too much.

635
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,640
I’m here.

636
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
Where were you?

637
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,040
Sorry, I was stuck in the toilet.

638
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,480
So do we know where we’re going yet?

639
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,360
Yeah.

640
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,240
Oh.

641
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,760
Let’s go to the same place.

642
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Yeah.

643
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,240
Pupaa.

644
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,600
Today Professor is going to take us
to celebrate

645
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,480
that I got the scholarship.

646
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,640
Do you want to come?

647
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,220
Let’s stop stressing

648
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,000
and go relax yourself.

649
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
Yeah.

650
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,680
The fact that
you didn’t get the scholarship,

651
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,280
we feel bad too.

652
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,680
If you don’t want to go,

653
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,200
you don’t have to go.

654
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,320
You...

655
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,320
Can you come with me?

656
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,120
Um.

657
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,920
Let’s go.

658
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,680
Come on.

659
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,680
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

660
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Come on.

661
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,440
Ta da.

662
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,560
All the signature dishes,

663
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,800
I’ve ordered them for everyone.

664
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,240
Pupaa and Prapai,

665
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,440
do you want some beer?

666
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,160
No.

667
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,280
Pupaa, do you want some?

668
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
No.

669
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,800
Don’t you want some?
So you can relax a bit.

670
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,560
I’ll have to excuse myself
to the toilet a moment.

671
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,120
Thank you, Pai,

672
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,120
for congratulating me today.

673
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,500
Actually

674
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,400
I feel bad for Pupaa
for not getting the scholarship.

675
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,960
If he had a better consultant,

676
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,600
he wouldn’t have failed like this.

677
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,320
And if the people around him
were more clever

678
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,240
to give him some advice,

679
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,800
Pupaa would’ve gotten the scholarship.

680
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,480
Pupaa is a smart person.

681
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,120
Even though
he didn’t get this scholarship,

682
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,640
there will be other places
that see his value.

683
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,120
You know each other well, don’t you?

684
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,760
Because I’m his girlfriend.

685
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,880
Well, the topic

686
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,440
might have been difficult

687
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,520
and big.

688
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,840
I understand.

689
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,960
But you guys shouldn’t have missed

690
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,840
the important information.

691
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,760
For example,
the objects used to refract light.

692
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
But we included that too.

693
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,320
I remember.

694
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,880
It wasn’t in the analysis heading.

695
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,360
Let’s not stress out everyone.

696
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,480
Let’s play a game.

697
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,880
- Sure.
- Sure.

698
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
- Great.
- Great.

699
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,320
Bring it on.

700
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,440
Let’s play spin the bottle.

701
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,240
Truth or drink.

702
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
Well,

703
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,760
I’m not drinking.

704
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,080
If you’re not drinking,
then you have to answer the questions.

705
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,840
That’s it. It’s not difficult.

706
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
No one will ask anything inappropriate.

707
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,800
Here’s the bottle.

708
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,680
Ken.

709
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,120
Ken.

710
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,080
Have you ever made a mistake
with Professor’s experiment?

711
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,120
Oh.

712
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,960
I’m dead.

713
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,400
I’m totally dead.

714
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,640
You asked such a direct question.

715
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,800
Did you want to kill me?

716
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,800
So it’s interesting.

717
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,040
What do you want?

718
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,560
Will you drink or answer?

719
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,560
Just confess it.

720
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,680
I promise

721
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,480
I won’t punish you.

722
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,000
I

723
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,960
would rather drink, Professor.

724
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,680
I’ll spin this round.

725
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,080
Tum.

726
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,280
I’ll ask.

727
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,280
Do you have a mistake
you never told anyone?

728
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,640
If you didn’t make a mistake,
you must finish your drink.

729
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,600
Do you want me to tell?

730
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,720
The biggest mistake I made

731
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,880
is...

732
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,880
is...

733
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,200
the first time I met you in high school.

734
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,200
Oh boy.

735
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,800
It was a huge mistake, wasn’t it?

736
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,160
Come here, finish it.

737
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,920
Drink it up, come on.

738
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,640
Yeah.

739
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,880
Great job.

740
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,360
Great job.

741
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,120
I’ll spin next.

742
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,040
Can I ask Pai?

743
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,120
Do you think

744
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,200
you suit with Pupaa?

745
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,200
It’s just a game.

746
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,440
I’m just asking for fun.

747
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,920
You won’t mind me, would you?

748
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,920
So what’s your answer?

749
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,480
If you’re not going to answer,
you’ll have to drink.

750
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,880
I’ll drink it for her.

751
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,280
Hey.

752
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,080
Come on, let’s continue with the game.

753
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,200
Yeah.

754
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,560
How about you, Professor?
Do you want to join?

755
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,440
Oh, alright.

756
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,560
I’ll join in one round.

757
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,920
Sure.

758
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,280
You can spin it, Professor.

759
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
Prapai.

760
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,840
Yes?

761
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,240
Prapai.

762
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,920
Um.

763
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,680
Prapai.

764
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,760
Hey.

765
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,600
You’ve called my name
a 100 times already.

766
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,080
Because I like Pi.
[*Prapai homophony]

767
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,760
So do you like Prapai

768
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,720
or the value Pi?

769
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,720
Prapai

770
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,600
is the value Pi.

771
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,320
The value Pi

772
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,640
is Prapai.

773
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,520
The value of Pi

774
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,800
has Prapai’s birthday date,

775
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,000
Prapai’s identification number,

776
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
phone number.

777
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,400
If I take the number from the value Pi

778
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,080
and write it into alphabets,

779
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,200
I can tell the entire story of Prapai.

780
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,640
So then

781
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,480
we can use the value Pi

782
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,720
to tell the story of Pupaa too, right?

783
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,720
So can Pupaa tell Prapai

784
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,080
that the world in Pupaa’s value of Pi

785
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,280
is sad, right?

786
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,680
It’s alright.

787
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,440
So today,

788
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,240
Pupaa can come be
in the world of Prapai’s value of Pi.

789
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,560
Prapai will be the one protecting Pupaa.

790
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,680
Come here, let’s recharge.

791
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,960
Take off your shoes.

792
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,720
Hold on a minute.

793
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,800
Oh.

794
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,800
Here, put your head up.

795
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,840
Pupaa.

796
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,120
Pupaa.

797
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,600
Prapai,

798
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,320
do you think you suit with Pupaa?

799
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,720
They say

800
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,160
drunk people don’t lie, right?

801
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,600
So,

802
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,320
do you think I’m beautiful?

803
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,920
And,

804
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,160
do you like me?

805
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,000
Well, you’re not lying.

806
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,360
So,

807
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,440
do you think we suit each other?

808
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,520
Come on, just nod.

809
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,880
Don’t worry.

810
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,720
You’ll get the scholarship anyway.

811
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,560
My intern boyfriend

812
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,520
is the best.

813
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,240
I will always be here for you.

814
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,440
Hey,

815
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,840
intern boyfriend.

816
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,320
Let’s see.

817
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,640
Can you tell me

818
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,760
the day I was drunk,

819
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,840
what did I do to my intern boyfriend?

820
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,120
Oh.

821
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,800
If you’re not going to tell me,

822
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,680
you can show it to me instead.

823
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,120
What are you doing?

824
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,040
What on earth are you doing?

825
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,520
(Special scene)

826
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,600
(Hot news!!! Violence against fan clubs)

827
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,200
(You’re a celebrity.)

828
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,040
(Aren’t you considerate of your fans?)

829
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,000
(I shouldn’t have supported you.)

830
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,800
(She’s the one who got Time in trouble.)

831
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,340
(Time and this girl,)

832
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,480
(is there something between them?)

833
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,240
(I will prove it to everyone.)
