30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
No.

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,000
I’m moving out.

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,960
Why are you suddenly going to move out?

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,280
I’ve cleaned up my bedroom.

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,480
From now on, we have nothing between us.

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,160
You already have a new
experimental partner.

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,520
I’m no use anymore.

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,680
Hey.

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,080
Why?

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,920
I know, I know. I’m coming. Hold on.

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,160
Ta.

41
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,440
Wait a minute.

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,360
What’s the matter?
My door is going to break.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,240
Am I bothering you?

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,400
Showing some empathy now, hey?

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,040
My heart is melting now.

46
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
You’re crazy.

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,680
I want to ask for some help.

48
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
Come in.

49
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,960
So what’s wrong? Spill it.

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Well,

51
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,760
I have one equation I cannot solve.

52
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,040
Even you can’t solve the equation,

53
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,840
and you need my help?

54
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,040
So,

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,200
why don’t you let your beautiful senior

56
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,080
help you with it?

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,000
What’s her name?

58
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,040
Oh, is it Meena?

59
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,720
No, I can’t.

60
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,280
I can’t let Meena help me on this one.

61
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,680
It must be only you.

62
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,480
You’re the expert.

63
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
Really?

64
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,120
I can help you?

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Of course.

66
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Because

67
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,040
this equation has pi in it
[*sounds like Prapai’s name in Thai]

68
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,800
Oh.

69
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,960
So you have a problem with Prapai.

70
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,880
Could’ve just told me at first.

71
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,240
You’re asking the right person.

72
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,040
Trying to make amends with Prapai,

73
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,320
I can tell you,

74
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,080
I’m very specialized.

75
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,880
So what is the problem here? Tell me.

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,560
Well,

77
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,960
- she moved out.
- What?

78
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,560
She moved out?

79
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,880
This is a big problem.

80
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,440
Normally Pai is very easy to talk with.

81
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,120
She gets mad easily
but also gets over it in no time.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,240
So what’s the story behind this?

83
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,480
My colleague went to drop off
some documents for him.

84
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,080
But she saw him making out
with another girl.

85
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,840
He said it’s just an experiment.

86
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,440
But behind her back,
he says it’s not working out.

87
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,160
You called me in the middle of the night

88
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,160
to listen about your colleague’s issue?

89
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,120
Well isn’t it frustrating?

90
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,360
Well, they could just be discussing

91
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,800
about any scientific experiment, right?

92
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
If they were just discussing,

93
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,880
there wouldn’t have been
a lipstick mark on his shirt.

94
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,800
I guess they were talking really close.

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,720
Oh.

96
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,440
From the looks of it,

97
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,960
you must’ve made a move too obvious

98
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,560
that it made Prapai uncomfortable,

99
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,840
so she just left.

100
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,280
No, I don’t think so.

101
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,360
Where did this mark come from?

102
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,960
Oh, so this isn’t Prapai’s?

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,920
Are you pedaling two boats?

104
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,720
Didn’t I tell you

105
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,160
that you can’t hurt Prapai?

106
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,720
Wait, calm down first.

107
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,800
It must be...

108
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,200
I bought some snacks.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,120
From today’s experiment,

110
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,120
I accidentally hit her and didn’t know.

111
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,240
I think I understand now

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
why Pai is mad at you.

113
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,320
What is it?

114
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,880
Your colleague

115
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,560
likes that guy for sure.

116
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,520
Yes, I think she’s jealous.

117
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,560
Jealous?

118
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,960
Jealous?

119
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,920
Um.

120
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,560
She’s jealous for sure. 100% jealous.

121
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,120
But in order to be jealous
of one another,

122
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,280
don’t they have to like them
or love them first?

123
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,000
Are you crazy?

124
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,400
I don’t think it is like that.

125
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,600
She just likes to help others,

126
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,780
so she’s helping out
as an experimental partner.

127
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,320
She doesn’t like him.

128
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Also,

129
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,320
I can see it from Mars

130
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,320
that there is something going on
between them.

131
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
And so?

132
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,200
What? And what?

133
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,540
And what does your friend
have to do with it?

134
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,440
If they like each other,
then it’s their problem.

135
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,960
Why does your friend need to be upset?

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,920
You know

137
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,680
any guy would think that
your friend likes him.

138
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,960
No.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,160
Why are you so emotional
about your friend’s problem?

140
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,480
As if you’re talking about yourself.

141
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,920
Are you insane?

142
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,800
I told you,
it’s my friend from university.

143
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,000
I thought you said your work colleague.

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,600
Um.

145
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,880
Well, a work colleague

146
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,440
from the same university.

147
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,040
Why are you asking me so much?

148
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,640
Don’t stress out.

149
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,120
Even if you go to her now,

150
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,920
there won’t be much difference.

151
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,680
Girls,

152
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,360
when they’re mad and jealous,

153
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,560
they become so… so unreasonable.

154
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,640
Wait until tomorrow.

155
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,440
Wait until she calms down,
then go talk to her.

156
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,920
- Really?
- Um.

157
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,400
Is it okay leaving it like this?

158
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh boy,

159
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,880
trust the expert here.

160
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,640
Don’t stress out.

161
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,560
I think we should do something to relax.

162
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,560
Stressing out won’t help.

163
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,680
Let’s relax a bit.

164
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
There you go.

165
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,680
(Arena of Valor)

166
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,800
My great knight of all time,

167
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,200
it’s time to form a team again.

168
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,280
Tonight is the night

169
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,320
that we will fight till dawn.

170
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,440
- But...
- Hey.

171
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,360
The tower is like a girl.

172
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,840
Attack it and knock it down.

173
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Trust me, I know what I’m doing.

174
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,640
- The tower is like a girl.
- Um.

175
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,360
- Attack it and knock it down.
- Um.

176
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,440
Must knock it down.

177
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,720
What is all this bag doing here?

178
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,440
Looks like you’ve been kicked out.

179
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
Kick out?

180
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,280
I have enough dignity

181
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,560
to not be anyone’s third wheel.

182
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,880
Who do you live with, Pai?

183
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,240
Do you like someone?

184
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,800
No, I can’t.

185
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,680
I’ve promised myself

186
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,160
that I won’t fall
for a heartbreaker anymore.

187
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,040
Who knows?
There might be a misunderstanding.

188
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,360
You really don’t like him?

189
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,960
When Ta played around with you,
you didn’t have any reactions.

190
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,080
But with this person,
you’re so emotional.

191
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,400
I don’t know either.

192
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,120
It’s time. Everyone stop stressing out

193
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,900
and come relax with me.

194
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,000
I promise everything will be better.

195
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
What is it?

196
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,720
Pretty girls like us

197
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,640
must be keeping ourselves
looking good, right?

198
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Um.

199
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,960
Your phone, pick it up.

200
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,600
(Arena of Valor)

201
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,480
Is this your good looking activity?

202
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,860
Isn’t this beautiful?

203
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,660
This skin I bought was expensive.

204
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,000
As soon as I put it on,
guys came rushing in.

205
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,600
You guys know I suck at playing games.

206
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,760
Aren’t you afraid of me
making you guys lose?

207
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,000
It’s alright. I’ve got good help today.

208
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,120
Hello, ladies.

209
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,120
We’re really lucky today.

210
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,520
We’ve got a great knight
on our team today.

211
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,320
That is Mr. Pupaa.

212
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,640
I must tell you that Mr. Pupaa

213
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,320
is one of the top players
of the country.

214
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,760
Pupaa.

215
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,120
I just left the room.

216
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,480
And you still have the feels
to be playing games?

217
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,360
Why didn’t you tell me
you’re joining up with Ta?

218
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,840
You didn’t ask me.

219
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,880
Everyone, I’ve got Pai on my team too.

220
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Oh.

221
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,760
How come Pai is with you, Maesa?

222
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,040
She came to talk to us
about her relationship problem.

223
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,080
I don’t know who she likes,
but she’s mad and jealous at the moment.

224
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,280
Stop talking too much.
Let’s start the game.

225
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,560
Come on, come on.
She’s mad now. Let’s start the game.

226
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,940
(Mortos)

227
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,660
(Alice)

228
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,360
Hey, Pai and Pupaa.
What are you guys doing?

229
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,440
Why are you walking in circles
in the forest?

230
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,660
I’m just a bad experimental variable.

231
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,220
Why are you following me?

232
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,600
Oh, the lane below is being attacked.

233
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,720
Pupaa, can you help guard?

234
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,720
Stop chasing after each other.

235
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,480
Is that all you’ve got?

236
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,800
Don’t mess with my Prapai.

237
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,520
Ta, why is your friend with you?

238
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,160
He’s here to discuss
about his emotional problems as well.

239
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,960
I reckon he’s asking on
how to flirt with Meena.

240
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,620
(Executed)
Shut down.

241
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,440
With Meena,

242
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,320
I was only talking to her about
my laboratory research.

243
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,760
There’s nothing beyond that.

244
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,280
Is he explaining this to me?

245
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,860
Sure, Pupaa, I know already.

246
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,400
No one is misunderstanding you.

247
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,920
But right now,
can you stop following Pai?

248
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,640
The lower tower is being attacked.

249
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,880
Prapai? Aren’t you going home?

250
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,880
It’s already late.
Your roommate will be worried.

251
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,960
Pai said
she’ll be sleeping at mine tonight.

252
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,640
Why?

253
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,720
The water in my room is not running.

254
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,240
Oh, the water is not running?

255
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,120
Do you want Pupaa to fix it for you?

256
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,720
Pupaa is good at fixing.

257
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,520
Send me the location.

258
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,540
The landlord just texted me,

259
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,760
saying that the water is running now.
You don’t have to.

260
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,200
So go home then.

261
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,840
Your roommate would be worried sick.

262
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,440
Oh, actually I haven’t met
your new roommate before.

263
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,880
(Victory)

264
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,760
We’ll do that next time.

265
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,840
I’ll have to excuse myself now.

266
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,720
- Bye. See you.
- Bye.

267
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,160
Bye.

268
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
I’m going to go now.

269
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,240
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

270
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,360
I’ll have three pork skewers
and one packet of sticky rice.

271
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,320
Sure.

272
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,040
(Pork skewers)

273
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,640
Popular shops are like this.

274
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,520
Thank you.

275
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,640
Oh, Aunt Noy, it’s you.

276
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,000
I’ll have four pork skewers
and one packet of sticky rice.

277
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,640
- Sure.
- And Aunt Noy wants...

278
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,320
- I’ll take five.
- Five pork skewers, please.

279
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,360
- Sure.
- So it’s a total of two orders.

280
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,300
One order is four pork skewers
and one packet of sticky rice.

281
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,760
And the other is five pork skewers.

282
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,200
- Here.
- Thank you.

283
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,960
It’s alright.

284
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,520
Here’s yours, auntie.

285
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,120
Oh, you’re back?

286
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,360
You don’t want me to come back?
Alright, I’ll go.

287
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,600
Wait, hold on.

288
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,680
I didn’t mean that.

289
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,640
I bought you some pork skewers.

290
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,720
Hey, pork skewers.

291
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,480
How did you get it?

292
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,800
This shop always has a long queue.

293
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,000
Do you buy this for
every experimental partner of yours?

294
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,040
It’s your favorite.
I bought it only for you.

295
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,920
How about Meena?

296
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,520
Meena is just helping me
with my research.

297
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,840
That’s all.

298
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,160
And this mark here,

299
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,400
Meena accidentally crashed into me.

300
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,360
I didn’t ask you.

301
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
Why do you have to explain it to me?

302
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,600
So you’re not mad at me anymore?

303
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
No.

304
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,400
(Rules of living together)

305
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,320
But if you don’t want me to be mad,
it’s not that difficult.

306
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
How so?

307
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,240
You will have to cancel all the rules.

308
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,720
And let me put some of my stuff

309
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,920
in this living room too.

310
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Um.

311
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,720
Alright.

312
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,480
Yay.

313
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,360
Why am I happy seeing it today?

314
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,400
I’m taking over this room.

315
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
I’m telling you,

316
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,400
everything in this room is mine.

317
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,400
I’m

318
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,400
in this room too.

319
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,000
Why are you up so early?

320
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,280
What’s going on?

321
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
(Mom)

322
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,760
Hello, mom.

323
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,920
Prapai, what is going on?

324
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,280
How have you been? I’m very shocked.

325
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,160
I told you Bangkok is very dangerous.

326
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,720
Come back home, dear.

327
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,560
Hold on, calm down first.

328
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,160
What’s going on?

329
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Isn’t the girl in the news, you?

330
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,320
Peng showed me the photos.

331
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,040
It looks just like you.

332
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,560
What news?

333
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,160
(Male celebrity named T.)

334
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
(Drugged a mysterious girl
to take her back to his place)

335
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,840
What? Why is the news like this?

336
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,440
And so is it really you?

337
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,680
I know it’s you

338
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,200
just seeing you from behind.

339
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,360
Calm down first, mom.

340
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,600
It’s not like what the news reported.

341
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,640
Time is a celebrity
that I am taking care of.

342
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,920
And there was a celebration after work.

343
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,960
And I was drunk.

344
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,640
No, I was just a bit tipsy.

345
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,600
Time just wanted to drop me off
at the condominium.

346
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,400
But he didn’t drop me off, mom.

347
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,440
No one drugged anyone.

348
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,880
And no one carried anyone
back to their places.

349
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,960
How can the reporters do that?

350
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,000
Wait, hold on.
And is Time hitting on you?

351
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,600
Mom, it’s getting ridiculous.

352
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,760
We’re just working together.

353
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,040
He’s not hitting on you,

354
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,680
but why does he have to drop you off?

355
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,760
I can tell if a guy is tricking you.

356
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,280
But

357
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,480
Pai, this guy though,

358
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,080
he’s quite popular.

359
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,880
You can actually talk with him.
I don’t see any problem with it.

360
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,760
Are you with a guy?
Who’s voice was that?

361
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,520
It’s...

362
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,440
It’s the television, mom.

363
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,040
You don’t have to worry about the news.

364
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,400
I’m all good. I’m safe.

365
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,760
I have to go now. Bye.

366
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,800
Hey, hey. Pai. Pai.

367
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,560
Hello.

368
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,760
Hey, hey.

369
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,600
You’re not living with a guy, right?

370
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,080
Yes, I’m sure.

371
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,920
Then turn on FaceTime.

372
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,280
Right now?

373
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,720
Yes, right now.
Or are you hiding something?

374
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,520
No, I’m not.

375
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,320
I’ll turn on the camera.

376
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,520
See, mom? I’m alone.

377
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,840
I’m not hiding anything.

378
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,660
Your room is very clean.

379
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Unlike when you’re at home.

380
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,680
But look at that.

381
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,800
There’re still things everywhere.

382
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,860
You’re exactly the same.

383
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,240
Just like you used to be.

384
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,240
So if you don’t have anything else,
I have to go now.

385
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,920
Bye, mom.

386
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,000
Hey.

387
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,520
Hello, mom,
I told you no one drugged me.

388
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,620
I want to hear an explanation
about this as well.

389
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,160
Come to the office right now.

390
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,560
I don’t know what the real story is.

391
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,480
And I don’t want to know
what’s going on between you two.

392
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,360
But this will have negative effects
for sure.

393
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,720
Our client is quite upset about it.

394
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,500
That their presenter

395
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,200
is having a bad reputation
because of our staff.

396
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,840
Alright. So during this time,
you can go do other jobs first.

397
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,120
- But it’s really...
- And if there’s nothing necessary,

398
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,560
don’t be in contact with Time anymore.

399
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,240
Yes.

400
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,140
I didn’t want to do this.

401
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,560
You understand me, right?

402
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,240
I understand.

403
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,120
Alright. Then that’s it.

404
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,320
Thank you. Thank you.

405
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,700
(I’m sorry I got you in trouble.)

406
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,760
(I really am.)

407
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,440
(If it weren’t for me,
this wouldn’t have happened.)

408
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,680
(Man Manager)

409
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,880
Hello, Man.

410
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,640
Time.

411
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,640
Why weren’t you careful?

412
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,520
Oh boy.

413
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,760
Why do you complain so much?

414
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,000
I’m in the spotlight.
It’s not weird to be having rumors.

415
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,600
You’re still joking around?

416
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,880
Never mind about it.

417
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,360
Oh, Man.

418
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,440
I want you to help me with something.

419
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,720
What else do you what?

420
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,600
It’s about the person from the rumor.

421
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,680
I thought she was decent.

422
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,760
You don’t say that.

423
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,320
Look at her.

424
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,720
Acting to be innocent in front of men.

425
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,880
What’s wrong? Look at what she did.

426
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,640
- Unbelievable.
- I know, right?

427
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,600
Some people are so shameful.

428
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,760
Never stop talking and gossiping.

429
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,320
Keep on talking behind people’s back.

430
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,360
All the annoying people are gone.

431
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,840
It’s only me.

432
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,840
Tell me what happened.

433
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,520
What can it be? It’s a misunderstanding.

434
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,800
No one drugged me.

435
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,120
I’m just not good with alcohol.

436
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,120
Time just wanted to drop me off.
But now he has to face all this.

437
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,440
Keep it down.

438
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,920
There’re people envying you
from everywhere.

439
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,520
Anyone would want a moment like this.

440
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,080
Going viral with a celebrity.

441
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,320
Just like being the main character
in a Chinese series.

442
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,240
Hold on. If you don’t feel anything.

443
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,160
That means you already have
someone you like.

444
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,520
(Pupaa)

445
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,280
Hello, Pupaa.

446
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,440
I’m in front of your office.

447
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,920
I brought you some brownies.

448
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,840
Come get it.

449
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,000
Sure, wait a moment.

450
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,120
I’ll be back.

451
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,360
Hey.

452
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,360
Here you go.

453
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,680
Thank you.

454
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,840
Look.

455
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,800
Look at that.

456
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,840
Went viral with a celebrity
in the morning,

457
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,800
now a good looking guy
is bringing her snacks in the afternoon.

458
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,080
She looks so innocent.

459
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,520
- Who would’ve known she’s such a bitch.
- You’re so right.

460
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,480
Prapai.

461
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,880
Take this too.

462
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,000
So you can’t hear others.

463
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,440
What should I do?

464
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,920
It’s like I’m falling for him
more and more every day.

465
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,960
(Time)

466
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,800
Hello.

467
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,720
Why aren’t you at the set today?

468
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,760
It’s such a viral.

469
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,960
Who would let me be near you?

470
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,480
Oh wow.

471
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,640
Are we forced to be separate?

472
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,680
It’s a huge problem
and you’re still joking about it?

473
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,320
Okay. I’ll stop.

474
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,040
I’m going to be serious now.

475
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,440
So after this incident,
you plan on hiding away from me, right?

476
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,560
No, I’m not.

477
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,080
Don’t give me an excuse.

478
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,880
You texted me only once
and you disappeared.

479
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,720
If I didn’t call,

480
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,040
you wouldn’t have said anything, right?

481
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,920
I guess you’re just apologizing
for the sake of it.

482
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,240
It’s not like that.

483
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,320
Pon won’t let me...

484
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,880
Otherwise,

485
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,120
come meet me.

486
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,000
How can I go? The news is still viral.

487
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,640
If I go and the reporters see me,

488
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,440
it’ll be a bigger problem,
and I’ll be in bigger trouble.

489
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,120
- And you’ll be having worse rumors.
- Blah, blah, blah.

490
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,960
You keep complaining like my manager.

491
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,880
We can meet in a place
where nobody’s around.

492
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,280
Is that possible?

493
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,040
Wherever you go, people always notice.

494
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,360
There sure is.

495
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,160
You’ll know when you get here.

496
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,200
What is wrong with him?

497
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,320
So stubborn.

498
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,260
(STORYBOARD)

499
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,640
Are your legs too short?
That’s why you’re here late.

500
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,440
Stop talking.

501
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,040
There’s no one around here
to gossip about us, just like you said.

502
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,800
I like to come here during my free time.

503
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,000
I can’t believe

504
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,560
that a celebrity like you
has this kind of moment.

505
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,840
I’ve got many more.

506
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,480
Do you want to know me more?

507
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,800
Hey.

508
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:37,840
Don’t do this.

509
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,240
There’ll be more rumors going around.

510
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,760
I will affect your future. Be careful.

511
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,840
I’m sorry.

512
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,720
What’s with you today?

513
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,720
Why are you apologizing to me?

514
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,160
Sorry for getting you in trouble.

515
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,480
I’m not in that much trouble.

516
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,440
You’re the one in trouble.

517
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,160
I’m a celebrity.

518
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,040
I’m used to this.

519
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,140
But you.

520
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,400
I guess people have been
gossiping about you a lot.

521
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,920
No one’s numb with things like this.

522
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,840
But those words and accusations

523
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,320
don’t even consider any reasonings.

524
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,640
Even if it’s someone crazy like you.

525
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,560
But you’ve got feelings.

526
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,120
Having to hear it so often,

527
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,560
I’m sure it hurts.

528
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,440
Back in the days, I never understood

529
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,600
how these comments and rumors

530
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,840
can hurt our feelings.

531
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,200
But now...

532
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,400
Being you isn’t so easy I guess.

533
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,000
I don’t care little issues like this.

534
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,360
But I have one way

535
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,080
that can help you feel better.

536
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,680
What is it?

537
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,680
How can you trust those rumors?

538
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,600
It’s not even true.

539
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,120
Trust me, one day the truth will reveal.

540
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,840
Those gossipers will be punished.

541
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,060
All the aliens will kidnap you

542
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,720
and use you as slaves.

543
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,320
Nonsense like that.

544
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,520
I don’t care about it.

545

552
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,480
I blew it.

553
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,900
Your hottest brother from home

554
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,800
called to wish you a happy birthday
every year.

555
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,480
Thanks.

556
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,320
You’re a year older now.

557
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,920
Stop reminding me of it.

558
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,800
I just wanted to let you know
that you’re getting old.

559
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,280
Go find something to do
on your birthday.

560
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,320
You’ve been reading the past few years.

561
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,800
I know, I know.

562
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
I won’t disturb you anymore.

563
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,200
I just called so you remember
that you have a brother.

564
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,400
Don’t forget to send me some money. Bye.

565
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,920
Yes.

566
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,720
Other than writing
“Happy Birthday Prapai” on the cake,

567
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,600
you must write this equation too.

568
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,800
Sure. Thank you.

569
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,720
(Happy Birthday Prapai)

570
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,560
Did Pupaa forget his keycard?

571
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,880
(Happy Birthday Prapai)

572
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,800
Happy Birthday, Prapai.

573
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,040
Hey, what are you thinking, Prapai?

574
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,140
(Happy Birthday Prapai)

575
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,840
Surprise.

576
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,200
Hey. How did you come here?

577
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,600
Come inside quick.

578
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,640
What is all this?

579
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,600
Happy Birthday.

580
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,840
How did you know about my birthday?

581
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,400
If I really wanted to know anything,

582
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,680
it’s not that difficult.

583
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,680
But take this present first.

584
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,160
Actually
I’ve got another present for you.

585
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,400
But I’ll wait until you get to work.

586
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,120
You’ll see.

587
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,240
Open it. Do you like it?

588
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,720
This is cute.

589
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
I’ll put it on for you.

590
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
What are you doing?

591
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,680
What are you doing here?

592
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,680
This is my home.

593
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,840
Why can’t I come in?

594
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,200
- Mom.
- Happy Birthday.

595
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,080
- Surprise.
- Happy birthday to you, dear.

596
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
Mom.

597
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,920
I missed you.

598
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,080
Oh.

599
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,680
Isn’t this the guy in the news?

600
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,960
He likes you and you like him, right?

601
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,080
No, mom. Calm down first.

602
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,000
He just came to give me a present, see?

603
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,320
And who’s this?

604
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,520
Who is it?

605
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,280
This is my friend. My friend.

606
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,760
But I’m not her friend.

607
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,680
There’re three of you here?

608
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,080
It’s not like that, mom.

609
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,280
My friends

610
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,000
went outside to buy some stuff.

611
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,520
So we three are here to set up the room.

612
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,160
Yeah, right?

613
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,080
Oh really? That’s good.

614
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,000
I made some northern style food.
Let’s have them together.

615
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,020
Please.

616
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,400
Let’s have some northern style food.
Do you like northern style food?

617
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,280
I do, auntie.

618
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,760
How are you doing lately?

619
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,160
There’re still a lot of things going on.

620
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,800
- That’s great.
- It’s nice meeting you.

621
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
Me too.

622
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,240
Hello, Wawa.

623
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,680
Happy birthday, my best friend.
I was about to call you.

624
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,200
You come to my place, now.

625
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,720
Why?

626
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,220
Just come. I’ll tell you later.

627
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,700
Don’t forget to buy a few things over.

628
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,360
If you don’t come,
it’ll be a big problem.

629
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,920
Alright?

630
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,800
Alright, okay. See you soon.

631
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,160
Um.

632
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,200
Why are you in so much shock?

633
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,440
Because of you.

634
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,800
Why didn’t you tell me
you’re in Bangkok?

635
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,960
Mom won’t let me tell you.

636
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,960
You know I can’t argue with her.

637
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,440
But

638
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,720
why are you acting strange today?

639
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,240
Or you have a secret to me?

640
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,400
No.

641
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,440
How could I have a secret to you?

642
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,520
Just go back inside and help mom.

643
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,400
- Why are you letting mom do it alone?
- I think you have a boyfriend.

644
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
You’re crazy. I don’t have one.

645
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,680
Let me help you.

646
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,720
It’s alright, dear.
Make yourself comfortable.

647
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,200
Let me help you.

648
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,360
- Do you want to help?
- Sure.

649
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,240
Sure.

650
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,280
Please excuse me.

651
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,000
Sure.

652
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,680
Prapai is very similar to you.

653
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,280
Both sweet and beautiful.

654
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,800
You’re cute too.

655
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,480
But before today,

656
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,840
I saw you in the news.
I thought you were going to

657
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,520
do something bad to Prapai.

658
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,160
These reporters are really mean.

659
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,880
How can they write something like that?

660
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,600
It’s alright, auntie.

661
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,600
At least you and Prapai
don’t misunderstand.

662
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,200
I’m flattered.

663
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,400
Good then.

664
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,200
So enjoy my northern style food today.

665
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,760
Wow. I’m sure I’ll finish it all.

666
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,880
I’ll open it, mom.

667
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,480
Sure.

668
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,440
Wawa, come on in.

669
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,960
So what’s going on?

670
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,680
Hey, everyone.

671
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,680
Hello, auntie.

672
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,960
Ta.

673
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,980
Come on in first, both of you.

674
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,600
Come on, come on.

675
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,960
Let’s help set up. Feel free to do so.

676
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,000
Have a look at what you want to eat.

677
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,120
What do you want?

678
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,700
- Anything is fine.
- Northern chili paste?

679
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,800
What did you buy?

680
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,480
Here you go.

681
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,280
I’ll be right back.

682
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,080
- Prapai.
- Yes?

683
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,600
Bring me the glasses.
I’ll set them up for you.

684
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,000
Sure, mom.

685
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,840
That one too.

686
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,120
Thank you.

687
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,720
I’m coming.

688
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,160

Thank you.

696
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,680
What does the cake say?

697
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,560
(Happy Birthday Prapai)

698
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,040
Just what a genius physician would do.

699
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,400
Even the cake has an equation.

700
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,780
(Prapai 128√e980)

701
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,720
Let’s take a photo.

702
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,320
I’ll take it for you.

703
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,800
- Okay.
- Give it to me.

704
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,480
Come on, one, two, three.

705
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
Hey.

706
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,360
I’ll cut it for you.

707
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,240
Alright, there you go.

708
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,520
Be careful.

709
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,800
Okay.

710
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,560
I’ll do yours first, auntie.

711
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,520
Sure.

712
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,800
Just a moment.

713
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,880
Come on, cheers.

714
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,960
I’ll tell you something.
Don’t let her drink.

715
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,560
Otherwise she’ll go crazy.

716
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,400
Oh, mom.

717
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
She also bites.

718
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,560
Bite?

719
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,920
It’s true, auntie.

720
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,960
I want to complain.

721
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,760
Yea?

722
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,440
I met with Pai once, when she was drunk.

723
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,600
She was walking around,

724
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,400
and just bit my arm. Just like this.

725
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,800
Her teeth are very sharp.

726
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,360
I experienced it too.

727
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,640
I told you I was dreaming about
having pork leg back then.

728
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,720
But it’s your friend’s arm.

729
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,520
See? I told you.
Once she drinks, she goes crazy.

730
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,480
Mom.

731
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,960
So then let’s give it to me.

732
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,360
- No. Not for you.
- Stop right there.

733
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,480
But today is your birthday,
you can have some.

734
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,400
- Yay. Cheers.
- Yay.

735
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,080
Here.

736
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,200
Thank you.

737
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,080
Mom, you and Peng can go back first.

738
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,800
Me and my friends
will finish off the rest.

739
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,760
How can you let your visitors
clean up the room?

740
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,120
You’re the owner of the room.

741
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,520
Kids, you can all go back.
Aren’t you all working tomorrow?

742
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,240
I’ll finish off everything.

743
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,120
- So then I’ll have to excuse myself.
- Sure.

744
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,240
- Bye.
- Bye.

745
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,920
You still have something to tell me.

746
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,000
I know. We’ll talk later.

747
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,840
- Alright, see you.
- Bye.

748
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,120
I’ll head out too. See you.

749
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,920
- See you.
- I’m going now, auntie.

750
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,720
- Sure. See you later.
- Sure, mom.

751
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,440
Don’t forget to go back home
to Chiang Mai too.

752
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,320
Sure.

753
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,640
See you later, Peng.

754
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,920
Bye, Ta.

755
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,120
Oh, how about you?
Aren’t you going back?

756
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,560
You’re not the owner.

757
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,160
Let the owner do it herself. You can go.

758
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,440
Prapai.

759
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,080
Yeah?

760
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,120
I’m going to go now.

761
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,600
Auntie, if I have the chance.
I’ll go visit you at Chiang Mai.

762
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,320
Sure. You’re very welcome.

763
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,080
I’ll leave now. Bye.

764
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,280
Good luck.

765
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,360
- See you later.
- See you.

766
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,440
I’ll head out now.

767
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,720
Good luck.

768
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,920
Bye.

769
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,120
I’ll wash it later.

770
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,040
Hop on, I’ll drop you off.

771
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,160
It’s alright. I’ll find a taxi.

772
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,120
Come on, get in the car.

773
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,400
Quickly.

774
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,240
It’s getting dark soon.
It’s going to be dangerous.

775
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,880
It’s dangerous going alone.

776
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,480
I’ll drop you as a friend.

777
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,080
Take care of yourself.

778
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,280
Yes, mom.

779
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,400
You know,

780
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,440
if Peng doesn’t have school tomorrow,

781
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,440
I would want to stay the night.

782
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,880
I missed you so much.

783
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,200
Mom.

784
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,280
I missed you too, mom.
I want you to stay too.

785
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,860
But if you don’t leave now,

786
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,920
you’re going to miss the flight.

787
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,920
You can just send me here.

788
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,120
Sure.

789
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,800
Peng, take care of mom.

790
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,800
Okay, noted.

791
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,400
Good job.

792
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,080
- You take care of yourself too.
- Sure.

793
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,320
- Give me a hug. I missed you.
- Sure.

794
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,840
- Come back to Chiang Mai too.
- Yes, mom.

795
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,280
- Bye mom.
- Bye, Pai.

796
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,040
- Bye. See you.
- See you next time.

797
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,080
- Bye.
- Bye.

798
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,000
Thank you.

799
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,520
Next time if you need a ride,
you can tell me.

800
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,440
Why?
Did you change your job to a driver?

801
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,880
If you want me to be a driver, I can be.

802
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,040
But I have to tell you,
this car is special.

803
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,480
Because this car will take only you.

804
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,320
No, thank you.

805
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,160
I don’t want to disturb you.

806
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,880
I can go on my own.

807
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,600
I used to travel alone anyway.

808
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,720
Pupaa.

809
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,840
Pupaa. I’m sorry.

810
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,000
I was having a long talk with my mom.

811
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,940
You’re the really owner,

812
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,760
but you had to go wait outside.

813
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,760
I’m really sorry.

814
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,760
It’s alright.

815
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,760
If it’s about you,

816
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,760
I have no problem with it at all.

817
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,120
Actually,

818
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,400
I had so much to do for you today.

819
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,960
But

820
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,640
nothing went as planned.

821
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,120
But this time, I don’t think
anything will get in the way anymore.

822
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,520
(I love you)

823
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,800
You knew?

824
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,600
You didn’t have to make saying
“I love you” so complicated.

825
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,720
Don’t you like it?

826
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I do.

827
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,640
So...

828
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,160
You...

829
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,920
Will you be my girlfriend?

830
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,880
(Special scene)

831
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,440
Look at this photo.
Pai’s face is so funny.

832
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,880
Stop making fun of me.

833
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,520
Her face is beautiful.

834
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,840
- Why do you keep making fun of her?
- Yes, mom?

835
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,160
So do you have a birthday present
for your sister?

836
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,880
(I love you)

837
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,760
Pai.

838
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,360
What’s wrong with you?

839
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,320
Why are you smiling to yourself?

840
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,760
Nothing, mom.

841
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,640
I don’t believe you.

842
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,480
- It’s true.
- You’re smiling with your phone.

843
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,960
Nothing.

844
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,640
Really?
