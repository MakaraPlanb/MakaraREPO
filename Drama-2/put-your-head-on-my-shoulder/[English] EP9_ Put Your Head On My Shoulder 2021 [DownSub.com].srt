I’m going now.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,400
Please calm down.

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,200
Why should I wait for someone
who is not punctual?

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,280
I beg you, Time.

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,920
Can you think about
the other staff as well?

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,760
If you leave now,
then what is everyone else going to do?

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,840
That’s not my problem.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,800
Please, Time.
I’ll do whatever you tell me to do.

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,960
Please just stay.

39
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,920
You’re willing to do everything. Really?

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,640
Um.

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,840
Okay. Alright then.

42
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,340
Then from now on, you will do as I say.

43
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,560
Everything.

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,120
Huh?

45
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,000
Alright.

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,560

Can I have it?

47
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,800
Alright.

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,720
Thank you.

49
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,320
Pon, so what are we doing?

50
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,520
I’ll try to follow up.

51
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,480
Alright.

52
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,060
This way, please.

53
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,200
We’re here. Time is here.

54
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,060
Here we go.

56
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,560
This way, please.

57
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,160
If we’re ready
then let’s do a blocking rehearsal.

58
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,200
How are we going to do that?
My rehearsal partner isn’t here yet.

59
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,640
Well, Time, during the shoot,

60
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,360
you will have to say
you can also live life at the market,

61
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,040
and then wink at the model.
Just like that.

62
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,920
You’re going to be my rehearsal partner,
servant.

63
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,920
Okay?

64
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,160
Okay. If we’re all ready,
then let’s start.

65
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
What did you call me?

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,520
Well, you have to do everything
as I say, don’t you?

67
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,280
Hey.

68
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,120
Sure.
You can rehearse your blocking now.

69
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,860
(Seasonal fruit)

70
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,640
Go ahead.

71
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,400
You can also live life at the market.

72
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,480
Okay. Just about right.

73
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,200
Where’s the model?

74
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,440
I’m still trying to contact her.

75
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,280
This set’s staff is just useless.

76
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,920
What location did they send?
I was lost for ages.

77
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,360
Such a waste of time.

78
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,480
And what is this?

79
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,040
Why are you using a dwarf
as my stand-in? This isn’t right.

80
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,000
Well, it wasn’t her job to do so.

81
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,480
If the real actor
had some responsibility,

82
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,600
did some research on the route
before travelling,

83
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,080
then you wouldn’t have to be screaming
and blaming it on others like this.

84
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,700
And this dwarf

85
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,960
wouldn’t have to be standing here.

86
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,760
I’m here already. Can we just start?

87
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,320
Hold on.

88
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,360
Just wait.

89
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,840
I need to use the restroom.

90
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Sure.

91
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,760
I’ll go get him.

92
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,360
Okay.

93
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,040
Guys, let’s take a break.

94
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,580
Time.

95
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,040
Give me your phone.

96
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,160
You don’t need to be shy, come on.

97
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,240
Just a minute.

98
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,640
Okay.

99
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,440
One, two...

100
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,240
Thank you for supporting me here today.

101
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,120
I have to get back to work now.

102
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,760
Servant.

103
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,320
You followed me here?

104
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,040
Time, I thought you left.

105
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,800
You think I’m that irresponsible?

106
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,280
No, I didn’t mean it like that.

107
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,400
What are you looking at?

108
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,680
Oh, I thought I saw a friend.

109
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,000
I don’t think so.

110
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,300
Because my looks

111
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,640
must have blurred everyone out already.

112
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,520
Shall we go back to the set?

113
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,640
So we can finish soon.

114
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,280
Okay.

115
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,040
This way.

this isn’t mine.

128

Tum forgot it with me.

129
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,960
I’m going to give it back to him
tomorrow.

130
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,720
Hello.

131
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,480
Good morning. Have you had breakfast?

132
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,960
Is it Pupaa?

133
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,200
Um.

134
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,920
Not yet. I just got up.

135
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,680
Aren’t you going to work?

136
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,720
I finished the shoot late last night.
So I’m having the day off.

137
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,200
What do you want?

138
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,440
Well, I...

139
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,160
Hold on. Why is it so echoey?

140
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,000
What are you trying to do?

141
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Why did you call
when you’re right in front of my room?

142
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,640
Why didn’t you knock?

143
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,960
They said to call regularly.

144
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,960
They?

145
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,120
Who are they?

146
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
So what do you want?

147
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,560
Today is the 14th of March.

148
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,160
14th of March.

149
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,320
Oh, White Day.

150
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,200
What is it?

151
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,360
Open it.

152
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,760
What is this?

153
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,200
Do you like it?

154
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,200
It’s a special day today.

155
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,720
I know.

156
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,120
I know today is the 14th of March.
It’s White Day.

157
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,520
It’s world Pi day.

158
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,320
And it’s also Einstein’s birthday.

159
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,440
Take it back.

160
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,960
I’m going back to sleep now.

161
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,280
And don’t wake me up for lunch.
I’m not going to eat.

162
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,800
You don’t want it?

163
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,000
Why don’t you like it?

164
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,640
It’s so meaningful.

165
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,920
Is something wrong, Prapai?

166
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,120
I got a weird gift from a weird person.

167
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,440
Who is it? A pervert?

168
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,160
Not to that extent.

169
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,480
But

170
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,920
he gave me a gift that
no other person normally gives.

171
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,600
A gift?

172
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,720
Um.

173
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,840
Or he likes you?

174
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,280
Are you out of your mind?
Never. It’s impossible.

175
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,080
Then why would he give you a gift?

176
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,660
Normally,

177
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,680
guys will only give gifts
to the girl they like.

178
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,000
I don’t think so.

179
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,720
It doesn’t seem like he likes me.

180
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,840
All he does is calculate
and experiment stuff.

181
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,920
I don’t even know
if he knows what love is.

182
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,640
Or is he doing an experiment on you?

183
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,700
But getting a weird gift

184
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,200
is better than having a boyfriend
who doesn’t care about you.

185
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,640
I’m done with this, Pai.

186
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,040
He doesn’t answer my calls.

187
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,000
I send him texts,

188
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,760
he reads them but doesn’t reply.

189
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,280
If you’ve had enough, then just stop.

190
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,040
I’ve tried hard enough, right?

191
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,480
I don’t think Ta
even deserves your love.

192
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,320
Holding on will just hurt me more.

193
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,360
Breaking up would be the best solution.

194
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,840
But ever since I’ve been born,

195
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,440
I’ve never broken up with anyone before.

196
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,480
Will he be sad, Pai?

197
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,760
Wawa, stop thinking about others.

198
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,720
Think about yourself too.

199
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,400
If you don’t want to go alone,
I’ll go with you.

200
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,960
Thank you.

201
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,320
(Ta)

202
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,640
Hello, Ta.

203
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,160
Sure.

204
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,560
I have something to tell you too.

205
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,720
Great move, Ta.

206
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,200
Ta.

207
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,680
Are you free next week?

208
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,920
Let’s break up.

209
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,840
That’s all I wanted to say.

210
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,400
You can get back to your game.

211
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,560
Ta, are you still playing?

212
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,440
Come on.

213
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,040
Wawa.

214
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,840
How was it?

215
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,520
I was the one who told him.

216
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,800
But why am I the one sad?

217
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,920
It’s alright.

218
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,680
It will be better.

219
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,160
You will always have me here.

220
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,560
It’s alright.

221
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,480
Everything will have to be better.

222
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,400
I think it’s Prapai.

223
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,120
I know it is.

224
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,540
Cute, right?

225
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,140
It’s so cute.

226
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,960
Both of you please concentrate.

227
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,560
I’ll be back.

228
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,360
How’s your experiment going?

229
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,280
Why are you asking?

230
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,520
You’re helping me with it now.

231
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,260
I was talking about your

232
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,040
personal experiment.

233
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,640
Not bad.

234
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,800
Not bad? What does it mean?

235
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
As in, you understand the variable now?

236
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,480
Well, there’s a daily exchange
of information.

237
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,800
What information are you exchanging?

238
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,000
Cheesy romantic ones?

239
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,440
Well, Hello, Pupaa.

240
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,120
I’ve got to go, Pupaa.

241
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,400
Oh, Pupaa.

242
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,560
Me and the security guard
has a better relationship than this.

243
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,960
What a waste.

244
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,200
You’re such a handsome guy,

245
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,360
why are you such a loser in love?

246
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,920
Then what can I do
to understand the variable more?

247
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,840
You have to study its properties
and its nature.

248
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,360
Collect data from the environment too.

249
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,900
What experiment is it?

250
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,440
You can talk to me. Maybe I can help.

251
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,040
The most relatable environment
to a variable like Prapai.

252
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,960
That’s right. Wawa.

253
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,800
Hey. Is that papaya salad?

254
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
You don’t normally have fermented fish,
do you?

255
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,840
What do you want from me?

256
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,480
I just brought it back.
It’s alright if you don’t want it.

257
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,520
It’s so good. You’re so kind.

258
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,880
So,

259
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,640
how has your friend been lately?

260
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,280
My friend? Who?

261
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,040
Wawa?

262
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,600
Girls really do have strong sense.

263
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,920
You know about it already?

264
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,000
But I feel bad for Wawa.

265
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,600
Wawa really loves Ta.

266
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,960
I think she’ll need a lot of time
to heal.

267
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,440
The amount of time
to heal from a break up

268
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,680
is half the time they’ve been in love.

269
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,760
But if you want to heal faster,
you must find a replacement for the loss.

270
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,600
Wow, what a quote.

271
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,960
You read it from that book right?

272
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,600
It’s not nice to be reading from
someone else’s book.

273
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,320
I asked for information
on an experiment.

274
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,280
An experiment?

275
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Or is he doing an experiment on you?

276
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:12,340
(Memory Box)

277
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,720
Let’s go.

278
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,360
I can’t stop laughing seeing that scene.

279
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,840
I thought you were going to help me.

280
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,120
But you held on to the music box
so tight.

281
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,320
Then from now on, I will help you first.

282
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,640
Thank you.

283
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,480
I really appreciate it.

284
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,840
That I’m more important
than a music box now.

285
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,200
Wee, why didn’t you call me?

286
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,080
Do you know how important today is?

287
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,240
I’m sorry, Ta.

288
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,480
Oh, hey, friends.

289
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,480
Ta.

290
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,800
You talk with him first. I’ll be back.

291
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Um.

292
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,760
What happened this morning?

293
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,280
Why did the event start late?

294
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
It’s because of Wee.

295
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,920
I told her to call and wake me up,
but she didn’t.

296
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,840
Well, first year student.

297
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,520
You can’t really rely on them.

298
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,280
New girlfriend?

299
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,240
Ta.

300
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,820
Don’t you plan on changing yourself

301
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,320
for others?

302
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,160
Are you going to continue
changing girlfriends like this?

303
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,360
What you said was true.

304
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,440
I’m not good at keeping people.

305
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,160
I don’t really take care of people.

306
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But whatever, it’s the past.

307
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,000
It’s too late to fix it.

308
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,340
Instead of being discouraged,

309
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,960
why don’t you actually
start doing something?

310
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,720
I don’t know if it’s too late or not.

311
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,180
But it depends on

312
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,920
whether you still love Wawa or not.

313
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,120
Thank you.

314
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,840
It’s alright.
We’ve been friends forever anyway.

315
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,720
Thank you.

316
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,720
Thank you.

317
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,880
I’ll go talk to others first.

318
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,520
Hey, Ta.

319
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,080
Yeah?

320
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,680
Can I have Wawa’s number?

321
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,400
The amount of time to heal from a break up
is half the time they’ve been in love.

322
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,720
But if you want to heal faster,

323
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,280
you must find a replacement
for the loss.

324
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,560
Or the person that Pupaa likes is Wawa?

325
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,440
I never thought
that you’re this kind of person.

326
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,800
I thought you said you like Prapai.

327
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,000
Ta.

328
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,760
You too.
You know that Pupaa likes Prapai?

329
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,280
I know now.

330
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,720
You know and you’re still doing this?

331
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,360
But Prapai is still your friend.

332
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,560
You can’t just start flirting
after a break up right away.

333
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,680
That’s enough, Ta.

334
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,360
The reason I’m meeting up with Wawa

335
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,040
is because I wanted to ask for help
about Pai.

336
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,200
Oh really?

337
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,560
Why don’t you ask me then?

338
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,080
I’ve been friends with Pai
for longer than Wawa.

339
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,720
Then what kind of guy does Pai like?

340
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,320
Someone like me.

341
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,760
I’m joking.

342
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,320
But I’ve had more girlfriends than you.

343
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,720
How about this?

344
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,680
I’ll teach you the techniques
to win a girl’s heart.

345
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,780
After winning her heart,

346
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,520
make sure you know how to keep it too.

347
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Then where do we start?

348
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,080
What about starting from
changing your looks?

349
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,640
Prapai likes someone who...

350
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,320
Where are you going
dressed up like this?

351
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,800
Nothing.

352
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,640
I just wanted to switch things up.

353
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,620
Trying to switch himself up like this.

354
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,440
It’s so obvious.

355
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,080
He’s really in love.

356
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,120
Oh really?

357
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,360
So how do I look?

358
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,320
Do you like it?

359
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,120
I don’t know.

360
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,160
This technique doesn’t work.

361
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,880
Or she is still not over me?

362
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,840
Oh my friend,

363
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,160
I’m so sorry.

364
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,720
I really am sorry.

365
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,640
So then,

366
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,520
what should I do next?

367
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,120
I think the next step should be...

368
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,560
A girls advice won’t work out.

369
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,400
Let’s try the guys’ way out.

370
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,280
Hello there.

371
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,720
Oh, why are you early today?

372
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,680
I’m not lazy enough
to come late like you.

373
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,440
It’s not called being late.
It’s called being on time.

374
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,080
Hey, I’m talking to you nicely.
Can’t we be kind to each other for once?

375
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,160
Sure.

376
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,240
Servant.

377
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,800
Cut.

378
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,200
Servant,

379
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
touch up.

380
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,080
Sure.

381
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,040
Servant, where’s the lip balm?

382
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,680
Yes.

383
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,120
Servant, water.

384
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,960
Cut.

385
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,480
Are you done, Mr. Idol?

386
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,120
Wait, where’s my water?

387
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,200
Sure.

388
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Don’t.

389
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,880
Go back to your work.

390
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,000
Yes.

391
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,480
Only I can boss her around.

392
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,680
Camera set.

393
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,400
Sound set. And...

394
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,400
Action.

395
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,960
Living Life in Bangkok.

396
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,720
Cut.

397
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,520
Come on, quick.

398
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
Right here, come on.

399
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,800
Today’s a great day.

400
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,320
Do you see the guy over there?

401
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,960
He’s trying to get close to her.

402
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,680
This is how guys do it.

403
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,040
Hey, where are you going?

404
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
Are you going to leave him
to touch her like that?

405
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,160
Don’t go bother them.

406
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,960
Pupaa.

407
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,920
Already a problem on the first day.

408
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,400
Pupaa.

409
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,800
- Pupaa, what are you doing?
- Hey, I think that’s enough.

410
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,960
Servant.

411
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,160
No one’s here to pick you up today?

412
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,360
Do you need a lift?

413
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,320
No, thanks. I can go alone.

414
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,680
We don’t often finish early like this.

415
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,400
Do you want to go for a walk?

416
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,160
Hey, are you trying to
take advantage of me?

417
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,600
You’re not fun at all.

418
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,680
Don’t think that everyone is like you.

419
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,760
What? What did you say?

420
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,880
How was the situation
during the incident?

421
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,060
Those two guys harassed a girl.

422
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,760
So I went in to help.

423
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,320
Then what next?

424
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
Then I got punched in the face.

425
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,920
What happened here?

426
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,320
How old are you guys?
Why are you still fighting?

427
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,760
I’m fine. It’s alright.

428
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,600
It’s good that you’re alright.

429
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,600
I’m the one who’s hurt.

430
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
Why are they caught?

431
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,960
For fighting in the place.

432
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
But those two were harassing a girl.

433
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,000
So I’ve become the injured hero here.

434
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,720
What harassment?

435
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,140
I saw that she was dizzy,

436
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,360
so I wanted to give her a hand.

437
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,920
How is that helping?
It’s obvious you were harassing her.

438
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,640
I can explain the situation,
police officer.

439
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,280
That’s enough.

440
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,480
Both of you should discuss
about yourselves first.

441
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,560
- No.
- Sure.

442
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,800
I don’t think it should be a big issue.

443
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,720
How about this? Next time you guys come,

444
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,080
I’ll let you drink for free.

445
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,840
Is that okay?

446
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,760
- No.
- Yes.

447
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,080
But those two guys
were harassing a girl.

448
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,200
You’re just going to leave it like this?

449
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,760
Is society really this bad nowadays?

450
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,320
You weren’t in the situation,
why are you even bothering?

451
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,880
I’ve listened to you talk for a while,

452
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,200
I want to know, if a celebrity

453
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,080
came to review your place

454
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,520
that you ignored human rights,

455
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
will there still be customers coming?

456
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,600
Police officer,

457
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,400
we will give you the video evidence
from the security camera,

458
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,640
and will contact the girl
as soon as possible.

459
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,560
Does the police need any more details?

460
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,800
Let’s conclude to this then.

461
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,360
If there’s nothing else,
then we can split ways.

462
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,160
Come on.

463
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,600
Please lead the way, officer.

464
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,480
Thank you for doing it for a girl.

465
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,800
Don’t thank me.

466
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,380
Actually,

467
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,240
I didn’t do it
for the girl I don’t know.

468
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,760
But I did it for...

469
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,000
Come on, let’s go home.

470
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,120
Hold on, go home?

471
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,400
Well...

472
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,880
My house and his
are in the same direction.

473
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,040
I’ll go now. Bye. Ta.

474
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,480
Pupaa?

475
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,080
This is what you call the guy’s way?

476
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,360
Better call it an excuse to go party.

477
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,280
Not a single plan works.

478
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,400
What should I do next?

479
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,200
The fact that Pai saw me
going to the club like this

480
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,000
discredits me even more.

481
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,000
This time, I’ve thought about it.
It will work for sure.

482
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,280
How so?

483
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,880
Have a romantic meal together.

484
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,640
This plan never disappoints anyone.

485
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,160
Really?

486
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,760
Being alone together.

487
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,960
Confessing love in a good environment.

488
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,680
Anyone would fall for it.

489
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,120
The person that Pupaa likes
must be Wawa.

490
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,680
That’s why he’s trying so hard
to be close with me.

491
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,440
How about yesterday?
Was he thinking anything?

492
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,560
(Wawa, how are you?)

493
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,240
(Are things with Ta better? Have you...)

494
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,720
(Typing…)

495
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,160
(You put fresh food in the bin today.
It smells.)

496
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,920
(Clean it up.)

497
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,920
(Are you free tomorrow?)

498
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,940
If I respond immediately,

499
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,160
he will think that
I’m interested in talking to him.

500
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,480
I’ll wait for a while.

501
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,520
(I’m free. What’s up?)

502
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,040
(I want you to go somewhere with me.)

503
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,800
(Where to? A date?)

504
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Am I too obvious?

505
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,800
I’m just an experiment subject.

506
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,920
Hey, you’re liking someone, right?

507
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,660
If you want me as part of your
dating experiment,

508
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,920
then just tell me.

509
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,240
Don’t just use me like this.
You’re not a gentleman at all.

510
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,040
So will you be my date partner?

511
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,520
Yeah, sure.

512
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,080
I’m not a mean person.

513
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,400
Wow, a huge damage on me.

514
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,840
Be in control, Prapai.

515
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,280
So beautiful.

516
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,680
I’m hungry already. Let’s go.

517
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Here you go.

518
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,080
Thank you.

519
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,480
This place is lovely. It’s a pass.

520
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,360
But why is there no one here?

521
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,600
Thank you.

522
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,000
Thank you.

523
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,360
Thank you.

524
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,120
Have a bite.

525
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,680
This is just like chicken soup.

526
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,060
This is a molecular cuisine.

527
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,720
It’s a new way of presenting food.

528
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,540
It’s appearance may be

529
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,120
different and unique.

530
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,400
But if you taste it,
you will know what it is.

531
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,200
Because the real taste

532
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,840
will never fool you.

533
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,920
Hey.

534
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,080
Are you alright?

535
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,880
I forgot to take a photo.

536
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,000
Can I borrow yours for the photo?

537
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,200
Actually, your flirting skill
is quite on point.

538
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
Seems like you’ve done some homework.

539
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,200
The restaurant has a nice environment,

540
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,800
and the guy is also very pleasing.

541
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,880
The girl who is pursued by Pupaa,
the scientist,

542
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,600
must be feeling special.

543
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,280
I’m so jealous.

544
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,480
You don’t have to be jealous.

545
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,600
Because that girl...

546
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
is...

547
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,360
I’m sorry. I have to take this call.

548
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,280
Hello, what’s up?

549
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,160
Come to the location I sent you
immediately.

550
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,320
But this is my day off.
Where do you want me to go?

551
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,880
It’s work. I’ve got an urgent job.

552
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,040
You must come quick.
Otherwise, you’re doomed.

553
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,320
Hold on, it’s your job.
What does it have to do with me?

554
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,840
In 15 minutes,

555
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,560
if I don’t see you here,

556
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,800
be prepared to answer your boss’ call.

557
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,320
Hey, hold on.

558
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,360
(Siam Amazing Park)

559
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,040
An amusement park?

560
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,080
I have to go now. It’s an urgent call.

561
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,600
Right now?

562
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,760
I’ll treat you to a meal later, alright?

563
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,040
I’m sorry. See you later.

564
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,920
What a Prapai thing to do.

565
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:05,620
(Siam Amazing Park)

566
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,880
I thought you said
you had a shooting going on.

567
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,680
No.

568
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,960
I just wanted to
come to an amusement park.

569
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,880
But I don’t have any friends.

570
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,160
What is wrong with you?
Why are you like this?

571
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,280
I’m taking you out for some fun time.

572
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,080
You should be happy.

573
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,800
Unless I was interrupting you
with something.

574
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,640
Were you on a date?

575
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,720
No.

576
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,520
Then good.

577
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,400
You can go have fun alone.

578
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,920
It’s my day off today. I’m out.

579
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,600
Are you really going to go?

580
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,880
I thought you said
you’d do everything I said.

581
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,200
But I meant it being work-related.

582
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,040
But I meant everything.

583
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,120
Fine, if you want to go, you can.

584
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,680
But I won’t promise

585
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,160
if you’ll be seeing me
at the next shoot or not.

586
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,280
(Special scene)

587
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,880
Is this yours?

588
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,080
Is this going to work? I’ll try.

589
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,920
(There must be a gift for every holiday)
There must be a gift for every holiday.

590

Gifts will win her heart.

(Prapai likes things
with lots of decorations)

594
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,840
Open it.

595
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,960
Do you like it?
