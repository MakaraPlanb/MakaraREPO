00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]


2
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,590
Are you okay, Xiaoxiao?


3
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,670
Xiaoxiao?


4
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,070
I'm okay. I'm okay.


5
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,110
Such a trifle can't scare me at all.


6
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,430
I'm really fine.


7
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,140
What is it?


8
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,750
What is it?


9
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,550
You'd better not see it.


10
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,110
Throw it away.


11
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,590
What is it?


12
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,700
Nothing.


13
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,150
Have you checked the monitor?


14
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,190
I couldn't see anything.


15
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,350
We have voice-activated lights in this building.


16
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,150
And the man came in in the dark.


17
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,030
I can only check with property management


18
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,870
to see if there's any surveillance


19
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,110
inside the elevator.


20
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,070
I'm sorry, Xiaoxiao.


21
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,390
That's all because of me.


22
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,430
I got you involved.


23
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,829
Don't say sorry to me!


24
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,710
Pretentious!


25
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:39,590
Listen.


26
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,790
I was careless this time.


27
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,550
I'll teach him a lesson


28
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,990
if he dares to come again!


29
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,470
Come on!


30
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,590
You already turned pale.


31
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,510
So stubborn.


32
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,110
You need to change a place


33
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,350
to live these days.


34
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,430
What about living


35
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,710
with your parents?


36
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,470
No way.


37
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:56,390
I can't leave you


38
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,230
alone here.


39
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,230
Its' too dangerous.


40
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,630
Why don't you stay at my home?


41
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,990
My parents' house is roomy


42
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,190
and they seldom stay at home.


43
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,870
It's also very strictly managed.


44
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,950
Ordinary people can't get in there.


45
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,830
I don't think that's appropriate.


46
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,310
Why not?


47
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,590
Hang, see.


48
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,550
You can't understand


49
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,470
girl's thoughts.


50
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,630
She hasn't even met your parents yet,


51
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,070
but now you invite her to live in your home.


52
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:16,870
In what identity?


53
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,390
She will see my parents sooner or later.


54
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,470
That's still not appropriate!


55
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:22,710
What about this?


56
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,550
Since Hang feels worried about you,


57
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,470
what about


58
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,110
my moving to this house?


59
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,110
It will be much safer


60
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,110
if there is a man.


61
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,430
Don't tell me that


62
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,030
it was you who put the scary thing.


63
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,470
How could I do that!


64
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,790
Look at your expression just now,


65
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,470
just like a villain


66
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,630
whose trick had worked.


67
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,950
Which trick did I do?


68
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,310
You...!


69
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,230
Alright. Alright.


70
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,710
You two stop arguing.


71
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,270
How about your negotiations


72
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,510
with Wang Shu?


73
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,630
I haven't got a result.


74
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,110
He asserted that


75
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,590
they had voted


76
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:53,670
to choose the topic.


77
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,070
It was totally because


78
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,430
this thing went viral on the hot topic list


79
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,790
and they wanted to ride the wave.


80
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,270
As for the contents,


81
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,300
they were offered by the parties themselves.


82
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,790
They were neither inspired


83
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,150
nor embellished.


84
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,230
They didn't even


85
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,070
know it was such


86
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,710
big news before


87
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,990
and thought that they would make a fortune.


88
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,350
Right.


89
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,750
Contact the Shenliu News as soon as possible.


90
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,910
All conditions can be met


91
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,590
as long as they are willing to


92
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,470
remove the article.


93
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:19,829
OK.


94
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,470
OK. OK.


95
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,750
I'll contact you later.


96
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,470
My son?


97
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,870
Why did you come so late?


98
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,620
I want to go back to live for a few days.


99
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,950
Why didn't you tell me


100
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,710
in advance?


101
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,980
I haven't even changeg your bed sheet.


102
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,590
Come in. Give me.


103
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,470
No, thanks, mom.


104
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:34,950
Mom,


105
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,790
who were you calling?


106
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,790
Nobody.


107
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,590
Just a company staff.


108
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,950
You don't know his name.


109
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,990
I heard what you said.


110
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:43,950
You called him to


111
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,070
remove the article


112
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,060
from Shenliu News, right?


113
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,270
It's because I'm worried about you.


114
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:51,510
Mom, I know you're worried about me.


115
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,190
But I advise you not to do that.


116
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,670
Why?


117
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,510
This can only make the problem


118
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,550
more complicated.


119
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,750
They would feel that


120
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,790
I performed academic cheating


121
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,510
but was actually supported


122
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,310
by shady capital.


123
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,910
The credibility of research institutions


124
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,470
will be further questioned.


125
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,430
Or even worse,


126
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,590
the social evaluation of SP


127
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,710
may be adversely affected.


128
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,710
You should consider it


129
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,870
more carefully.


130
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,030
Dear son,


131
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,910
you've got a point there.


132
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,470
It seems that I'm too impatient.


133
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,630
Well.


134
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,430
I'll call back again.


135
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,390
I won't force them to remove the article.


136
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,910
Take it easy.


137
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,670
I can deal with


138
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,550
my own business.


139
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,830
Don't worry.


140
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,710
And my bed sheet,


141
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,350
I'll change it by myself.


142
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,670
I'm not a kid anymore.


143
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,870
You should go to bed early.


144
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,070
Good night.


145
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:38,950
Hang.


146
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,630
Don't flaunt your superiority.


147
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,550
You just do it if you can cover the problem.


148
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,830
But if not,


149
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,950
you still have me with you.


150
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,510
I don't care about the so-called credibility


151
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,990
or social evaluation.


152
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,510
I have struggled with my business for so many years.


153
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,990
And now I think everything


154
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,790
will be meaningless


155
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,620
if I can't protect my son


156
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,550
against malicious slander.


157
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,270
Mom.


158
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,910
Thank you.


159
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,790
You can cast away your company,


160
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,790
å·¥but the rest of the staff


161
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,150
can't lose their jobs.


162
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,430
Don't get your head in the clouds.


163
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,580
Don't worry.


164
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,470
I'm alright.


165
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,110
OK?


166
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,270
OK.


167
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,350
Cutie.


168
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,590
Do you want to sleep together?


169
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:04,910
Alright.


170
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,350
Get, get down.


171
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,470
What are you doing?


172
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,590
It's too early.


173
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,110
You finally got up.


174
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,390
I bought a surveillance camera


175
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,870
with...infrared night vision.


176
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,830
Now it's arrived.


177
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,670
It also has...an electronic cat's eye.


178
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,030
That sounds pretty impressive.


179
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,230
My god.


180
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,910
Don't stand there.


181
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,110
Hurry up, help us.


182
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,510
Take the thing


183
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,190
on that table.


184
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,270
Quick.


185
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,630
Quickly, stick it.


186
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,590
There. Quick.


187
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,510
Be careful.


188
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,870
Move it up a little. Up.


189
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,510
Higher. Higher.


190
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,950
Higher. Higher.


191
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,310
Higher.


192
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,670
Never mind. Get down.


193
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,550
Get down.


194
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,380
Stick it there. Come here.


195
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,110
Quickly! You are too slow!


196
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,990
OK. Here.


197
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,430
Let me do it.


198
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,830
OK. Stick it.


199
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,910
But for what happened


200
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,750
was scary and vexing,


201
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,030
this scene is


202
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,470
kind of cozy.


203
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,630
It's like pasting Spring Festival couplets.


204
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,870
Come here. Come here.


205
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,510
Look.


206
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:20,990
That car.


207
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,990
In my memory,


208
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,670
that car has been parked outside


209
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,020
for two days.


210
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,630
That's suspicious.


211
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,390
Lingling,


212
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,230
I think you'd better


213
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,310
not to go to the lab.


214
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,230
No, I can't.


215
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,430
Mr. Zhang and others


216
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,750
have stayed up all night.


217
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,870
I have to go to the lab


218
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,150
and change shifts.


219
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,110
Take it easy.


220
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,510
It's in broad daylight.


221
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,830
He can't do anything bad.


222
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:42,830
But,


223
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,270
remember the car number


224
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,550
and keep the evidence.


225
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,630
Clever.


226
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,710
Kid.


227
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,390
You're finally here.


228
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,580
Alright.


229
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,100
Haven't eaten breakfast, huh?


230
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,550
Hurry up. Eat some breakfast.


231
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,830
Jing and I will take over the work.


232
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,990
-Thank you.
-Thank you.


233
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,270
You have tried so many times


234
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,230
in the past whole day!


235
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,150
You bet!


236
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,430
We didn't even close our eyes.


237
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,910
We had already discussed in the


238
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,310
chat group with guru


239
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,190
and speculated about possible


240
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,670
problems with the materials.


241
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,070
We've already set the direction,


242
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,430
so we tested it overnight.


243
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,630
Guru can get back to our team sooner


244
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,190
if we finish the test earlier.


245
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,580
Not so,


246
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,710
working with you guys all the time


247
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,510
isn't so productive.


248
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,150
You wimpy kid!


249
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,110
What are you saying!


250
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,670
I stayed up all night.


251
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,510
I'm gonna die.


252
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,510
But you still beat me?


253
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,310
Alright. Alright.


254
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,270
Well.


255
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,310
We'll leave it to you


256
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,230
and we'll go first.


257
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,350
I'm too tired to continue.


258
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,550
Take the breakfast.


259
00:11:59,550 --> 00:11:59,990
Thank you.


260
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,710
You've had a long day.


261
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:01,590
We'll leave.


262
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,430
Bye.


263
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,110
Bye.


264
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:05,950
Uncle.


265
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,030
The cleaning worker


266
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,470
has no authority to get in the lab.


267
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,310
You just clean the corridor.


268
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,630
Qingyi.


269
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,310
with only two days


270
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,110
you recognized me as an uncle.


271
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,590
You are so brave.


272
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,150
Guru!


273
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,340
I...I was wrong.


274
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:24,990
Lanhang.


275
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,590
Why are you here?


276
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,830
You're not the only one


277
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,310
who can't stand a day without doing experiments.


278
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,390
This is our last bastion.


279
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,870
What if we get caught?


280
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,550
It's OK.


281
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,550
I've asked the Professor.


282
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,550
Although I'm not allowed to


283
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,750
do experiments as a member


284
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,670
of the research team,


285
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,750
now I have changed to another identity.


286
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,190
I'm a cleaning worker.


287
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,590
I guess no one can impede me now.


288
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,110
It's suitable for you.


289
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,030
Lanhang,


290
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,430
so every dog has its day.


291
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,990
I didn't expect you to be in such a situation.


292
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,430
Only when I have experienced


293
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,350
your life


294
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,230
will I know


295
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,670
how to love you in a better way.


296
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,630
Get to work.


297
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,990
We are going back.


298
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,710
Too tired.


299
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,190
Lingling, Headmaster Zheng wants to see you.


300
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,110
I'll be right there.


301
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,630
Bai Lingling,


302
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,550
I guess you've already known


303
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,270
what had happened.


304
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,150
I don't know.


305
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,670
Then I'll say it directly.


306
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,030
The love affair between you and Yang Lanhang


307
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,790
caused uproar in our school.


308
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,510
Crucially, it also involves the issue


309
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,270
of fairness and justice


310
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,710
in graduate enrollment.


311
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,270
It has had a very bad effect on


312
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,310
the reputation of our school.


313
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,150
But compared with this,


314
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,790
isn't the impact of


315
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,750
academic fraud worse?


316
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,310
I'm just pointing to a fact.


317
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,190
Academic fraud will definitely


318
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,510
be investigated by the


319
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,670
Academic Inquiry Committee.


320
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,030
But your relationship


321
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,070
did have


322
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,710
a bad effect on our school.


323
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,070
I heard that


324
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,790
it's because of you that


325
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:14,950
he refused to stay for teaching.


326
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,790
You are ruining his future!


327
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,190
He refused to stay for teaching?


328
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,070
Didn't he tell you?


329
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,150
Lanhang is


330
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,270
a rare talent.


331
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,670
We're the elders who


332
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,390
watched him grow up.


333
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,670
He wanted to be a teacher


334
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,510
since his childhood


335
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,270
because he liked the academic atmosphere of universities.


336
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,110
His parents


337
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,390
knew that clearly.


338
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,550
If he'd like to stay


339
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,030
we'll definitely nominate him ,


340
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,350
for the coming election of


341
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,350
Distinguished Young Scholars.


342
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,710
But we didn't expect that


343
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,110
such a scandal to appear.


344
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,790
We don't want to see him


345
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,390
be ruined like this.


346
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,070
Have a look at this.


347
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,310
This is the last quota of the university


348
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,630
to go abroad on an official assignment.


349
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,900
What you should do is just


350
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,470
go back and sign it.


351
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,110
Headmaster.


352
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,390
For the problem


353
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,510
of academic cheating,


354
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,830
how would you


355
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,750
prove that he is innocent?


356
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,750
You don't need


357
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,110
to worry about that.


358
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,500
All you have to do is


359
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,870
sign up and then


360
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,150
return here


361
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:15,990
for the formalities.


362
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,990
If it's just like


363
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,110
what you said,


364
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,990
you love Yang Lanhang as your own kid,


365
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,910
then I think the most important thing at this time is that


366
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,270
how to cleanse him of the


367
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,110
stigma of the academic fraud,


368
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,950
instead of trying to


369
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,150
get me out of here.


370
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,510
I'm not that important.


371
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,990
I feel guilty that


372
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,110
you gave me such a heavy stake.


373
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,990
It's true.


374
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,070
You might as well


375
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,950
ask me to take his place for the academic fraud.


376
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,590
If so,


377
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,310
I might feel a little more peace of mind.


378
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,350
What the hell are you talking about!


379
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,110
Just kidding.


380
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,430
Please don't be serious.


381
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,710
Anyway, I won't go abroad.


382
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,310
I'm not interested in it.


383
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,070
It's too hot for me


384
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,150
to hold something that doesn't belong to me.


385
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,390
But I won't give to others


386
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,190
what belongs to me either.


387
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,110
I passed the postgraduate entrance exam


388
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,070
with blood, sweat


389
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,430
and tears.


390
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,190
If you think


391
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,270
there is something


392
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,350
concerning fairness,


393
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,150
it's okay for me


394
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,070
to cooperate with all forms


395
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,070
of investigation.


396
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,540
But no matter what the consequence is,


397
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,750
I won't leave Yang Lanhang anyway.


398
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,390
I like him,


399
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,550
I love him,


400
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,990
so I'll consider for him


401
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,070
and do what he likes.


402
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,510
He


403
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,670
had given up


404
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,630
so much for me


405
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,390
but he had never let me go.


406
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,390
So will I.


407
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,710
Why should I let him go?


408
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,590
OK. I finished my words.


409
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,270
We are quite busy in the lab.


410
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,030
I need to go now.


411
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:46,710
You...


412
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,060
You know know what happened.


413
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,630
Assistant Chen is awesome.


414
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,190
He had investigated


415
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,550
Tang Shun thoroughly


416
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,710
about his personal information.


417
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,950
He is not on a trip at all.


418
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,230
He just stays at home.


419
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,150
It's of no use to find him.


420
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,950
He can only tell us a pack of lies.


421
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,390
That's a libel,


422
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,069
and he should be punished by the law.


423
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,390
We might as well think about


424
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,470
how we can get him to tell us the truth.


425
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,910
Aren't you dizzy?


426
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:17,790
Stop writing.


427
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,990
No.


428
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,510
You know what?


429
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,190
I wrote an article about the touching love story


430
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,109
of Lingling and Yang Lanhang.


431
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,270
The backstage data is pretty good.


432
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,230
It already has nearly 10,000 readers


433
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,230
in the past one hour.


434
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,790
Next,


435
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,030
I should continue to write it.


436
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,590
What's the content?


437
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,110
I wrote a story of


438
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,270
a genius scientist


439
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,590
suffering from a serious illness


440
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,150
and a poor girl


441
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,390
with a clever mind.


442
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,070
After seven years of online love,


443
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,670
they experienced nearly 20 years


444
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,430
of entanglement


445
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,390
and finally broke through


446
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,590
the obstacles of reality


447
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,830
and fell in love with each other.


448
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,950
But what greeted them


449
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,230
was a new heated debate


450
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,470
and a criticism from the world.


451
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,630
Why are you laughing?


452
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,910
Just tell me whether you want to see it?


453
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,310
Don't you feel that it's too dramatic?


454
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,660
Dramatic?


455
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,230
Just tell me. You want to see it or not?


456
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,190
I want. I want.


457
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,310
I can't wait to see it.


458
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,550
If this story


459
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,340
was printed in a magazine


460
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,350
ten years ago,


461
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,550
it will definitely be sold out.


462
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,350
Really?


463
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,310
I said it.


464
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,910
What's it?


465
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,550
Nothing special.


466
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,790
I'll get down and see it.


467
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,110
Who?!


468
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,750
Who are you?


469
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,790
Get out of the way!


470
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,470
Back off!


471
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,230
Back off!


472
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,670
Back off!


473
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,950
Are you okay?


474
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,550
Are you alright?


475
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,270
I'm fine.


476
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,110
Just skin trauma.


477
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,190
How could they beat you


478
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,710
to such an extent!


479
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,190
They are villains!


480
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,950
In broad daylight!


481
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,070
Come here.


482
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,190
Come here.


483
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,390
Do you want to lean on it?


484
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,630
What the hell happened?


485
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,990
Where did they come from?


486
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,230
Don't worry.


487
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,230
The automobile data recorder was recorded.


488
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,390
They won't run away.


489
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,350
This is Hang's car.


490
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,590
I guess they mistook me for


491
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,740
Hang just like you did before.


492
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,190
I didn't do that before!


493
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,550
I just threw trash at you.


494
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,750
I didn't hit you.


495
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,550
And I didn't hit you


496
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,990
to such an extent.


497
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,150
I'm so sad.


498
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:03,910
I haven't met anything good


499
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,270
after meeting you.


500
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,230
But I think it's worthwhile


501
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,230
to see you crying for me right now.


502
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,380
What are you saying!


503
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,110
My laptop was left there.


504
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:16,670
I....


505
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,230
Headmaster Zheng


506
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,310
found you in the daytime.


507
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,110
What did he say?


508
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,070
Nothing important.


509
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,390
Just some professional topics.


510
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,590
Now we have


511
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,390
done repeated tests


512
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,590
in different directions.


513
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,070
When we prove that


514
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,310
there is no problem


515
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,270
with this material,


516
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,150
can we prove your innocence?


517
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,430
That can only prove that


518
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,150
there's nothing wrong


519
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,430
with our materials and our


520
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,110
animal testing procedures.


521
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,990
But now they're saying


522
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,390
we faked the experiments.


523
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,340
In the past,


524
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,150
you would have said,


525
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,990
'Well, we've been


526
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,270
working for nothing.'


527
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,590
We can't think of it that way!


528
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,990
We do repeated tests


529
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:41,950
to prove the safety


530
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,510
of our materials,


531
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,270
right?


532
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,990
Making experiments don't like making shows.


533
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,310
Also,


534
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,830
we need to guarantee that


535
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,630
our data is safe forever.


536
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,750
We should have confidence.


537
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,950
Did I look like that?


538
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,790
You did!


539
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,830
Wasn't that a good imitation?


540
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,980
You were just like this!


541
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,870
They are Yang Lanhang


542
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:01,750
and Bai Lingling.


543
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:02,950
How ridiculous.


544
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,550
She passed the postgraduate exam because of her boyfriend,


545
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,150
but now she should dare to display it


546
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,030
in public!


547
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,350
She is disgraceful!


548
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,030
I read a lot of people online saying that


549
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,750
we were like a tortoise matching a dog.


550
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,750
Can you tell me


551
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,790
which one would you like


552
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,910
if you must choose one?


553
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,830
Must I choose one?


554
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,500
Tortoise has a long span.


555
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,910
It moves slowly


556
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,230
but has a beautiful shell,


557
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,550
which can also be made into Chinese medicine.


558
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,910
Dog.... Its life span is shorter.


559
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,990
But it's fluffy.


560
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,190
So cute.


561
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,670
It's hard for me


562
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:42,990
to choose.


563
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,350
Then I'll be a dog.


564
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,830
You want to be a dog?


565
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,510
OK. Then I'll be a tortoise.


566
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,310
Sure.


567
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,190
Bye.


568
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,510
Then, I'm leaving first.


569
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,510
Okay.


570
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,990
You should be careful


571
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,230
since you drive home alone.


572
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,270
It's okay.


573
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,110
Bye.


574
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,110
I'll watch you leave.


575
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,390
Okay.


576
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,110
Bye.


577
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,350
Have an early rest.


578
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,590
You sick freak!


579
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,830
Is it you? Is it you?


580
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,950
Nuo, it's me.


581
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,540
It's me.


582
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,190
You... Why are you here?


583
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,190
The netizens can even


584
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,150
find out your address.


585
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,990
I'm a little worried.


586
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,790
Your auntie wanted


587
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,510
to invite you home.


588
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,750
I know you must disagree.


589
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,110
But I feel worried.


590
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,670
So I came to pay a visit.


591
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,110
So...


592
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,150
that car...?


593
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,430
Yes.


594
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,470
During these days,


595
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,590
you've always stayed here?


596
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,190
No. No.


597
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,230
The cousin of your auntie


598
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,710
and I came in shifts.


599
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,070
He came during the daytime.


600
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,390
And I came at night-time.


601
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,590
You...are in such an old age,


602
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,550
why are you still displaying gallantry?


603
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,630
You think


604
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,150
I would feel touched, right?


605
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,950
I don't mean that.


606
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,830
I, I'm afraid that you might have an accident.


607
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,310
If it's really so,


608
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,110
I...


609
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,910
How can I explain this to your mom?


610
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,340
Alright.


611
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,110
You go upstairs.


612
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,350
I'll leave.


613
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:30,790
You...


614
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,860
Have you eaten anything?


615
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,350
What about


616
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,350
going upstairs and having some water?


617
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,230
Forget it if you don't want to.


618
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,110
I will.


619
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,460
I will.


620
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,300
Be quiet.


621
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,390
Hold on.


622
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,990
Don't...don't grab me.


623
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,750
Be gentle. Be gentle.


624
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,670
Hold on. Hold on.


625
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,310
You're back.


626
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,510
Who's he?


627
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,030
Well.


628
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,620
This is my dad.


629
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,300
And this is Guan Xiaoyu.


630
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,790
Hello, uncle.


631
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,910
Hello. Hello.


632
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,750
Hello, uncle.


633
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,750
I'm Guan Xiaoyu's boyfriend.


634
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,790
My name is Ouyang Yifan.


635
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,860
No one will think you are numb even if you keep quiet.


636
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,990
What's wrong with your face?


637
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,350
Could it be that you hit him?


638
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,790
I was a scapegoat.


639
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,110
I just happened to


640
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,310
look pitiful.


641
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,310
Uncle, have a seat.


642
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:37,790
Don't stand there.


643
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,110
Uncle, sit down. Sit down please.


644
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,590
Thank you.


645
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,590
You must have taken care of


646
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,030
Lingling so much.


647
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,150
It doesn't matter.


648
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,390
Uncle, take a seat first.


649
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,390
Have a seat and I go fetch you some water.


650
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,070
Okay.


651
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,550
Uncle,


652
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,230
why did you come


653
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,350
to pay a visit today?


654
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,950
So that car is yours.


655
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:09,790
Yes.


656
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:10,510
It's mine.


657
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,110
Oh my god.


658
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,310
I'm deeply touched


659
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,070
by such deep paternal love.


660
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,470
Maybe next time


661
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,590
when you meet him,


662
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,670
you can smile at him.


663
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,870
I think your father


664
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,630
has been missing it for a long time.


665
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,470
I've heard that


666
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,790
every dad would guard against


667
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,390
his daughter's smile.


668
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,510
And they will strive for it.


669
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,350
I did as what you said.


670
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,350
I smiled at my father.


671
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,500
I didn't expect that he would weep.


672
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,180
At that moment, I suddenly felt that


673
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,470
he seemed old.


674
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,110
Actually, in my childhood,


675
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,710
I always felt my dad


676
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,750
would never age.


677
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:32,870
But today,


678
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:33,990
I,


679
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,630
I somehow felt


680
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,190
that he was not so tall


681
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,950
and strong as


682
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,390
I imagined.


683
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,390
He was quite fragile indeed.


684
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:43,910
Yes.


685
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,870
After we grew up,


686
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,030
our parents aged


687
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,990
before we knew it.


688
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,020
You know, my dad


689
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,030
always called me Nuo.


690
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,830
I felt annoyed


691
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,430
every time


692
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,380
he did,


693
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,710
because he had divorced my mom.


694
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,430
I didn't want him


695
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,470
to call me Nuo.


696
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,070
But I didn't expect


697
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,470
to feel more sorrowful


698
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,790
when he called me Lingling.


699
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,990
You can smile more at him


700
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,790
when you meet him next time.


701
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,190
Okay.


702
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,230
It's getting late.


703
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,550
Have an early rest.


704
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,670
You too.


705
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,070
Good night.


706
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,270
Good night.


707
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,190
And...


708
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,390
I love you.


709
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:33,910
I love you too.


710
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,910
Alright, have an early rest.


711
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:37,510
Good night.


712
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,070
Mom,


713
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,110
isn't that enough?


714
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,030
Hang,


715
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,110
it's so late.


716
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,590
Who did you call?


717
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,030
My girlfriend.


718
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,950
Is she Bai Lingling?


719
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,430
Of course.


720
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,030
Now that you love her


721
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,270
and she loves you too,


722
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,590
seek a chance


723
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,620
and invite her home


724
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,710
to have a meal with us.


725
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,140
I'll cook some delicacies for you two.


726
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,030
Really?


727
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,190
Of course.


728
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,270
Alright,


729
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,470
have some hot milk


730
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,390
and then an early rest.


731
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,470
Good night.


732
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,230
Good night.


733
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,190
My mom wants to see you.


734
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,470
See you now?


735
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,230
I feel really uneasy.


736
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,390
Yesterday, Headmaster Zheng


737
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,270
told me that for me,


738
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,070
he gave up the chance to


739
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,670
be a lecturer at Huaihai University.


740
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,470
Do you think she wants to talk about this matter with me?


741
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,790
More than that chance.


742
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,670
He gave up


743
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,790
vying for Distinguished Young Scholars as well.


744
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,950
If I were his mom,


745
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,350
I might really want to


746
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,030
break you up.


747
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,510
What should I do?


748
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,750
What should I do?


749
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,110
Don't be anxious.


750
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,350
And you should not deny yourself.


751
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,190
Listen to me.


752
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,340
You are not below him.


753
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,020
You're right.


754
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,790
It's just that


755
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,390
my grades are a little poorer than his.


756
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,270
My achievements are less than his.


757
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,030
My family is somehow poorer than his.


758
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,060
And my background


759
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,030
is somehow complicated.


760
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,110
I'm done.


761
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,070
I am below him


762
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,630
too much.


763
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,150
You see.


764
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,430
For my condition,


765
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,820
I still date Yang Lanhang.


766
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:41,870
Is it that I don't


767
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,470
have a clear estimation of myself.


768
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,070
No. You're great.


769
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,510
You.


770
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,310
I might as well punch you to wake you up.


771
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:47,950
Believe me.


772
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:48,750
You should behave


773
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,510
like what you did


774
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,110
to Headmaster Zheng yesterday.


775
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,550
That...that was a special circumstance.


776
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,750
I could not be timid at that moment,


777
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,310
could I?


778
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,030
No.


779
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,590
I think you thought too much.


780
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,150
My auntie is quite nice.


781
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,350
She is your auntie.


782
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,550
Of course, she is nice to you.


783
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,390
It's not that you are dating


784
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,230
Yang Lanhang.


785
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,230
I got an idea.


786
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,870
I pretend to be sick and I won't go.


787
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:09,670
No.


788
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,710
I still think


789
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,950
sooner or later,


790
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,710
the day of reckoning will come.


791
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,990
Listen to me, you should go.


792
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:14,390
Come on.


793
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,150
Better a little loss than a long sorrow.


794
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:15,870
Come on. Get up.


795
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:16,710
No, what are you doing?


796
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,390
Go. Go. Go.


797
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,190
Pick up a beautiful garment.


798
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,110
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.


799
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,790
My dad is not home today.


800
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,590
So there's only my mom,


801
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,150
the housekeeper and me.


802
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,270
Okay.


803
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,390
So you don't need to be reserved.


804
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,710
Just make yourself at home.


805
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,230
Be careful.


806
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,470
Mom, Lingling is here.


807
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,750
Lingling is here.


808
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,110
Come on. Come on. Take a seat.


809
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:45,870
Hello, auntie.


810
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,230
Ms. Zhang,


811
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,350
bring the fruit here.


812
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,590
Okay.


813
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,150
Pretty girl.


814
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,470
Thank you.


815
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,150
Thanks.


816
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:58,910
Well, mom,


817
00:32:59,230 --> 00:32:59,870
this is a plant


818
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,100
Lingling selected for you.


819
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,790
I, I


820
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,550
have no idea about whether you will like it or not.


821
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,030
Of course I do.


822
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,830
Plants have long roots


823
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,750
and mean something propitious.


824
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,230
Why don't I like it?


825
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,020
Hang,


826
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,310
you stay with Lingling.


827
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,110
I have specially


828
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,430
cooked soup for Lingling today.


829
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,150
I'm going to see if it is ready.


830
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,190
Auntie,


831
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,190
is there anything


832
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,390
I can do for you?


833
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,190
Look.


834
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,270
Look.


835
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,070
My son is more than


836
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:24,710
20 years old.


837
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,190
And he has never offered


838
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,190
me some help in the kitchen.


839
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,430
Sure enough, daughter-in-law is more considerate.


840
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,630
Mom,


841
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,470
you might scare her.


842
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,030
Is it that serious?


843
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,910
Lingling, did I scare you?


844
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:39,710
No. No.


845
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:40,990
Go, go, go. Go


846
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:43,910
Go.


847
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,870
Go. Go.


848
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,630
Ms. Zhang, you did a great job today.


849
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,550
There's no work for you anymore.


850
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,630
You can go back early.


851
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,470
Okay. Okay.


852
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,110
Thank you for your great work.


853
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:58,910
Hang,


854
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,070
go to the cellar


855
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,390
and fetch the wine that I've treasured


856
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,070
for years.


857
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,990
Hurry.


858
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,630
Yes. Yes.


859
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:09,590
Lingling, take a seat.


860
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,110
Sit down.


861
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,190
Lingling,


862
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,510
I have something


863
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,550
to talk to you alone


864
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,110
in Hang's absence.


865
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,310
Alright.


866
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,230
Take it.


867
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,670
Auntie, sorry.


868
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:26,830
Please don't behave like that.


869
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,389
I won't leave Yang Lanhang.


870
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,030
Lingling, what are you thinking?


871
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,030
This is a Centurion Card of SP.


872
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,070
I've thought about it for a long while.


873
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,550
I really have no idea


874
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:40,310
about a proper gift


875
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,710
for our first meeting.


876
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,230
I'm afraid that you won't accept it


877
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,310
if it is too expensive.


878
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,870
So I asked the public relations department


879
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,670
to specially make this for you.


880
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,989
A Centurion Card for VIP.


881
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,870
Look, there's your name.


882
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:52,550
It's true.


883
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,070
How's that? Do you like it?


884
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:54,750
Yes.


885
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:55,670
Thank you, auntie.


886
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,190
Take it.


887
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,790
Then I'll take it.


888
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,030
Sorry,


889
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,310
I watched too many TV plays.


890
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,910
Lingling, tell me the truth.


891
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,510
How do you


892
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,790
think of my son?


893
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,230
He's really nice.


894
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,390
Really?


895
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,230
What's wrong, auntie?


896
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,070
Actually, this is the first time


897
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,950
my son has brought


898
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,310
a girl home.


899
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,030
And it's my first time


900
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,390
to be a mother-in-law.


901
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,390
I'm quite a green hand.


902
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,030
I even have no idea about what I should ask you.


903
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,270
Lingling,


904
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,150
what about this?


905
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,830
Let's add friends on WeChat.


906
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,070
Then I can ask you


907
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,350
if I think of something. Okay?


908
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:33,830
Okay. Okay.


909
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,270
Here. You scan my code.


910
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:37,950
Mom.


911
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,710
Mom.


912
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:40,550
You, you


913
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,990
should not invite Lingling


914
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,070
into our family's group chat.


915
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,310
Why?


916
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,220
We've been one family.


917
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,510
Why can't we be in a group chat?


918
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,430
No. You silly kid.


919
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,630
Just ignore him.


920
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,270
Okay.


921
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,830
I got in.


922
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,670
You eat less.


923
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,990
You've eaten quite a lot of ribs.


924
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,510
I bought these for Lingling.


925
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,470
Stop eating.


926
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,830
I'm still growing up.


927
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,310
Eat one more.


928
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,270
How can you be growing up?


929
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,460
You are tall enough. Don't eat.


930
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,750
I'm thin.


931
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,590
Lingling, come and eat by yourself....


932
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,030
What's wrong?


933
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,270
You see, these marketing accounts


934
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,150
have apologized.


935
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,150
But why do netizens still criticize him?


936
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,950
It's normal.


937
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,710
Now everyone online thinks himself Sherlock Holmes.


938
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:51,990
They behaved so righteously that


939
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,790
they seemed to be


940
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:53,630
part of justice.


941
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,270
Even if these marketing accounts have admitted that


942
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,460
they were following the trend to bring shame on him


943
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,350
and apologized,


944
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,390
it wouldn't work


945
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,270
as long as they believed that Hang cheated


946
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:01,270
in scientific research.


947
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:01,710
See,


948
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,030
Li Feifei was abused because of that, too.


949
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,660
So, it's proven that


950
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,470
it's easy to verify what we've done.


951
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,470
But to verify


952
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,830
we didn't do anything wrong,


953
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,950
it's too hard.


954
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,270
Unless,


955
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,060
unless that monkey is still alive.


956
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,350
Is Zoey alive?


957
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,310
It's just an assumption.


958
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,470
It has died.


959
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,310
It's a fact, isn't it?


960
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,350
No.


961
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:25,750
Think about it.


962
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,030
It's Tang Shun who said Zoey was dead.


963
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,750
But from beginning to end,


964
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,110
only he said that.


965
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,110
And what he said


966
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,030
was always changing.


967
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,110
He told us


968
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,910
that Zoey died two or three days ago.


969
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,070
But he told the media reporters that


970
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,430
it happened four months ago.


971
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,390
What matters more is that


972
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,310
no one has ever


973
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,350
seen Zoey's body.


974
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,550
There's even


975
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,430
no official report about that.


976
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,710
So he might have lied


977
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,390
about Zoey's death.


978
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,590
There are so many monkeys


979
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,430
and each of them


980
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,750
looks similar.


981
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,750
No one will go check it,


982
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,550
right?


983
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,470
According to your words,


984
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,990
in for a penny and in for a pound,


985
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,470
will he just kill Zoey


986
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,190
since he was lying to us.


987
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,310
What are you thinking?


988
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,870
You must be overwhelmed by literary creations.


989
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,270
If Lingling is right,


990
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,230
that means Zoey is still alive.


991
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,870
Then he just believed that


992
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:15,870
we could never find it out


993
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,870
and talked at random.


994
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,790
Anyway, a lie doesn't cost much.


995
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,110
But if he chooses to kill the monkey,


996
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,590
it means a greater chance to give himself away.


997
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,750
I finished.


998
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,230
I have to go to the zoo.


999
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,150
Now?


1000
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,670
You haven't eaten breakfast.


1001
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,830
Yes, eat something.


1002
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,310
You are so thin.


1003
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,470
You two keep eating.


1004
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,990
You said too much.


1005
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,270
I'll eat it if she doesn't.


1006
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,390
Where's Lingling?


1007
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,550
Bai's gone to the zoo.


1008
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,990
Didn't she tell you?


1009
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,710
The zoo?


1010
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,030
She made a hasty call


1011
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,470
this morning


1012
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,870
and said she felt somewhat strange


1013
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,110
about Zoey's death.


1014
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,550
So she went to check it out.


1015
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,070
Then I should tell her later.


1016
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,190
We should not waste time


1017
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,150
on this matter.


1018
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:31,630
But Yang,


1019
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,390
as long as this has not been figured out,


1020
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,390
you have to suffer shame


1021
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,540
because of it.


1022
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:36,950
Lingling


1023
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:37,950
must be more anxious


1024
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,710
than each of us.


1025
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,030
A clean hand wants no washing.


1026
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,270
There's no use to be anxious.


1027
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,190
Lingling?


1028
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,350
How's it?


1029
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,470
But


1030
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:52,910
I believe


1031
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,870
that Zoey is still alive.


1032
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,070
He must still be there.


1033
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,710
Tomorrow I'll go there again.


1034
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,350
I'll go there tomorrow.


1035
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,150
Let's go there in shifts.


1036
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,220
We can find it sooner or later.


1037
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,390
Okay.


1038
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,550
No going anymore.


1039
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,390
Why don't you want us to go?


1040
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,110
Didn't you notice that


1041
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,350
Zhang was silent?


1042
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:21,980
We are scientific researchers,


1043
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,310
instead of criminal investigators.


1044
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,510
Each minute should


1045
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,350
be treasured.


1046
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,430
I don't want you


1047
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,910
to waste your time and energy here.


1048
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,310
I don't think it is a waste.


1049
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,390
As long as you can wash the shame,


1050
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,470
I can even abandon my slumber.


1051
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:35,990
Alright.


1052
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,230
I believe you.


1053
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,350
What about others?


1054
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:41,790
And I don't


1055
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,790
care about these.


1056
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,260
I know you are for my sake.


1057
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,670
And, the academic board


1058
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,950
has plunged into an investigation, right?


1059
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,710
They will work out the truth sooner or later.


1060
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,630
Then when will they?


1061
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,870
As long as they don't find the truth,


1062
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,470
netizens will


1063
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,710
keep abusing you.


1064
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,150
Abuse? Then just let them abuse.


1065
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,310
They can't harm me physically anyway.


1066
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,590
What's more, I'm not the only victim.


1067
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,190
See,


1068
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:01,950
you are abused.


1069
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,830
Li Feifei is also abused.


1070
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,470
Zheng....


1071
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,110
Wait a minute.


1072
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,110
It's okay if they abuse me.


1073
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,110
See what relationship we two have.


1074
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,510
Of course, they can abuse me.


1075
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,030
But why do they abuse Li Feifei?


1076
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,190
Who is Li Feifei?


1077
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,100
What's the relationship between you and her?


1078
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,270
Why is she qualified to be abused?


1079
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,390
You, according to your logic,


1080
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,430
why do they


1081
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,300
abuse Zheng Minghao?


1082
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,630
The photo of Zheng Minghao's


1083
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,750
saving a seat in the study room for you


1084
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,030
has...has been exposed.


1085
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:22,630
Why don't they expose


1086
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,390
the photo of mine?


1087
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,820
I saved a seat for you, too.


1088
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:25,550
You...


1089
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,340
you lost him because of your style.


1090
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:27,710
I...?


1091
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,150
When he saved a seat for me,


1092
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:29,830
he dressed like


1093
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:30,830
a hot-blooded teenager


1094
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:31,830
and brought such a big toy bear.


1095
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,550
Of course others would take photos of him.


1096
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:34,900
Who would notice you?


1097
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,550
So you are saying that


1098
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,990
I'm too low-key?


1099
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,670
I prefer low-key.


1100
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:44,550
It's good to be low-key.


1101
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,350
Is it?


1102
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,310
Really?


1103
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,070
Alright.


1104
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,030
To be honest, whether Zheng Minghao


1105
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,790
or Li Feifei,


1106
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,020
or anyone else,


1107
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,030
are suffering


1108
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,950
such unexpected accidents because of us.


1109
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,150
Should we send a message to them


1110
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,070
to show our regret?


1111
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,630
You're right.


1112
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,070
But I don't want you to


1113
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,310
send a message to Li Feifei.


1114
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,260
I'll feel jealous.


1115
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:12,630
Let me do it for you.


1116
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,110
Then, for the sake of fairness,


1117
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,750
let me send a message to Zheng Minghao.


1118
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,670
Okay. Deal.


1119
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,390
Right.


1120
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,790
You should forget about Zoey.


1121
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:29,990
I have to go there anyway.


1122
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:30,830
Let me tell you....


1123
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:32,710
Okay.


1124
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,990
Then I'll go with you.


1125
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,870
Don't get others involved.


1126
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,230
Okay.


1127
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,910
Auntie actually gave you


1128
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,670
a custom-made Centurion Card


1129
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,430
as a gift for your first meeting.


1130
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,510
Is this rare?


1131
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,390
Just a VIP card anyway.


1132
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:55,790
Free parking


1133
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,590
and a 15 percent discount when shopping.


1134
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,590
Why do they prefer a card


1135
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,190
as a gift?


1136
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:00,990
Do they


1137
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,990
think it saves space the best?


1138
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,270
I can't afford it


1139
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,190
even if she offers me the best discount.


1140
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,110
I have no money


1141
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,710
and no car either.


1142
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:08,830
Parking has nothing


1143
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:09,710
to do with me.


1144
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:10,590
Here.


1145
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:11,550
You two take it.


1146
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,270
I don't need it either.


1147
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,300
I've already had a lot.


1148
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:15,750
Really?


1149
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,590
Do you two have


1150
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,550
any misunderstanding about this card?


1151
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:22,790
This is a custom-made Centurion Card of SP.


1152
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:23,790
There's few in total.


1153
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:24,830
And it is not for sale.


1154
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:26,990
Auntie didn't mean


1155
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,550
some discounts when shopping.


1156
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,270
You can just take what you want at SP.


1157
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,110
For free.


1158
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:34,310
Let me have a look.


1159
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,230
You said you don't need it.


1160
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:35,790
You said it.


1161
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:36,430
I'll go shopping with you.


1162
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:36,910
I'll go shopping with you.


1163
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:37,310
With me?


1164
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,070
What about buying


1165
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:38,750
some clothes for Moustache?


1166
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,950
You are rich!
