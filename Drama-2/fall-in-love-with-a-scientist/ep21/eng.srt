1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]


2
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,140
Ouyang, I'm here first.


3
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,270
I put the ticket at the door.


4
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,750
You can just come in later.


5
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,790
Sorry.


6
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,750
The wind is strong.


7
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,670
Where are we going to play later?


8
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:39,350
Where do you want to go?


9
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,310
It's all good for me.


10
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,710
Let's go to that place.


11
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,310
It looks like a shape of a heart.


12
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,190
OK, let's go.


13
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,790
Now?


14
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,470
Wait a minute.


15
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,470
It's Zhang.


16
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,750
Hello, Zhang.


17
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,390
What's up?


18
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,910
What?


19
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,670
What is it?


20
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,100
He said Zoey is dead.


21
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,110
Someone is calling, it's Doctor Li.


22
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,310
Pick it up.


23
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,060
Hello, Yifan.


24
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,740
Some patients who


25
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,790
participate in clinical trials


26
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,470
are making a fuss about leaving.


27
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,630
You need to contact with the


28
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,150
insurance company.


29
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,830
So that we can determine


30
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,990
what to do in this case.


31
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:33,790
OK.


32
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,990
Did you pick Hang up?


33
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,310
I'm at the hospital now.


34
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:36,990
They should be arriving


35
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,909
at the zoo soon.


36
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,270
Let's see what's going on there first.


37
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,830
OK, keep in touch.


38
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,950
Don't you think


39
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,790
it's a little bit odd?


40
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,590
Why?


41
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,909
First,


42
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,550
we knew back then


43
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,030
how hard it is to


44
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,230
recruit volunteers,


45
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,110
Yang Lanhang's mother


46
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,030
and Li Feifei


47
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,870
ended up making us get on the trend on social media platforms.


48
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,670
Now the fuzz is all over the place


49
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,670
just because of


50
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,150
a dead monkey.


51
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,110
I don't believe if


52
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,110
there isn't anyone who


53
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,270
is behind pushing forward these things.


54
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,950
Second,


55
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,230
most of our volunteers of clinical trials


56
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,950
are elders.


57
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,340
Their children should all be


58
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,430
in their 30s to 40s.


59
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,750
They are certainly not


60
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,030
as sensitive to the Internet as I am.


61
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,430
I just knew about this news.


62
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,950
But they have already


63
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,990
made a fuss there.


64
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,750
That's so unreasonable.


65
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,030
I've always thought


66
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,270
we could save it.


67
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,670
Don't be upset.


68
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,310
I think Zoey's death


69
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,590
still have many doubts.


70
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:41,430
Let's go to the scene first


71
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,350
and see.


72
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,190
Clinical trials are now


73
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,830
nearing the end of their progress.


74
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,270
There are nearly 30 volunteers.


75
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,030
Including your...


76
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,830
If the material really has some


77
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,620
serious problem.


78
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,710
I just couldn't think about it.


79
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,470
You have to trust me.


80
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,710
Trust yourself.


81
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,110
Trust the entire team.


82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,350
Everything is all right.


83
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,310
Right.


84
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,830
Zoey is long past the observation period


85
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,710
after its surgery.


86
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,550
All of our procedures


87
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,390
are followed by


88
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,190
regulations.


89
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,070
No mistakes have been made.


90
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,140
And there have been no problems


91
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:28,830
with the animals


92
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,820
in other tests.


93
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,070
So


94
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,270
Zoey's death


95
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,310
is not necessarily related to us.


96
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,190
Yes.


97
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,310
No worries.


98
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,350
Take it easy.


99
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,110
Tell your leaders to come out.


100
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:43,909
Tell your leaders to come out.


101
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,070
Now things have not been investigated clearly.


102
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,950
Let's calm down a little bit first.


103
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,950
Why calm down?


104
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:48,940
How can I be calm


105
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,870
when people's lives are at stake?


106
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,990
Right. How exactly?


107
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:51,750
Tell him to come out.


108
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,030
Calm down.


109
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,980
I don't know


110
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,670
what you guys put in my mother's heart.


111
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:55,909
I don't think


112
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,830
you can make any decisions.


113
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,070
So tell your dean to come out.


114
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,950
Tell your dean to come out.


115
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,190
What are you yelling about?


116
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,230
Go back.


117
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,790
You.


118
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,590
Open your eyes and see.


119
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,910
Does my life look like it is at stake now?


120
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,990
Why are you here, mother?


121
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,950
When my heart had problems


122
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,910
and I was suffering,


123
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,310
you leave me alone.


124
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,670
The hospital


125
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,750
gave me operations for free.


126
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,630
Take care of me for free.


127
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,630
I'm fine now.


128
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,910
I'm energetic now.


129
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,630
You just came out of nowhere


130
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,190
to ask for an explanation for me.


131
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,990
How grateful


132
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,230
are you!


133
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,550
And you people.


134
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,070
Look at me.


135
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,310
I am the volunteer.


136
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,110
Is my life at stake now?


137
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:43,780
Do your parents even know


138
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,950
you are here?


139
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,670
You guys are so


140
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,150
ungrateful!


141
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,590
Cui Jing.


142
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,870
Professor.


143
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,230
Are you here to do the paperwork?


144
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,510
Did you tell Yinfan


145
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,990
about your study abroad trip?


146
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,780
Not yet.


147
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,270
I still have some work to do.


148
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,870
I want to wrap things up.


149
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,310
And after that, I will tell them.


150
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,310
My plan was to


151
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,950
call our guys to


152
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,350
hold a farewell party


153
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,190
for you this weekend.


154
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:21,990
I never thought


155
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,700
something like this would happen all of a sudden.


156
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,070
What?


157
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,950
Haven't you read the news?


158
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,910
No.


159
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,350
Professor, I'll leave now.


160
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,220
Doctor Li just called,


161
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,710
he said


162
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,470
the hospital is fine for now.


163
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,270
Thanks to Madame Zhang.


164
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,390
It is true that


165
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,310
there have not been any substantial problems.


166
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,350
Let's see.


167
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:56,870
OK.


168
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,150
Here.


169
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:58,780
OK.


170
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,470
Of course the body was burned.


171
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,510
It's been few days.


172
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,550
Otherwise it would be stinky.


173
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,110
There are many monkey in the Monkey Mountain.


174
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,350
They fight.


175
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,270
So things like this do happen.


176
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,390
This is the normal state


177
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,430
of the nature.


178
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,870
I don't know why


179
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,220
it gets so much attention.


180
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,150
It puts the pressure


181
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,270
on us, too.


182
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,230
Did the fight between it and other monkeys


183
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,190
caused...


184
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,430
Maybe.


185
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,550
I don't really know.


186
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,830
Then do you know


187
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,870
which day it...


188
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,750
These two or three days.


189
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,310
You have to go to the Monkey Mountain.


190
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,510
I don't really know, either.


191
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,790
I am only here for a month.


192
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,700
It's our experiment subject.


193
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,710
It died.


194
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,350
Why did no one


195
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,230
notify us?


196
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,910
I said I was new here.


197
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,910
I don't know.


198
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,110
What about the person in charge before?


199
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,710
Then I don't know, either.


200
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,230
Coming!


201
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,550
Come.


202
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,590
Meal is ready.


203
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,550
Come.


204
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,150
Mister.


205
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,870
Mister.


206
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:13,990
Meal is ready.


207
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,750
Mister.


208
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,390
Hello.


209
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,470
I want to ask you


210
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,510
about Zoey.


211
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,390
Eel?


212
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,470
What eel?


213
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,550
Zoey.


214
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,390
That monkey


215
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,630
who was operated.


216
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,350
Do you know ?


217
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,190
Monkey?


218
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,150
What monkey?


219
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,710
A macaque.


220
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,550
Do you know about macaques?


221
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,430
Macaques?


222
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,670
They are all the same.


223
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,150
Who know which one is Zoey?


224
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,630
Excuse me.


225
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,230
They are basically the same.


226
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,270
The zoo don't know a thing


227
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,390
about Zoey's death.


228
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,870
Don't know it's because of the fight


229
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,670
or something else.


230
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,830
No information whatsoever.


231
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,070
Not to mention its body


232
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,910
was cremated.


233
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,710
We can't dissect and investigate, either.


234
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,150
What we know for sure is


235
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,150
Zoey's death time.


236
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,350
Three days ago.


237
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,990
It has surpassed


238
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,190
the observation period of our experiment.


239
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,150
Which means our experiment's


240
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,670
follow-up process


241
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,590
is all good.


242
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,910
So don't worry.


243
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,670
But just to be safe,


244
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,510
we have to


245
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,230
further investigate


246
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,710
other animals in our experiment


247
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,790
to confirm the valve material.


248
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,310
If there are other problems,


249
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,710
we have to increase the samples of the test.


250
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,430
We will also


251
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,550
do a comprehensive checkup


252
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,110
to all clinical patients


253
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,230
and extend their observation period,


254
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,790
increase the number of checkups.


255
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,830
We have to make sure detect the problems and solve them


256
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,870
as early as possible.


257
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,230
Ouyang sent a message.


258
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,230
He has already had contact with


259
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,310
Xiaoyu.


260
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,710
Zoey is not some


261
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,590
animals who go viral on the Internet.


262
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,550
No one actually


263
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,750
pays attention to it.


264
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,710
If it is because of


265
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,190
the sudden death,


266
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,590
with such a massive discussion,


267
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,870
even the public opinion is almost one-sided.


268
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,430
This is not that simple.


269
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,550
Who would be


270
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,670
that unethical?


271
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,950
Don't ever let me find out who that person is.


272
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:07,750
OK.


273
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,510
Let's cheer up.


274
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,790
Let's move.


275
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,310
Zhang,


276
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,470
what's wrong with that cold face?


277
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,550
Wearing like that.


278
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,310
Ouyang.


279
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:39,750
Sorry.


280
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,390
Sorry.


281
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,230
I'm late.


282
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,470
I'll go change first.


283
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,710
OK.


284
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,180
Brother.


285
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,390
Editor Tang.


286
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,950
Looks like you made it.


287
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,550
She's my girlfriend this time.


288
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,990
Who said I'm your girlfriend?


289
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,150
Didn't you say yes?


290
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,590
When?


291
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,670
Too late to say no.


292
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,190
You didn't ask me out


293
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,510
so that I can see you guys flirt.


294
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,550
I'm kinda busy.


295
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,030
Brother,


296
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,390
actually


297
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,350
I need your help.


298
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,510
Look.


299
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,870
Do you recognize


300
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,070
these marketing accounts?


301
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,390
Some of them look familiar to me.


302
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,590
How about sending screenshots to me?


303
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,710
I'll check them out.


304
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,270
Thank you Editor Tang.


305
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,110
Thanks brother.


306
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,070
Sit.


307
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:39,710
Lingling.


308
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,350
Why are you here


309
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,390
in the middle of the night?


310
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,750
How did you pass through the


311
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,070
concierge?


312
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,230
Nothing.


313
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,470
I just miss you.


314
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,870
Is it because of the lab?


315
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,750
Madame Wu is so clever.


316
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,350
Why do you know about


317
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,030
everything?


318
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,550
My phone


319
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,310
sends me notifications every five minutes.


320
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,430
It's hard for me to be unaware of that.


321
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,030
Actually that's all right.


322
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,260
But I'm just so worried.


323
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,870
You know?


324
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,030
What if anything happens?


325
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,430
Then what about Yang Lanhang?


326
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,950
And other


327
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,470
participants.


328
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,870
When will your valve


329
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,110
ever


330
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,350
get changed?


331
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,230
You have to listen to that voice


332
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,790
for so long.


333
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,750
Don't be afraid.


334
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,230
Think about Yang,


335
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,030
Madame Zhang.


336
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,150
Their hearts are all fine.


337
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,390
They are all fine.


338
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,390
I understand


339
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,390
your worries.


340
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,349
It is resonable.


341
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,869
But as they always say,


342
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,670
if you care so much, you will be panicked.


343
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,550
The man in charge is always confused.


344
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:24,790
Don't put pressure


345
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,510
on yourself too much.


346
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,390
Your grandma


347
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,150
is fine.


348
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,230
The earphones that Yang gave me


349
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,510
are also good.


350
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,150
The music quality is terrific.


351
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,190
I often


352
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,350
listen to it.


353
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,190
I can't hear


354
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,430
the outside world with these earphones.


355
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,870
I don't


356
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,310
receive their things randomly.


357
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,550
I know you are


358
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,670
in a relationship.


359
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,910
I took him as a family member, so I took it.


360
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,070
OK.


361
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,590
That's all right.


362
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,230
He should be


363
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,990
filial to you.


364
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,230
I want to listen to it, too.


365
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,910
Don't think too much.


366
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,070
Don't give yourself too much pressure.


367
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,750
I won't


368
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,950
die randomly.


369
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,830
I'm waiting.


370
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,750
Waiting for Lingling


371
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,790
to make the best valve ever.


372
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,510
Right?


373
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,870
If we can't make it today,


374
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,700
we will make it tomorrow.


375
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,030
If tomorrow doesn't work,


376
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,110
we will make it next year.


377
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:03,900
I will


378
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,270
live to my fullest.


379
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:46,830
Hello.


380
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,870
Hello, Hang.


381
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,150
Didn't you say


382
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,230
Zoey passed away three days ago?


383
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,310
Why did the zoo


384
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,150
and Mr. Tang


385
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:52,910
said to the press


386
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,870
Zoey passed away


387
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,630
four months ago?


388
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,670
What?


389
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:57,670
He said,


390
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,790
Zoey is dead


391
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,870
during the observation period.


392
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,070
He said you were worried about


393
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,670
the lack of living samples of animal experiments,


394
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,830
so you give them hush money.


395
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,830
They kept this thing down.


396
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,670
We can't tolerate academic fraud.


397
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,990
They can literally


398
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:10,830
do anything


399
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,630
just to post an article.


400
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,910
I know this man.


401
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,070
He has been setting up his


402
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,910
genius persona.


403
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,380
He is rubbish to me.


404
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,550
I don't know


405
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,030
how his previous articles


406
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,150
were posted?


407
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,350
I heard that Yang Lanhang's


408
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,710
private life is somehow messed up.


409
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,150
A female student in his school


410
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,030
was so bad at academic performance that


411
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,110
she couldn't get her diploma.


412
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,310
After dating with him,


413
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,470
she got the eligibility for master study.


414
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,190
Where does his power come from?


415
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,750
If he can even alter the experiment result,


416
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,270
he can do anything then.


417
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,550
I don't think


418
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,910
that girl is innocent.


419
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,550
A couple of douchebags.


420
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,350
Who is it?


421
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,230
It's me.


422
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,620
Let me ask you.


423
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,070
Did you set up


424
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,510
the zoo thing?


425
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,510
Yes.


426
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,390
Monkey Mountain in the zoo


427
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,190
is not some


428
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,110
important area.


429
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,150
No one pays attention.


430
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,550
Spend some money to


431
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,830
make them talk nonsense.


432
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,030
That's easy.


433
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,990
You also bought the trolls?


434
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,870
Yes.


435
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,590
I will make you a list


436
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,550
about every expense detail


437
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,870
after this thing is over.


438
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,070
I'm not asking you about this.


439
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,710
Did you remember


440
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,870
what I told you?


441
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,110
You said you were busy.


442
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,470
You have no intention to know how.


443
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,190
You just give me the money.


444
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,030
Only if Yang Lanhang


445
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,350
would be back to you.


446
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,230
对 Yes.


447
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,390
But what are you doing now?


448
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,310
I just want you


449
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,390
to grab him back.


450
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,030
Not ruin him.


451
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,590
If I don't ruin him,


452
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,350
you won't be able to help him when he needs you.


453
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,110
What are you talking about?


454
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,310
A man at his lowest


455
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,790
is most vulnerable.


456
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,230
His heart is easiest


457
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,310
to be captured.


458
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,150
Rather than


459
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,710
spending time being angry at me,


460
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,750
you should be more concerned about


461
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,470
how to comfort him.


462
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,780
The Academic Board


463
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,350
has already got involved


464
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,710
in the investigation.


465
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,150
During this period,


466
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,510
we decided


467
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,750
to shut down


468
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,590
the lab temporarily.


469
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,550
The fund of the lab


470
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,950
is all from guru and his cousin.


471
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,430
How could it be shut down this easily?


472
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,990
A joint lab as it is,


473
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,670
universities have the right


474
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,190
to investigate and correct academic related issues.


475
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,470
How could we


476
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,430
continue the test of materials


477
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,230
if the lab is closed?


478
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,350
For now,


479
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,550
we just forget


480
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,910
the testing materials.


481
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,110
Go back


482
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,590
and wait for the result of investigation.


483
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,150
I'm really sorry.


484
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,230
It's all my fault and everybody is taking responsibility for me.


485
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,670
This is not your fault.


486
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,230
It's obvious that someone did this deliberately aiming at you.


487
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:56,990
I just don't understand.


488
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,510
What's wrong with


489
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,270
Tang Shun of the zoo?


490
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,470
I tried to call him,


491
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,910
but he just don't answer the phone.


492
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:03,990
And I also


493
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,430
gave a call to


494
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,350
the Animal Control.


495
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,350
They said that


496
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,110
Tang Shun asked a leave


497
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,150
for family errands.


498
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,950
It seems that it has been designed already.


499
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,790
But we cannot


500
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,710
just do nothing.


501
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,540
Right.


502
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,270
We have to do something.


503
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,070
If we don't do anything,


504
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,230
we won't be able to prove ourselves.


505
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,870
Maybe we can go back to our school


506
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,510
and do our experiment in the old experiment building.


507
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,070
We are students of the school


508
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,670
and have paid for out tuition fee.


509
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,070
There is no reason for


510
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,510
not allowing us to use the public lab.


511
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:34,950
Make sense.


512
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,270
OK.


513
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,510
Let's go.


514
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,470
Wait.


515
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,150
It's not good for me


516
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,990
to go with you now.


517
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,190
Guru.


518
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,430
OK.


519
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,430
Have a good rest.


520
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,510
Thank you.


521
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,070
What did we do?


522
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,310
Look at us.


523
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,910
We just love


524
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:55,990
experiments so much


525
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,350
and cannot live without them.


526
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,950
Don't worry.


527
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,710
Send him back.


528
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,430
Let's go.


529
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,740
I will take you.


530
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,510
Zhang.


531
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,110
Did the cold face


532
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,030
say six words just now?


533
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,230
With a modal particle.


534
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,350
Does...


535
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:20,350
does he...


536
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,870
What does he think of every day?


537
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,070
Let's go.


538
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,150
You drive so steadily today.


539
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,750
Because I have practiced a lot.


540
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,190
No wonder I found


541
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:43,990
some scratch on the left of back


542
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,620
this morning.


543
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,270
It turned out that you are practicing secretly.


544
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,510
Impossible.


545
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,790
I'm exceptionally cautious


546
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,550
every time,


547
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,510
and check the car every time when I'm back.


548
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,550
Absolutely not me.


549
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,070
Are you trying to trick me?


550
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,150
I'm just kidding you


551
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,270
because you look upset.


552
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,470
Don't you worry


553
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,420
at all?


554
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,950
Not at all.


555
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,070
You don't worry


556
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,510
even when people slanders you.


557
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,990
Frankly, I was


558
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,030
quite worried at the beginning.


559
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,550
Because if the death of Zoey


560
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,950
is related to animal experiment,


561
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,110
it means we have made


562
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,670
serious mistakes in the process.


563
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,910
And this will


564
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,790
endanger the volunteers


565
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,150
who trust us and


566
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,350
leave their health and life to us.


567
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,710
But after I reviewed the whole issue


568
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,990
and found our experiment


569
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,790
is correct.


570
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,030
It just seems to be


571
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,110
a designed plot


572
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,670
aiming at me.


573
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,230
As long as the experiment is good,


574
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,630
I don't have anything to worry about.


575
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,510
Have you thought of


576
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,190
your academic reputation?


577
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,150
It could be ruined.


578
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,630
No one can take away the fruit of us.


579
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,270
As for reputation,


580
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,070
it is the least I care about.


581
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,310
Civilization it so vast,


582
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,310
and I'm just


583
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,150
a tiny particle


584
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,950
of it.


585
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,110
If I have to say,


586
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,940
it is not worry.


587
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,230
It's pity.


588
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,670
We have made


589
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,150
so much efforts together


590
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,870
and finally got here.


591
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,270
If we have to stop here,


592
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,190
it is a real pity.


593
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,790
Shenliu News.


594
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,390
It's them again.


595
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,950
I worked as an intern


596
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,150
when I was in college.


597
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,580
They are always like that,


598
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,110
doing bad things


599
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,350
in the name of deeply digged news.


600
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:32,990
Need to tell you.


601
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,750
As long as you have money,


602
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,470
they can turn white into black.


603
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,190
It's not fair


604
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,510
that such unscrupulous media


605
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,910
still operates


606
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,180
and Bai Lingling's lab


607
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,270
stops operation.


608
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,900
The more it cares less about face, the less it will lose.


609
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,710
Huaihai University is a famous university of 100 years.


610
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,550
It cannot be compared with small media.


611
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,230
Exactly.


612
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,350
Since you have interned there.


613
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,670
Let's go


614
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,310
and check the situation there.


615
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,550
OK.


616
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,950
What about the marketing accounts?


617
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,020
Have you checked it up?


618
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,310
What did Editor Tang say?


619
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,070
I am about to tell you.


620
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,110
You can just sit there.


621
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,110
Why do you sit next to me?


622
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,790
I just want to be closer to you.


623
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:19,990
Don't you know?


624
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:20,870
People in love


625
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,030
are all longing for touching.


626
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,150
Do you still want to know


627
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,300
what Editor Tang said?


628
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,510
Say it.


629
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,470
He has told me


630
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,030
the contact


631
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,030
of the marketing accounts.


632
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,350
I have asked the legal specialist


633
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,510
to send a lawyer's letter


634
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,670
and asked them


635
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,270
to delete the improper comments immediately


636
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,670
and apologize publicly.


637
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,710
So quickly.


638
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,350
They really deleted it.


639
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,950
So quickly.


640
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,750
Li Feifei also reposted it.


641
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,430
Look.


642
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,430
I'm here.


643
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,270
You take a shower


644
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,190
and rest first.


645
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,110
I will go to the supermarket and get some food.


646
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,910
We can go together.


647
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,750
You should rest more.


648
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,390
What? You worry about me?


649
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,590
No.


650
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:26,310
I...


651
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,990
Go...just go.


652
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,510
Be careful.


653
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,150
You are just worried about your car,


654
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:37,750
right?


655
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:39,390
Bye.


656
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:39,870
Bye.


657
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,110
Bye.


658
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,590
You are back so quickly.


659
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,230
It's you.


660
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,110
I saw the news


661
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,270
and worry about you,


662
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,430
so I came to see you.


663
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,190
I'm okay. Don't worry.


664
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,270
You can go back.


665
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,710
And it.


666
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,550
It came to see you, too.


667
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,790
Animals are really curing.


668
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,430
I know you are not in a good mood,


669
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,470
so I brought it here.


670
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,670
Oh, that one.


671
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,350
Yes.


672
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,110
It is healthy now.


673
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,990
Woofy, Woofy.


674
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:10,950
Woofy.


675
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,430
You cannot come inside.


676
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,110
You cannot come inside.


677
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,790
You cannot come inside.


678
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,630
I...I...


679
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,870
Just go back.


680
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,630
Woofy...it...


681
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,740
Or...I borrow it from you.


682
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,270
What? Borrow?


683
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:22,830
Borrow it?


684
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,510
I will give it back to you soon.


685
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,310
I...I will take good care of it.


686
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,670
It's okay. I will take good care of it.


687
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,190
Just go back.


688
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,150
Woofy.


689
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,470
Miss Li,


690
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,310
why are you here?


691
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,030
Hang met some problems.


692
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,030
I definitely need to come.


693
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:50,990
And


694
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,430
send Woofy here.


695
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:53,710
Woofy?


696
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,630
What Woofy?


697
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,510
Yes, Yang Woofy.


698
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,270
It is the dog


699
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,430
Hang and I got by the roadside.


700
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,870
I believe Hang will cheer up soon


701
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,590
with the companion of Woofy.


702
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,510
OK.


703
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,070
Do you have anything else?


704
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,390
If not, I will go inside first.


705
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,190
Good Woofy.


706
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,020
You are back.


707
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,950
Why do you buy so much?


708
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:35,990
Let me help you.


709
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,830
Let me help you.


710
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,310
No need.


711
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,390
Just play with Woofy.


712
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,230
Woof, Woofy.


713
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,670
You mean it.


714
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,510
Yes, it also has a family name.


715
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,790
It's called Yang Woofy.


716
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,710
It's your son.


717
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,430
Yang Woofy.


718
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,430
Really?


719
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,110
It should be Li Woofy.


720
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,070
What son?


721
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:03,910
My wife has already been angry.


722
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,430
How can I play with my son?


723
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,110
Don't say things like that.


724
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:08,950
Don't abandon


725
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,310
your dog son for me.


726
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,350
It's okay. I will help you.


727
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,710
Would you like to hold it?


728
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,070
I don't know that


729
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,790
you like animals so much.


730
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,110
I always like animals,


731
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,590
but I don't have a chance to raise one.


732
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,190
And Li Feifei just


733
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:24,710
showed up suddenly


734
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,150
and brought it here.


735
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,270
I thought


736
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,990
you may also like animals,


737
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,830
so


738
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,390
I borrowed it from her.


739
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,390
Borrow?


740
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:34,580
Yes.


741
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,750
Didn't she say it was


742
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,470
saved by you two together?


743
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,070
Yes.


744
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,190
Partly.


745
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,790
We just met it at that time.


746
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,630
It was injured.


747
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,950
And Ouyang showed up later.


748
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:48,990
So I asked Ouyang


749
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,390
to take them to the animal hospital.


750
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,590
It was injured.


751
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,790
Poor thing.


752
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,110
Come.


753
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,190
Be careful.


754
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,110
It has good temper.


755
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,150
You are nice.


756
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,110
You two play together.


757
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:01,870
I will handle this.


758
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:02,270
OK.


759
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,910
I will leave it to you.


760
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:03,990
Pork rib soup?


761
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,420
Yes.


762
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,190
Woofy.


763
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,780
Li Woofy.


764
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:17,469
Hello.


765
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:18,750
I would like to see


766
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,070
Editor Wang Shu.


767
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,590
Do you have an appointment?


768
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,699
No.


769
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,030
But he knows me.


770
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,510
I was an intern for him.


771
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,550
My name is Guan Xiaoyu.


772
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:27,909
OK. Wait.


773
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,389
Hello, Editor Wang.


774
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,150
Miss Guan Xiaoyu


775
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,670
is here to see you


776
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,389
for some important things.


777
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,190
OK. Understand.


778
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,139
I will tell them.


779
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,870
I'm sorry, Miss Guan.


780
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,469
Editor Wang is in a meeting now.


781
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,670
He is not available to see you.


782
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,989
Please leave.


783
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,830
Not willing to see me?


784
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,230
Then I will stay here


785
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,430
and see when he will come out.


786
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,670
I just don't believe it.


787
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,830
It has just been one year. How could he be so arrogant?


788
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,670
He has forgotten that


789
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,710
I used to charge his car every day.


790
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,230
Charge his car?


791
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:04,910
Of course.


792
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,390
He bought a new car


793
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,110
and told me


794
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,430
to charge his car every day.


795
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,310
Charge my car for me.


796
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,180
There


797
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,350
were two interns then.


798
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,030
One was responsible for his take-aways.


799
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,670
The other


800
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,590
was in charge of topping up for his phone.


801
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,910
We never asked him to pay us back.


802
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,270
Then you must know his car.


803
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,670
Certainly.


804
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,070
I can recognize it even if it has turned into ashes.


805
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,270
Just say it earlier.


806
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:25,350
Come.


807
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,230
Woofy, look.


808
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,270
It's food.


809
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:27,750
Shake hands.


810
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,870
Food, food.


811
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,830
Coming.


812
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:38,870
Where's Hang?


813
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:40,990
Coming.


814
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:43,910
Come.


815
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,190
Woofy.


816
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,030
Thank you.


817
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,420
I will pay for your renting Woofy.


818
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,630
How could I accept your money？


819
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,790
What's more, we found Woofy together.


820
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,590
If you like,


821
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,190
I can often take it here and you can play with it.


822
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,670
It's not proper.


823
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,950
Woofy is still little.


824
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,350
If the environment always changes,


825
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,510
it will lack sense of security.


826
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,150
If we want to have a pet,


827
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,830
we can save one.


828
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,990
OK. Bye, Woofy.


829
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,710
It's Li Woofy.


830
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,710
Don't get it wrong.


831
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,670
Bye, Woofy.


832
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:10,900
Let's have the soup.


833
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:11,670
Bye.


834
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,990
Now Woofy is leaving as well.


835
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,670
Bai Lingling, let's have a talk.


836
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:33,710
I will


837
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,510
wait for you at the nearby cafe.


838
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,910
Li Feifei.


839
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,030
Who?


840
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,110
Who did it?


841
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,710
Who?


842
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,110
Who?


843
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,870
See. Did I say it wrong?


844
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,750
We go back，


845
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,470
have dinner,


846
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,470
have some milk tea


847
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,910
and watch TV


848
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,950
and wait comfortably for him to come to us.


849
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,270
And you just insist on waiting there,


850
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,270
right?


851
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,510
What...what are you doing?


852
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,190
Answer the phone.


853
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,230
Hello.


854
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,830
You hit my car.


855
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,790
Wang Shu has knocked off work.


856
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,630
Move.


857
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:41,790
Let me be straight.


858
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,110
How did you


859
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,790
tell me then?


860
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,950
You said you have a boyfriend


861
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,990
and would never


862
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,990
like Yang Lanhang.


863
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,990
What's happening now?


864
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,630
You are hypocritical.


865
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,430
You just...


866
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,230
I know what you want to say.


867
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,030
Actually, you are right.


868
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,030
Of course I'm right.


869
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,950
I believed you,


870
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,110
paint your eyebrows,


871
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,550
and gave you an eyebrow pencil as a gift.


872
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,870
I was too naive.


873
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,750
Miss Li.


874
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,990
I really appreciate you.


875
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,150
The eyebrow you paint for me


876
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,470
was really nice.


877
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,260
However,


878
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,940
there is some misunderstanding here.


879
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,110
Let me explain.


880
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,630
The situation is different now.


881
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:26,910
I didn't know that


882
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,150
he was my boyfriend.


883
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:28,990
Enough.


884
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,790
I don't want to listen to


885
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,590
your illogical explanation.


886
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,190
I'll be straight to you.


887
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,590
I invited you out today


888
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,630
to ask you to leave him.


889
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,390
Why don't you talk?


890
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,510
Shouldn't you


891
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,910
offer a deal at this situation?


892
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,230
You are with him for money as expected.


893
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,550
Partly.


894
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,470
Actually,


895
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,590
I was so bored


896
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,710
in the lab.


897
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:58,830
It is rare for me


898
00:39:58,910 --> 00:39:59,870
to be in such a scene.


899
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,870
I'm quite excited.


900
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:01,910
We can follow


901
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,070
the normal rule.


902
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,390
You don't have to


903
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,910
jibber-jabber here.


904
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,670
I think you are clearer


905
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,990
with the situation than I am.


906
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,310
If it


907
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,670
keeps this way,


908
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,030
Yang Lanhang's


909
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,110
profession


910
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,710
will be at a danger stage.


911
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,350
He needs people like me


912
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,790
to be with him.


913
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,270
I have tens of millions of fans,


914
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,310
so I'm important


915
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,990
to the trend of public opinion.


916
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,270
I can easily


917
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,390
change the public opinion


918
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,510
with a simple repost.


919
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,910
You?


920
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,350
What can you do for him?


921
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,950
You are right.


922
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,030
I cannot


923
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,110
do anything for him.


924
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,390
He doesn't


925
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,390
need me to, either.


926
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,620
In case


927
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,670
he really


928
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,390
meets any problem one day,


929
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,990
his parents are still there.


930
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,790
There is no need for us


931
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:49,790
to worry about him here.


932
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,630
What's more, as you said,


933
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,110
you have so many fans on Weibo


934
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,190
and you are pretty,


935
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,180
and paint good eyebrows.


936
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,110
What's the meaning for you


937
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:56,860
to sit here


938
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,110
and talk to me for him?


939
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,590
Let's finish here.


940
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,550
I'm done.


941
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,550
Yang Lanhang


942
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,950
has just finished the surgery


943
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,350
and needs to rest early.


944
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,030
I


945
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,470
need to be back and sleep with him.


946
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,470
Bye.


947
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,100
Why are you here?


948
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:35,990
You said


949
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,070
you were out for the trash.


950
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,590
And you didn't take it with you


951
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,830
and it's been a while.


952
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,190
So, I came to check.


953
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,270
I was busy


954
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,950
quarreling with the actress.


955
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,870
How's it?


956
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,710
Did you win?


957
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,550
Quarreling with me,


958
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,670
I must win.


959
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,350
I win


960
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,430
every time.


961
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,110
My girlfriend is bravo.


962
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,630
Didn't you want to know


963
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:55,990
how we quarreled?


964
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:57,950
You can say it if you want.


965
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,100
It's okay if you don't want to.


966
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,590
I definitely want to say it.


967
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,110
What's the smell?


968
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,070
Yes.


969
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,110
You hit my car?


970
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,110
Yes.


971
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:41,750
What?


972
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,180
Then why your car is good?


973
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,670
How can I hit it with my car?


974
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,110
It's too costly, bro.


975
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,870
What? You did it deliberately?


976
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,580
You are so busy.


977
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,830
If I don't do this,


978
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,870
how can I get to see you?


979
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:54,590
Right?


980
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,710
What do you want?


981
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,350
Relax, bro.


982
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,030
Let's have a talk.


983
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:04,820
Bai Lingling,


984
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,830
when can you get back?


985
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,070
Xiaoxiao,


986
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,470
I will not


987
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,990
go back tonight.


988
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,270
What's wrong with him?


989
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,510
I'm concerned about


990
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,070
Yang Lanhang.


991
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,070
His corridor


992
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,990
was being painted by someone deliberately,


993
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:22,550
saying some horrible words.


994
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:23,870
So serious!


995
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,830
Then, his address must be exposed.


996
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,270
Are they insane?


997
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,990
They can do some other things


998
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,470
if they have the time.


999
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,950
Ouyang Yifan should be back.


1000
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:37,870
I will open the door.


1001
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:39,430
Go for it.


1002
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,030
It seems to be the delivery.


1003
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,350
There is still delivery at night?


1004
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:53,270
Seems to be yours.


1005
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:54,750
Delivery.


1006
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:56,110
What time is it now?


1007
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,150
It is still delivered.


1008
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,630
What's in it?


1009
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,670
I will open it for you.


1010
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,270
What's this?
