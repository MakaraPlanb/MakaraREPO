00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:45,750
Guru said

3
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,950
don't get involved with others.

4
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:47,870
But I am not

5
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,509
one of "the others".

6
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,190
Is there anyone

7
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,310
in the whole lab

8
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,830
who is more important to him than me?

9
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,750
I have to go.

10
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:56,710
His cousin.

11
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,110
I am about to leave the country.

12
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,430
Before I go,

13
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,750
if I don't see

14
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,870
the result of this thing.

15
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,390
I won't be satisfied.

16
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,510
I have to go, too.

17
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,870
Since everyone wants to go.

18
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:32,990
If we have any accidents,

19
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,110
somebody has to be responsible.

20
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,350
Then let's go together.

21
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:40,910
Yang Lanhang.

22
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,510
Lingling.

23
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,270
Lingling.

24
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,430
It's been a long time.

25
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,230
We still didn't get any news of Zoey.

26
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,950
Did they kill the monkey

27
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,829
just like what Xiaoxiao said?

28
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,510
Do you have any other photos

29
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,550
of Zoey?

30
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:02,790
Yes.

31
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,790
I take photos with it

32
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,830
every time I see it.

33
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:05,670
See,

34
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,470
I specially got a photo album for it.

35
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:26,750
As expected.

36
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,430
What is it?

37
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,310
Look at the date of the photo.

38
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,670
Have you found anything?

39
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,430
It hardly comes out

40
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,230
during the day.

41
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,470
It doesn't eat, either.

42
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,390
In the night,

43
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,070
it becomes more active instead.

44
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,670
Right.

45
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,470
I made fun of it earlier, I said:

46
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,430
"It is a primate

47
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,470
but has a lifestyle

48
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,310
like a

49
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,750
cat.

50
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,950
I don't really see it

51
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,990
during the daytime."

52
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,310
What should I do?

53
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,070
The zoo will close

54
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,230
at 6 P.M..

55
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,750
What is it?

56
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,990
There is no such

57
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,590
date like that.

58
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,550
So sleepy, let's go back.

59
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,070
Don't doze off.

60
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,350
Aren't we creating

61
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,070
opportunities for them?

62
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,910
We are watching someone.

63
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,230
Who?

64
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,310
The man in the zoo.

65
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,100
Tang...

66
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,590
Now there are

67
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,270
two breakthroughs in the event.

68
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,070
One is the monkey,

69
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,830
and the other is him.

70
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,590
What?

71
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,710
Do you want to

72
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,150
beat him into submission?

73
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,350
No.

74
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,310
I am asking him to voluntarily turn himself in.

75
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,590
OK.

76
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,070
Try using your hand to

77
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,750
press the Baihui point.

78
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,390
It will be very comfortable.

79
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,310
You will not be sleepy right away.

80
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,020
Baihui point

81
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,790
lies in the center line of your head.

82
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,630
It lies at the intersection of the lines between the two ears.

83
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,710
Here.

84
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,950
Two hands.

85
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,390
I love you too.

86
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,430
Idiot.

87
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,630
You are so boring.

88
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,990
Then you are not sleepy then.

89
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,190
I am not sleepy now...

90
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,030
Here he comes.

91
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,030
What do you want?

92
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,590
I want to see it, too.

93
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,510
Get out of the car.

94
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:52,590
Hurry.

95
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,110
Stop following me.

96
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,230
Well,

97
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:08,910
you are so annoying.

98
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,030
How annoying?

99
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,470
You

100
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,390
are so weird.

101
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,150
I just posted it

102
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,230
on Weibo.

103
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,630
Do you have to ignore me for two days?

104
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,820
Do you want a breakup?

105
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,110
What are you posting?

106
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,470
That's a lie and slandering.

107
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,430
That's a criminal crime.

108
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,670
If you get caught,

109
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,670
you have to be in jail.

110
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,630
Who are you lying to?

111
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,350
Do you think I am a three-year-old?

112
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,110
Go to jail?

113
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,030
Let's break up.

114
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,590
Don't have to send prison meals then.

115
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,790
It's just a monkey.

116
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,630
Hello.

117
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,630
How about stepping outside?

118
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,990
We have business here.

119
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:35,950
Help me judge.

120
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,460
I just posted a weibo.

121
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,110
I said a monkey died.

122
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,430
This person.

123
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,470
I'm with him for five years.

124
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,590
He now wants a breakup.

125
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,590
I'm so upset.

126
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,310
He thinks that the monkey is more important than me.

127
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,190
Honey,

128
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,390
what monkey?

129
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,830
I'm telling you.

130
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,110
You don't know

131
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,030
how natural my acting skill is.

132
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,790
I can really be an actress.

133
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,870
My tears

134
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,150
just keep falling.

135
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,430
Tang Shun was

136
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,430
so fooled by us.

137
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,710
He really thought

138
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,510
we were a couple who wanted a breakup.

139
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,350
Hang.

140
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,830
I am putting too much effort on you.

141
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,070
Breakup is so unlucky.

142
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,270
I did it for your sake.

143
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,070
I am really putting too much effort on you.

144
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,190
Really touched.

145
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:26,620
Here.

146
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,510
It's the soup

147
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,750
my dad brought.

148
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,310
Each of you

149
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,590
have a bowl of this.

150
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,430
-Drink it while it's hot.
-Thank you.

151
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,429
So you fooled him.

152
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,110
So?

153
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,789
So,

154
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,230
we told him

155
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,950
how serious

156
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,990
the defamation charge is.

157
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,070
And told him

158
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,390
this charge

159
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,590
was pressed by the victim.

160
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,110
If the victim gives up,

161
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,260
then it's fine.

162
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,510
So we think

163
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,710
he will beg for forgiveness.

164
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,100
Beg for our leniency.

165
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,270
I bet he is

166
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:54,990
spineless

167
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,230
since he broke the law

168
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,910
for some benefit.

169
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,390
You have a point.

170
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,830
Wait.

171
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:04,950
OK.

172
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:05,550
Just drink.

173
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,230
You.

174
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,430
Why are you putting this thing?

175
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,310
Hello.

176
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,630
Finally you pick up the phone.

177
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,630
It's not the first time you've broken up.

178
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,630
You are a grown-up now.

179
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,470
Why disappear again?

180
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,220
Don't be so dramatic.

181
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,630
I turn off the phone when I'm working.

182
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,590
Don't message

183
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,350
or call me all the time.

184
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,550
I have to work.

185
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,460
Do you know about

186
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,390
Bai Lingling?

187
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,270
Yesterday, Yang Lanhang

188
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,110
called me

189
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,200
using Lingling's phone.

190
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,230
He thought he had gotten me involved.

191
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,310
He felt sorry.

192
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,110
What's your plan?

193
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,830
I've thought it through,

194
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,470
I have worked

195
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,190
to the fullest

196
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,350
every time

197
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,710
I need to.

198
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,070
I don't regret it at all.

199
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,630
Since Lingling

200
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,830
has made up her mind.

201
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,310
I'm done with them.

202
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,070
OK.

203
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,030
I am relieved that you think so.

204
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,310
Well,

205
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,190
just go cold turkey

206
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,190
with those idiots' attack

207
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,310
of our Gate of Heart.

208
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,550
What do you mean?

209
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:29,790
Well,

210
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,390
the affair of Yang Lanhang and Bai Lingling

211
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,750
is like snowballing.

212
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,390
Someone checked

213
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,310
you have chased after Bai Lingling.

214
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,470
Then today they found

215
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,710
our Gate of Heart.

216
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,070
Now the criticism spills everywhere in the comment area.

217
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,670
They are aiming at me now.

218
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,750
Why go cold turkey?

219
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,030
Just bring him down.

220
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,390
Why are you so mysterious?

221
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,030
You had cameras

222
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,110
on Monkey Mountain.

223
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,910
And it's night-visioned.

224
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,990
Even at night,

225
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,340
we can see things clearly.

226
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:12,630
When did you

227
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,830
do that?

228
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,390
I know nothing about it.

229
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,950
Today morning.

230
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,150
When the first wave of tourists

231
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,030
were entering,

232
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:19,950
I got in.

233
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,830
I observed.

234
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,550
It's a feeding area.

235
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,750
At night,

236
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,310
if animals are out for food,

237
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,270
that's the place.

238
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,870
Yes. I know that place.

239
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,630
It's here.

240
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,070
We are so worried that

241
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,230
we might not get into the zoo at night.

242
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:35,670
Minghao.

243
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,950
You helped us a lot.

244
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,350
Our top minds

245
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,310
are incredible.

246
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,550
Just like cheating in the game.

247
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,110
We are going to solve this case soon.

248
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,540
Baby.

249
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,670
It is important for people to have self-awareness.

250
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,350
See,

251
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,110
the top mind is sitting over there.

252
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,190
We are just

253
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,870
two actors.

254
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,790
Am I not a top mind?

255
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,230
You are.

256
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,470
Something's wrong.

257
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,390
Nobody cares that

258
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,670
you installed the camera?

259
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,670
Not sure.

260
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,910
That's OK if you get caught.

261
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,710
Anyway, as long as it does not involve privacy

262
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,510
or endanger public safety,

263
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,110
that's not a

264
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,390
violation of the law.

265
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,470
But

266
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,670
forced dismantling

267
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,750
will be criticized.

268
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:24,950
Let's see if

269
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,390
we could find Zoey or not these days.

270
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,230
Let me ask you something,

271
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,590
can you log in to this software

272
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,830
on different devices at the same time?

273
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,950
If you ask other people,

274
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,950
that's a no.

275
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,790
But if you ask me,

276
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,150
that's a yes.

277
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,270
Then thank you.

278
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:45,830
You are welcome.

279
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,910
I will send messages

280
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,910
in our chat group.

281
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:49,950
Great.

282
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,070
We don't have to

283
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,670
take turns going to the zoo then.

284
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,470
Minghao,

285
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,590
although you know it's kind of pretentious.

286
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,590
But I will formally

287
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,430
say

288
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,470
thank you.

289
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,310
Too soon.

290
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,470
Say it after we find Zoey.

291
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,590
Mr. Zhang, Qingyi.

292
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,430
Lanhang,

293
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,790
I should leave now.

294
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,750
Drive safe.

295
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,430
Bye.

296
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,230
Do some record.

297
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,390
Ten times, 18.0.

298
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,110
Will you feel unhappy

299
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,980
about Zheng Minghao

300
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,030
helped us?

301
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,150
A little.

302
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,670
Anyway,

303
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,510
he is trying to help us.

304
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,900
Don't you know that

305
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,070
a man is the most handsome

306
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,270
when he is doing what he does best?

307
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,590
I don't hope that

308
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,750
you see him that handsome.

309
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,230
Can't imagine.

310
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,550
My senior also has a sense of crisis

311
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,230
even if he is so incredible.

312
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,230
When someone is falling in love,

313
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,870
he will feel inferior.

314
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,030
Now?

315
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,390
Do you feel inferior now?

316
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,870
Now it's better.

317
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,310
Are they

318
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,820
Ouyang and Jing?

319
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,310
Seems to be.

320
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:40,990
Jing is about to

321
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,110
go abroad.

322
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,870
What does

323
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,230
Ouyang intend to do?

324
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,670
Does he like Jing or not?

325
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:47,710
You ask me?

326
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,110
I don't know either.

327
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,790
When will he

328
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,110
start to bust a move?

329
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,470
He...

330
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,190
He has

331
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,710
already busted a move.

332
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,870
Right?

333
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,790
Why are you here?

334
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,470
Sorry.

335
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,030
Don't worry about

336
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,630
that movie.

337
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,430
Also, you have

338
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,830
apologized.

339
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,310
Don't take it personally.

340
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,390
OK.

341
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,110
You are here for...

342
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,070
I'm going to the bookstore next door

343
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,670
to get some reference books.

344
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:05,910
Are you here also for the books?

345
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,710
Yes.

346
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,910
Let's go then.

347
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:31,870
Zhang,

348
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,110
about the CCTV in the zoo at night,

349
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,780
should we

350
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,830
plan a schedule?

351
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,630
Who will watch it?

352
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,870
Maybe later.

353
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,190
It seems that

354
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,500
it's kind of competitive in the first two days' slot.

355
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,180
It's detailed for hours.

356
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,590
Probably

357
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,150
we won't have our turn.

358
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,750
Do your thing.

359
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,310
Rest assured.

360
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,310
Mother.

361
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,270
Are you still watching?

362
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,870
Stop.

363
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,500
It's late at night.

364
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,270
Time to sleep.

365
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,150
Let's go to sleep.

366
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,590
You little brat.

367
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:12,990
Are you responsible

368
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,030
for 8 to 10 p.m.?

369
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,270
It's 10:30 now.

370
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,380
Someone else is watching.

371
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,390
Someone else?

372
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,790
Are they careful enough?

373
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,710
What if they miss a clip?

374
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,630
They are very responsible.

375
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,950
Don't worry. Just go to sleep.

376
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,150
Also,

377
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,300
an entrepreneur like you

378
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,110
are like

379
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,030
a pupil.

380
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,070
If they know,

381
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,950
who will spend money at your place?

382
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,230
You know nothing.

383
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,910
It's called doing things by ourselves.

384
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,310
Do you know why our shopping market

385
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,110
can succeed?

386
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,910
It's because of this spirit.

387
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,030
I know.

388
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,510
You are still watching, uncle?

389
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,390
Haven't you go to sleep?

390
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,030
That's OK.

391
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,430
I am a night owl.

392
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,470
It's only 12:00 now.

393
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,310
OK.

394
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,630
But take care of yourself.

395
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,630
Sleep early.

396
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,590
I'm going to sleep now.

397
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:05,990
OK.

398
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,830
Good night.

399
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,270
Good night.

400
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,830
What?

401
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,910
Be quiet.

402
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,710
Uncle is outside.

403
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,300
I'm telling you,

404
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,390
uncle

405
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:47,910
took up my place.

406
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,790
I can't sleep with Bai Lingling.

407
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,590
Right?

408
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,110
I've thought it through.

409
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,990
I decided to make it up for one night with you.

410
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,190
What are you thinking about?

411
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,870
Trying to be innocent?

412
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:57,860
Get up.

413
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,070
Don't play victim with me.

414
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:00,790
Get off.

415
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,590
Stinky feet.

416
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,190
Stinky feet.

417
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,190
Don't pull my pants down.

418
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,470
My underwear is out.

419
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,630
Will you get off or not?

420
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,630
Uncle, uncle.

421
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,390
You are a piece of work.

422
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,990
Ouyang Yifan,

423
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,030
aren't you getting off the bed?

424
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,110
Get off.

425
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,870
Will you get off or not?

426
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,470
Get off.

427
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,430
What would you do?

428
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,420
Out!

429
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,510
Off!

430
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,310
I deliberately gave way to you.

431
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,350
Do really really think

432
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,230
I can't fight with you?

433
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,670
Ouyang Yifan.

434
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,140
Ouyang Yifan.

435
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,830
That hurts.

436
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,150
I now inform you.

437
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,470
I, Ouyang Yifan,

438
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,510
am sleeping here tonight.

439
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:06,670
I.

440
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,070
Stop.

441
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,390
Are you bullying me?

442
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,070
Are you bullying me?

443
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,110
Did you tickle me?

444
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,910
No.

445
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,430
Sorry.

446
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:14,630
Sorry.

447
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:26,750
What do you want?

448
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,590
I want to be in your bed.

449
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,790
What is it?

450
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,790
So abrupt.

451
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,550
You can sleep with me.

452
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,470
But I have to

453
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,710
write papers overnight.

454
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,860
And I have to watch the camera.

455
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,510
Are you afraid of noises?

456
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,510
I might wake you up.

457
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,470
What if

458
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,910
I stay up all night, too?

459
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,230
Lingling.

460
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,750
You can tell your uncle

461
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,350
to get him back.

462
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,350
I'll stay here.

463
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,710
It's a pity that he sleeps on the couch.

464
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:02,830
Don't mention it.

465
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,230
I told him the entire afternoon.

466
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,790
He didn't listen.

467
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,110
He said

468
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,750
it's okay if we can't go to the zoo,

469
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,670
but we must see

470
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,350
the camera carefully. It's so easy.

471
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,270
He insisted.

472
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,580
And Yang Lanhang.

473
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,310
He almost got into a fight

474
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,910
because of the camera.

475
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,190
Whatever.

476
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,270
OK.

477
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,710
What's wrong?

478
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,070
It's about 1 a.m.,

479
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,470
it's Zoey's

480
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,790
favorite sports time.

481
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,470
I will be out to watch the camera.

482
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,630
Luckily, granny doesn't know.

483
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,390
If she ever knows, she will fight with me.

484
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,390
Don't mention it. I'm telling you,

485
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,270
she and some other old ladies

486
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,150
are playing Mahjong in the nursing home.

487
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,470
They are having so much fun.

488
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,790
Really?

489
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,230
Lingling.

490
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,030
Lingling.

491
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,030
Come and see.

492
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,030
Is it Zoey?

493
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,190
Go! Go!

494
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,510
Lingling, is it that?

495
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,470
Yes.

496
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,270
It really is that monkey.

497
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,150
I told you!

498
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,510
I know it is still alive!

499
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,350
Right?

500
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,870
Thank you, dad.

501
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,310
Zoey was found,

502
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,670
and I was also criticized

503
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,830
for installing the camera.

504
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,590
This thing should

505
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,830
have been in the past.

506
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,110
Yeah.

507
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,030
The lab's been notified

508
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,630
to be unsealed.

509
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,350
And then we can

510
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,350
continue our clinical trials.

511
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,790
You know what? Zheng Minghao,

512
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,590
I really owe it to you this time.

513
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,510
I haven't thought of it if you didn't mention it.

514
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,990
But now that you say it,

515
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,030
I thought you'd like to

516
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,390
treat me to a meal

517
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,110
because I did you such a big favor.

518
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:00,990
I can't believe you

519
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,150
invited me over to paint

520
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,950
his house.

521
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,270
Are you afraid

522
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,510
I haven't been hurt enough?

523
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,030
He is busy cooking for us

524
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,350
in the kitchen now.

525
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,670
Listen to me.

526
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,430
You can torture him as much as you like

527
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,710
and let him serve you after the meal.

528
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,230
I think you

529
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,550
pulled that stunt because

530
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,470
you were afraid he'd be jealous.

531
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,190
He wouldn't have a chance

532
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:23,990
to blame me if I

533
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,870
came and worked for him.

534
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,110
Yang lanhang isn't so narrow-minded,

535
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,870
he said you are handsome the other day.

536
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,670
He?

537
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,230
Said I was handsome?

538
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,510
He told me that

539
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,470
the most handsome moment

540
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,790
of a man is when in

541
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,910
his area of expertise.

542
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,310
He also said you made him feel threatened.

543
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,630
Did he say that?

544
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,390
Why would I lie to you?

545
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,190
You can go in there

546
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,350
and ask him yourself.

547
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,950
I mean...

548
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,950
How to say?

549
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,590
He is also handsome.

550
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,150
To tell you the truth.

551
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,990
I'm relieved to see

552
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,070
you two get together.

553
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,310
You said it as if

554
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,390
you were my father.

555
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:04,910
Trust me.

556
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,110
I think my own dad would also think you

557
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,150
are my dad after hearing your words.

558
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,270
It looks like you and your dad

559
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,150
are on good terms now.

560
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,310
Pretty good.

561
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,590
It was Yang Lanhang who let me know

562
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,710
something from the past.

563
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,870
So,

564
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,750
I'm not so entangled anymore.

565
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,430
I remember that I checked your profile

566
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,510
furtively when I first met you.

567
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,870
You wrote in the former name column,

568
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,190
"Shi Nuoling".

569
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,270
Then, I went to

570
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,630
see your family

571
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,790
background stealthily.

572
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,670
That's when I thought

573
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,950
I wanted to protect this girl

574
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,990
from being hurt.

575
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:42,590
But now it seems that

576
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,030
what you need is not protection,

577
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,590
but reconciliation.

578
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,950
No wonder I lost to him.

579
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,830
What lost!

580
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,630
Listen to me.

581
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,150
Zheng Minghao,

582
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,390
you'll definitely meet

583
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,470
a really nice girl someday

584
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,150
whom you love very much.

585
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,190
And when that happens,

586
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,230
you'll be glad you didn't

587
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,750
take advantage of me now.

588
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,390
Alright. Let's not talk about it.

589
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:04,870
I think we're

590
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,910
almost done.

591
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,870
Let's eat first.

592
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,670
After the meal,

593
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,230
I'll ask Yang Lanhang to do it by himself.

594
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,030
Go.

595
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,510
Bai Lingling.

596
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,230
Even though I said I wouldn't give up,

597
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,180
I'm telling you

598
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,070
on the record,

599
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,110
I don't like you anymore.

600
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,430
Congratulations!

601
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,900
May you find a girl

602
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,710
who is prettier than me soon.

603
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,510
Are we still friends?

604
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,910
You bet. Come in and eat.

605
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,790
We finally came back.

606
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,270
Zhang,

607
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,070
why don't we get a brazier and jump on it?

608
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,510
Open fires are prohibited in the laboratory.

609
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:47,950
Go.

610
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,700
Lanhang,

611
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,310
the school leaders have asked me

612
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,510
to express our condolences

613
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,870
to you on behalf of the school.

614
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,110
We feel sorry

615
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,630
to have wronged you.

616
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,030
That's okay.

617
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,620
All the things had been figured out.

618
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,790
It's more important that

619
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,390
our experiments can go on.

620
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,710
Right.

621
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,390
There were so many people

622
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,070
abusing us.

623
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,150
What about now?

624
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,270
They must be embarrassed!

625
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,430
I wanna see

626
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,030
what else they will say.

627
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,950
What happened?

628
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,740
Why do so many people

629
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:25,710
still curse guru?

630
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,550
Their words are

631
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,830
even worse than before.

632
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,830
"He is worthy of being the master of a large corporate group,

633
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,860
he can even revive

634
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,990
a death monkey."

635
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,270
"Controlling life and death,

636
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,790
even the law cannot bring him to justice!"

637
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,710
What nonsense!

638
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,630
What's wrong with this guy!

639
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,750
What?

640
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,830
Why are you so angry?

641
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,110
Let me see.

642
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,190
I think that

643
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,550
they are

644
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,470
oversimplifying

645
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,870
the matter.

646
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,590
It's true that Zoey's still alive,

647
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,350
we have achieved

648
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,710
a phased victory.

649
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,070
Our clinical trials can continue,

650
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:15,910
and the lab can also

651
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,270
operate normally.

652
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,470
But

653
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,110
this won't be over until

654
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,710
we find out who's

655
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,110
behind this.

656
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:24,750
By the way,

657
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,550
what about that Tang Shun?

658
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,950
Yeah.

659
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,150
I almost forgot if you didn't tell me.

660
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,870
Didn't you say he'd be here

661
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:32,750
one of these days begging for

662
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,350
our forgiveness on his knees?

663
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,910
It seemed that what you said

664
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,070
wasn't so reliable.

665
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,310
Or maybe

666
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,310
our acting skills were so awful

667
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,390
that had been seen through by them?

668
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,710
Whatever.

669
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,870
We've given him a chance.

670
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:49,990
The lawyer's letter will be sent to his house

671
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,510
in half an hour.

672
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,470
I have told you so many times that

673
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,790
I have already given up.

674
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,470
I got a ton of guys chasing me,

675
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,590
so I don't need to hang

676
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,950
on to Yang Lanhang.

677
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,510
You know what? Just stop it.

678
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,670
Stop doing those

679
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,710
nasty things.

680
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,830
I did nothing.

681
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,390
I have nothing

682
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,830
to do with

683
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,990
the whole thing now.

684
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,150
It's completely pushed by netizens spontaneously.

685
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,270
OK.

686
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,070
Then let me ask you.

687
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,750
What can I do

688
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,750
to make this go away?

689
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,230
How much money do you want?

690
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,150
Give me a price.

691
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,230
Miss Li,

692
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:29,670
don't be silly.

693
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,950
Money can't

694
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,900
solve anything at

695
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:33,910
this stage.

696
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,830
Well, I want everyone to know that

697
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,950
you directed all of this.

698
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,150
I didn't do this on my own,

699
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,190
but both of us.

700
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,070
What do you want?

701
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:54,990
I wanna milk tea.

702
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,030
Milk tea?

703
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,550
Aren't you afraid of gaining weight?

704
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,350
Do you think I'm fat?

705
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:58,790
No.

706
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,600
I think you...

707
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,470
...you are slim.

708
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,190
I wanna three cups.

709
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,030
Please wait a minute.

710
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,870
It's you!

711
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:04,990
Mr. Yang.

712
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,950
Miss Bai.

713
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,030
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

714
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,390
I really didn't expect that

715
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,630
this issue would cause an uproar.

716
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,110
I got confused temporarily

717
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,350
and was blinded by money.

718
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,390
I had been expelled

719
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,790
by the zoo.

720
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,590
Look,

721
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,230
please don't sue me.

722
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,110
I don't know anything

723
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,870
about what happened.

724
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,670
Someone else put me up to it.

725
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,550
You, you should sue her.

726
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:25,950
Sue her?

727
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,310
Who?

728
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,670
That actress.

729
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,670
Li Feifei.

730
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,190
Monkey Mountain in the zoo

731
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,110
is not an

732
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,110
important area.

733
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,500
No one pays attention.

734
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,390
Spend some money to

735
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,110
make them talk nonsense.

736
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,470
That's easy.

737
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,910
You also bought the trolls?

738
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,750
Yes.

739
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,710
I will make you a list

740
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,950
about every expense details

741
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,390
after this thing is over.

742
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,590
I'm not asking you about this.

743
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,790
Do you remember

744
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,550
what I told you?

745
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,430
You said you were busy.

746
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,430
You have no intention to know how.

747
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,110
You just give me the money.

748
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,550
Only if Yang Lanhang

749
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,110
would be back to you.

750
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,510
You don't need to hear the rest.

751
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,350
That's almost all about it.

752
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,230
I can send you the full version.

753
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,830
What are the conditions?

754
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,150
No.

755
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,030
You are not the only one who is great in this world.

756
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,590
Wait.

757
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,230
Have you ever thought about

758
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,870
what would happen to you

759
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,830
if this record is circulated?

760
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,590
Of course.

761
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,910
Do you really think that

762
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,150
I'm innocent

763
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,870
and easy to be tricked?

764
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,470
When I decided to give

765
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,230
this recording to you,

766
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,310
I've already put my entire reputation

767
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,790
and career on the line.

768
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,550
But don't worry.

769
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,630
I do this

770
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,990
neither for Yang Lanhang

771
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,190
nor for myself

772
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,590
to set a character setting.

773
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,150
I don't think any of that matters to me

774
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,630
compared to defending the dignity

775
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,750
and justice of science research.

776
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,430
I'll go.

777
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,860
Did your new film

778
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,590
be selected for the

779
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,670
international film festival?

780
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,430
I wonder if the audience can vote?

781
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,990
His face is opposite

782
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,790
to his heart.

783
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,670
Look at Wang Tao,

784
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,910
this thing has tested out his true nature.

785
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,550
It seemed that Li Feifei was also involved.

786
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,430
Really?

787
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:26,990
Yeah.

788
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,910
Oh, that's so refreshing.

789
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,670
You bet.

790
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,230
They deserve it.

791
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:29,990
Yes.

792
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,830
Did Li Feifei get involved in this thing?

793
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,670
Is that true?

794
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,590
I heard it's true.

795
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,430
Stop talking.

796
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,390
I didn't know he was such a person.

797
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,430
He's gone too far.

798
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:44,750
Yeah.

799
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:45,550
Look at me.

800
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,110
Are you Wang Tao?

801
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,190
How could he say it like that?

802
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,190
Now everything is okay.

803
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,420
The truth finally came out

804
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,670
and the bad guys have been caught.

805
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:05,990
It's really gratifying!

806
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,710
In fact, Wang Tao is also pretty miserable.

807
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,870
He was fired before he even

808
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,990
got hired because of a video.

809
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,950
Later he found a couple of jobs,

810
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,070
but none of them worked out.

811
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,910
And then he got into

812
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,020
that game company because

813
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,070
he was free of salary.

814
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,350
Till now, he can't afford the rent

815
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,790
and is also in debt.

816
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,630
Yeah.

817
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,430
If he had lived a better life,

818
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,350
he would not have

819
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,150
done such

820
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,830
unconscionable things.

821
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,940
When did you come here?

822
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,790
Who do you think bought the milk tea?

823
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:43,550
No wonder.

824
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,020
I saw Ouyang pick off the sign

825
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,470
"Forbidden Area for Zheng Minghao"

826
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,430
early this morning.

827
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:50,830
After all, we've

828
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,870
fought together,

829
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,550
right?

830
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,830
You just said that

831
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,470
Wang Tao was fired

832
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,630
because of a video.

833
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,230
Who shot it?

834
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,150
I don't know.

835
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,750
Is that you, Lingling?

836
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,030
That's impossible!

837
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,909
I was so frightened at that time.

838
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,909
I didn't dare to

839
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,510
take any videos.

840
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,190
Who was it then?

841
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,310
I did it.

842
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,429
Isn't it right to blow the whistle

843
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,270
on such bad behavior?

844
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,429
Right. You're right.

845
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,510
You are the best.

846
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,429
Alright.

847
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,670
We're done with the gossip.

848
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,070
After drinking milk tea,

849
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,230
let's go back to work.

850
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,670
OK.

851
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,310
I'll leave then.

852
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,310
Bye.

853
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,350
I won't see you out then.

854
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,429
Bye. Thank you for the milk tea.

855
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,350
Bye.

856
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,830
They...

857
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,060
I know what you want to say.

858
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,430
You wanna know what he is thinking.

859
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,470
I have a method.

860
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,670
Isn't it the bracelet of the locker room?

861
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,310
Yeah.

862
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,630
But it's a little different.

863
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:02,790
I have implanted

864
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,510
a joint program in it.

865
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,470
As long as his heart rate is

866
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,030
a little abnormal

867
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,390
and exceeds standard level,

868
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,350
his bracelet will have a

869
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,630
synchronous vibration with mine.

870
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,150
So what we should think is,

871
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,230
how to get Ouyang

872
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,510
to wear this bracelet.

873
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,350
This is familiar.

874
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,030
I see you're worried about them,

875
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,190
so I made it just now.

876
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,230
Look at me.

877
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,550
No.

878
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,300
I'll go to work.

879
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,790
What a surprise.

880
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,030
You not only sent the video

881
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,150
but also made the bracelet.

882
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,390
Why did you do so many things

883
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,030
to chase me?

884
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,350
I always work hard

885
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,070
at everything I do.

886
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,750
OK.

887
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,310
Let's go.

888
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,510
Morning.

889
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,590
I'm waiting for you.

890
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,550
Thank you...senior.

891
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,750
Jing, are you okay?

892
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:36,750
Sorry.

893
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,630
I'm okay.

894
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:38,990
Be careful.

895
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,870
Are you alright?

896
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:17,750
How about now?

897
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,830
Do you want to wear it?

898
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,990
My hands have been numb from the shaking

899
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,270
for the past two days.

900
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,150
I didn't expect that.

901
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,750
I thought

902
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,310
the twin brothers were totally different.

903
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,710
Actually they are the same!

904
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,460
It's just one in light and

905
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,300
the other in the dark.

906
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,430
Yeah.

907
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,310
Come on.

908
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:38,870
I won't.

909
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,180
How can I feel

910
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,710
other men's heartbeat?

911
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,790
You wear it.

912
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,950
You've got the point.

913
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:47,990
Then would you like to

914
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,750
feel my heartbeat?

915
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:51,630
Let me listen to it.

916
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,030
It was Ouyang who

917
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,830
told you the things about me.

918
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:02,910
Yes.

919
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,870
At that time, I only gave him

920
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,430
your name "Bai Lingling",

921
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,270
then he paid attention to it for half a month.

922
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,230
He said,

923
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,350
In the first semester of your senior year,

924
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,470
you were actually ready to take the

925
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,190
postgraduate entrance exam.

926
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,190
But then you gave up.

927
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,270
No wonder you have already known I was going to

928
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,670
take the postgraduate exam.

929
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,590
So it was him who

930
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,030
gave you the photo?

931
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,230
Yes.

932
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,190
Being reliable,

933
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,310
not asking questions

934
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,630
and can keep secrets.

935
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,630
There were no other

936
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,030
choices but him.

937
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:32,750
But looking at his character,

938
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,910
he is too hesitant.

939
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,790
His heart was beating so fast,

940
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,270
and the bracelet was also shaking.

941
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:38,630
But he acted on his face

942
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,030
like nothing

943
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,190
had happened.

944
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,350
Why do you feel like

945
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,190
a sister-in-law when you're

946
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,710
not even married yet?

947
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,510
To help our brother

948
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,670
find a wife.

949
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,270
What are you saying!

950
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,270
I don't!

951
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,910
I haven't agreed to marry you.

952
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,110
Won't you marry me?

953
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,990
We'll talk about it later.

954
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:03,950
Didn't we make a deal that

955
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,510
we'll be together just like a dog with a turtle.

956
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,950
I don't want to be a turtle

957
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,220
or a dog.

958
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,750
Then what do you want?

959
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:28,750
What time is it?

960
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,430
It's almost ten thirty.

961
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:31,710
He is currently engaged

962
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,430
in a new project,

963
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,430
so he must be working overtime at this hour.

964
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,230
I wonder if

965
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,590
he can still focus on his project

966
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,710
when he's shocked like this?

967
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,470
I see.

968
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,110
In such a beautiful place,

969
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,310
I decided to

970
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,590
just let it go.

971
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,990
I have an idea.
