00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,110
Aren't you busy there?

3
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,190
My work is never done,

4
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,750
but you are more important than my work.

5
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,110
Don't you want to see me?

6
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,870
It's just a little sudden.

7
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,430
Not at all.

8
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,750
Iâ€˜ve thought about it over and over again.

9
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,990
Maybe I'm a little greedy after all.

10
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,870
Of course I hope

11
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,830
you can put aside all external factors

12
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,870
like education background and appearance

13
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,190
and only love my soul.

14
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,510
But I also hope that

15
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,790
you can accept all of me

16
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,670
besides my soul.

17
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,940
I hope you still like me

18
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,270
after you see me.

19
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,710
So when are you going back?

20
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,270
Provisionally, next week.

21
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,270
I'll let you know the exact date

22
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,430
in advance.

23
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,230
Next week is okay.

24
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,150
I still have some time to buffer myself.

25
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,150
Me too.

26
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,230
To be honest, I'm really nervous.

27
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,350
Yeah.

28
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,590
I'm nervous, too.

29
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,470
See you next week.

30
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,390
OK.

31
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,790
Interesting.

32
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,430
Now I think

33
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,830
your little boyfriend

34
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,910
is more adorable.

35
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,589
You bet.

36
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,470
Do you know that?

37
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,550
Most of the boys

38
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,150
in love put a lot of

39
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,070
emphasis on how much they pay out.

40
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,110
After doing some trivial things,

41
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,230
they are going to boast about themselves like,

42
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,990
'Look how nice I am to you!';

43
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,630
'How much I've done for you!';

44
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,430
''How much I love you!'

45
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,350
or 'How great I am!'

46
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,390
and so on,

47
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,390
which makes girls

48
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,230
feel guilty.

49
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,030
But look!

50
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,510
He didn't!

51
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,670
He insisted on explaining it to you

52
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,190
that it was all because of himself,

53
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,950
so you don't need to

54
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,150
feel guilty at all.

55
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,310
He's very protective

56
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,110
of your emotions.

57
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,950
And also,

58
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,070
he always shows you

59
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,270
a positive attitude

60
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,630
in your relationship.

61
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:57,270
That's what it means

62
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,630
to love someone.

63
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,910
He's always like this.

64
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,070
I've gotten used to it,

65
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,230
so I didn't pay much attention.

66
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,710
Well, if you put it that way,

67
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,550
I think there's something wrong with him.

68
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,630
The man could be a liar

69
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,670
if he talks

70
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,070
so skillfully.

71
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,470
Are you still suspicious of him?

72
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,270
I believe him.

73
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,630
I believe that he

74
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,350
can't be Ouyang Yifan.

75
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,230
But after all, it's online dating.

76
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,740
Listen to me carefully.

77
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,950
It's online dating anyway.

78
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,870
We can't be too cautious or prudent.

79
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,150
I see.

80
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,710
I don't care if he wants to

81
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,110
cheat my feelings,

82
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,550
as long as he doesn't cheat me out of my money.

83
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,270
You are quite broad-minded.

84
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,630
I'm serious.

85
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,510
Think about it.

86
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,750
It's commonplace that we modern people

87
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,870
fall in love and break up.

88
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,630
Well, you will be sad when you break up.

89
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,470
That's to say,

90
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,270
every time you're in a relationship,

91
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,710
there will be a risk of breaking up.

92
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,830
And it's a high risk.

93
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,630
You're gonna feel sad

94
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,790
no matter you fall in love,

95
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,870
break up or get cheated.

96
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,230
It's just kind of normal.

97
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,990
We shouldn't be bothered by

98
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,870
this kind of normal.

99
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,790
Right?

100
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,350
Breaks up with me and makes me sad,

101
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,190
never mind.

102
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,550
Cheat my money, no way.

103
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,230
Why?

104
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,790
I will not only be sad

105
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,030
but also be poor if he cheats on my money.

106
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,510
You are pretty rational.

107
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,230
But

108
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,990
money can't solve all the problems.

109
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,110
You should take me with you

110
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,030
next time you

111
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,230
meet him.

112
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,390
I should be your gatekeeper.

113
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,190
I don't need it!

114
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,990
I'm not a fool.

115
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,990
None of the girls are smart

116
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,870
when they are in love.

117
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,870
They all become fools.

118
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,070
Trust me.

119
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,630
OK. We'll talk about it later.

120
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,110
I haven't asked you,

121
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,950
what happened to you?

122
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,710
Didn't you go out early?

123
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,190
When did you come back?

124
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,150
And sleep in your clothes!

125
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,070
Where did you go?

126
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,630
Don't mention it.

127
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,900
What?

128
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,260
They are twins.

129
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,909
When did you...?

130
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,390
Are, are you pregnant?

131
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,950
What are you thinking!

132
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,110
I mean, twin brothers!

133
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,830
It's only....

134
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,790
You look quite....

135
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,270
And you've already know their gender?

136
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,270
Bai Lingling,

137
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,110
I mean Ouyang Yifan.

138
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,230
He has a twin brother!

139
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,390
Don't tell me that you

140
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,070
have seen my elder brother!

141
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,430
What are you talking about?

142
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,670
Don't you know that?

143
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,140
Didn't your mother tell you

144
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,190
that I have a twin brother

145
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,870
when you went that blind date?

146
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:21,870
I do have a brother.

147
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,390
Are you kidding me?

148
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,470
Think back to it.

149
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,070
Did he always answer you with

150
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,670
'Yes' or 'Huh'

151
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,590
no matter what you said?

152
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,310
I didn't expect that

153
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,630
he could not only help me get rid of

154
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,670
bad relationships

155
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,830
but also find my true love.

156
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,910
I love him so much!

157
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,830
You go away!

158
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,910
I don't want to see you anymore.

159
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,990
Go, go, go!

160
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,110
You are

161
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,230
such a ruthless woman!

162
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,750
I've saved you a couple of times.

163
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,950
Don't you feel grateful

164
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,830
to me?

165
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,510
You are ruthless!

166
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,710
Go away, quickly.

167
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,500
I don't want to see your face.

168
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,390
I hate you!

169
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,190
Why should I leave?

170
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:22,950
I rented this room.

171
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,950
I will sleep here.

172
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:25,470
You...!

173
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,070
Just like what I said,

174
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,460
you'll meet a ghost sooner or later

175
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,669
if you always walk too much at night.

176
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,870
Are they really twin brothers?

177
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,429
I've never seen

178
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,390
twin brothers in reality.

179
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,790
Do they look the same?

180
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,830
I found that they are not so similar

181
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,430
when I see their photos.

182
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,390
But I had never

183
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,510
thought of it.

184
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,070
Well, forget it.

185
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,230
Never mind.

186
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:55,910
He didn't do anything to you,

187
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,510
right?

188
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,030
But I'm still angry.

189
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,950
I feel angry when I think of this.

190
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,630
Look,

191
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,390
Panpan hasn't answered my phone call yet.

192
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,750
He must have been mad at me!

193
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,110
Hello, Professor.

194
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,350
Congratulations, Bai Lingling.

195
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,870
Your score on the preliminary exam is very high,

196
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,070
and your graduation thesis is also of high quality.

197
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,070
Thank you, professor.

198
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,940
Well,

199
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,670
I still keep your

200
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,550
undergraduate diploma.

201
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,830
Don't you want to take it back?

202
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,230
Of course I do!

203
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,550
I,

204
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,910
I really want it!

205
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,590
Look,

206
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,390
Professor, I...

207
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,190
took the exam

208
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,230
and meanwhile, rewrote my thesis.

209
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,230
I lived like I was dying.

210
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,020
How could I not want it back?

211
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,230
Don't say it like that.

212
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,670
You had a narrow escape from death.

213
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,590
Alright. Professor,

214
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,750
I think you didn't call me here

215
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,750
just to praise me.

216
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,150
Here is the thing.

217
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,430
As things should be,

218
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,550
it's three months away of the first day of school.

219
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,910
I ask you here today

220
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,390
because I want you to

221
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,950
choose your research project ahead of time.

222
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,230
You can start your research earlier

223
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,550
if you learn about it earlier.

224
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,790
Look.

225
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,670
Hi, Professor!

226
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,310
Hello.

227
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,070
This is the material

228
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,030
I want you to work on.

229
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,870
Metamaterials?

230
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,550
Yes.

231
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,510
Metamaterials

232
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,790
are composite materials

233
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,470
with artificially designed structures

234
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,750
that exhibit extraordinary

235
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,870
physical properties

236
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,110
not found in

237
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,110
natural materials.

238
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,110
A feasibility study was done

239
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,190
according to the research direction.

240
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,790
These plans were

241
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,750
initially formulated.

242
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,990
You can take it away

243
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,310
and read it carefully.

244
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,590
Search for some relevant information.

245
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:33,710
Okay.

246
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,630
No problem.

247
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,150
Are you free tomorrow?

248
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,710
Tomorrow? What for?

249
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,470
Please tell me.

250
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,590
Here's what happens.

251
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,750
Now we

252
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,470
have a physical experiment

253
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,390
on oxidation resistance.

254
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,430
Originally, Yu Shuang was in charge.

255
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,190
He is one of my

256
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,310
graduate students now.

257
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,390
But our school

258
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,750
has assigned him

259
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,310
to go to Shanghai with me

260
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,910
to attend a seminar tomorrow.

261
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,550
But

262
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,630
this experiment

263
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,750
can't be delayed anymore.

264
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,110
So....

265
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,550
Professor,

266
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,110
that's okay. I will handle it.

267
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,750
Don't be in such a rush to say yes.

268
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,430
This experiment is not difficult.

269
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,710
But

270
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,670
you need to go through

271
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,790
100 hours of standing by

272
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,110
the device continuously

273
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,310
in case something goes wrong.

274
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,390
Professor,

275
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,150
do you know that

276
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,430
I slept less than ten hours a week

277
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,590
when I prepared for the postgraduate entrance exam.

278
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,190
This....

279
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,190
Just tell me

280
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,150
how to do it.

281
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:30,630
Sure.

282
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,220
He'll be back

283
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,070
the day after tomorrow at the latest.

284
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,350
All you have to do is

285
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,790
keep an eye on it for the first 30 hours.

286
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:39,590
No problem.

287
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,430
Alright. Deal?

288
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,990
That's it.

289
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:42,510
Deal.

290
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,150
We count on you.

291
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:43,950
Goodbye, Professor.

292
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,390
OK.

293
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,230
Are you really going to

294
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,950
that old lab?

295
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,990
Do you still remember

296
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,310
the story of the old lab

297
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,150
that we knew when we first entered our university?

298
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,750
Aren't you scared?

299
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,550
Why should I be scared?

300
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,950
We scientific researchers

301
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,950
are staunch materialists

302
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,830
who are not afraid of these rumors.

303
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,270
Where are you going?

304
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,430
I have to go to a planning meeting first.

305
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,390
And then

306
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,070
I should go to school and find Geng Panpan.

307
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,030
I need to invite him to dinner to apologize.

308
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,590
Who knows if Ouyang Yifan

309
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,380
had bullied him!

310
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,510
He's been acting with me

311
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,510
for more than half a year.

312
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,990
We are friends of life and death.

313
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,870
I would never

314
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,790
burn my Bridges.

315
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,070
Please come in.

316
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,910
You are here.

317
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,590
Hello.

318
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,310
Hello. Sit down and wait for a while.

319
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:42,870
OK.

320
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,230
Hi.

321
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,070
Excuse me,

322
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,790
I wanna ask,

323
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,630
could you please

324
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,870
call Geng Panpan in 302 for me?

325
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,150
OK. Wait a second.

326
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:14,990
Sure. Thank you.

327
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,510
Thank you....

328
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,830
I'm the roommate of Geng Panpan.

329
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,590
Are you Guan Xiaoyu?

330
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:28,630
Yes.

331
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,790
Where is he?

332
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,750
I called him,

333
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,550
but he didn't answer.

334
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,630
He, he is in hospital.

335
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,230
Hospital?

336
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,750
Hello, Panpan.

337
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,870
I'm outside your dormitory right now.

338
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,830
Your roommate told me that you are in hospital.

339
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:54,870
What happened?

340
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,230
Which hospital? I'll go visit you.

341
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,470
That's OK.

342
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,710
I, I'm fine.

343
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,470
Are you mad at me?

344
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:01,750
I'm sorry.

345
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,870
I drank too much yesterday.

346
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,550
I didn't know

347
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,430
I was drinking spirits.

348
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,070
What the hell happened to you?

349
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,270
I'm not mad.

350
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,630
I didn't tell you because I don't want you to worry about me.

351
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,740
I'm fine, really.

352
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,310
Just mild concussion.

353
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,630
The doctor said I'd be

354
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,350
discharged in a few days.

355
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,830
Concussion?

356
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,070
That's too awful!

357
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,430
What happened to you?

358
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,310
Why did you have concussion?

359
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,630
Was it Ouyang Yifan?

360
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,510
I'll seek revenge on him.

361
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,150
No, no.

362
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,310
No.

363
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,110
I went to the bar

364
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,950
to look for you that night

365
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,630
when I saw that

366
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,030
Ouyang Yifan was going away with you.

367
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,670
I ran out in a hurry,

368
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,390
but was knocked down

369
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,430
by a reversing car

370
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,150
in an unguarded moment.

371
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,670
I fell on the ground

372
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,100
and got hit on my head.

373
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,230
Are you an idiot?

374
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,870
Why were you so careless?

375
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,470
I was afraid something would happen to you.

376
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,470
So I didn't think that much.

377
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,030
What would happen to me!

378
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,670
He dare not do anything evil to me.

379
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,670
Tell me.

380
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,790
Which hospital are you in?

381
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,950
You really don't need to come.

382
00:14:59,310 --> 00:14:59,990
I'm a little tired.

383
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,030
Then I'll hang up.

384
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,430
Listen,

385
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,310
I'm magnanimous.

386
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,070
You may rest assured.

387
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,390
I told you that we are friends,

388
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,470
then we'll be friends forever.

389
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,470
Come on,

390
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,590
I'll drink it for worship.

391
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,710
You can't drink any more, right?

392
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,190
I'll help you.

393
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,910
All right. You've drunk too much.

394
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:33,580
I'll send you home.

395
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,420
No!

396
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,670
Bartender!

397
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,190
One more glass!

398
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:39,590
Quickly!

399
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,350
Go, go. Let's go home.

400
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,070
One more glass.

401
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,590
Another bar, okay?

402
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:42,950
Go.

403
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,390
Why are you so heavy!

404
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,550
Me?

405
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,350
Where are you taking her?

406
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,510
She's drunk. I'll send her home.

407
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,710
Let me send her home.

408
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,110
Imp,

409
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,380
I know

410
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,430
what you are thinking.

411
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,150
Get out of the way.

412
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,270
I'm her boyfriend.

413
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,550
I'll send her home.

414
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,910
You're addicted to acting!

415
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:04,950
OK.

416
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,310
Just ask her

417
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,390
whether she'd like to go with you.

418
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,510
Xiaoxiao,

419
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,710
I'm Panpan.

420
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,990
Let me send you home.

421
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,110
You're finally here.

422
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,670
You know what?

423
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,470
You

424
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,630
are my best,

425
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,670
best friend.

426
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,630
Best friend.

427
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,430
You.

428
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:30,830
Let's go.

429
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,350
See?

430
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,110
Drink more.

431
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,349
Are you tired?

432
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,869
No. I already have some preparation.

433
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,950
Well.

434
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,670
You scared me!

435
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,870
You scared me!

436
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,550
Why are you laughing

437
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,710
at 3:30 a.m.?

438
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,830
What are you doing?

439
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,470
I am spending time with my girlfriend

440
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,390
on her experiment.

441
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,590
Aren't you cooking?

442
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,910
I'm cooking.

443
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:05,910
But my girlfriend

444
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,030
is in the lab right now.

445
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,350
This is the first time

446
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,310
she's performed an experiment alone.

447
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,430
I'm a little worried about her,

448
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,300
so I want to accompany her remotely.

449
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,750
You can go to the lab

450
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,910
if you worry about her.

451
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,270
You are her

452
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,590
senior fellow apprentice.

453
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,790
That's reasonable for you to see her.

454
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:22,830
I can't.

455
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,470
Then you can chat with her.

456
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,510
I can't.

457
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,790
You can't do this,

458
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,710
and that.

459
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,070
Just cooking?

460
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,870
Hang,

461
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,670
I think you should confess.

462
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,070
It'll be good if you can go on with your relationship.

463
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,190
If you can't,

464
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,310
just turn to another one.

465
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,630
You stay up so late every day.

466
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,270
I'm worried about your health.

467
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,550
I see.

468
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,150
As a man who likes her,

469
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,430
I worry about her and

470
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,710
I'm afraid that she'd be too tired.

471
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,790
And I even want to

472
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,790
help her complete the experiments.

473
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,310
But as a qualified researcher,

474
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,150
I know that

475
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:55,910
she must go through

476
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,150
this process by herself.

477
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,190
Every one of us should

478
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,190
go through the process by ourselves.

479
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,510
Some of these experiments

480
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,260
take 30 hours,

481
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:01,910
and some 50 hours,

482
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,350
or even 100 hours.

483
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,470
When I was in Europe,

484
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,150
I saw one of my friends spend

485
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,030
10,000 hours on anti oxidation.

486
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,310
The sadness

487
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,390
and loneliness

488
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,030
can only be digested by herself.

489
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,310
All we can do is

490
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,590
wait for her at the finish line.

491
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,830
If she can't even

492
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,030
get through these 30 hours,

493
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,270
it would be hard for her

494
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,310
to really understand this occupation.

495
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,670
It was also her first lesson

496
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,870
from Professor Jiang.

497
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,550
What if

498
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,270
she can't understand your thoughts?

499
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,310
Couldn't you

500
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,270
give her some hints

501
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,510
privately?

502
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,750
No.

503
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,870
What I should do

504
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,590
is to wait for her at the finish line

505
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,910
and prepare some small surprises

506
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,070
for her.

507
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,950
I suspect you are not 26

508
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,870
You are 62 instead.

509
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,390
Nonsense.

510
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,710
Well, I won't go to sleep.

511
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,230
You can sleep in my bed.

512
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,390
OK.

513
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,510
Come on.

514
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,630
Don't come over!

515
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,670
Don't come over!

516
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,430
I could tell her that it's professor

517
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,110
asked me to bring her some food.

518
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,350
Bai Lingling.

519
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:24,910
Bai Lingling.

520
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:25,710
Stay there.

521
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,230
Stay there.

522
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:28,830
Stay there.

523
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,030
Slow down. Slow down.

524
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,310
Go back. Go back.

525
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,350
Hold the railing.

526
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,030
Keep down. Keep down.

527
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,470
Alright. Wait for me.

528
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,910
You can tell me if you stay here overnight.

529
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,030
I didn't know you were inside

530
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,510
when I locked the gate.

531
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,510
I'm sorry.

532
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,870
I would be more careful later.

533
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:51,630
Thank you, sir.

534
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,430
It's okay.

535
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,670
Are you okay?

536
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,830
I didn't jump yet.

537
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,590
Then why did you climb over the railing?

538
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,550
I thought you were going to

539
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,270
jump down.

540
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,390
If I was committing suicide,

541
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,350
why would I choose the second floor?

542
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,030
So why did you stay there?

543
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,950
I was performing an experiment.

544
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,270
It would take me 30 hours.

545
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,150
And I haven't finished it yet.

546
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,070
30 hours?

547
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,110
No chat anymore.

548
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,630
I need to

549
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,580
buy some rat poison.

550
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,830
Rat poison?

551
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,670
Aren't you in Shenzhen?

552
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,990
Why are you back?

553
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,830
A venture capital firm

554
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,510
is interested in our products.

555
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,350
So we made an appointment this noon.

556
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,510
I'm afraid I would be late to take the early flight.

557
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,950
So I took a high-speed train last night.

558
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,590
See, is this a chance

559
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,510
god offers me?

560
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,630
He asked me here to rescue a beauty.

561
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,670
Forget it.

562
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,390
What about accepting me?

563
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,390
No. No. No.

564
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,030
You...if you are

565
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,630
still here tonight,

566
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,710
I might invite you for dinner.

567
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,830
If you invite me for dinner,

568
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,630
I can stay here.

569
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,550
I can leave tomorrow.

570
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,350
Men should focus on their business.

571
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,950
Okay?

572
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,030
Focus on your business.

573
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,550
Just a meal.

574
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,990
Rat poison and mouse-trap.

575
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,860
Almost there.

576
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,670
Yang Lanhang.

577
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,150
I'm done.

578
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,150
I'm done. I'm done.

579
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,230
Yang,

580
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,590
why are you here?

581
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,980
You haven't had breakfast yet?

582
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,510
I didn't eat, either.

583
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,630
It looks quite delicious.

584
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,230
Can I have one?

585
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,310
Yang, what about going back?

586
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,590
I can handle these.

587
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,030
Yang, I was wrong.

588
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,070
I know I should not

589
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,390
leave the lab.

590
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,470
But...I have just been absent

591
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,550
for a little while.

592
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,070
I...I was going to buy

593
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:35,790
some rat poison.

594
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,230
There is a rat in the lab.

595
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,310
It's no more than one hour.

596
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,790
Yang, I was wrong.

597
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,310
I'm sure

598
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,790
I won't make it again.

599
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,990
Only for your absence

600
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,230
during the experimentation?

601
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,870
And I should not play the trick

602
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,550
to install a camera here.

603
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,910
Yang,

604
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,350
I know I was wrong.

605
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,550
You won't tell Professor Jiang, will you?

606
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,630
It's so hard for me to join you.

607
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,270
I'm afraid that the professor would kick me out

608
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,710
if he knows that.

609
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,150
So, ever since your stepping in,

610
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,830
you haven't asked me

611
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,190
if the experiment is okay.

612
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,870
You are here anyway.

613
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:39,950
What problem could there be?

614
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,790
So,

615
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,580
compared with

616
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,590
your master's degree,

617
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,470
your satisfying report cards

618
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,190
and your promising future,

619
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:45,990
this experiment

620
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,950
matters nothing, right?

621
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,950
I...I put a camera....

622
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,550
Bai Lingling,

623
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,140
why on earth do you

624
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,150
pursue a master's degree?

625
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,500
To become better, of course.

626
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,430
And then?

627
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,990
To have a satisfying resume

628
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,750
and gain higher income?

629
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,750
Right?

630
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,990
So is there anything wrong with it?

631
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:10,950
No.

632
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,710
There's nothing wrong.

633
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,190
What's wrong with him?

634
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,150
Why is he mad at me

635
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,830
in the early morning?

636
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,390
And he wasted food.

637
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,230
I'm down.

638
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,430
I sneaked away in the experimentation

639
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,230
and was actually caught by Yang Lanhang.

640
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,950
We have agreed to turn the page.

641
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:09,710
But I don't know how

642
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,790
I have offended him again.

643
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,140
I just don't know why.

644
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,390
It's not his experiment anyway.

645
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,990
Why was he so angry?

646
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,550
It seems that

647
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,790
I can't make friends with him anyhow.

648
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,110
Do you think

649
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:19,830
he'll tell this

650
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,790
to the professor?

651
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,150
I'm back, Lingling.

652
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,150
Good job.

653
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,390
Is there anything wrong with it?

654
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,030
No. Everything goes well.

655
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,310
Here. This is the record.

656
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,510
That's great.

657
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,910
This means a lot to me.

658
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,110
It's late.

659
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,460
Hurry home and have a good rest.

660
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:20,950
Okay.

661
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,230
Yu,

662
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,110
emm...

663
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,990
Has the professor told you something?

664
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,070
No.

665
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,350
Then,

666
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:34,790
I just want to know

667
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,470
if

668
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,430
there's been someone like me

669
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,550
that has passed the reexamine

670
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:39,910
but was still refused

671
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,990
before?

672
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,910
Usually,

673
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,990
no.

674
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,950
But it was by no means zero.

675
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,590
Hold on.

676
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,070
Why are you here?

677
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,590
Didn't you say that you'd like to invite me for dinner?

678
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,630
You forgot?

679
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,310
I kept the bill anyway.

680
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,870
Remember to pay me.

681
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,270
I see.

682
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,350
Alright, you've sent them here.

683
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,350
Why don't you leave?

684
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,390
It's enough that you refused me.

685
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,270
You needn't be so ruthless, need you?

686
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,790
Just kidding. Eat together.

687
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,430
Why is a boy here?

688
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,430
Come on. Ask him out.

689
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,540
I haven't made up yet.

690
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,630
It's me.

691
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,870
Zheng Minghao.

692
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,310
It's you.

693
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,030
Why not tell me earlier?

694
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,550
What will we eat?

695
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,950
Could you two please

696
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,190
show me some respect?

697
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,230
Sauerkraut fish?

698
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,590
You bought it?

699
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,070
Great. I like Sauerkraut fish best.

700
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,230
Nice. Nice.

701
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,030
You two, don't eat.

702
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,790
I'll go brush my teeth.

703
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,790
Don't eat. Wait for me.

704
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:39,710
Okay. Okay.

705
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,350
Thank you.

706
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,630
What happened yesterday?

707
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,430
Nothing special.

708
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,190
Yesterday, after the experiment,

709
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:53,750
I wanted to go out.

710
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,030
But the gate was locked.

711
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,070
I was so nervous that

712
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,460
I was about to jump from the second floor.

713
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,750
Luckily, Minghao arrived.

714
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,950
Jump from the second floor? Are you crazy?

715
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,150
Am I brave?

716
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,550
Are all experiments

717
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,750
so tiring?

718
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,470
It actually needs

719
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,350
more than 30 hours.

720
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,180
30 hours is normal.

721
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,310
Some might need 100 hours.

722
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,390
And I was just

723
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,380
helping monitor that.

724
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,750
So tiring.

725
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,670
How could you girls

726
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,740
get so tired?

727
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,190
He's right.

728
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,110
Girls will soon look old

729
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,190
if they stay up late so often.

730
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,750
You'll easily get wrinkles.

731
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,150
Look at Yang Lanhang.

732
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,750
Although he is in his twenties,

733
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,710
he looks like

734
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,310
a middle-aged man.

735
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,150
Am I right?

736
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,430
Do you even want to

737
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,550
have a date with a middle-aged man?

738
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,590
I was drunk at that time.

739
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,150
Alright. Alright.

740
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,110
I was finally able to pursue a master's degree,

741
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:37,630
right?

742
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,550
I can't quit midway

743
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,390
and resign.

744
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,070
It's normal in this field.

745
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,750
Why not?

746
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,350
What should I do if I quit?

747
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,510
Live on air?

748
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:48,870
I can support you.

749
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,550
No.

750
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,550
I was saying...

751
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,510
Have you thought of

752
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,670
the Zhenghong Group?

753
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,790
What do you mean?

754
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,910
Owed by the Zhenghong Group,

755
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,100
a newly developed company

756
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,870
running electronic materials

757
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,790
is advertising

758
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,070
for staff.

759
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,990
I happened to see the advertisement

760
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,350
and thought of her.

761
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:22,470
So I asked that.

762
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:23,310
No.

763
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,990
I finally passed the exam.

764
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,190
I should strive to

765
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,180
get a master's degree anyway

766
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,190
even though it is hard.

767
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,870
But you should also think over

768
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,380
why you chose to

769
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,470
pursue a master's degree.

770
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,070
Bai Lingling,

771
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,550
why on earth did you

772
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,310
strive to be

773
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,470
a post graduate student?

774
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,350
It must be easier for a graduate student

775
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,990
to find a good job than a bachelor.

776
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,790
You're right.

777
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,470
The reason why I supported you to

778
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,870
pursue a master's degree is to

779
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,070
wish you more choices.

780
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,070
And now, you have a choice.

781
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,710
Don't you go?

782
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,190
It makes sense.

783
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:58,990
Lingling,

784
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,470
think of those rich guys.

785
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,910
For example, Bill Gates

786
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,900
and Jobs,

787
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,310
both of them dropped out

788
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,110
after gaining admission to their universities.

789
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,230
Alright. Alright.

790
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,270
I'll think it over.

791
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:10,910
Let's eat first.

792
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:11,710
Eat first.

793
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,630
That...

794
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,190
Minghao,

795
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,070
thank you.

796
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,060
Are you busy these days?

797
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,750
I have an important deed

798
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,150
to discuss with you.

799
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,870
Don't be upset.

800
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,550
Have some snacks.

801
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,470
Come on. Have one. Have one.

802
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,390
Cheer up. Cheer up.

803
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,390
Bite me.

804
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,790
I agree with Zheng Minghao.

805
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,790
You are anxious to work.

806
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,310
Isn't that you want to earn money

807
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,110
and create a better life for yourself

808
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,230
and your grandma?

809
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,630
If you choose the master's degree,

810
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,190
though your effort for the last half year

811
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,030
has paid off,

812
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,430
I think it is not worthwhile.

813
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,350
It still takes another few years.

814
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,030
What if you can't find

815
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:10,990
such a good job anymore

816
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,310
when you graduate?

817
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,510
It is a big loss.

818
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:15,950
What's more,

819
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,550
microelectronic material

820
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,110
is somehow similar to

821
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,590
your major, right?

822
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,270
I have no idea.

823
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,070
But I think the Zhenghong Group

824
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,390
is a really good choice.

825
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,270
If you join them now,

826
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,590
you will be a founding member.

827
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,910
And when this group

828
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,270
developed,

829
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,990
you might be a millionaire.

830
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:33,950
Bai Lingling,

831
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,310
only imagination is enough to excite me.

832
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,990
When you become a millionaire,

833
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,070
don't forget to support me.

834
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,310
I might have to think twice.

835
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,710
You're so heartless.

836
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,390
It really bothers me.

837
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,870
Look at my boyfriend.

838
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,190
What happened to him?

839
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,110
I've sent a lot of messages to him.

840
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,590
But he has disappeared for two days.

841
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,270
He totally ignored me.

842
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,830
I was still thinking about

843
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,470
asking for his advice.

844
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,110
So what I said just now

845
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,230
is no advice.

846
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,150
Yes. Yes. Yes.

847
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,350
Great advice for me.

848
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,470
I suddenly got

849
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,830
a great job offer.

850
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,190
I am somehow hesitant.

851
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,270
If I choose it,

852
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,470
I might have to quit pursuing a master's degree.

853
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,470
I need your advice.

854
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,870
Don't forget to reply when you see it.

855
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,950
Alright, leave him alone.

856
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,310
Have some drink?

857
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,590
Okay.

858
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,070
I won.

859
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,190
Go, go, go. Go fetch it.

860
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,990
You should admit defeat.

861
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,150
What type do we have?

862
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,270
Let me see.

863
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,830
Lemon,

864
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,430
passion fruit....

865
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,390
Passion fruit! Passion fruit!

866
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:42,990
Passion....

867
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,750
Bai Lingling, your call.

868
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:52,670
His reply?

869
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,270
It's Yang Lanhang.

870
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,470
Hurry. Answer it.

871
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,350
Take it.

872
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,230
It's midnight. Can I tell him

873
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:03,990
I'm in my bed now?

874
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:04,910
Just pick up

875
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,790
It's your work. Work.

876
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:12,510
What's wrong?

877
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,310
I'm here.

878
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,030
Why do you look the same

879
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,830
as Yang Lanhang?

880
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,190
Actually,

881
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,270
I am Yang Lanhang.

882
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,550
What? Don't...don't you believe me?

883
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,350
I am Yang Lanhang.

884
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,230
If you were Yang Lanhang,

885
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:09,750
I will,

886
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,790
I'll blacklist you now.

887
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,830
Wait, wait a minute.

888
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,350
I am Forever is for Ever.

889
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,550
That's right.

890
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:43,990
Ouyang.

891
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:44,830
Ouyang.

892
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:45,630
Ouyang.

893
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,270
What happened? What happened?

894
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,110
An earthquake?

895
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,030
No.

896
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,630
I think

897
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,070
I'd better not see her.
