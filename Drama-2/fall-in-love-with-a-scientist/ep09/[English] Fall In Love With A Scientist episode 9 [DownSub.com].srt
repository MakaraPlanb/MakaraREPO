1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,430
Stop watching.

3
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,870
2 hours and 27 minutes.

4
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,550
We just made a deal.

5
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,310
Wu Chunhua.

6
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,070
Be gentle.

7
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,150
You.

8
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,540
Unbelievable.

9
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,590
We made a deal.

10
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,270
Only 2 hours.

11
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,430
You are 27 minutes over the limit.

12
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,070
Stop watching.

13
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,190
You are not self-conscious at all.

14
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,750
What are you doing?

15
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,350
What am I doing?

16
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,630
Do you even care for your eyes?

17
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,430
After staring at the screen for too long,

18
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,670
you will be tearing up soon.

19
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,750
Come.

20
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,430
Have some more.

21
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,310
Don't stare at the screen all the time.

22
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,270
No.

23
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,430
After finishing the postgraduate entrance exam,

24
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,670
you should date someone.

25
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,430
Find some friends to chat.

26
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,870
Go shopping.

27
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,710
Don't have to accompany me

28
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,150
and forbid me to watch TV shows.

29
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,190
It's for your own good.

30
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,430
It's almost New Year's Eve.

31
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,750
Any plans?

32
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,790
What plans.

33
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,310
Be by your side of course.

34
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,550
Let's go shopping.

35
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,030
I'm suffocating

36
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,150
staying here all day long.

37
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,710
These days it must be quite busy out there.

38
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,390
OK.

39
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,270
Will your son pick you up tomorrow?

40
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,750
I'm not lucky as you.

41
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,990
My grandkids don't have all day

42
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,950
to be with me.

43
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,710
My son is quite busy.

44
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,630
He just flew

45
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,230
to go abroad yesterday

46
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,750
to make a big deal.

47
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,990
A big deal.

48
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,550
That's something.

49
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,990
What big deal.

50
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,670
Nothing to be impressed about.

51
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,270
Don't be so cocky, I don't buy it.

52
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,030
Take a break.

53
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,070
OK.

54
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,430
Have some more.

55
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,110
Let's go to the night market tomorrow

56
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,590
and eat some snacks.

57
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,790
Have some roasted beika,

58
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,470
roasted rice cake,

59
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,630
rice dumplings,

60
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,430
and sticky rice. They have everything.

61
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,790
That's called Oyster Omelette.

62
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,190
I'm so hungry right now.

63
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,220
I haven't eaten for a long time.

64
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,550
All right.

65
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,870
In view of Ms. Wu's

66
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,670
excellent performance,

67
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,350
I'll allow you

68
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,070
to have some delicious food tomorrow.

69
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,150
Eat as much as you want.

70
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,630
I'm doing well.

71
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,350
I'm doing well, right?

72
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,590
I'm doing well every day.

73
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:23,950
OK.

74
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:24,990
Right?

75
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,030
Use less

76
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,950
iPad.

77
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,470
How time flies.

78
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,430
One year passed.

79
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,550
We had a delay in class.

80
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,270
Let's go.

81
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,390
I'll buy you some food.

82
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,630
I'll buy you some.

83
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,110
Will you be attending

84
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,310
the New Year prom this year?

85
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,470
No.

86
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,390
I'm not really a dancer.

87
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,550
Besides,

88
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,070
I'll definitely be with you.

89
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,950
Otherwise,

90
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,870
what if Ouyang Yifan realizes we are acting.

91
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,950
I don't think so.

92
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,350
It's been quite a long time.

93
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,390
If he really holds grudges,

94
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,430
to the point where

95
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,310
he spies on me on New Year's Eve.

96
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,630
I'll give him some respect.

97
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,350
Right, I forgot to tell you.

98
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,270
In the future,

99
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,350
play as much as you like.

100
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,070
No need to put on a show with me.

101
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,950
You mean,

102
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,070
I don't have to

103
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,070
pretend to be your boyfriend?

104
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,430
No.

105
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,270
Then what's your plan

106
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,790
on New Year's Eve?

107
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,260
Me?

108
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,950
I'd like to go to this prom.

109
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,310
It's just

110
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,430
I don't know if a senior like me

111
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,670
could ever blend in.

112
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:04,950
Right.

113
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,110
Have you ever heard that

114
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,070
in classic literature

115
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,660
and artworks,

116
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,150
the special point in time

117
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,350
is closely linked to the destiny.

118
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,790
Maybe when new year comes,

119
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,830
I'll meet

120
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,350
the one.

121
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,350
At that point,

122
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,630
I'll have my

123
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,030
new year's kiss.

124
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,390
Just kidding.

125
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,070
Bastard,

126
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,350
do you want some?

127
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,990
No I don't.

128
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,510
I just want to ask you about

129
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,870
your New Year Eve's plan

130
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,100
tomorrow.

131
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,350
You want to date me?

132
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,790
No I don't.

133
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,870
Just for the reference.

134
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,110
I don't have a plan for now.

135
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,390
Usually,

136
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,430
we spend New Year's Eve in Europe.

137
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,750
Have some food with friends.

138
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,310
Countdown the New Year in the streets.

139
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,870
What about guru?

140
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:19,910
Him?

141
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,310
He's usually in the lab.

142
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,990
He said that's

143
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,830
the lab's most peaceful time

144
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,830
in a year.

145
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,430
Don't really understand his style.

146
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,070
Understood.

147
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,430
My soup!

148
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,060
What's wrong with one sip?

149
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,830
Drink some and that's enough. Don't finish it all.

150
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,710
Bastard.

151
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,390
That's all.

152
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,790
How delicious!

153
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,950
Cooked the meal yourself. Impressive.

154
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,350
The tofu

155
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,030
is made by myself.

156
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,430
I know you can cook this dish.

157
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,310
Our son

158
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,790
is abroad for several years.

159
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,870
Our family

160
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,310
hasn't been spending

161
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,230
New Year's Eve for a long time.

162
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,390
Hang,

163
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,670
don't play with your phone.

164
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,350
What's your plan for New Year's Eve?

165
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,390
I've promised grandma

166
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,670
to take her for a walk.

167
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,790
I brought a bottle of

168
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,830
great wine.

169
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,150
Let's taste it later.

170
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,150
Taste it now then.

171
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,110
OK.

172
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,310
Son.

173
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,670
Hang.

174
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,310
Ma.

175
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,230
Let's also go out for a walk in a while.

176
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,230
Don't stay at home.

177
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,549
Our son's idea is great.

178
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,470
OK, so let's finish our meal.

179
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,350
After the meal,

180
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,350
let's go for a walk.

181
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,950
OK, I'm all yours.

182
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,830
Such a beauty.

183
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,150
Brother,

184
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,150
you look some handsome.

185
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,790
Just average.

186
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:23,910
Remember,

187
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,990
When 12:00 comes,

188
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,830
you shout

189
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,830
I love you

190
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,420
and

191
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,870
kiss her.

192
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,420
This will definitely work.

193
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,390
I try my best.

194
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,790
I'm making a pose

195
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,340
of classical Micheal Jackson.

196
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:43,790
Cool.

197
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,710
Three, two, one.

198
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:45,830
So great.

199
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,830
So great, come.

200
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,230
Wu Chunhua,

201
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:49,830
square dancing

202
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,550
is very nice.

203
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,830
Beautiful square dancing.

204
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,150
Come on.

205
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,430
Impressive.

206
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,630
Come on, take a look.

207
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,150
Is it great?

208
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,070
Am I that beautiful?

209
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,750
Yes, of course.

210
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,830
Look at the manners of grandma.

211
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,630
Elegant.

212
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,550
OK.

213
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,110
We should really go right now.

214
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,230
I haven't been so happy for a long time.

215
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,030
The wind is blowing, let's go.

216
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,470
No,

217
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,630
it's...

218
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,270
it's...

219
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,350
it's a dance called...

220
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:12,950
I'll make a video of you.

221
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,310
Make a video.

222
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,350
Nice.

223
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,270
Perfect.

224
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,790
Let's go.

225
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,910
Let's go back.

226
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,070
Look at that.

227
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,230
A wishing tree.

228
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,870
OK, go.

229
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,950
Bought, let's go.

230
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,030
Wishing tree is important.

231
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,300
Very important.

232
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,390
See.

233
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,310
Wishing tree straps are hanging on the tree.

234
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,470
You can fulfill any wishes.

235
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,710
Go.

236
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,350
How much?

237
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,230
20 yuan.

238
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,030
OK.

239
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,030
New year is coming.

240
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,430
Thief!

241
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,270
Stop!

242
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,190
You go back first.

243
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,780
Hey.

244
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,910
You, where are you?

245
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,750
Help me.

246
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:04,910
Stop.

247
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,150
Ouyang.

248
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,550
Why are you peeking?

249
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,870
Let me read it.

250
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,710
I told you it wouldn't work if you read it.

251
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,790
Then show me yours.

252
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,870
It wouldn't work if you read it.

253
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,430
No.

254
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,790
But I know what you wrote.

255
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,700
What did I write?

256
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,630
It's all about

257
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,830
winning in mahjong.

258
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,270
The lottery ticket of double color ball

259
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,580
that I bought will win the jackpot.

260
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,470
Right?

261
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,430
So cheesy, Ms. Wu.

262
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,310
What are you doing?

263
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,590
Slow down a little.

264
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,110
So beautiful.

265
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,790
What does Hang

266
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,630
doing down there?

267
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,790
It's been so long.

268
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,550
Ling.

269
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,110
Why did you go up to such a high place?

270
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,270
Are you done hanging?

271
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,110
Yes.

272
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:43,910
Come down here.

273
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,270
Slowly.

274
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,870
Let's kowtow first.

275
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,070
Hang a little bit higher.

276
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,710
A little bit higher so that the God can see.

277
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,830
Wishes will be fulfilled.

278
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,830
Hang a little bit higher.

279
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,870
Let me do it.

280
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,670
OK, I know.

281
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,220
Come down.

282
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,060
OK.

283
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,070
Be quick.

284
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,390
I hope

285
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,150
I will still be Ya's mother

286
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,390
and Ling's grandmother

287
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,590
in the next life.

288
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,310
Make up

289
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,390
those I have owed to them.

290
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,390
Here comes the countdown.

291
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,630
Here comes the countdown.

292
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,710
Ten,

293
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,590
Nine.

294
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,910
Six.

295
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,110
Four.

296
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,350
Three.

297
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,550
One.

298
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,470
Happy New Year!

299
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,670
Happy New Year!

300
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,190
Happy New Year.

301
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,550
Where's my bag?

302
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,020
Give it to me.

303
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,900
Ouyang,

304
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,030
happy New Year.

305
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,630
Ling.

306
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,310
I made it!

307
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,550
I knew it.

308
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,870
Ling can pass the exam.

309
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,110
It's all because of me.

310
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,510
Because of you?

311
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,270
You play games under her eyes all day long.

312
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,430
Guru.

313
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,230
Don't listen to Zhang's rubbish.

314
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,950
I tutor Bai very seriously.

315
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,870
Doesn't matter.

316
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,910
I made it.

317
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,670
Nothing matters.

318
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,590
Very important.

319
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,590
I'm not that kind of

320
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,550
loafers.

321
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,430
Zhang, don't talk rubbish.

322
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,670
I don't talk rubbish.

323
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,910
Just show them your phone.

324
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,990
Look at your gaming results.

325
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,630
Come on.

326
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,710
Enough about that.

327
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,670
Doesn't matter now.

328
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,630
What's really important now

329
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,750
is to

330
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,350
thank everyone

331
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,870
in this house.

332
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,430
How about this.

333
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,630
Let's celebrate tonight.

334
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,830
Have a dinner together.

335
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,750
OK.

336
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,110
Great.

337
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,910
I'm in.

338
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,430
Karaoke and dinner, sounds good?

339
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,910
Great.

340
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,430
OK.

341
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,310
OK.

342
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,590
Let's sing! Karaoke and dinner!

343
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,070
OK.

344
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,230
What are you doing?

345
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,230
Don't play with your phone. I'm here.

346
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,790
Come on.

347
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,950
One glass of wine first.

348
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,270
It's all about being happy today.

349
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:08,790
Happy.

350
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,710
Yang Lanhang

351
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,190
might be sick as a person,

352
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,590
but he is

353
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,670
quite handsome.

354
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,630
Girlfriend, do you know that

355
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,670
Ouyang Yifan

356
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,510
has already messed up with

357
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,150
my boyfriend?

358
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,790
Otherwise, today would be

359
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:28,950
the day that

360
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,950
I

361
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,750
make moves to him.

362
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,990
That's OK.

363
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,110
He and I

364
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,350
are not enemies anymore.

365
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,310
You

366
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,430
don't have to

367
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,790
make sacrifices for me.

368
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,470
Really? Bai Lingling.

369
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,510
You forgive him

370
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,870
so fast.

371
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,990
That's it.

372
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,470
I thought I could

373
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,950
realize my

374
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,030
evil idea in my mind

375
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,790
in name of our friendship.

376
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,710
I know

377
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,110
you are not that kind.

378
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,390
OK.

379
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,110
Stop.

380
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:57,670
Stop being a child.

381
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,310
Just kidding.

382
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,750
OK, he's all alone now.

383
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,310
Let's drink with him.

384
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,590
Mr. Scientist,

385
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,430
have some drink.

386
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,750
Jing.

387
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,870
Ouyang is here, too.

388
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,190
Sit.

389
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,670
Make yourself comfortable.

390
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,310
Ouyang offers to

391
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,630
celebrate.

392
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,430
It's great that you're here.

393
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,310
Go have some fun.

394
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,750
OK.

395
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,390
What?

396
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,390
What are you doing?

397
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,780
What's wrong with you?

398
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,590
Why don't you

399
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,550
notify me that he's here?

400
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,750
I should not have come.

401
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,550
He's here?

402
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,430
Who?

403
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,030
Ouyang Yifan.

404
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,150
Ou,

405
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,670
senior Ouyang?

406
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,390
He is that

407
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,190
Ouyang?

408
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,310
No way.

409
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,390
I used to

410
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,510
call him senior Ouyang in the lab.

411
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,390
Senior Ouyang.

412
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,190
I don't know.

413
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,110
He's Ouyang Yifan.

414
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,470
I don't even have his contact information.

415
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,150
So great at hiding.

416
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,350
Such a piece of work.

417
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,550
I can't drink.

418
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,350
OK.

419
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,230
I have to leave

420
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:26,990
before he recognizes me.

421
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,430
Go.

422
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,190
Don't worry about the money.

423
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,790
I have some.

424
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,470
Take your time.

425
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,310
Where are you going?

426
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,150
Well,

427
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,390
she has to use the restroom.

428
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,310
Go.

429
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,030
I'll play with you.

430
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:34,870
Come on.

431
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,230
Come on, together.

432
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,510
What a coincidence...

433
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,110
Playing hard to get, huh?

434
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,190
I bet you will

435
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,580
turn around in ten seconds.

436
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,710
Ten.

437
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:00,830
Nine.

438
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:01,550
Eight.

439
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,670
Seven.

440
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:03,950
Six.

441
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,230
Five.

442
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,990
Four.

443
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,350
Three.

444
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,750
Two.

445
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,270
One.

446
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,070
You do have something.

447
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,910
I will give you 10 more seconds.

448
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,390
Ten,

449
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:18,830
nine,

450
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,470
eight, seven, six,

451
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,350
five, four, three, two,

452
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:25,790
one.

453
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,510
What is this?

454
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,750
What do you mean?

455
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,230
Just be clear.

456
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,550
What's that expression?

457
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,670
Didn't you expect

458
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,910
me to break up with my boyfriend?

459
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:49,830
What?

460
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,630
Finally giving up?

461
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:56,590
Yes.

462
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,390
You don't like me anymore?

463
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,340
I understand.

464
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,950
Are you setting

465
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,150
your persona

466
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,990
in the lab?

467
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,950
Are you afraid of me exposing you?

468
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,350
No.

469
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,390
What are you saying?

470
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,950
A word spoken is past recalling.

471
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,100
You

472
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,990
said that.

473
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,990
Don't regret.

474
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,430
Don't try to revenge me later.

475
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,470
Making me trouble...

476
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:24,830
It's okay.

477
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,750
I'm quite magnanimous.

478
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:26,550
We can still

479
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,670
be friends.

480
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,910
If I keep walking, I will be entering the room.

481
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,950
Strange.

482
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,750
Cheers.

483
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,430
What about we

484
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,710
playing a game together?

485
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:42,350
OK.

486
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,950
I put my hand here.

487
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,390
And you put your fingers

488
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,110
at my hand.

489
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:46,670
I will try to catch them.

490
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,310
Alright.

491
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,830
OK. Come.

492
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,270
Three, two, one.

493
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:50,950
Right,

494
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,070
why did you come in the end?

495
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,350
Staying at home is worse.

496
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,550
Drink, drink.

497
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,310
Why is it me again?

498
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,910
It's the family gathering.

499
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,030
I have refused it

500
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,630
to my mom long time ago.

501
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,310
So, you leave Yifan alone

502
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,910
to deal with the elderly at home.

503
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,070
Cheers.

504
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,030
Yang.

505
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,870
Do you know how to play Fifteen and Twenty?

506
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,510
Yes.

507
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,670
Yang.

508
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,180
Come. Get ready.

509
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,910
15, 20, 15.

510
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,270
Congrats.

511
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:40,790
Thank you.

512
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:43,510
Alright.

513
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,070
You have eaten too much.

514
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,950
Come. 15, 20.

515
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,460
Here, here, here.

516
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:46,470
What?

517
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,550
What?

518
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,110
What are you playing?

519
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,660
Fifteen and Twenty. Do you know?

520
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,630
Come.

521
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,030
15, 20, 15.

522
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,910
Welcome.

523
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,030
He's here.

524
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:25,990
Come.

525
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:27,710
Guru,

526
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,990
it's so late.

527
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,750
Let me send you home.

528
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:31,990
She doesn't live at school.

529
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,270
I will send her home on the way.

530
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,390
You guys be careful.

531
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,630
OK, bye.

532
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,950
Guru,

533
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:39,790
I will..

534
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,110
Bye.

535
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,470
Bye, bye.

536
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,470
Watch your head.

537
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,550
Bye.

538
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,150
I, I don't live at the school as well.

539
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,030
Goodbye.

540
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,670
Long time no see, beauty.

541
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,350
Hello.

542
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,310
What would you like to drink?

543
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,110
The same. Up to you.

544
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,390
Hello,

545
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,470
Panpan.

546
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:44,910
Yes.

547
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,550
I'm alone at the bar.

548
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,310
Today...

549
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,070
I'm happy today,

550
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,110
so I would like to have a drink.

551
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,150
Great. You come to find me.

552
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:56,950
See you later.

553
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,430
It has a delayed effect.

554
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,070
Will you be OK?

555
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,670
Don't you know how much

556
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,590
I can drink?

557
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,710
I'm good enough.

558
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:08,990
But when my friend

559
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,670
is here later,

560
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,790
remember to take care of him.

561
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,390
OK.

562
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,990
Beauty,

563
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,710
I forgot my wallet.

564
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,430
Can you buy me a drink?

565
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,990
Why is it you?

566
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,510
Aren't you hiding from me?

567
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,430
Why do you come to my place

568
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,270
for drinks alone?

569
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,870
You are brave.

570
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,470
Well,

571
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,510
why do you look at me like that?

572
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,550
Do you think I become more handsome

573
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,390
after a few days?

574
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:54,590
No,

575
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,790
you have finished already?

576
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,670
How can I

577
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,550
play with them?

578
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,790
I just ran away with an excuse.

579
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,670
Right.

580
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,510
You are not like you

581
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,790
when you are

582
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,110
with them.

583
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,990
It's like you have seen

584
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:13,830
Austin.

585
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,510
Give me the same drink as hers.

586
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,110
OK.

587
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,230
What are you having?

588
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,870
Is it good?

589
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,070
It's okay.

590
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:22,870
Let me have a taste.

591
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,510
Gross.

592
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,430
I'm so happy today.

593
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,990
I know.

594
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,590
My, my mom.

595
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,140
Alright, alright.

596
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:48,750
Alright.

597
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,030
Don't face the wind after drinking.

598
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,230
You will get a headache tomorrow.

599
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,990
I know.

600
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,230
I, I...

601
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,910
Why are you smiling?

602
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,700
Do, do you know,

603
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,310
you know

604
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,990
that I

605
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,870
really hate Yang Lanhang?

606
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:31,990
Yes, you.

607
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,470
Think about it.

608
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,670
If

609
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,910
someone

610
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:39,910
causes

611
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,990
your graduation delay,

612
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,030
and your job

613
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,350
is lost due to him.

614
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,750
And he still

615
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,230
tries to torture me

616
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,230
taking the advantage of

617
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,710
his role in the name of work

618
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,070
in the lab.

619
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,710
Will you hate him?

620
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,230
I didn't take the advantage of work.

621
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,110
I just ask you.

622
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,550
Do you hate this guy?

623
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,350
Do you hate him?

624
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:04,910
Hate him?

625
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,470
Yes.

626
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:06,830
Right?

627
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,030
I really hate him.

628
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,910
Although I know,

629
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,390
it is my fault on the thesis.

630
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,510
You were right.

631
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,150
And you always helped me

632
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,030
with the mess.

633
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,710
Help me

634
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,950
in the lab.

635
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,510
But, I

636
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,310
still couldn't

637
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,150
forgive you.

638
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:29,710
You know?

639
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,350
Because

640
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,110
you still threaten me with

641
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,830
the confession stuff.

642
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,750
However, this time,

643
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,790
I admit.

644
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,110
If it were not you

645
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,390
who helped me

646
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,870
with the review

647
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,110
and the exam preparation,

648
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,110
it would not be this smooth.

649
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,350
So, I...

650
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,550
Thank you.

651
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,110
Personally,

652
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,790
I would like to forgive you on my side.

653
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,750
It's all over.

654
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,870
I thought we have

655
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,910
let it pass for a long time.

656
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,110
That's your thought.

657
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:26,630
Hello.

658
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,670
I've sent you so many messages.

659
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,270
Why don't you reply?

660
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,550
I thought you were angry with me.

661
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,710
I got the message, Lingling.

662
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:34,910
Congrats.

663
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,670
Minghao,

664
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,350
I'm sorry.

665
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,630
I forgot to invite you for karaoke today.

666
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,550
You didn't intend to.

667
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:47,710
Well,

668
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:49,590
I

669
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,030
will treat you dinner tomorrow.

670
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,710
Are you treating me dinner?

671
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:54,710
OK.

672
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,620
I will take the morning flight

673
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,950
and will be there in the evening

674
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,750
and we can have dinner.

675
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,510
OK.

676
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,750
Flight?

677
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,020
Where are you?

678
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,790
I have sent you the message.

679
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,910
You didn't listen to it, right?

680
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,470
What? What did you say?

681
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,990
I, I will listen to it now.

682
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,990
Listen to it now.

683
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,230
Listen.

684
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,430
I'm leaving.

685
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,550
I intended to tell you

686
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,470
when we meet.

687
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,630
I will leave for Shenzhen tomorrow.

688
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,390
The Internet

689
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,590
is developing fast now.

690
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,990
The market there is broad and promising.

691
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,070
There are more opportunities there.

692
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,590
Dong Chao and I

693
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,590
prepare to take the office

694
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,310
to Shenzhen.

695
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,310
I have packed up for a long time.

696
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,550
My house is taken care of by someone.

697
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,550
Everything is ready.

698
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,430
I just don't know

699
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,830
how to say goodbye to you.

700
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,390
I'm afraid that

701
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,350
you would say nothing.

702
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,910
Then I will lose face.

703
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,030
But I'm more afraid of you saving me.

704
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,710
Because as long as you say it,

705
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,270
I will not go anywhere.

706
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,230
I keep telling myself

707
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,150
that I will not give up.

708
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,750
Actually I will.

709
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:00,990
As long as you are happy,

710
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,350
I will be willing to give up.

711
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,060
But, are you happy?

712
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,470
You are not.

713
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,790
At least not now.

714
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,230
I only see your

715
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,030
efforts

716
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:09,870
and difficulty.

717
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,230
I was thinking...

718
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,590
Who would

719
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,550
hold the umbrella for you on rainy days?

720
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,590
You cannot

721
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,270
live you whole life with your phone.

722
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:18,670
None of your business.

723
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:20,469
Hold on.

724
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,630
Hold on.

725
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:25,750
I'm throwing up.

726
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,469
old on.

727
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:29,310
Watch out.

728
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:30,310
Wait.

729
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:47,980
Are you okay?

730
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,949
How much have you drunk?

731
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,070
You are vomiting like this!

732
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,870
It's okay. I'm okay.

733
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,110
I didn't drink much.

734
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,270
I'm not drunk.

735
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,230
Then you throw up

736
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:06,990
due to his words.

737
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,390
I need to ask you.

738
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,510
Why is everybody

739
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,230
negative about

740
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,340
the relationship

741
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,910
between us?

742
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,590
Zhengminghao is.

743
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,350
Guan Xiao...

744
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,510
Never mind.

745
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,710
Actually, I'm negative about it, too.

746
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,110
Do you know when it rained that day,

747
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,460
I told him I had my umbrella

748
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,870
when I didn't,

749
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,350
because I was afraid that

750
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,350
he wouldn't care

751
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,790
and wouldn't ask me?

752
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,590
So, I thought

753
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,750
maybe I should avoid

754
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,870
leaving the chance to him.

755
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,790
I just didn't tell him.

756
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,830
Do you think I am

757
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,470
being unconfident?

758
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,870
I

759
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:06,350
dare not ask his name,

760
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,990
watch his photos,

761
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,950
listen to his voice,

762
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,150
or confess my love.

763
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,070
I fear that

764
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,030
everything

765
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,030
I own now

766
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,590
is just a dream.

767
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,750
I'm really afraid that

768
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,150
when we face the reality,

769
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,030
it will

770
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,070
be broken.

771
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,670
Why don't you say it?

772
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,150
Say what?

773
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,030
I mean...

774
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,710
Why don't you tell that guy,

775
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,460
the guy you like.

776
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,790
Don't you understand?

777
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,870
I cannot say it.

778
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,670
It's like

779
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,790
I have a candy.

780
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,110
I believe the candy

781
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,510
is exceptionally good.

782
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,950
If I don't eat it,

783
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,710
I will still believe

784
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,510
that I have the

785
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,390
most delicious candy in the world.

786
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,270
However, what if I find

787
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,390
the candy bitter

788
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,110
if I taste it?

789
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,910
Who doesn't like candy?

790
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,790
I also want to taste it.

791
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,340
I also want someone to like me.

792
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,030
I also want someone to hold the umbrella

793
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,670
for me on rainy days.

794
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,110
I also want to tell him.

795
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,830
It's been six years.

796
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,270
I really

797
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,550
like him.

798
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,510
Actually...

799
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,070
Ouyang Yifan,

800
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,110
are you insane?

801
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,540
What are you doing?

802
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:57,990
You...

803
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,310
What did I do?

804
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:02,630
Ouyang Yifan，

805
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,630
I think I have

806
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,150
made it clear enough.

807
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:05,750
I also think your attitude

808
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,910
of being cool

809
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:07,910
is admirable.

810
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,710
As a result?

811
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,750
Because of that,

812
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,830
I am willing to be friends with you,

813
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,070
and drink with you.

814
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,830
What are you doing with my trust?

815
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,790
Or there isn't

816
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:15,630
any truth

817
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,470
from your mouth？

818
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,270
Are you crazy?

819
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,590
You got drunk last night

820
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:26,790
and would not go home.

821
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,990
You also threw up on my clothes.

822
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,270
If I don't take you to the hotel,

823
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,260
where can I take you to?

824
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:31,750
Give you to the

825
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:32,950
ill-intentioned kid?

826
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,150
What to do...

827
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,510
It's all your fault.

828
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,670
I like you.

829
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,670
Let's have a date.

830
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,350
Confession...

831
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,230
What?

832
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,870
He said he liked me!

833
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,230
Who likes you?

834
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,150
Are there any others?

835
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:54,990
Forever is for Ever!

836
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,030
He said he liked me

837
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:56,710
and asked me to have a date.

838
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,510
Really?

839
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,310
Look.

840
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,270
It's true.

841
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,750
What would you like to reply?

842
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,670
I don't know,

843
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:06,390
so I came to you.

844
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,430
What step should I take

845
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,870
in this case?

846
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,430
Step in this case?

847
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,030
Just...

848
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,350
kiss him!

849
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,310
I would like to kiss him.

850
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,030
But,

851
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,230
it's not realistic.

852
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,510
Give me an easy one.

853
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,230
I don't have easy ones.

854
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,710
I only have sophisticated ones.

855
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,620
OK, I will go to sleep.

856
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,870
Congrats. Congrats.

857
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:23,630
Why didn't you get changed?

858
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,510
Didn't you come back last night?

859
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,020
I also like you.

860
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,390
Look outside of your window.

861
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:45,910
What?

862
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:48,510
Shut the door. Shut the door.

863
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,790
Actually,

864
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,470
I'm Forever is for Ever.
