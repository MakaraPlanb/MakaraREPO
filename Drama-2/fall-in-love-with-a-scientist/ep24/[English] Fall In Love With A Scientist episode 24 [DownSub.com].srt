1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]


2
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,150
Ouyang,


3
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,790
I have booked an air ticket to Germany in the afternoon


4
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,590
the day after tomorrow.


5
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,110
So I won't come to the lab tomorrow.


6
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:40,790
This is the last time


7
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,350
I did an experiment with you.


8
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,110
OK.


9
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,710
And...


10
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:52,670
and...


11
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,870
I like you.


12
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,670
Goodbye, Ouyang.


13
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,910
Everything's normal.


14
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,270
The recovery is good.


15
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,710
Great.


16
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,270
As of yesterday's evening,


17
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,230
the number of people


18
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,150
participating in the clinical trial in the several centers


19
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,670
has increased to 300.


20
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,390
Based on the results of short-term follow-up visits,


21
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,390
it's all good.


22
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,430
Don't worry.


23
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,030
According to the plan,


24
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,510
our new valve material


25
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,910
can be put into use


26
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,470
by 2022 at the latest.


27
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,390
Through all our efforts,


28
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,910
we are finally getting somewhere.


29
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,350
Any new topic


30
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,470
next?


31
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:09,910
Lingling's postgraduate topic


32
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,910
is metamaterial.


33
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,710
I'm also interested


34
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,990
in it.


35
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,829
I was asking you a question


36
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,390
about scientific research.


37
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,150
I don't want your public display of affection.


38
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,350
Sorry.


39
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,470
If you are really sorry,


40
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,550
give me a treat.


41
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,470
I happen to have an appointment today.


42
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,150
So today is not an option.


43
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,030
Next time.


44
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,270
Next time, I will surely give you a treat.


45
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,190
I'm going.


46
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,750
Is having a relationship really that happy?


47
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,750
It's fine. Trust me.


48
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,350
What is your


49
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,710
plan today?


50
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,630
You are making it so mysterious.


51
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,590
Where are you taking me?


52
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:19,790
Guess.


53
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,910
It's a place


54
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,870
we both like.


55
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,990
I know it. I'm telling you,


56
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,350
since we entered the lift,


57
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,909
and stepped out,


58
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,510
I haven't met a single person


59
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,390
along the way.


60
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,909
I just said hello,


61
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,790
and no one answered.


62
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,670
So I don't think


63
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,670
we are


64
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,590
in a restaurant, right?


65
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,100
Or a bar, right?


66
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,350
No waiters.


67
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,110
No.


68
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:53,790
You...


69
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,390
You didn't bring me


70
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,830
to that skyscraper tower, did you?


71
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,030
Guess.


72
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,380
No.


73
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,590
Wait. Wait.


74
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,590
Come. Wait a moment.


75
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,550
Come. Wait a moment.


76
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,750
I'm telling you.


77
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,910
I'm telling you.


78
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,790
Here, trust me.


79
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,510
Here, move forward.


80
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,990
You can trust me. Trust me.


81
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,670
Trust me.


82
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,510
Here. Step over.


83
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,110
It's fine.


84
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,110
It's really fine.


85
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,860
I'm telling you.


86
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,670
I...I know we must be


87
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,710
on that skyscraper tower right now.


88
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,470
I....


89
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,230
Fortunately,


90
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,110
you are smart enough


91
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:28,950
to cover my eyes.


92
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,670
Or I....


93
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,230
Actually, I sort of have the acrophobia.


94
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,909
I'm telling you.


95
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,190
You don't have to be stressful.


96
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,390
Don't be stressful.


97
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,230
I will not be mad at you.


98
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,070
I will definitely not.


99
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,430
OK.


100
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,310
Do you know that this skyscraper tower


101
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,470
has a name


102
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,270
called Peak of Love?


103
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,670
We are standing on the peak now.


104
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,110
We are on the peak.


105
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,909
Over there, I remember there is a...


106
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:46,470
That....


107
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,909
We can hang a lock maybe.


108
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,510
A love lock.


109
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,990
We should hang


110
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,950
a love lock later.


111
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:50,990
-I'm not angry.
-OK.


112
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,909
I'm not mad, really.


113
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,550
Come.


114
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,030
I'm really not...


115
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,670
Hold me tight.


116
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:55,950
Where are you going?


117
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,510
It's fine.


118
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,510
Are we on the top?


119
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,620
Soon. Soon.


120
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,790
On the top.


121
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,830
Five steps away.


122
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,430
Four.


123
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:08,710
Three.


124
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,350
Come. Two more steps.


125
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,230
Two.


126
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,470
One.


127
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:14,590
OK.


128
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,150
We are here.


129
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,110
It smells familiar.


130
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,870
So this is the smell


131
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,710
on the peak.


132
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,390
Familiar?


133
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,750
Of course you are familiar.


134
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,070
Wait for me.


135
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,110
You...you...!


136
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,110
What are you doing?


137
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,310
Are you going to buy a lock?


138
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,020
No.


139
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,909
You...you just wait for me.


140
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:38,670
I'll be back in a minute.


141
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,990
No. No. No.


142
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,190
You are safe.


143
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,909
I... I'll be gone just for a minute.


144
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:43,540
Okay. Okay.


145
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,670
Wait for me.


146
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,150
Okay. Okay.


147
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,710
Trust me.


148
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,150
Okay.


149
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,550
Are you buying a lock?


150
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,390
I want a pink one.


151
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:49,510
OK.


152
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,710
Done?


153
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,350
Done.


154
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,230
Done. Here.


155
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,630
I'll take it off.


156
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,550
I got it. I got it.


157
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,350
You are really...!


158
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,790
You take me here


159
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,550
for a date?


160
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,750
You tricked me here to work overtime,


161
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,590
right?


162
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,590
You did this...!


163
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,550
You...!


164
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,230
I....


165
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,350
This is how


166
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:26,990
you think of me?


167
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,470
Yes.


168
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,750
Not exactly.


169
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,230
But,


170
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,390
but you don't know this.


171
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,030
I'm telling you.


172
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,390
Sometimes you are really inhumane


173
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,909
at work.


174
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,510
Just say it.


175
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,789
What do you want me to do?


176
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,950
I just


177
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,870
have a surprise for you.


178
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,100
It's safe.


179
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,750
This


180
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,470
is a natural Moissanite.


181
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,990
I got it when I studied


182
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,830
in Europe.


183
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,150
Guess.


184
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,710
How is


185
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,630
a natural Moissanite formed?


186
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,030
So it's not working overtime,


187
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,870
but a pop quiz,


188
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,390
right?


189
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,750
I'll tell you.


190
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,180
A natural Moissanite


191
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,030
is formed in an


192
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,270
impactive environment under high temperature


193
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,270
and high pressure with carbon


194
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,110
and silicon elements needed.


195
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,900
The first person who discovered Moissanite


196
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,670
is a Nobel Prize winner


197
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,670
in France.


198
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,950
His name is Dr. Moissan.


199
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,740
He found the gem in the meteorolite,


200
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,310
so the gem was


201
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:58,870
named after him.


202
00:09:59,310 --> 00:09:59,790
I was planning to


203
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,550
take this one


204
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,710
back to China


205
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,550
as a seed.


206
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,630
I spent so much time


207
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,030
simulating its growing environment repeatedly.


208
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,230
Finally I managed to cultivate


209
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,910
this high-quality gem.


210
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,270
I intend to


211
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,070
embed it on a ring.


212
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:15,790
Wait a minute.


213
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,990
Ring?


214
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,380
What...what ring?


215
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,790
An engagement ring.


216
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,150
The gem


217
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,430
grows in


218
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,430
a quite extreme environment,


219
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,390
so it has


220
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,270
a very, very high purity.


221
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,790
Higher than diamonds.


222
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,350
Besides, diamonds are expensive


223
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,390
because their price includes


224
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,350
fees for mining


225
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,020
and workforce,


226
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,910
as well as advertising.


227
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,910
But this gem


228
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,910
is totally different.


229
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,430
I cultivated it.


230
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,750
It's a one-off.


231
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,910
This gem


232
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,670
is born just for you.


233
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:46,590
Right.


234
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,670
How about


235
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,990
giving it a name?


236
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:49,790
OK?


237
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,870
Let's


238
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,830
follow the naming rule of


239
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,110
Dr. Moissan.


240
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,070
Name it with names.


241
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,390
OK.


242
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,110
Using our names.


243
00:10:59,230 --> 00:10:59,710
Yang.


244
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,550
Baiyang.


245
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,510
Lan.


246
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,700
Bailan.


247
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,350
Ling. How about Linglan?


248
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,630
Linglan.


249
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,790
This sounds great.


250
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,590
You are really good at naming.


251
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,790
You should name


252
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,670
our future kid.


253
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,510
The name of our kid.


254
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,750
So,


255
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,670
are you making a proposal?


256
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,470
No.


257
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,910
I... I just want to show you it.


258
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,990
It grows slow,


259
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,030
really slow.


260
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,230
Only one karat in six months.


261
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,550
So I want you to see it first.


262
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,510
And....


263
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,790
What?


264
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,630
Are you eager for it?


265
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,270
No. No.


266
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,270
It does look


267
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,790
a little bit small right now.


268
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,270
Right?


269
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:47,990
It's fine.


270
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,190
Wait for it to


271
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,590
grow up. Grow up.


272
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,270
Grow up.


273
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,710
OK.


274
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,710
Grow up slowly.


275
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,150
OK.


276
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,990
Six...six months.


277
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,590
One karat


278
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,110
in six months.


279
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,830
Yang Lanhang proposed to you?


280
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,630
So soon.


281
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,910
It's not a proposal.


282
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,990
He just showed me


283
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,390
the engagement ring.


284
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,510
It's just that


285
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,670
the gem on the ring,


286
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,980
the rare gem,


287
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,470
is still growing.


288
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,030
Still growing.


289
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,350
So it will take a time


290
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,950
before it completes growing.


291
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,030
But he just


292
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,990
told you his engagement plan


293
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,350
like this?


294
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,070
It's not mysterious at all.


295
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,870
There won't be a surprise.


296
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,950
No.


297
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,630
This surprise is just what I want.


298
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,110
I can accept that,


299
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,230
and I'm very satisfied.


300
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,630
Don't you think


301
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,590
it feels wonderful


302
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,500
when someone makes a proposal


303
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,150
in public?


304
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,590
It enlarges happiness.


305
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,550
It's like


306
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,630
the whole world


307
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,030
is witnessing your happiness.


308
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,550
I can't stand that.


309
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,310
Let me tell you this.


310
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,390
When I was at school,


311
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,590
a boy in the adjacent classroom


312
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,150
had a crush on me.


313
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,990
At 12 o'clock of my birthday,


314
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:57,990
he called


315
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,710
a dozen of his classmates


316
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,870
to gather in front of my door


317
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,150
and sing a birthday song.


318
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,070
My neighbors came out and kept shouting


319
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,470
'stop singing, what time is it'.


320
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,350
I was so awkward


321
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,670
that I wanted to smash that cake


322
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,710
into his face.


323
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:10,710
Later, there was that Wang Tao.


324
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,550
You know it too.


325
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,910
He was really suffocating.


326
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,910
So, not every romance


327
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,950
is good.


328
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,870
A good romance


329
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,790
is the one you like.


330
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,590
Do you understand?


331
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,390
Otherwise,


332
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,350
both will be awkward


333
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,870
in the crowd.


334
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,030
But I


335
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,790
quite like it.


336
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,910
It's fine if you like it.


337
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,990
It's okay as long as you like it.


338
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,110
Everyone has his own preference.


339
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,430
What about


340
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,060
asking Yang Lanhang


341
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,710
to convey my preference?


342
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,430
You want to suggest Ouyang Yifan


343
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,750
making such a proposal?


344
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:57,910
Impossible.


345
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,830
No.


346
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,430
I just want him to know


347
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,110
my, my...


348
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,110
my...


349
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,430
my preference.


350
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,350
If he proposes to you tomorrow,


351
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,070
will you say yes?


352
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,190
Of course I will not.


353
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,270
There is no way I will say yes.


354
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,550
I just want to have a relationship.


355
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,670
I won't get married.


356
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,070
I will never,


357
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,230
ever, ever,


358
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,030
get married.


359
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,510
No way.


360
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,910
Definitely impossible.


361
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,070
What?


362
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,310
You are cultivating a gem?


363
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,750
Since when?


364
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,310
Hang,


365
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,510
what should I say?


366
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,270
How did you learn this?


367
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,110
You are so romantic.


368
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:38,910
What am I supposed to do?


369
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,750
Your girlfriend and my girlfriend


370
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,550
are bosom friends.


371
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,190
They are quite intimate.


372
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,030
If you cultivate a gem,


373
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,110
then I will have no other choices but


374
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,990
fetch a star in the sky.


375
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,190
I can't do anything about it.


376
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,310
This is the next problem in your life


377
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,950
you need to figure out.


378
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,710
Come on.


379
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,270
No.


380
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,230
I need to take actions first.


381
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,510
Engagement diamond ring.


382
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,550
A man can only buy one throughout his life.


383
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,150
Ouyang,


384
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,390
someone is knocking at the door.


385
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,750
You go.


386
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,750
I'm working on my report.


387
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,790
I'm busy, you go.


388
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,990
What are you busy with?


389
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,910
Making a proposal.


390
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,390
Don't you feel ashamed?


391
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,990
You...you are here.


392
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,870
Wait a minute.


393
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,030
I forget where I put the file.


394
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,190
Come in.


395
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,790
Wait.


396
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,270
I'll find it for you.


397
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,150
I forget.


398
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,150
Come here.


399
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,510
Help me choose one.


400
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,750
Even super stars prefer it as


401
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,390
their first choice for engagement,


402
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,030
let alone a celebrity like me.


403
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,230
What?


404
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:24,870
Nothing.


405
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,390
You know what?


406
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,140
I thought I would be outperformed.


407
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,590
Then I closed my eyes


408
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,470
and began to search, and I found this ring.


409
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,350
A man can only customize one throughout his life.


410
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,750
Awesome, huh?


411
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:36,630
See,


412
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,550
no girls will remain indifferent.


413
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,990
I like it, too.


414
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,590
This is it.


415
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:06,430
Welcome to


416
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,550
DR True Love Experience Center.


417
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,060
Sir,


418
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,310
how can I help?


419
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,069
Hi, I want to buy an engagement ring.


420
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,349
I browsed your official website.


421
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,190
It says only men can


422
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,349
buy rings,


423
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,670
and they can only customize one throughout the life,


424
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,190
right?


425
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,069
Yes. Sir.


426
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,310
A man can customize one DR ring


427
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,910
throughout his life


428
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,510
with his ID card.


429
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,349
The ring for the love of your life


430
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,710
means she is the only true love in your whole life.


431
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,700
I noticed a simple luxury


432
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,310
engagement ring online


433
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,750
in the


434
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,550
Love Line collection,


435
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,590
please show me.


436
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,350
OK. Sir.


437
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,150
Please wait.


438
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,710
Don't you think the way that


439
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,470
female sales assistant looked at you is strange?


440
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,590
Really?


441
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,990
Maybe I look too handsome.


442
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,190
What?


443
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,150
Is this news reliable?


444
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,270
Of course.


445
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,990
Yang Lanhang specially asked for leave


446
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,430
to buy a ring with him.


447
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,230
His brother seemed to go with them, too.


448
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,630
Anyway, there is only me,


449
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,430
Mr. Zhang, and that kid


450
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,790
in the lab today.


451
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,950
Then I should get prepared.


452
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,710
For what?


453
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,510
Of course for....


454
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,990
What else should I prepare for?


455
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,830
To refuse him.


456
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,710
I must look gorgeous


457
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,790
when I say no.


458
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,870
Otherwise, what if there is


459
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,310
no second chance?


460
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,110
Alright. I need to go.


461
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,950
Love you.


462
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,430
I'm getting married.


463
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,110
Sorry, Mr. Ouyang.


464
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,870
We can't sell the ring to you.


465
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:37,910
Why not?


466
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,830
Wait.


467
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,590
How did you know my family name?


468
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,020
Because you customized a ring


469
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,950
more than 15 days ago,


470
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:44,630
right?


471
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,230
You took it away this morning.


472
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,710
A man can only customize


473
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,390
one DR ring throughout his life.


474
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,910
According to the rules,


475
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,870
we can't sell you


476
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,830
another one.


477
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,430
When did I buy one?


478
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,510
Is it possible that it's Yinfan?


479
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,270
Take a look, was that him?


480
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,110
Isn't this you?


481
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,710
You seem to have something to say to me.


482
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,710
I changed my flight.


483
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,470
Go ahead.


484
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,030
Even at this time,


485
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,790
you still won't


486
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,230
say an extra word?


487
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,950
I've thought too much.


488
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,790
I love you.


489
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,430
I always thought


490
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,230
we were born to be lonely.


491
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,470
So I've never asked for


492
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,910
others' understanding


493
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,870
until your appearance.


494
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,470
You can understand


495
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,550
every glance of me.


496
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,390
You can catch every change


497
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,710
of my emotion.


498
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,390
The DR diamond ring


499
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,350
can only be ordered once in a man's lifetime.


500
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,390
It is bound to give his only love.


501
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,230
If you don't want,


502
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,270
I'll throw it.


503
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,830
Anyway, I know during this lifetime,


504
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,710
I won't meet a girl


505
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,870
like you anymore.


506
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,870
I've never heard


507
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,630
so many words from you.


508
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,790
I seem to be dreaming.


509
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,950
These matter more than


510
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,790
'I love you'.


511
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,710
If you like,


512
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,470
I can say more in the future.


513
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,310
This?


514
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,390
This is


515
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,350
what made me linger for another while.


516
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,310
My luggage has been checked.


517
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,270
Mine too.


518
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,790
I haven't thought about asking you to stay.


519
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,550
You used to follow me.


520
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,990
This time, it's my turn to follow your step.


521
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,070
Xiaoxiao,


522
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,710
peel an orange for you?


523
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,230
Listen to me. For this matter,


524
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,910
it's really not my fault.


525
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,150
Yang Lanhang told me that.


526
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,110
Tonight.


527
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,510
It must be tonight.


528
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,470
Because...


529
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,190
it's easy to have a romantic atmosphere at night.


530
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,950
They must be busy now.


531
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,950
I bet.


532
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,430
What about refining your make-up now?


533
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,270
No. No refining.


534
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,350
We don't need that.


535
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,150
I'll call Yang Lanhang


536
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,670
and make it clear.


537
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,310
Wait a minute.


538
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,430
So annoying.


539
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,710
Buddy,


540
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,070
what are you doing?


541
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,670
She has early put on makeup.


542
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,870
And she's been waiting for the proposal ever since noon.


543
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,190
What time is it now?


544
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,910
Come on.


545
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,710
It's nine o'clock.


546
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,470
Can't you


547
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,270
change a store to buy the ring?


548
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,430
Xiaoxiao,


549
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,510
this....


550
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:52,990
Xiaoxiao,


551
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,550
it's like this.


552
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,430
I've brought my ID card.


553
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,060
And household register as well.


554
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,870
Why can't these


555
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,830
show my identity?


556
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,150
Why don't you sell it to me?


557
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,590
Of course we can.


558
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,190
But....


559
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,710
I hate the 'but'.


560
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,110
Once in a lifetime.


561
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,790
I only want a diamond ring from your store.


562
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,390
Lady,


563
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,110
please sell this ring to me.


564
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,630
I'm going to make a proposal.


565
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,830
I can tell your determination.


566
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,390
But this one is a sample.


567
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,430
To make sure


568
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,750
that every diamond ring we sell


569
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,060
can bring perfectly beautiful memory


570
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,590
and unforgettable experience


571
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,910
to our customers,


572
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,670
you need to make an order


573
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,990
within 15 to 20 days


574
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,510
ahead of schedule.


575
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,430
But sir,


576
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,430
believe me,


577
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,950
it's worth the wait.


578
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,070
Alright.


579
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,670
I'll order now.


580
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,790
Is it okay to make an order now?


581
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,470
Okay.


582
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,510
But could you please be quicker?


583
00:27:59,510 --> 00:27:59,910
Okay.


584
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,390
Identity documents please.


585
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,350
Are you a pig?


586
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,430
You can't make a proposal


587
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,660
since you didn't get a ring?


588
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:23,870
I,


589
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,470
I....


590
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,430
Are, are you kidding me?


591
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:27,870
I,


592
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,110
Ouyang Yifan,


593
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,430
only date


594
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,710
but never step into the tomb of marriage.


595
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,950
What about being paired with me?


596
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,670
What do you mean?


597
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,630
I'm making a proposal.


598
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,710
Love is not a grand confession


599
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,230
or something like stars or moon.


600
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,750
Love is something about beginner's luck.


601
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,710
Sometimes


602
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,230
you will meet a guy


603
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,340
who feels the same as you.


604
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,270
But sometimes,


605
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,390
you are not that lucky.


606
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,670
But I believe


607
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,270
one day


608
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,110
you will encounter a guy


609
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,630
who really appreciates you.


610
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,460
With seven billion people


611
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,430
on Earth,


612
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,750
I know


613
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,950
there will be one


614
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,150
who is perfectly ready to


615
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,550
climb onto the moon for you.


616
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,110
Climb onto the moon for you.


617
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,470
There will be one


618
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,830
who is perfectly ready to


619
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,230
climb onto the moon for you.


620
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,030
Don't you play mahjong?


621
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,270
You're reading lines here.


622
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,470
You wanna be an actor?


623
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,150
You're thinly clad.


624
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,510
You heard it?


625
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,270
Climb onto the moon for you.


626
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,630
I need to prepare a program for the new year's party.


627
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,750
They asked me to recite something.


628
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,070
It's really outdated. Really.


629
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,510
I find myself a piece of


630
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,830
classical movie lines.


631
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,790
Okay. Okay.


632
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:30,470
You're so great.


633
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,390
Come on. Come on. Let's go.


634
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,190
Is it fashionable?


635
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,630
Yes. Yes. Let's go.


636
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,510
Where are we going?


637
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,510
Ouyang Yifan


638
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:35,990
finally got


639
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,270
his diamond ring.


640
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,830
He was going to make a fantastic proposal


641
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,230
that Xiaoxiao dreamed of


642
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,150
to make up for her.


643
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,420
But Xiaoxiao has said it.


644
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,510
It can't be a surprise anyway.


645
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,030
We might as well


646
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,390
have a party


647
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,310
to celebrate


648
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,190
the coming new year.


649
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,950
She specially asked me to pick you up.


650
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,350
Go.


651
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,750
He finally got the ring.


652
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,390
Congratulations to him. It's been a long way.


653
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,630
Hello?


654
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,950
We're going to start off.


655
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,740
Canceled?


656
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,790
You can't blame me.


657
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,590
Of course, you are more innocent.


658
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:14,910
Early in this morning,


659
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:15,430
it was reported that the epidemic


660
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,710
hit Wuhan.


661
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,070
So I totally agree


662
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,140
to cancel it.


663
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,630
Otherwise,


664
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:21,510
it must be dangerous


665
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,710
with so many people together.


666
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:23,630
Right?


667
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,790
Come on.


668
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,950
Don't be mad. Have something sweet


669
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,750
to nourish your skin and vitality.


670
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,470
You don't understand me


671
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,510
at all.


672
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,670
I'm not mad at the canceled proposal.


673
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,470
I got mad because you delayed


674
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,790
so much on buying a ring.


675
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,470
Or we might have early


676
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,620
finished the wedding ceremony.


677
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,470
Have something sweet.


678
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,230
Why are we eating sweet dumplings on an ordinary day?


679
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,550
Put it here. I'll eat by myself.


680
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:55,830
Why is the electricity off?


681
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,910
You should go check


682
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,270
if there's a blackout in the estate.


683
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,510
And I'll go check


684
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:00,870
the circuit.


685
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,350
Alright.


686
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,870
What are you doing?


687
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,989
Although we met a special case


688
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,630
and time was limited,


689
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,630
I know that you've been


690
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,030
eager for a proposal


691
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,110
witnessed by our friends.


692
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:24,710
So I invite all of you


693
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,670
to witness this.


694
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,150
Wow.


695
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,310
So romantic.


696
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,310
So thoughtful.


697
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,110
So thoughtful.


698
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,310
Guan Xiaoyu,


699
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:35,830
I love you.


700
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,469
Will you marry me?


701
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,949
Say yes.


702
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,270
-Say yes.
-Say yes.


703
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,590
-Say yes.
-Marry him.


704
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,070
-Marry him.
-Say yes.


705
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,230
-Say yes.
-Say yes.


706
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:53,030
-Say yes.
-Say yes.


707
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:55,710
-Say yes.
-Marry him.


708
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:58,390
-Say yes.
-Say yes.


709
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,790
Say yes.


710
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,910
Moustache!


711
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,230
Why are you here?


712
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,110
Buddy,


713
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,590
what kind of tyre do you want to change?


714
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:08,750
Sir,


715
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,910
do you have tyres


716
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,710
that are good at gripping the ground.


717
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,190
I mean, I want to drive on snow.


718
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:13,950
We do.


719
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:14,870
We have best


720
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:15,830
snow tyre.


721
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,190
What, buddy?


722
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,270
You are going to northeast China?


723
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,230
Return home for the new year?


724
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:20,830
Yes.


725
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,180
My wife comes from northeast China.


726
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,390
This is my first time to


727
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,470
pay a New Year call to my mother-in-law.


728
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,540
I have to make some preparation, right?


729
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,830
Okay, relax.


730
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,910
I'll take step for you.


731
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,270
Alright. Alright. Thanks.


732
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,070
I've checked the scheme. Pretty good.


733
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,550
We should attach great importance to disinfection.


734
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,070
Above all,


735
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,710
entrances, wash rooms and staircase


736
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,390
need someone specially assigned to take charge.


737
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,430
What's more,


738
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,510
I've discussed it


739
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,670
with the board of directors.


740
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,350
We should limit the customers from tomorrow.


741
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,750
Shut down the entrance in the north and east.


742
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,750
Set up electronic thermometers.


743
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,190
And meanwhile, make full preparation.


744
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,510
If necessary,


745
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,270
we will temporally shut down.


746
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,630
You've worked overtime


747
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,990
to design marketing schemes


748
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,270
for Spring Festival.


749
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,270
You did a good job.


750
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,630
But we have no other choices.


751
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,670
Whatever loss


752
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:19,470
is not a patch


753
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,220
on customers' safety.


754
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,390
Alright. Alright.


755
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,510
Stop here.


756
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,350
Communicate without delay


757
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,990
if you have any problem.


758
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,350
I'll see you home


759
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,590
after we picked up grandma.


760
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,990
I'm going to the hospital to check something.


761
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,390
What's wrong?


762
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,150
The clinical test is still in observation period.


763
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,510
Now that the epidemic is so serious,


764
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,710
I should take a look.


765
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,990
Then I'll


766
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,990
go with you.


767
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,150
Alright.


768
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,270
Actually,


769
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,510
there are not


770
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,110
many cases in our city.


771
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,270
I think as long as


772
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,790
the hospital quarantines


773
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,990
inpatient wards right,


774
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,110
there wouldn't be any problems.


775
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,110
Don't worry too much.


776
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:42,670
Qingyi,


777
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,230
you kid,


778
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,110
haven't you bought


779
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,470
the flight ticket home, have you?


780
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,670
Why are you still here?


781
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,790
I made a hasty decision


782
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,070
that I would not go back.


783
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,470
Why?


784
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,670
I'm going to spend


785
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,630
my autumn of Polkino


786
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,950
in the lab.


787
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,110
Autumn of Polkino?


788
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,550
Once,


789
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,870
when Pushkin went to Polkino to have some affairs,


790
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,190
he happened to meet an epidemic.


791
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,150
The village was locked.


792
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,470
And he was trapped there for three months.


793
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,430
But surprisingly, he was enlightened


794
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,430
and finished four plays,


795
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,910
more than 30 poems


796
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,710
and one and a half novels.


797
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,310
We called it the autumn of Polkino.


798
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:23,990
Anyway,


799
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,790
I will definitely


800
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,190
get rich inspiration


801
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,870
during this Spring Festival.


802
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,260
Maybe I would look totally different


803
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,950
when you meet me next time.


804
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,150
Qingyi,


805
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,470
what happened?


806
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,790
Are you okay?


807
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,110
Wuhan was locked.


808
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,020
I can't go back.


809
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,510
It's time for us


810
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,470
to think about


811
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,670
what we can do.


812
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,950
From the perspective of materials science,


813
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,270
maybe we can start from


814
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,190
medical protective


815
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,070
equipment.


816
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,150
I have something


817
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,230
to show you.


818
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,870
When I was a postgraduate,


819
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,830
I was studying metamaterial,


820
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,070
right?


821
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,590
It was reported these days that


822
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,230
medical supplies are quite short.


823
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,150
I am thinking


824
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,750
whether we can invent


825
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,670
a new material


826
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,230
for protection suits.


827
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,190
Not only should it


828
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,390
have good physical and mechanical properties


829
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,390
like being strongly resistant against breakage,


830
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,870
but I wish it is good at


831
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,470
exhaust of moisture.


832
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:48,580
It would be better


833
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,550
if it can be recycled.


834
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,230
In this way,


835
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:50,950
I think we can


836
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:51,940
solve the short supply


837
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,910
and something else


838
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:53,950
brought by consumption of


839
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,870
one-time protection suits


840
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,830
and production cycle


841
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,350
more efficiently.


842
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,630
What's more,


843
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,350
the cost of medical waste disposal


844
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,230
can be greatly cut.


845
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,030
Good job, Lingling.


846
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,540
You've prepared so much


847
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,790
for it.


848
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:10,630
Actually,


849
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,550
I think this idea


850
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,230
not mature enough.


851
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,990
So I didn't mean to tell you.


852
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,030
But


853
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,830
no one


854
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,470
expected that the epidemic is so sudden and serious.


855
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,470
Maybe we can


856
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,430
cooperate with


857
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,350
Huaihai University


858
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,710
to make further research on this.


859
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,510
Then we should start off now.


860
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,350
Come on.


861
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,430
Time waits for no one.


862
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,870
Don't you go home?


863
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,550
You were going to pay a visit to your mother-in-law, weren't you?


864
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,630
My wife has a clear estimation of righteousness.


865
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,870
She will understand me.


866
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,350
Then we should join you.


867
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,310
Why are you two back?


868
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,870
For experts on physics and dynamics,


869
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,870
I am the best person, right?


870
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,590
You're right anyway.


871
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,110
But we somehow miss the time


872
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,180
when you were silent.


873
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,190
The moment we knew the news,


874
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,830
we bought flight tickets home.


875
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,350
An accident happened at home.


876
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:02,790
Of course we should come back.


877
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,030
Yes.


878
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:05,950
Okay.


879
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,230
Now everyone is here.


880
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,950
Let's move out!
