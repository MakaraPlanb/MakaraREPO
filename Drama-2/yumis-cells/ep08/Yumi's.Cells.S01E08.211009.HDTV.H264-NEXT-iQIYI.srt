102
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:03,117
Is that him?

103
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:05,758
The one you dated for seven years
and broke up after cheating on you?

104
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:14,278
That's him, isn't he?

105
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,358
I knew it.

106
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:24,918
He said he was getting married.
He told me not to get hurt.

He was talking gibberish.

108

Before I realized what I was doing...

109
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:37,478

Hey. He's stylish.

114
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:02,518
He's way better than Ji Ugi.

115
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:04,838
You got a good one after dumping trash.

116
00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:08,398
Not that much.

117
00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:10,878
He was nice.

118
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:14,598

120
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:27,718

122
00:07:29,438 --> 00:07:33,718
[Kauai, Maui, Oahu and the Big Island.]

123
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:37,158

125
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:55,517
[No. I've never even been there.]

126
00:07:57,398 --> 00:07:59,958
[Then why did you say Hawaii?]

127
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:04,318
[I don't know. It just came out.]

128
00:08:04,398 --> 00:08:08,598

-That's a relief.
-That's a relief.

131
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:33,638
But it wasn't over completely.

132
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:36,038
There was a back blast.

133
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:37,758

By the way, Woong. Are you marrying Yu-mi?

138
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:03,038
-What?
-One of my friends

139
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:04,918
is Yu-mi's junior from university.

140
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:07,358
The rumor has already spread
amongst the alumni.

141
00:09:07,678 --> 00:09:09,318
That she's marrying you next year.

142
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:11,398
You already have it all planned out.

143
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,718
It's going to be a small wedding abroad.

144
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:17,118
-Is that true?
-Well...

145
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:18,838
What do you mean well?

146
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:20,758
Yes. Well, yes.

147
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:25,398
Come on. Is it true or not?

148
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:28,918
If it is, I totally approve.

149
00:09:30,358 --> 00:09:32,078
I won't say anything.

150
00:09:32,158 --> 00:09:34,558
What? You're making me curious.

151
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:36,758
Ask Yu-mi yourself.

152
00:09:36,838 --> 00:09:39,278
Look at you. You are not denying it.

153
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:41,358
I said I won't say anything.

154
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:45,798
Have you been to Hawaii before?

155
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:48,718
There are four major islands in Hawaii.

156
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:50,678
You're serious.

157

[Daehan Noodles]

158
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:57,838
[Congratulations, Yu-mi.
I heard you're getting married.]

00:09:57,918 --> 00:09:59,438
[Yu-mi. Congratulations.]

160
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:02,238
[Everyone says your boyfriend is so hot.]

161
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:05,238
[I heard you're getting married in Hawaii.
I'm so jealous.]

162
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:07,118
[Guys.]

163
00:10:07,598 --> 00:10:09,918
[There must be a misunderstanding.]

164
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:12,843
[I don't know when it's going to be.]

165
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:15,883
[I heard it's next spring.]

166
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:16,998
[No.]

167
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:21,358
[I said maybe.]

168
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:27,558
[It's not confirmed yet.]

169
00:10:28,118 --> 00:10:31,318
[Yu-mi. Are you getting married? Amazing.]

170
00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:33,758
This is killing me.

171
00:10:41,238 --> 00:10:42,238
Yu-mi?

172
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:43,558
Yes, Ugi.

173
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:47,438
Can I ask you a question?

174
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:51,518
I heard the rumor...

175
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,798
-that you're...
-I'm not getting married.

176
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:55,238
That's a false rumor.

177
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:57,478
What marriage? We just started dating.

178
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:58,998
Don't you think it's a ridiculous rumor?

179
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:01,198
I don't know who spread such rumor.

180
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:05,438
I know.

181
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:07,278
What?

182
00:11:08,838 --> 00:11:11,638
False news is getting out of control.

183
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:14,918
What a scary world, right?

184
00:11:18,638 --> 00:11:21,918
[This incident traumatized Yu-mi.]

185
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:36,198
It's Louis.

186
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:38,158
Hello.

187
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:39,998
What are you doing here?

188
00:11:40,558 --> 00:11:41,558
Hello.

189
00:11:41,638 --> 00:11:43,798
This is good.
We were going to get you one too.

190
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:45,798
-Do you want it now?
-Yes, well...

191
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:47,078
Are you two getting married?

192
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:52,798
What took you so long?

193
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,878
I heard you're getting married
next spring.

194
00:11:55,478 --> 00:11:56,918
That's so yesterday.

195
00:11:56,998 --> 00:11:58,198
I just heard it.

196
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:00,278
I heard it

197
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:03,118
while pooping in the restroom.

198
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:04,478
You traitor.

199
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,278
I'll go buy a sandwich.

200
00:12:07,638 --> 00:12:09,598
Louis. I'll get you the same one as mine.

201
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:10,998
It's really good.

202
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:16,838
Who said that?

203
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:20,918
Are you ready to order?

204
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:22,598
Yes.

205
00:12:23,238 --> 00:12:26,678
[Marriage became a taboo word
between them.]

206
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:30,718
[The back blast also hit the cell town.]

207
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:33,598
Now, I will pass judgement

208
00:12:33,678 --> 00:12:35,118
on Hong Na-ri Wedding incident.

209
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:36,838
Defendant, Emotion cell.

210
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:39,118
By using Reaction Number One

211
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:41,438
without other cells' consent,

212
00:12:41,518 --> 00:12:43,398
you turned Yu-mi into a liar

213
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:46,158
and made her lose reliability greatly.

214
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:49,118
You committed a very dangerous act

215
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:51,238
that could have ended her relationship
with Woong.

216
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:52,998
I find Emotion cell guilty.

217
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:56,678
No wonder.

218
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:57,478
[Defendant]

219
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:06,278
[Reaction Number One is banned
for use indefinitely.]

220
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:11,918
[Emotion cell was locked
in the solitary confinement for a month.]

221
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:13,478
Emotion.

222
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:14,718
Reason.

223
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:17,358
Isn't it tough?

224
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:19,518
I can bear it.

225
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:21,878
So why did you do that?

226
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,198
I stopped you.

227
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:25,998
It's okay. I don't regret it.

228
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:27,598
-What?
-Through that,

229
00:13:27,678 --> 00:13:29,398
I got confidence in Woong.

230
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:32,118
Reason. Will you deliver this?

231
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:38,078
Put this up.

232
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:40,638
Bulletin board cell. Can you put this up?

233
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:43,478
Keep up the good work.

234
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:44,918
Okay.

235
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:47,038
What's this?

236
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:48,638
Again?

237
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:49,398
[I want to marry Woong, from Emotion cell]

238
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:52,998
I'm getting so many
of the same message lately.

239
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:54,238
[Is Woong thinking of getting married?
From Love cell]

240
00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:56,478
[I had a dream of marrying Woong,
from Dream cell]

241
00:13:56,558 --> 00:13:58,598
[Let's wear a wedding dress!
From Diet cell]

242
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:05,918
Wait. What is that?

243
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:07,198
I wonder.

244
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:16,718
[Marriage desire]

245
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:20,958
So what happened?

246
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:22,238
What do you mean?

247
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:24,638
Did Yu-mi and Woong get married

248
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:26,278
in Hawaii?

249
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:28,398
If you want to know,

250
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:31,478
you should read the 33rd edition
of Yu-mi Encyclopedia.

251
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:35,518
I already saw the wedding photo.

252
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:36,798
Really? Who was it?

253
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:38,358
It is...

254
00:14:38,438 --> 00:14:40,758
Everyone. The incident

255
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,718
didn't end there.

256
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:45,158
That became the root

257
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:48,118
of two major incidents in Yu-mi's life.

258
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:50,198
Your drinks are ready.

259
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:52,158
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

260
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,918
Woong. I'm going to start

261
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:09,038
-exercising tomorrow.
-Exercise?

262
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:11,238
I said I'm participating
in the half-marathon.

263
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:14,478
I have to start getting into shape.

264
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:18,758
This sweet is my last feast.

265
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:20,478
I have to watch my diet starting tomorrow.

266
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,278
So I might not be able to
meet you as often.

267
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:24,398
Because I have to run.

268
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:27,358
Don't be disappointed though.

269
00:15:29,038 --> 00:15:30,518
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

270
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:31,798
No.

271
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:34,398
[For the impression of a cool girlfriend]

272
00:15:34,478 --> 00:15:36,558
[who doesn't care about marriage,]

273
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:43,358
[she started practicing for the marathon.]

274
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:51,198
[Si-hyeon. Do you see him now?]

275
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:52,438
[My boyfriend.]

276
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,558
[I got the bouquet.]

277
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:57,598
[Congratulations, Na-ri.
I wish you happiness.]

278
00:15:57,678 --> 00:16:00,878
[I'll dry it nicely
and give it back to you.]

279
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,118
[Another one is...]

280
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:11,918
[Sae-yi finally realized
what her heart wants.]

281
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,003
[I will never get married.]

282
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:20,318
[But if I ever get married one day,]

283
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,598
[it would be with Woong.]

284
00:16:31,598 --> 00:16:33,918
[Woong. I just got here.]

285
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:41,317
Yu-mi. Did you get there already?

286
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:43,158
[The bus came early.]

287
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:44,918
I'm leaving now.

288
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:47,398
Just give me 15 minutes.

289
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:49,718
[-Take your time.]
-Okay. I'll be there soon.

290
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,598
[Woong. Are you home right now?]

291
00:16:56,678 --> 00:16:59,198
[Yes.]

292
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:00,998
[I need to ask you a favor.]

293
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:03,558
[What is it?]

294
00:17:03,638 --> 00:17:06,358
[Can I borrow a hammer?]

295
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:09,478
[A hammer?]

296
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:15,078
[I need to drive many nails,
but I don't have a hammer at home.]

297
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:16,958
[Just get one from a store.]

298
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,603
[I need one right now. Can I stop by?]

299
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:21,718
What's she talking about?

300
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:25,358
[You're coming to my house?]

301
00:17:25,438 --> 00:17:27,118
[Yes.]

302
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:29,523
[I'm going out now.]

303
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:30,598
[I'll be right there.]

304
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:32,918
What? Be right there?

305
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:35,638
Her house is so far from here.

306
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:38,518
She always has it her way.

307
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:43,158
Who is it?

308
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:45,118
Woong. It's me.

309
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:46,878
Who?

310
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:48,558
It's me, Sae-yi.

311
00:17:58,718 --> 00:17:59,718
The hammer.

312
00:18:01,198 --> 00:18:03,558
What are you doing here?
You said you were home.

313
00:18:04,198 --> 00:18:06,398
-How did you...
-I moved yesterday.

314
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:08,678
-What?
-I guess you didn't know

315
00:18:08,758 --> 00:18:10,798
because you were visiting
your parents for a few days.

316
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:12,318
Louis knows.

317
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:14,958
What are you talking about?

318
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:17,598
I moved to the fifth floor here. Room 503.

319
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,358
I thought you knew.

320
00:18:20,638 --> 00:18:22,398
No wonder why.

321
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:25,038
I was disappointed because you didn't
give me any calls after I moved.

322
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:27,838
Nice to meet you, neighbor.

323
00:18:29,438 --> 00:18:30,478
Can I borrow your hammer?

324
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:38,518
Every time I work overtime,
I had to take a cab.

325
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:41,278
It cost too much and I was too tired.

326
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:44,598
Mom said I should get a place
of my own too.

327
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:47,318
I asked you a few months ago

328
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:49,198
about the building you live in.

329
00:18:49,278 --> 00:18:51,758
I don't think I ever said
it's nice to live here.

330
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:54,398
But no location was better than this.

331
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:55,838
It's closer to work,

332
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:57,598
and it's new and clean.

333
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:02,158
You should come for dinner sometime.

334
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,518
-Dinner?
-I always cook for myself.

335
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:09,678
Don't get deliveries.
Come to my house when you're hungry.

336
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:11,638
I just need to put one more set
of chopsticks.

337
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:21,918
Here.

338
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:26,198
Can I give it back to you tomorrow?
I have many nails to drive in.

339
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:27,438
Suit yourself.

340
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:28,838
Oh, right.

341
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:30,318
Are you busy right now?

342
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:32,238
I have a plan.

343
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:34,838
Can you drive just one nail in?

344
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,558
I have to put the clock up,
but it's too high.

345
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:41,358
No?

346
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,238
Can you do it for me please?

347
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:55,798
Woong.

348
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:59,678
Sorry I took so long.

349
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:02,998
You said it will only be 15 minutes,
but you took 30 minutes.

350
00:20:03,398 --> 00:20:06,478
Actually...

351
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:07,558
What?

352
00:20:08,638 --> 00:20:11,118
Yu-mi. You see...

353
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:12,198
What?

354
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:15,478
What is it?

355
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:18,398
Nothing.

356
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:20,278
What do you mean nothing?

357
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:23,718
It's nothing. Let's go.
We're going to be late.

358
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,718
What is it?

359
00:20:31,318 --> 00:20:33,998
[So, the Hong Na-ri Wedding incident]

360
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:37,478
led to other important events

361
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:40,558
after Sae-yi awakens
and Yu-mi starts the marathon.

362
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:45,598
Ma'am. What about
Yu-mi's marathon practice?

363
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,118
Why is that important?

364
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:49,238
Oh, about that...

365
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:58,905
[Episode 22: Yu-mi Patrol]

366
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:05,425
What? Is it getting cold already?

367
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:37,545
Gosh. I'm tired.

368
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:47,025
[Good morning. Are you up?]

369
00:22:01,545 --> 00:22:02,545
[Of course.]

370
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,630
[I'm in the park right now.]

371
00:22:05,705 --> 00:22:06,745
The park?

372
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,311
[At this hour?]

373
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:16,705
[I said I'm practicing the half-marathon
starting today.]

374
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:18,470
[I said I'm practicing the half-marathon
starting today.]

375
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,865
[Oh, that's right.]

376
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:27,065
[You're not paying attention
to your girlfriend.]

377
00:22:27,865 --> 00:22:28,310
[You're not paying attention
to your girlfriend.]

378
00:22:28,385 --> 00:22:29,625
[What do you mean?]

379
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:32,425
[What do you mean?
I know what your favorite ING is.]

380
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,905
[What is it?]

381
00:22:36,145 --> 00:22:39,665
[What is it?]

382
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:42,465
[Exercising.]

383
00:22:43,385 --> 00:22:44,465
What?

384
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:51,465
[I know what yours is.]

385
00:22:51,945 --> 00:22:52,945
[What?]

386
00:22:53,678 --> 00:22:57,665
[What is it?]

387
00:22:58,705 --> 00:22:59,625
[Dating.]

388
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:02,665
[Correct.]

389
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:08,025
Excuse me.

390
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:10,185
Pardon?

391
00:23:10,865 --> 00:23:12,985
Which way is the exit?

392
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,985
The exit is that way.

393
00:23:17,065 --> 00:23:18,785
Thank you.

394
00:23:25,865 --> 00:23:29,505
[Sorry. Someone just asked me
for direction.]

395
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:31,225
[A man?]

396
00:23:31,505 --> 00:23:32,545
[A man?]

397
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:36,145
[Are you jealous?]

398
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:39,305
[A young man?]

399
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:42,665
[I don't know. I don't remember.]

400
00:23:43,665 --> 00:23:45,025
So handsome.

401
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:47,545
-He's so good-looking.
-He's so hot.

402
00:23:47,905 --> 00:23:49,465
He's so handsome.

403
00:23:49,545 --> 00:23:51,185
-He's really handsome.
-He's hot.

404
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:54,545
[I had lunch in a new curry restaurant.]

405
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:56,625
[A good restaurant near work.
To my likings.]

406
00:23:56,705 --> 00:23:58,825
[A good curry restaurant. Curry rice.]

407
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:01,265
Girls. Did you see that?

408
00:24:01,345 --> 00:24:03,265
-Yes.
-See what?

409
00:24:03,385 --> 00:24:05,465
The server when we were having curry.

410
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:07,945
The cutie in the curry restaurant.
He's so handsome.

411
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:10,185
Right? Handsome enough
to go there again tomorrow.

412
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:12,425
Yes, he was so hot.

413
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:14,345
What do you mean? Who?

414
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:17,065
The server in the curry restaurant
who brought us food.

415
00:24:17,425 --> 00:24:18,905
The server in the curry restaurant?

416
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:24,665
That looks good.

417
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:30,825
Who ordered deep fried shrimp curry?

418
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:31,945
That's me.

419
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,865
I'll take a picture.

420
00:24:34,225 --> 00:24:35,265
That's me.

421
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,865
Anything else you need?

422
00:24:40,185 --> 00:24:42,265
-We're good.
-Thank you.

423
00:24:42,345 --> 00:24:44,785
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

424
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:49,465
-Thank you.
-Let's eat.

425
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:51,025
It looks so good.

426
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:55,265
Right. I think it was a young man.

427
00:24:55,385 --> 00:24:56,945
What? Didn't you see him?

428
00:24:57,665 --> 00:24:58,905
I can't remember his face.

429
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:03,665
Yu-mi. How can you not remember his face?
It was legendary.

430
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:05,145
I was busy taking a picture.

431
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:07,105
If he was that handsome,
you should've told me.

432
00:25:07,185 --> 00:25:08,745
He came by many times.

433
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:10,625
He got us water and side dishes.

434
00:25:10,705 --> 00:25:13,545
Did he? Why didn't I notice?

435
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:16,145
I guess I was busy eating.

436
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:19,665
I was so hungry because I had
marathon practice in the morning.

437
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:21,865
[No.]

438
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:24,265
[It's not that she was busy eating.]

439
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,345
[It's because the male reconnaissance
squad isn't working lately.]

440
00:25:29,345 --> 00:25:31,505
[They always keep eyes forward]

441
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:33,745
[for a decent man.]

442
00:25:35,905 --> 00:25:38,385
Yu-mi's type found at 5 o' clock.

443
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:40,065
-Where?
-Where?

444
00:25:40,425 --> 00:25:42,665
[Yu-mi. Turn your head to 5 o' clock.]

445
00:25:54,705 --> 00:25:57,025
Yeonnam-dong please.

446
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:59,625
[Yu-mi. To your right.
On the right side view mirror.]

447
00:26:04,545 --> 00:26:07,345
[Their main job is to find Yu-mi's type.]

448
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:15,065
Now that Yu-mi's got a boyfriend,
we'll go take a break.

449
00:26:15,145 --> 00:26:17,185
She wouldn't need us for a while.

450
00:26:17,265 --> 00:26:19,705
Sure. When do you plan to return?

451
00:26:20,185 --> 00:26:21,785
When Yu-mi's lonely again.

452
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:23,305
-Have a good time.
-Have a good time.

453
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:24,585
-Aloha.
-Aloha.

454
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,625
Woong.

455
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:43,865
Yu-mi.

456
00:26:43,945 --> 00:26:44,945
You're early.

457
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,745
Yu-mi!

458
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:54,905
-Are you okay?
-It hurts.

459
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:56,145
Let me see.

460
00:27:05,185 --> 00:27:06,745
You fall often.

461
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:08,985
You should be more careful.

462
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:13,905
What's wrong?

463
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:15,665
Does it still hurt?

464
00:27:17,145 --> 00:27:19,785
Woong. Do you want fried chicken?

465
00:27:21,505 --> 00:27:23,585
No, is pizza better?

466
00:27:24,545 --> 00:27:27,905
No, let's get fried chicken.
I know a real good place nearby.

467
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:32,105
No, wait a minute. Pizza?

468
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:34,465
Let's get both.

469
00:27:36,305 --> 00:27:37,345
Woong.

470
00:27:37,745 --> 00:27:38,825
What is it again?

471
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,665
My heart just fluttered.

472
00:27:42,785 --> 00:27:45,305
Then let's have
both fried chicken and pizza.

473
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:51,705
Did you order something?

474
00:27:52,465 --> 00:27:53,665
I think it's the package.

475
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:55,465
Package?

476
00:27:58,905 --> 00:28:00,705
It's matching shirts.

477
00:28:01,025 --> 00:28:03,065
Yes, I bought them
while looking for sweatsuits.

478
00:28:03,145 --> 00:28:04,825
I thought we can wear them
and exercise together.

479
00:28:09,465 --> 00:28:10,825
Yellow is mine.

480
00:28:17,505 --> 00:28:18,745
Blue is yours.

481
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:20,785
Let me see.

482
00:28:22,145 --> 00:28:23,825
-It's cute.
-I know, right?

483
00:28:25,145 --> 00:28:26,225
You should try it on.

484
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:27,825
-Now?
-Yes.

485
00:28:27,905 --> 00:28:29,185
To see if it fits.

486
00:28:29,265 --> 00:28:30,785
If it doesn't, I should return it.

487
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:31,945
Sure.

488
00:28:47,985 --> 00:28:50,545
You have a mole on your back.

489
00:28:51,185 --> 00:28:53,625
On my back?
I don't have a mole on my back.

490
00:28:53,705 --> 00:28:55,545
You do. Right here.

491
00:28:56,265 --> 00:28:57,305
Where?

492
00:28:59,665 --> 00:29:00,745
Here.

493
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:08,465
Yes. Who is it?

494
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:11,785
Who was that?

495
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:17,905
It's right here. The mole.

496
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,225
-Fried chicken...
-What?

497
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:24,625
Can you order it later?

498
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,385
Should I order pizza first?

499
00:29:28,585 --> 00:29:29,625
No.

500
00:29:50,785 --> 00:29:51,985
Enjoy exercising.

501
00:30:19,225 --> 00:30:20,065
[Let's go.]

502
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:25,345
[The reconnaissance squad's long vacation
won't end anytime soon.]

503
00:30:26,065 --> 00:30:27,625
[-Meanwhile in the village,]
-Let's go!

504
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:29,665
[Yu-mi's Guard is back.]

505
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,065
Excuse me.

506
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:50,105
-What? Who's this punk?
-Who is he?

507
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:56,545
Me?

508
00:30:56,985 --> 00:30:59,105
Yes. Aren't you

509
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:01,745
Kim Yu-mi?

510
00:31:02,865 --> 00:31:04,625
Who is he? Do you know who this guy is?

511
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:06,345
-No.
-You don't know him?

512
00:31:08,265 --> 00:31:10,785
If a guy she doesn't know stopped her
and said, "Excuse me,"

513
00:31:10,865 --> 00:31:12,385
I must step in.

514
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:16,585
This is an order.
Lock the Gates of the Heart at once.

515
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:18,665
All cells, be on red alert!

516
00:31:24,345 --> 00:31:25,585
-On red alert!
-On red alert!

517
00:31:26,905 --> 00:31:28,785
Who knows? He may ask her for her number--

518
00:31:28,865 --> 00:31:31,425
-What? What is it?
-Guard! Wait!

519
00:31:34,265 --> 00:31:35,505
Calm down.

520
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:38,465
First, let's see if he's on the list
of the men she knows.

521
00:31:38,545 --> 00:31:40,985
It's rude if she doesn't recognize
someone she knows.

522
00:31:41,345 --> 00:31:43,625
Right, that would be awkward too.

523
00:31:46,345 --> 00:31:48,985
Hold on. Does Yu-mi know this many guys?

524
00:31:49,945 --> 00:31:51,785
No, this isn't it.

525
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,665
Here's the list.

526
00:31:56,585 --> 00:32:00,505
[Who?]

527
00:32:01,025 --> 00:32:03,025
[He's not here. He's a new face.]

528
00:32:03,105 --> 00:32:04,385
[He's not on the list.]

529
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:07,825
How do you know my name?

530
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:09,865
You're Assistant Manager Kim Yu-mi, right?

531
00:32:10,585 --> 00:32:12,945
Hello,
I'm Assistant Marketing Manager Yoo Bobby.

532
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:15,425
I see.

533
00:32:15,945 --> 00:32:17,225
Hello.

534
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:20,465
I thought you looked so familiar
every time I saw you, and I was right.

535
00:32:21,345 --> 00:32:23,745
The other day, I asked you for directions.

536
00:32:25,865 --> 00:32:26,945
Well...

537
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:29,745
Did you?

538
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:31,345
Yes.

539
00:32:32,345 --> 00:32:35,985
Anyway, it's nice to have a co-worker
who lives in my neighborhood.

540
00:32:36,185 --> 00:32:37,825
Right, yes.

541
00:32:41,345 --> 00:32:43,705
Then I'll see you around.

542
00:32:43,785 --> 00:32:45,505
Okay, see you.

00:44:05,178 --> 00:44:06,338
Right?

721
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:11,138
On weekends,
it's nicer here in the morning.

722
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:12,538
It's usually crowded during the day.

723
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:14,858
On weekends,
I'm always here in the morning.

724
00:44:16,778 --> 00:44:17,858
I see.

725
00:44:18,818 --> 00:44:21,298
Yes, the perfect autumn sky.

726
00:44:24,898 --> 00:44:26,298
Your hair looks different today.

727
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,018
It looks so pretty.

728
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:37,258
[-Thank you.]
-I think he just wants to be her friend.

729
00:44:37,338 --> 00:44:40,618
I agree.
Now, it doesn't look weird at all.

730
00:44:40,738 --> 00:44:42,218
-Wait!
-What?

731
00:44:42,298 --> 00:44:45,098
Then Sae-yi didn't do
anything wrong either.

732
00:44:45,178 --> 00:44:46,778
This is okay, when that isn't?

733
00:44:48,498 --> 00:44:50,098
Woong, this is for you.

734
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:51,858
It's yuzu tea.

735
00:44:53,178 --> 00:44:54,418
Oh, thanks.

736
00:44:55,178 --> 00:44:56,578
I made it myself.

737
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:57,898
You have a cold, right?

738
00:44:58,178 --> 00:45:00,018
Take it home
and drink it every morning and evening.

739
00:45:00,378 --> 00:45:01,418
You have to, okay?

740
00:45:05,258 --> 00:45:08,538
Woong, let's get this for Yu-mi.

741
00:45:10,698 --> 00:45:11,938
This will look cute on her.

742
00:45:15,218 --> 00:45:16,218
You think so?

743
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:18,378
Oh, no.

744
00:45:23,258 --> 00:45:24,418
You had something on your shirt.

745
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:28,058
-Come on.
-You were wrong.

746
00:45:28,138 --> 00:45:30,578
-That's wrong!
-That's wrong!

747
00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:35,258
Woong.

748
00:45:35,898 --> 00:45:38,618
Am I old-fashioned?

749
00:45:38,898 --> 00:45:39,978
Yes.

750
00:45:40,418 --> 00:45:42,698
Hey, I want a serious answer.

751
00:45:42,978 --> 00:45:44,058
You want me to be serious?

752
00:45:45,378 --> 00:45:46,418
Yes.

753
00:45:46,738 --> 00:45:47,738
My gosh.

754
00:45:49,258 --> 00:45:50,538
Anyway, why do you ask?

755
00:45:51,258 --> 00:45:54,418
I was just wondering
if I was too old-fashioned

756
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,378
when it comes to male-female friendships.

757
00:45:56,618 --> 00:45:58,858
You know, girls having male friends
and vice versa.

758
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:01,138
Well, I'm not sure.

759
00:46:01,698 --> 00:46:04,098
But I'd say you're very cautious.

760
00:46:05,538 --> 00:46:06,578
Really?

761
00:46:07,778 --> 00:46:09,378
Am I weird?

762
00:46:11,138 --> 00:46:12,698
Do you have to work late again today?

763
00:46:13,298 --> 00:46:16,578
[Yes. Looks like I'll be working late
every day until the end of the month.]

764
00:46:21,098 --> 00:46:23,418
Then I'll be alone again this weekend.

765
00:46:24,378 --> 00:46:25,978
[Just like last weekend.]

766
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:29,458
I'm sorry. I'll finish it this month
no matter what.

767
00:46:30,658 --> 00:46:33,778
Okay. Don't work too hard.

768
00:46:34,138 --> 00:46:35,178
You can do it.

769
00:46:35,258 --> 00:46:36,298
I can do it!

770
00:46:47,218 --> 00:46:49,018
What should I do today?

771
00:46:54,138 --> 00:46:55,578
Cabbage.

772
00:46:58,298 --> 00:47:01,338
Right, I'm out of sugar.

773
00:47:06,818 --> 00:47:08,218
No exercise today?

774
00:47:15,418 --> 00:47:17,578
What are you doing here?

775
00:47:17,778 --> 00:47:19,858
What do you think?
I'm here to get groceries, obviously.

776
00:47:21,378 --> 00:47:24,618
Looks like
we go to the same places, right?

777
00:47:26,698 --> 00:47:27,978
You think so?

778
00:47:30,738 --> 00:47:32,738
I guess
you're planning to make fish cutlets.

779
00:47:33,298 --> 00:47:35,458
Yes. My girlfriend is coming over later.

780
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:38,058
She loves fish cutlets.

781
00:47:38,938 --> 00:47:40,018
I see.

782
00:47:40,338 --> 00:47:42,818
Do you happen to know
where I can find tartar sauce?

783
00:47:42,898 --> 00:47:44,218
Tartar sauce?

784
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:48,538
You're going to buy it?

785
00:47:49,018 --> 00:47:50,978
It tastes way better
when you make it yourself.

786
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:52,898
Isn't it hard to make?

787
00:47:53,138 --> 00:47:55,738
Not at all.
Do you have mayonnaise at home?

788
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:57,458
Yes.

789
00:47:57,738 --> 00:48:00,818
Mix it with chopped onion and pickles.

790
00:48:00,898 --> 00:48:02,658
They must be finely chopped.

791
00:48:02,738 --> 00:48:04,378
Finely chop onion and pickles.

792
00:48:04,538 --> 00:48:08,458
Yes. After that, add a boiled egg
to that mixture.

793
00:48:08,938 --> 00:48:10,298
Rub the yolk through a sieve.

794
00:48:10,378 --> 00:48:12,018
Wait, hold on. You're going too fast.

795
00:48:14,938 --> 00:48:16,018
Is this right?

796
00:48:16,618 --> 00:48:18,378
Yes. After that,

797
00:48:18,858 --> 00:48:20,618
mix it with a hard-boiled egg.

798
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:22,098
Mix them together.

799
00:48:22,178 --> 00:48:23,698
Yes. Rub the yolk through a sieve.

800
00:48:23,778 --> 00:48:26,258
Rub the yolk through a sieve.

801
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:31,378
Emotion. Now, I'm thinking

802
00:48:31,898 --> 00:48:35,858
maybe it's possible for men and women
to be just friends.

803
00:48:36,378 --> 00:48:38,938
Then are you saying
we should accept Sae-yi?

804
00:48:39,098 --> 00:48:40,378
We should accept her too,

805
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:42,378
if we're accepting Yu-mi's guy friend.

806
00:48:42,938 --> 00:48:44,178
I can't.

807
00:48:44,298 --> 00:48:46,858
I'm not a fan of the idea
that men and women can be friends.

808
00:48:49,578 --> 00:48:52,538
What was the other thing you said?
Lemon juice?

809
00:48:52,618 --> 00:48:54,658
Yes, one tablespoon of lemon juice.

810
00:48:59,618 --> 00:49:01,498
Again... I'm sorry.

811
00:49:02,258 --> 00:49:03,898
-I have to make a quick phone call.
-Sure.

812
00:49:07,498 --> 00:49:08,538
Hey, it's me.

813
00:49:12,258 --> 00:49:13,378
Then you can't come over today?

814
00:49:15,378 --> 00:49:17,538
What do you think?
I'm out grocery shopping now.

815
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:21,378
Then why did you...

816
00:49:25,938 --> 00:49:28,538
Never mind.
I'll cook for you another time.

817
00:49:30,618 --> 00:49:32,618
It's okay. You must be busy,
so just get back to work.

818
00:49:34,498 --> 00:49:35,498
All right.

819
00:49:38,258 --> 00:49:39,538
She can't make it.

820
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:44,498
I see. Your girlfriend must be very busy.

821
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:46,298
I am in a relationship,

822
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:49,178
but I'm even more bored
than when I was single.

823
00:50:07,818 --> 00:50:09,298
Then I'll see you at work.

824
00:50:09,978 --> 00:50:11,058
Enjoy your dinner.

825
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:12,458
You too. Bye.

826
00:50:19,258 --> 00:50:22,258
[I know what it's like.]

827
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,138
[Feeling lonely from time to time]

828
00:50:35,218 --> 00:50:37,138
[although you are in a relationship.]

829
00:50:41,658 --> 00:50:43,578
I guess he's really busy.

830
00:50:50,978 --> 00:50:52,418
This looks great.

831
00:51:00,618 --> 00:51:01,818
It's delicious.

832
00:51:02,378 --> 00:51:03,498
It's so good.

833
00:51:22,298 --> 00:51:24,018
I miss Woong.

834
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,538
[Yu-mi, are you asleep?]

835
00:51:35,978 --> 00:51:36,823
[Yu-mi, are you asleep?]

836
00:51:36,898 --> 00:51:39,858
[No, not yet.]

837
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:41,578
[I'm heading home now.]

838
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,818
[You finished earlier than I thought.]

839
00:51:46,338 --> 00:51:48,058
[Yes. What did you do today?]

840
00:51:51,738 --> 00:51:54,458
[I made myself some tteokbokki at home]

841
00:51:54,538 --> 00:51:55,938
[and cleaned...]

842
00:51:57,978 --> 00:51:59,098
[Guys.]

843
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,498
Why don't we surprise Woong?

844
00:52:05,578 --> 00:52:06,698
-What?
-How?

845
00:52:10,498 --> 00:52:13,658
[He'd never even think
that Yu-mi would come over now.]

846
00:52:13,738 --> 00:52:16,058
Good idea.
I like surprise events like this.

847
00:52:16,138 --> 00:52:19,818
Let's go to his place
and have some late-night snacks with him.

848
00:52:20,778 --> 00:52:22,258
Let's tell him she's going to bed now

849
00:52:22,338 --> 00:52:23,818
so we can surprise him.

850
00:52:25,738 --> 00:52:28,298
[You must be tired. Go to bed soon.]

851
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:29,858
[I should go to bed too.]

852
00:52:31,378 --> 00:52:32,738
[Okay, sweet dreams.]

853
00:52:34,898 --> 00:52:36,458
[Have a dream about me.]

854
00:52:36,978 --> 00:52:39,098
[Have a dream about me.]

855
00:52:39,178 --> 00:52:42,098
[Okay, I'll try.]

856
00:52:47,258 --> 00:52:49,138
If she shows up now,
he'll be so surprised.

857
00:52:49,218 --> 00:52:51,058
Guys, let's go see Woong!

858
00:52:51,138 --> 00:52:52,778
-Let's go!
-We'll see Woong!

859
00:52:52,858 --> 00:52:53,978
-Let's go!
-Gosh.

860
00:52:54,818 --> 00:52:57,138
She's going out again
when she's already washed up?

861
00:52:57,218 --> 00:53:00,658
And I wanted her
to put on a sheet mask now!

862
00:53:00,738 --> 00:53:03,098
Don't worry. We'll take two

863
00:53:03,178 --> 00:53:04,618
so they can do it together.

864
00:53:04,698 --> 00:53:06,578
-You're a genius.
-You rock!

865
00:53:13,218 --> 00:53:14,338
I should do this with him.

866
00:53:14,898 --> 00:53:16,698
Woong's skin has been looking
dry and dull.

867
00:53:18,498 --> 00:53:21,858
-Nice! Off to Woong's with sheet masks!
-Nice! Off to Woong's with sheet masks!

868
00:53:22,298 --> 00:53:24,258
-Wait!
-What?

869
00:53:24,338 --> 00:53:26,938
Tomorrow's Monday.
What is she going to wear to work?

870
00:53:28,298 --> 00:53:31,298
Don't tell me she'll wear
what she's wearing now.

871
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:32,538
Don't you worry.

872
00:53:32,618 --> 00:53:34,858
She can take some clothes with her.

873
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,578
-That's right.
-I see!

874
00:53:38,258 --> 00:53:40,178
I should also take some clothes
for tomorrow.

875
00:53:57,618 --> 00:53:59,818
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

876
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:02,938
Thank you.

877
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,978
[Woong will be so surprised.]

878
00:54:13,658 --> 00:54:15,178
[What should we do to tease him?]

879
00:54:15,258 --> 00:54:17,218
[Should we ring the doorbell and hide?]

880
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:29,818
[How about we text him
right in front of his door?]

881
00:54:40,218 --> 00:54:42,058
[I can't wait to see
the look on Woong's face.]

882
00:54:42,418 --> 00:54:44,458
[I want to see Woong now!]

883
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:49,018
[Fifth floor.]

884
00:54:56,018 --> 00:54:57,058
My gosh.

885
00:54:57,578 --> 00:54:58,578
What?

886
00:54:58,738 --> 00:55:00,178
-What?
-What?

887
00:55:00,258 --> 00:55:01,978
It's Sae-yi!

888
00:55:05,178 --> 00:55:06,298
Yu-mi.

889
00:55:07,098 --> 00:55:08,178
Hello.

890
00:55:10,338 --> 00:55:11,698
Sae-yi.

891
00:55:17,578 --> 00:55:20,218
Wait, what's going on?
What is Sae-yi doing here?

892
00:55:20,298 --> 00:55:23,458
Why did she get on the elevator
on the fifth floor?

893
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,378
Right, you must be going to Woong's place.

894
00:55:33,418 --> 00:55:35,778
By the way, what are you doing here?

895
00:55:35,858 --> 00:55:37,658
I live in this building too.

896
00:55:38,938 --> 00:55:39,938
You didn't know?

897
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:42,898
I moved into a unit on the fifth floor
last month.

898
00:55:43,818 --> 00:55:44,818
What?

899
00:55:44,938 --> 00:55:48,098
My gosh,
I guess Woong hasn't told you yet.

900
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,938
But then again, why should he?
It's not even a big deal.

901
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:53,418
I'm going to his place too.
I need to borrow something from him.

902
00:55:55,778 --> 00:55:58,578
What is this? What is going on?

903
00:55:59,218 --> 00:56:01,138
Sae-yi lives in the same building?

904
00:56:01,218 --> 00:56:04,298
Woong never told us.

905
00:56:04,618 --> 00:56:05,858
I'll look into it.

906
00:56:07,658 --> 00:56:09,178
What did you say?

907
00:56:12,218 --> 00:56:14,418
Emotion, did you escape from prison?

908
00:56:14,498 --> 00:56:16,858
Sae-yi lives in the same building?
Since when?

909
00:56:16,978 --> 00:56:20,778
What is this? What on earth
did you guys do while I was behind bars?

910
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:27,338
[Tenth floor.]

911
00:56:34,378 --> 00:56:35,538
Aren't you getting out?

912
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:46,858
Yu-mi, why are you just standing there?
Say something!

913
00:56:46,938 --> 00:56:49,098
Why are you all quiet?

914
00:56:49,178 --> 00:56:50,418
Where is Reaction Number One?

915
00:56:50,498 --> 00:56:52,658
We can't use it because of you.

916
00:56:53,258 --> 00:56:54,658
Darn it!

917
00:57:01,938 --> 00:57:05,098
This is my first time living on my own,
so there are many things I don't have.

918
00:57:05,698 --> 00:57:08,378
So I've been borrowing stuff from Woong.

919
00:57:11,898 --> 00:57:13,738
Thank goodness my friend is my neighbor.

920
00:57:18,658 --> 00:57:19,698
Shall I press it?

921
00:57:20,658 --> 00:57:21,698
Sure.

922
00:57:27,858 --> 00:57:29,658
I told you
to just buy some wine glasses...

923
00:57:33,858 --> 00:57:34,938
Yu-mi.

924
00:57:36,618 --> 00:57:38,018
I ran into her in the elevator.

925
00:57:38,578 --> 00:57:40,778
She didn't know I had moved
into this building.

926
00:57:46,698 --> 00:57:47,738
Thanks for this.

927
00:57:48,578 --> 00:57:49,618
No problem.

928
00:57:50,658 --> 00:57:51,738
Thank you.

929
00:57:53,658 --> 00:57:56,858
My friend is coming over
with a bottle of wine.

930
00:57:57,218 --> 00:57:59,658
I don't have any wine glasses,
so I asked him if I could borrow some.

931
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:01,618
Thanks for these.

932
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:02,818
No problem.

933
00:58:02,898 --> 00:58:05,538
-See you, Yu-mi.
-Bye.

934
00:58:08,578 --> 00:58:11,098
Right, Yu-mi.

935
00:58:12,498 --> 00:58:15,298
I'm going to throw a housewarming party.
You should come.

936
00:58:17,258 --> 00:58:18,978
Sure, please invite me.

937
00:58:20,018 --> 00:58:21,058
I'll be there.

938
00:58:21,818 --> 00:58:23,898
Okay, then have a good night.

939
00:58:24,778 --> 00:58:25,858
Good night.

940
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:32,458
Yu-mi.

941
00:58:34,218 --> 00:58:36,738
What are you doing here?
You said you were going to bed.

942
00:58:38,978 --> 00:58:40,018
Come in.

943
00:58:44,978 --> 00:58:47,178
Come on in, Yu-mi.

944
00:59:04,818 --> 00:59:05,818
Come on in.

945
00:59:17,018 --> 00:59:18,418
What did I say?

946
00:59:18,698 --> 00:59:21,778
Men and women can be friends? As if.

947
00:59:21,938 --> 00:59:25,178
It's just not possible. See? I was right!

948
00:59:26,218 --> 00:59:28,138
Emotion, please quiet down.

949
00:59:28,218 --> 00:59:30,338
Don't raise your voice.
You just escaped from prison.

950
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:36,538
I'm just so angry. I trusted Woong.

951
00:59:36,778 --> 00:59:38,778
I was sure I could trust him!

952
00:59:48,658 --> 00:59:49,698
Yu-mi.

953
01:00:42,418 --> 01:00:45,258
[Yumi's Cells]

954
01:00:45,338 --> 01:00:47,858
[She wants to be your girlfriend
but pretends she's just a friend.]

955
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:49,258
[No!]

956
01:00:49,378 --> 01:00:51,538
[You're in a relationship,
but you don't look happy.]

957
01:00:51,618 --> 01:00:53,338
[You seem stressed, so I'm worried.]

958
01:00:53,418 --> 01:00:55,538
No! Woong, snap out of it.

959
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:59,138
[What you and I had was very special.]

960
01:01:00,058 --> 01:01:02,978
[There is nothing I can do
to push Sae-yi out of his life.]

961
01:01:03,058 --> 01:01:04,498
[But whether or not]

962
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:06,698
[I want to keep seeing him
is entirely up to me.]

963
01:01:06,778 --> 01:01:09,378
[Yu-mi is getting the Breakup Card.]

964
01:01:09,898 --> 01:01:12,218
[Right, I wanted to ask you something.]

965
01:01:12,338 --> 01:01:13,858
What are you doing on Christmas Day?
