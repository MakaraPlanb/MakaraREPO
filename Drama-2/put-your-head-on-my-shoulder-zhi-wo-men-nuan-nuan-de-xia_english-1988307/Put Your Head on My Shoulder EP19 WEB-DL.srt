So when are you going to get married?

4
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,430
It's not our plan at the moment

[Episode 19]

6
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,430
Si Tu Mo, wake up

7
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,470
I did call you

8
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,350
"The difficulties in the books"

9
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,750
"Not a problem"

10
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,750
"All the puzzles come with axiom"

11
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,910
"I thought I have the perfect logic"

12
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,430
"Now I find no solution"

13
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,670
"That's how you came into my heart"

14
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,110
"Sweet and childish"

15
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,070
"Nothing can describe your smile"

16
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,070
"You bring me courage"

17
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,950
"Put your head on my shoulder"

18
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,430
"You are my unknown world"

19
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,110
"Untie the knot of silence for you"

20
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:43,070
"You'll never be timid"

21
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,750
"Put your head on my shoulder"

22
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,830
"Pass over the seasons hand-in-hand"

23
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,510
"The youth marks my
heartbeat and feeling"

24
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,590
"Our love is passionate"

25
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,990
"Never fade"

26
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,190
Mo Mo

27
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,740
Your mom?

28
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,550
They've gone out?

29
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,750
Your mom?

30
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,910
They shouldn't have gone out so early

31
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,630
Your mom?

32
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,710
The door are closed

33
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,910
I guess they're asleep

34
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,790
My dad!

35
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,750
The sun is rising in the east

36
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,990
Sleep is a waste of time

37
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,950
My dad!

38
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,350
Young people shouldn't sleep too much

39
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,070
I must wake him up

40
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,550
Where are you going?

41
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,830
Gu Wei Yi

42
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,870
Dad, mom

43
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,230
Dad, mom

44
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,390
-Uncle, aunt, morning
-Uncle, aunt, morning

45
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,630
You two...

46
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,270
Why did you change your rooms?

47
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,310
Mr. Si Tu

48
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,310
Mrs. Si Tu

49
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,950
I'm supposed to be blamed

50
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,550
as I spoil my child

51
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,310
and made this happened

52
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,910
But don't worry

53
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,350
We will certainly give you
a satisfactory answer

54
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,950
Gosh! Don't take it too formal

55
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:07,870
They're just

56
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,310
in love, it's not a bad thing

57
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,830
You're so serious

58
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,710
My goodness!

59
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,750
Wen Jun

60
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,190
We're here today

61
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,510
to talk about

62
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,990
their relationship

63
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,470
Unexpectedly, they're

64
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,110
so close now

65
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,670
Do you still remember?

66
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,550
When Xiao Gu was small,

67
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,070
I taught you how to change his diaper

68
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,950
Yeah

69
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:32,790
So,

70
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,030
they're destined to meet

71
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,430
We should have arranged

72
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,630
the betrothal for them

73
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,230
Yeah

74
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:38,710
Well

75
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,470
Let's talk about their marriage

76
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,070
They're going to graduate anyway

77
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,750
What say you?

78
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,190
Then, we'll be a family

79
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,510
and always meet

80
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,670
That's right

81
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,310
Let's decide it today

82
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,270
Let's find a lucky day

83
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,470
to arrange

84
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,750
their engagement

85
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,470
What do you think?

86
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,390
No need

87
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,710
Now we can check the calender
using a mobile phone

88
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,230
Is it?

89
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,190
-Let me see
-Look at it

90
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,190
Wen Jun

91
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,150
Look

92
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,710
Their wedding room is ready

93
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,550
If you have no objection,

94
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,670
let them stay here

95
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,990
The house is pretty good

96
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,990
We could save the money

97
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,910
to buy a car for them

98
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,870
It's a good idea

99
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,990
-That's right
-Yeah

100
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:16,910
Look

101
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:17,750
Look at here

102
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,150
Mom!

103
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,070
The date...

104
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,830
What's wrong?

105
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,990
We're discussing, don't interrupt

106
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,750
This is a very good day for marriage

107
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,550
It's a good date

108
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,390
We are too excited for it

109
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,670
Shall we ask for their opinion?

110
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,310
Xiao Yi

111
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,630
What's your opinion?

112
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,190
Just say it

113
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,550
Yeah

114
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,630
We're adults

115
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,990
We can make a good plan for ourselves

116
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,430
So,

117
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,230
what do you mean?

118
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,550
No renovation

119
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,790
No car

120
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,150
And no date

121
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,670
Well...

122
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,710
So when are you going to get married?

123
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,750
It's not our plan at the moment

124
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,110
I think they're too young now

125
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,510
We have to

126
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,990
take a long view about it

127
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:19,870
Alright

128
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,230
It's about time

129
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,710
Get back to your study

130
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,990
as well as your work

131
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,990
Are we going to get married?

132
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,590
Why not?

133
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,350
I'm just asking, you said...

134
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,670
Don't think too much

135
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,110
What's wrong with you?

136
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,030
We took a long journey

137
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,510
to meet them here

138
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,270
We haven't said anything about it yet

139
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,430
and you walked away

140
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,830
I don't know what's in your mind

141
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,150
Xiao Gu is excellent

142
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,830
Mo Mo can't afford to miss him

143
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,270
He is excellent

144
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,390
Our daughter is good too

145
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,470
Why should we please him?

146
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,670
What are you talking about?

147
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,110
Didn't you see

148
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,910
they're so close?

149
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,870
Moreover, your daughter

150
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,790
always wears the dirty shirt for
several days without washing it

151
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,230
That's called go-green

152
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,990
You should send your
brain to recycle bin

153
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,590
Didn't you hear what Xiao Gu said?

154
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,230
That's not in his plan

155
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,870
It means

156
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,710
he doesn't want to marry our daughter

157
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,590
While you're busy planning for them

158
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,390
You're trying to please him

159
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,670
Xiao Gu

160
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,310
didn't mean it

161
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,830
You don't understand
a scientist's mind

162
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,030
He said,

163
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,790
it's not his plan at the moment

164
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,910
He referred to the current stage

165
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,630
and the current month

166
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:30,950
I tell you

167
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,190
He does everything accurately

168
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,310
He's different with someone like you

169
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,190
who has no sense of time

170
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,230
Okay then

171
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,430
I can't communicate with you

172
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,470
I don't have to
communicate with you either

173
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,030
What a pig-headed!

174
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,510
Come on

175
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,230
No point you're anxious now

176
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,150
Sit down and have some tea

177
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,070
Let's take a rest

178
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,510
We have to catch a plane later

179
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,030
Come on

180
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,190
How could I sit down?

181
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,310
Didn't you see

182
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,870
Wen Jun's husband's face just now?

183
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,430
He must be pissed off with Xiao Yi

184
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,550
You're the one who spoil him

185
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,670
Xiao Yi's wilful act

186
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,150
is exactly like you

187
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,830
Well

188
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,550
I'll call Mr. Si Tu

189
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,310
to say sorry

190
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,910
No!

191
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,070
Don't mess with it

192
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,390
You're really annoying

193
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,870
Well

194
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,350
I'll call Wen Jun

195
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,590
to explain to her after this

196
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,990
It's all my fault

197
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,870
I'm too stubborn

198
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,910
I saw only the surface,

199
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,790
never see its nature

200
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,030
I can tell that

201
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,030
our son likes that girl

202
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:42,990
Because I found

203
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,110
the way

204
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,030
he looked at the girl

205
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,110
is same with

206
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,870
how he looked at a fine porcelain

207
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,630
Dear Mr. Gu

208
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,190
You're something

209
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,150
Let me ask you then

210
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,550
Why did Xiao Yi say

211
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,150
the marriage wasn't in his plan?

212
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,830
You shouldn't ask me

213
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,070
You should ask our son

214
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:50,990
What's the time now?

215
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,750
Why are you sleeping in the lab?

216
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,790
They switched off the
lights too early last night

217
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,590
It's hard to read in the dorm

218
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,710
So I came here and sleep in the lab

219
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,990
You have exam in
your faculty recently?

220
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,030
You forgot it? We
need to sit for an exam

221
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,190
for the Germany exchange

222
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,590
I'm working cross-professional

223
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,390
So, I must work harder

224
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,030
That's why you asked me for the notes

225
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,790
Yeah

226
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,270
Did you give me all the notes?

227
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,790
You hide part of it?

228
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,830
The coming exam is about

229
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,710
quantum mechanics

230
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,790
I'll give you a more detailed note

231
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,470
That's great

232
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,750
Give me enough time

233
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,950
and I must beat you down

234
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,990
Okay

235
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,190
What's kind of your attitude?

236
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,030
Wait and see

237
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,430
I must beat you down

238
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,710
Don't make prediction
without scientific basis

239
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,150
It's raining

240
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,550
Get down

241
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,750
Are you crazy?

242
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,070
Wang Shan will be here soon

243
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,110
Come and pack your things up

244
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,270
You guys have gone too far

245
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,110
You guys bring your
girlfriend to the dorm

246
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,230
and chase me out

247
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,790
I'm neither pig nor goat

248
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,630
Don't chase me out

249
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,110
Quickly come down and cut the crap

250
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,350
Hurry!

251
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,390
I'm so nervous

252
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,310
Me too

253
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,350
What should we do now?

254
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,590
What about

255
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,230
forget it?

256
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,430
Wait for the next

257
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,350
No way

258
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,510
I've been waiting you for a long time

259
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:47,670
Well

260
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,550
I didn't do it purposely

261
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,910
Come on

262
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,270
Shan Shan

263
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,310
What's wrong? Don't scare me

264
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,550
You got 31 marks more than

265
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,510
the marking line of last year

266
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,550
I was busy in love with
you before the exam

267
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,190
But still make it

268
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,390
I'm really a whiz-kid

269
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,510
Professor Jiang took the
kitten to the pet clinic today

270
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,830
You just have to finish
what you haven't done yet

271
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,070
and no need to
come in the afternoon

272
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,830
I have a lot of questions
to ask Professor Jiang

273
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,430
But he's not here,
what should I do now?

274
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,070
Sister, are you free today?

275
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,950
No, I'm not

276
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:41,950
Okay

277
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,350
Gu Wei Yi, stay with me

278
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,150
Aren't you going to
sort out the notes for me?

279
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,030
So you can

280
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,350
explain it to me while
you're sorting it out

281
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,670
I'm not learning from you

282
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,630
We are exploring and
making progress together

283
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,110
I'm not free

284
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,990
You have no lectures anymore, right?

285
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,030
How come you're not free?

286
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,270
I'm going to fetch Si Tu Mo

287
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,670
Xie Yu Yin, what about you?

288
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,670
I'm not free either

289
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,350
I'm busy with the postgraduate thesis

290
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,430
Zhou Lei

291
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,830
Have you done your work?

292
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,710
I still have several observation data

293
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,070
Hurry up then

294
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,430
Alright

295
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,620
You're not nervous at all, huh?

296
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,550
My girlfriend is a whiz-kid

297
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,350
We should have a similarity

298
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,590
Look at it

299
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,670
432 points

300
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,550
You passed it

301
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,310
You passed it

302
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,990
You passed it!

303
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,550
Look at it

304
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,270
I told you

305
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,430
Don't be kidding

306
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:27,950
What?

307
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,790
Where's my reward?

308
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,750
I'll buy you a meal

309
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:34,870
No way

310
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,750
I want the reward right now

311
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,950
Now?

312
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,030
I have nothing...

313
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,630
What are you doing?

314
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,270
Redeeming the reward

315
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,070
Senior

316
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,310
I read this book too

317
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,310
Gu Wei Yi

318
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,870
I hope you'll be selected

319
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,910
Thank you

320
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,590
There are many questions

321
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,070
of calculation in the exam

322
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,870
It's not fair to you

323
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,670
Gu Wei Yi

324
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,510
I knew you're in the library

325
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,750
Is it raining?

326
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,710
I just went to the shower

327
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,110
to avoid the peak

328
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,310
I have been studying
in the lab recently

329
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,870
So I went to the shower first

330
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,390
Anything I can help you?

331
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,150
That's right

332
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,710
You promised

333
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,670
to sort out the notes
and explain it to me

334
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,550
When did I promise you?

335
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,110
Hey you!

336
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,910
You promised me before

337
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,350
Did you forget it?

338
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,030
This is a library

339
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,070
I'm so sorry

340
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,110
Senior Lu

341
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,590
Why are you two together?

342
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,190
She didn't give me tips

343
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,590
We just happened to meet here

344
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,910
Okay

345
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,150
I believe you

346
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,910
Anyway, I think  Senior Lu

347
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,910
won't do that

348
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:53,870
Gu Wei Yi

349
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,630
I've marked all the questions

350
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,990
I don't understand it

351
00:20:59,150 --> 00:20:59,990
Please explain to me

352
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,830
I'll write it for you

353
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,750
No, explain to me directly

354
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,790
It's more convenient and clearer

355
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:08,870
The experiment shows that

356
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,550
microscopic particles have
wave-particle duality

357
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,590
The momentum conservation
of collision energy

358
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,630
Should be like this

359
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,110
A shape like this

360
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,590
A circle on the front

361
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,150
Gu Wei Yi

362
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,790
You're really amazing

363
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,910
So sorry

364
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,350
It's about time

365
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,070
I'm going to fetch Si Tu Mo

366
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,590
I still have so many questions

367
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,510
You don't have to pick her up

368
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,750
Doesn't she have legs?

369
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,870
Okay

370
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,070
She has legs

371
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,190
I'll sort out the notes tonight

372
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,150
Call me if you have any questions

373
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,230
Dates before mates, huh?

374
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,150
How could you leave me alone?

375
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,470
I don't care

376
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,390
Hello

377
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,230
What are you doing?

378
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,430
I'm going to pick you up

379
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,790
I will be busy for a whole day

380
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,510
in the studio

381
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,630
Si Tu Mo

382
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,870
Mr. Lin is calling you

383
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,470
Coming

384
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,430
I'll get back to my work first

385
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,590
Okay

386
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,230
Tell me when you finish it

387
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,550
I'll pick you up

388
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:42,870
Okay

389
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,630
Bye

390
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,310
Look

391
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,310
She doesn't even
need you to pick her up

392
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,230
Come on

393
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,590
Let's continue to enjoy
the ocean of knowledge

394
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,390
Hey sis!

395
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,950
Are you the crew who works

396
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,910
with Xiao Lin today?

397
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,070
No, I'm not

398
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:00,790
Wait

399
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,030
You're wearing the staff ID card

400
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,430
Can you do me a favor?

401
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,430
No, I must get back to my work

402
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,670
Could you help me

403
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,470
to record Xiao Lin's
moaning on the bed?

404
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,590
Oops, no!

405
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,070
What makes you blush?

406
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,790
I mean the wake-up
ring tone of Xiao Lin's voice

407
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,190
Please

408
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,830
I can't help on this

409
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,630
Sis

410
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,510
I'm going to sit for the
university entrance exam soon

411
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,550
My parents stopped me
from joining the fans club

412
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,670
and surfing Internet

413
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,670
But Xiao Lin

414
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,110
is my motivation to learn

415
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,670
They removed all the pictures

416
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,550
and posters in my room

417
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,790
I have nothing left now

418
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,190
Please help me

419
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,310
I can't help you

420
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,150
I'll see you next time

421
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,190
You must help me

422
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,110
The kids nowadays
are all blinded with stars

423
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,230
I'm so sorry, Miss Xue Yu

424
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,950
Can't you just walk properly?

425
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,550
What a careless girl!

426
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,670
Are you looking for me?

427
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,750
Zhao Xue Yu is too big-headed

428
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,670
She's ordering all the people here

429
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,590
And I don't know anyone here

430
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,510
So I could only look for you

431
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,150
I told you, she doesn't like you

432
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,710
The shooting has started for 2 hours

433
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,950
and she fooled you for 1.5 hours

434
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,110
I knew

435
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,190
So you saw it

436
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,190
I tried so hard to put up
with her after the "fake accident"

437
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,390
You're trying so hard

438
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,150
Maybe she will spare you for 2 minutes

439
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,430
I should thank her then

440
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,470
Why are you using an old phone?

441
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,110
Your fan gave it to me

442
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,870
She wants to have your
voice as her wake-up ring tone

443
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,710
That's so easy

444
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,990
I'll help you

445
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,430
You may say no either

446
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,630
I'm afraid if you leave your job
behind and act like a boss

447
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,030
I'm not you

448
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,470
I'm going to record
the moaning for you

449
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,430
Lin Zhi...

450
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,830
Okay, next pose

451
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,750
Okay

452
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,630
Take a rest first

453
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,150
Buy me a drink

454
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,470
Okay

455
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,550
Miss Xue Yu, your green tea

456
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,150
Is this potable?

457
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,390
Buy me coffee

458
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,150
Miss Xue Yu, your coffee

459
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,830
So hot!

460
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,710
Lemonade

461
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,070
Okay

462
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,270
Miss Xue Yu, your lemonade

463
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,950
So cold

464
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,990
Don't you know girls

465
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,150
can't drink cold drinks?

466
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,510
So sorry

467
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,510
You should ask your
assistant to buy it for you

468
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,950
I think she should know you

469
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,790
better than I do

470
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,430
She's busy

471
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,430
I don't think so

472
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,910
Behave yourself

473
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,630
Do you know who I am?

474
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:09,750
Of course I know

475
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,270
I have checked it on Baidu last night

476
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,190
Si Tu

477
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,710
Have you checked about me?

478
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,110
Of course

479
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,350
You have 2 pages of news more than her

480
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,230
You...

481
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,470
I'm going to buy you drinks

482
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,030
I think she wants
to quit from this field

483
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,670
What if tomorrow's headline

484
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,550
shows "Zhao Xue Yu

485
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,230
is a big-headed

486
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,550
and tortured the crew"?

487
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:38,950
What picture do you think

488
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,790
they should use to match

489
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,750
the fake news?

490
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,910
Now you're working with a pop star

491
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,190
Be prepared to get stalked

492
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,390
by the paparazzi for 24 hours

493
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,670
You've tried so hard to be popular

494
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,630
Don't go too far then

495
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,150
Don't make me expose your affair

496
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,710
Where's your picture then?

497
00:26:59,030 --> 00:26:59,350
You...

498
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,150
Let's wait and see

499
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,190
You're mugged

500
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,270
Cut it out! I'm going to get fired

501
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,790
Don't worry, I've nailed it

502
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,230
Really?

503
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,350
Of course

504
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:16,990
Don't worry

505
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,630
That's great

506
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,110
My legs gave way

507
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,950
when I was walking out after the fight

508
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,470
What a silly girl!

509
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,350
How dare you

510
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,590
find her then?

511
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,430
The company wants to find her

512
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,870
because you two are popular and famous

513
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,470
She's just bad-tempered

514
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,430
Let's have some drink

515
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,350
Thank you

516
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,550
Do you really want to buy me a meal?

517
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:52,950
Of course

518
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,790
It's a reward for you to pass CET 4

519
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,030
But I have redeemed it

520
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,030
Shut up!

521
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,470
Your phone is ringing

522
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,710
Hello

523
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,270
I'm going to your place
for business trip in two days

524
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,830
Do you still remember
Aunt Lin Lin whom you met last time?

525
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,270
What's the matter?

526
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,790
She'll introduce her classmate to you

527
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:23,830
She's from a literary family

528
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,150
and has a master degree abroad

529
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,030
She is courteous

530
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,590
and our families are well-matched

531
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,430
That's crap! You're a parvenu
and she's a master degree

532
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,030
Behave yourself

533
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,390
Mind your words!

534
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,430
I have a girlfriend

535
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,790
Your own girlfriend

536
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,790
must be indecent

537
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,710
A blind date, huh?

538
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,110
Alright

539
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,510
I'll go

540
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,590
But don't regret it

541
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,070
It's my father

542
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,270
Let's order

543
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,870
Alright, let's call it a day

544
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,070
Thank you

545
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:09,830
Thank you

546
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,310
Thanks for your hard work

547
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,470
Don't go first

548
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,710
I'll buy you dinner today!

549
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,470
Thank you!

550
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,710
Si Tu

551
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,310
Miss Xue Yu

552
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,870
Let's go for dinner together

553
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,990
Let me apologize to you

554
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,670
Thank you, I'll pass

555
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,030
My boyfriend will pick me up later

556
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:28,870
Come on

557
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,710
You must go with us

558
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,590
Or you don't give me face

559
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,470
Gu Wei Yi, I'm done

560
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,710
The crew asked me
to go to dinner together

561
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,750
What about this?

562
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,550
You come and pick me up in an hour

563
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,550
I'll send you the address

564
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,910
Okay, wait for me

565
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,670
Bye

566
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,830
Thanks for your hard work

567
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,470
I'm very happy to work with you

568
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,150
I hope we could

569
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,470
work together again in the future

570
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,470
Cheers!

571
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,390
Come on

572
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,870
Thank you, Miss Xue Yu

573
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,230
Thank you, Miss Xue Yu

574
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,990
-Thank you, Miss Xue Yu
-Thank you, Miss Xue Yu

575
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,110
Have a seat

576
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,390
Why is he taking so long?

577
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,790
Si Tu

578
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,190
You have worked hard today

579
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,390
Not at all

580
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,110
Thank you for your tolerance

581
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,630
In term of tolerance,

582
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,830
I can't do better than Zhi Cun

583
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,910
Did I say something wrong?

584
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,590
It's okay

585
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,270
Have a seat

586
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,110
If you really want to thank me,

587
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,950
drink it bottom up then

588
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,030
Look at that

589
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,310
Zhi Cun

590
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,830
It seems Si Tu gets drunk

591
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,030
You send her home

592
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,150
Where's Si Tu's house? Let me send her

593
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,910
You should ask Zhi Cun

594
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,550
I want to go home

595
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:43,830
Who are you?

596
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,510
Her boyfriend

597
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:49,710
Lovely contrast

598
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,750
But you have to prove it to them

599
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,710
Si Tu Mo

600
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,430
I'm not drunk

601
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,670
Who's Circle's dad?

602
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,350
You

603
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,110
Who's Circle's mom?

00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,270
Me

605
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,310
You two...

606
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,430
Who's Circle?

607
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,070
She has a child at such a young age

608
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,590
I can't see it

609
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,590
I'm throwing up

610
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,230
I'm throwing up

611
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,950
I can't

612
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,950
I can't spit it out, help me

613
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:03,230
I can't spit it out, help me

614
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,870
I can't help you

615
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,030
Let Circle wait for a while

616
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,150
I'll try to spit it out

617
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,470
Circle is not here

618
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,510
What?

619
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,350
Where is Circle?

620
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,190
Call him!

621
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:19,189
You're drunk

622
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,149
I was throwing up when you hit me

623
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,950
Please hit me

624
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,510
Let's go home

Wind of Autumn

627
00:35:42,427 --> 00:35:43,197
Blooming of flowers

628
00:35:43,213 --> 00:35:44,213
As if we meet each other again

629
00:35:44,232 --> 00:35:45,532
I have only heard of this,
Wind of Autumn

630
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,468
Yummy crabs

631
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:47,865
It is nicer when you add chilies

632
00:35:48,011 --> 00:35:48,891
Oh! I'm craving for

633
00:35:48,955 --> 00:35:50,155
the Large Crab in Yang Cheng Lake

634
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:51,413
But it's now peak season

635
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:52,197
The hotel must be costly

636
00:35:52,205 --> 00:35:52,905
Don't worry

637
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:53,990
I'm the VIP of the APP

638
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,377
