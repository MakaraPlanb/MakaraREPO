Mo Mo, wait for me

189
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,140
Don't follow me

190
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,820
The stadium is so big

191
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,170
Can't I just come and play football?

192
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,460
Alright, go ahead

Kick me then

I dare not do it

196
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,020
What are you afraid of?

197
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,900
Since you dare to let
someone wear the tie for you

198
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,180
I didn't notice it

199
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,300
I'm innocent

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,260
Really?

201
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,660
You seemed enjoying it

202
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,380
Look

203
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,020
You're caught red-handed
and have nothing to say now

204
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,940
Nonsense

205
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,540
Stop following me

206
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,500
I told you, don't follow me

207
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,020
Be reasonable

208
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:18,700
Okay

209
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,660
I'm not reasonable

210
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,420
It's all for now, I'm
going back to the dorm

211
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,900
I'll never go back to
your stupid house again

212
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,620
What are you doing?

213
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,340
Put me down

214
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,620
Put me down

215
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,740
What do you want me to do?

216
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,060
I don't know

217
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,100
Think about it yourself

218
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,740
"A little feeling"

219
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,660
"A little strong"

220
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,180
"Make the ordinary life different"

221
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,100
"Like surrounded by the warmth"

222
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,780
"The story was shaking the destiny"

223
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,740
"Take up the courage
to make a promise"

224
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,260
What are you doing?

225
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:10,860
What?

226
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,220
Nothing

227
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,260
You're experienced in flirting

228
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,580
Think so

229
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,740
Put me down first

230
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,660
"I want to go further with you"

231
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,660
"It's all I miss"

232
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,580
"Shoulder to shoulder
with the touching moment"

233
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,460
"I want to go further with you"

234
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,420
"Despite the changing of world"

235
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,380
"Still holding each others hand"

236
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,940
"Let the time of a love song"

237
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,020
"witness our love forever“

238
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,340
I'm so hungry, are you hungry?

239
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,300
Hungry

240
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,820
But we don't have the money to eat now

241
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,500
Why don't we go and get some food?

242
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,180
Fu Pei promised to
buy all of us a meal

243
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,380
No

244
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,860
Are you still jealous of Fu Pei?

245
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,500
My senior is going to buy me a meal

246
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,140
Don't hold me, you should
hold your senior instead

247
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,900
Stop laughing

248
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,060
Let's go home

249
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,220
I'll cook you porridge

250
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,540
You can't cook

251
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,660
You teach me

252
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,980
No way

253
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,820
You...

254
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,500
I thought you're excellent

255
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,860
You know everything, don't you?

256
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,420
Where are you going?
Finish the porridge

257
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,300
We have eaten the
same porridge for 3 days

258
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,540
This is the last meal,
no more in the future

259
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:35,940
Finish

260
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,100
Gu Wei Yi

261
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,300
What's wrong?

262
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,980
Come and check the hose

263
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,980
No more water

264
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,940
Is it broken?

265
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,620
No water supply

266
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,100
Until when? I didn't see any notice

267
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,500
I forgot to pay the water bill

268
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,860
Professor Jiang just promised me

269
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,180
will give me the project fee first

270
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,820
I'll pay the bill once I get the money

271
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,180
Let me pay the bill first

272
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,140
No way

273
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,260
Just pay me back
when you get the money

274
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,140
No way

275
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,860
Are you sure you want to do this?

276
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:31,980
Let's go

277
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,660
Luckily, I made a pot of tea before

278
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,940
I don't want it anymore

279
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,180
What are you looking for?

280
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,180
The remote control
of the air conditioner

281
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,820
I feel hot after drinking the hot tea

282
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,020
Stop it

283
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,380
Why?

284
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,700
No electricity supply

285
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,060
I didn't pay the electricity bill

286
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,260
The house is a stuffy

287
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,420
Let's go out for a walk

288
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,100
Let's go

289
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,940
Are you going to criticize
the table tennis again?

290
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,420
I was in bad shape last time

291
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,580
I thought it's a problem with
the coefficient of the racket

292
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,780
That's one of the reason too

293
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,020
Are you sure you want to play it?

294
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,540
Don't regret if you lose

295
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,860
You serve

296
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,460
Or you'll miss it if I serve

297
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,420
It's alright

298
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,940
Are you sure?

299
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,220
I'm Zhang Yi Ning No. 2

300
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,500
You experienced it before

301
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,860
Hurry

302
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
I told you

303
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,860
Don't look at me like that

304
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,020
I will not let you win

305
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,220
I'll serve

306
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,940
Come on

307
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:20,780
Come on

308
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,100
Come on

309
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:34,940
You serve

310
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,340
I can't believe it

311
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:36,820
Come on

312
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,060
I'll quit

313
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,180
I won

314
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,420
How did you make it?

315
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,660
In a sudden again, huh?

316
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,860
I told you that I was in
bad shape last time

317
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,140
I happened to catch

318
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,540
the arc of the balls

319
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,420
So the continuity of
the ball will be better

320
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,220
Its forward momentum...

321
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,220
I know you're awesome

322
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,060
I'm hungry

323
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,660
Let's go home and eat

324
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,700
There's no water and
electricity in the house

325
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,780
I'll figure something out

326
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,100
I have money

327
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,780
Let's go and have a luxury food

328
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,300
Alright

329
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:40,740
Let's go

330
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,620
So luxurious

331
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,380
We bought the instant noodles in a cup

332
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,860
It's not environmentally friendly

333
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,940
You should about it

334
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,820
when you don't want to wash the bowl

335
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,059
Let's buy a dishwasher

336
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,730
I'll get my scholarship in a few days

337
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:16,299
No way

338
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,929
Why do you always want to buy robot?

339
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,020
Look

340
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,140
We've all bought so many noodles,

341
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,299
rice and pickled mustard

342
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,659
Even if the end of
the world breaks out,

343
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,660
we still can live half
a month more than others

344
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,860
So I think we're capable

345
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,540
to get a dishwasher now

346
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:33,820
No way

347
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,500
I wanted to study the structure

348
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,660
of the dishwasher for a long time

349
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,460
Look at the parameter

350
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,580
High temperature of 70 degrees

351
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,220
Sterilization rate up to 99.99%

352
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,940
We have nothing to lose

353
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,420
Pick either Circle or dishwasher

354
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,180
Good boy

355
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,000
There are 15 minutes
left before the test

356
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,920
Take your time

357
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,680
Are you ready to move?

358
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,240
I'm just free

359
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,200
at the end of the project

360
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,040
What about you?

361
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,360
I applied for a delay
in leaving campus

362
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,120
I'll stay in the postgraduate
dorm for temporary

363
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,400
Then I'll send the luggage
directly to the University of North

364
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,000
You're not going home, huh?

365
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,480
Fu Pei doesn't allow it

366
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,080
So you listen to him, huh?

367
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,720
What if you go to
the university later?

368
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,040
Will he cry every day?

369
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,880
He wanted to go with me,

370
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,560
but I stopped him

371
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,400
Why?

372
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,880
There are preferential policies

373
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,040
under local graduate entrepreneurs

374
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,320
If he wants to start a company,

375
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,840
it's better for him to stay here

376
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,520
He wanted to start a company, huh?

377
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
He has a entrepreneurial mind

378
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,440
You've been blinded by love

379
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,320
So you'll be in a long-distance love

380
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,320
Yeah

381
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,760
It's terrible

382
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,200
It seems like falling
into the air every day

383
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,440
I'm sure I can't stand it

384
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,360
Gu Wei Yi and you

385
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,960
see each other every day

386
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,840
You don't have to worry about that

387
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,720
Shan Shan, look at this

388
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,120
When I first got this,

389
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
I couldn't fall asleep all night

390
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,040
Now we suddenly graduated.

391
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,800
Yeah

392
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,320
When Lulu first arrived,

393
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,680
she couldn't even hang a mosquito net

394
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,280
She even washed the
apple with laundry liquid

395
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,040
And you ate the apple

396
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,040
Shan Shan

397
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,560
I know

398
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,480
We can't be too
sensational at this moment

399
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,480
Or we're going to cry

400
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,480
No

401
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,640
Look

402
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,560
I made the money when I worked
as a tutor for the first time

403
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,200
I hid it to avoid spending

404
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,480
until I forgot it

405
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,160
I'm rich

406
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,920
RMV800!

407
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,760
So silly!

408
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,960
Oh, my God!

409
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,600
Hello

410
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,800
I'm done with the test

411
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,160
and packing

412
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,200
I'm not done yet

413
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,640
And Lu Lu and Niu Niu are not here

414
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,320
I want to have a meal with them first

415
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,560
Take your time then

416
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,160
I'll go to the lab first

417
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,160
Call me when you're okay

418
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,000
I'll pick you up

419
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,520
Okay

420
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,200
Shan Shan

421
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,240
When will Lu Lu and Niu Niu come back?

422
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
Lu Lu went for a movie with Ke

423
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,880
Hu Niu went out for
the personnel files

424
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,040
It's so hard for me to
have a meal at the canteen

425
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,520
And I have something to do later

426
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,160
I can't go with you

427
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,120
Make sure you send the books

428
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
which you don't want to the warden

429
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,640
Okay

430
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,080
Gu Wei Yi

431
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,240
Let's check the answer in the lab

432
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,520
I'll not stay in the lab after this

433
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,920
Are you staying in the lab?

434
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,600
Yeah, it's easier for my revision here

435
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,080
Professor Jiang knew about it?

436
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,800
He'll surely stop me if he knows it

437
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,720
I used to bring the cat to the lab

438
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,000
and he complained a lot

439
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,360
You even brought a cat to the lab?

440
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,680
Do you know how expensive
the lab instruments are?

441
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,440
Can you afford to pay
if anything happens?

442
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,520
The lab has its rules

443
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,280
I have to report this
to the university

444
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,400
Gu Wei Yi

445
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,880
She's going to report
to the university

446
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,920
that I was staying in the lab

447
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,200
And you even raise a cat

448
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,200
You'd better be prepared with a review

449
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,520
I used to take care of the cat too

450
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,400
Gu Wei Yi, don't protect him

451
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,840
I know you were forced by him

452
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,640
No

453
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,040
You're biased against me

454
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,480
Why do you always target me?

455
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,920
Why should I?

456
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,160
I just judge the
matter as it stands

457
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,480
You're biased against me

458
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,440
It's not that serious

459
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,640
What?

460
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,960
If that's serious,

461
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,680
it may affect your
eligibility to go abroad

462
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,600
Senior

463
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,320
Let's leave it to Professor Jiang

464
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,880
What happened?

465
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,800
What's going on?

466
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,480
Zhou Lei stays in the lab

467
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,160
and even keeps a cat here

468
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,000
Zhou Lei

469
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,120
Why are you messing in the lab again?

470
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,240
Professor Jiang

471
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,480
I just did my revision in the lab

472
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,200
The lab has its rules

473
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,360
And there are so many instruments here

474
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,200
It's okay

475
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,440
I know about it

476
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,440
Leave it to me

477
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,000
So what are you going to do with it?

478
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,720
Don't you have to report
it to the university?

479
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:45,880
Senior

480
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,200
I have a problem in my experiment

481
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,760
-Let's check it out
-What about this...

482
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,080
Help me

483
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,920
Help her to check it out

484
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,640
Help her

485
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:56,960
Zhou Lei

486
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,120
Come with me

487
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,200
You're right

488
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,840
I've been emotional lately

489
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,080
I went on a blind date that day

490
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,040
I ran into a parvenu family

491
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,360
They're so cocky

492
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,280
When we're eating,

493
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,840
his girlfriend suddenly came in

494
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,120
and smashed thing

495
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,720
It's really wicked

496
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,600
Oh, my goodness

497
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,400
Yeah

498
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,040
The cocky man said his son

499
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,440
is the hottest man in our campus

500
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,920
I don't know if you know him

501
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,800
Fu Pei from Management school

502
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,880
I don't know him

503
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,960
Yeah

504
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,960
You shouldn't know that kind of guy

505
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,240
He's rude and cocky

506
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,280
We're not on the same level

507
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,240
Excuse me

508
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,760
I'm already downstairs

509
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,640
I'm right at the school gate

510
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,360
Wait for a minute

511
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:58,960
Okay

512
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,280
Uncle Fu

513
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,320
It's you

514
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,320
Why are you here?

515
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,920
I'm not here to see you anyway

516
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,720
Uncle, you don't even know me

517
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,400
Why do you hate me so much?

518
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,960
I don't even need to know you

519
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,320
Fu Pei always finds a flirt

520
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,360
to be his girlfriend

521
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,640
They all like him
all because of my money

522
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,280
I tell you

523
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,080
If you're going to be with him again,

524
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,560
I'm not giving him any money

525
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,200
You can't get anything from him

526
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,320
Uncle

527
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,560
Are you saying this

528
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,080
to insult me

529
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,440
or your son?

530
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,600
I have no time for you

531
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,480
I'm here to see Jian Shi

532
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,240
The rascal brought disgrace on me

533
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,680
in the last dinner

534
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,360
Uncle

535
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,920
I knew you stopped
me to be with Fu Pei

536
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,480
because you don't know me yet

537
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,000
But why don't you

538
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,200
even understand Fu Pei?

539
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,200
I don't understand him, huh?

540
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,960
Who knows him then?

541
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,320
You?

542
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,400
Do you know he is going
to start his own company?

543
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,360
What?

544
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,840
It will take less than
one month to close

545
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,440
He started his business

546
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,440
with the money he saved from
the winning basketball games

547
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,760
Everyone thought

548
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,200
he's playing with his dad's money

549
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,800
But he didn't ask you

550
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,240
for money for so long, did he?

551
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,000
Even if he did, I won't
give him any single cent

552
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,120
He used to do

553
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,680
every thing quietly

554
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,800
But I know

555
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,720
that he still wishes
for your recognition

556
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,680
Should I recognize him
because he runs a company?

557
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,520
I just want to say that

558
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,880
Fu Pei is much more mature
than what you think

559
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,000
I hope two of you sit down

560
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,560
and chat with an open-heart

561
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,920
And not solving the problem

562
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,280
by smashing things like that day

563
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:47,880
Shan Shan

564
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,080
What are you doing here?

565
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,680
Is this your territory?

566
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,280
No

567
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,680
Help yourself then

568
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,760
Wait a minute

569
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,640
I heard you're going to run a company

570
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,520
Why?

571
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,040
Are you afraid to compete with me?

572
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,720
Get your business license first

573
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,800
I did it

574
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,840
Sorry

575
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,440
Let's go

576
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,840
Did he give you a hard time?

577
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,080
No

578
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,960
He's quite easy going

579
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,560
He's not as scary as you think

580
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,640
Easy going?

581
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,200
Did he give you money
to get you out of me?

582
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,560
1 million?

583
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,040
No

584
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,640
What? Doesn't he have 1 million?

585
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,360
He made parvenu in disgrace

586
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,040
Please help me promote it

587
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,920
You won't use the books anymore

588
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,600
Right?

589
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,360
Okay

590
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,480
Thank you, see you

591
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,000
Okay, bye

592
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,480
Can I put the books here?

593
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,960
Put it here and weigh it yourself

594
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,440
Alright

595
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,800
RMB1 per kg

596
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,280
Count yourself

597
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,960
You're learning accounting right?

598
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,760
The total is 11.5kg

599
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,760
11.5kg

600
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,680
I don't have small change

601
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,920
Just keep the change

602
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,680
Help me sort it out

603
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,160
If it's a textbook,

604
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,920
please pick it out

605
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,040
for donation

606
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:11,960
Okay

607
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,240
11.5kg

608
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,320
Girl

609
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,240
You didn't back to the dorm
for a long time, right?

610
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,720
You found a house outside?

611
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,080
You still remember me, huh?

612
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,680
Of course

613
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,160
You always came back late and

614
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,640
looked unhappy when I scolded you

615
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,440
I was busy with internship back then

616
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,840
I knew

617
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,800
People who came back late

618
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,400
were all sent back by a boy

619
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,840
Only you came back on your own

620
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,600
Apparently, you're a single
who worked overtime

621
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,760
Do you have a boyfriend now?

622
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,240
What kind of man do you like?

623
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,080
A scientist

624
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,040
You got the right person

625
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,800
My husband is doing
scientific researches

626
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,240
He has 2 students

627
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
They're quite nice

628
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,880
One of them is handsome,

629
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,240
but a little silly

630
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,760
But, at your age...

631
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,200
I have a boyfriend

632
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,400
That's good

633
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,160
I just merely mention it

634
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,880
Actually, you shouldn't

635
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,800
get a scientist as your boyfriend

636
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,360
They always read for a whole day

637
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,880
You can't understand
what he's talking about

638
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,240
Moreover, they always do weird things

639
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,480
Always suddenly get up from sleeping

640
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,080
to do the calculation

641
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,640
And always bring machines home

642
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
Are you feeling better?

643
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
I feel better now

644
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,320
Si Tu Mo

645
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,360
Hey, senior

646
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm looking for Gu Wei Yi

647
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
He just left the lab

648
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,480
You can give him a call

649
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,080
Okay, thank you

650
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,240
See you

651
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:45,960
See you

652
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,080
Who's she?

653
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,200
She's Gu Wei Yi's girlfriend

654
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,360
Is she in our field?

655
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,360
No

656
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,760
Some sort like
Accounting or Advertising

657
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,000
Do they have a common topic?

658
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,520
You and Gu Wei Yi are quite close

659
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,560
during in the lab

660
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
I thought you two...

661
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,600
I don't know much about them too

662
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,080
Professor Jiang wanted to see me

663
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,360
I'm going to help him
correct the paper

664
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,960
I'm going to check some
information in the library

665
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,440
-Bye
-Bye

666
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,440
Gu Wei Yi

667
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,760
Your girlfriend just
looked for you in the lab

668
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,440
I just went to the lab,
but you're not there

669
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,400
I guess you're in the library

670
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,000
Wait for me, I'm coming

671
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,600
I have never expected

672
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,280
that you like that kind of girl

673
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,880
Why don't you get a girlfriend
from the physics department?

674
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,600
None of your business

675
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,040
What?

676
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,200
My girlfriend

677
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,480
has nothing to do with you

678
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,360
The guy named Fu Pei
which you mentioned

679
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,160
is my friend

680
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,600
He is not cocky as you are

681
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,240
and he is more courteous than you

682
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,480
One more thing

683
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,840
Don't bully Zhou Lei anymore

684
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,920
He's been in rehabilitation
center before

685
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,320
You seem in a good mood

686
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
I managed to punish the evil

687
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,200
Scientists are really weird

688
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,960
Today, while I was packing my things,

689
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,880
I found RMB800

690
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,320
Let's spend it

691
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,720
We can't keep the windfall

692
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:54,960
Okay

693
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,160
Say it

694
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,160
Do you have a girlfriend?

695
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,640
Yes, I do

696
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,720
Look at this

697
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,600
Alright

698
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,280
This one

699
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,160
How about this?

700
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,080
I'll change the color of
the sofa to a different mood

701
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,120
Okay

702
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,680
Let's pay for the bill

703
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,960
That looks good

704
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,040
I like it

705
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,880
Let's go

706
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,760
So nice

707
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,400
The rabbit is so cute

708
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,480
Look at its face

709
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,120
What's wrong? You look dull

710
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,200
Shopping is more tiring
than doing experiments

711
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,080
You lack of exercises

712
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,160
I'm doing mental exercise every day

713
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,600
You're awesome

714
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,960
These are all made
by the guests themselves.

715
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,920
You can make your own ceramics too

716
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,960
Let's take a mental exercise

717
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,600
Okay

718
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,510

719
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,760

720
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,400
Si Tu Mo

721
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,640
Is this the result of
your mental exercise?

722
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,320
It's hard to do this

723
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,640
Put it by the bed and enjoy it

724
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,400
Screw harder

725
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,240
Harder

726
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,200
Screw harder

727
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,480
Harder

728
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,960
Harder

729
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,560
Harder

730
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,160
"The signal in the eye"

731
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,960
Stick the bottom

732
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,440
-Ready?
-It's done

733
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,880
"Love your tone and your grumble"

734
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,440
"Love your smile and your hug"

735
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,920
"You please me like a cat,
I can't help falling into it"

736
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,800
"No one can replace it"

737
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
"Hand in hand and"

738
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,760
"walk together with you"

739
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,200
"Feel it the love"

740
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,040
"is getting more and more"

741
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,880
"I'm lucky to meet you,
smile in the dreams"

742
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,640
"I got a heart thump"

743
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,800
"Let the sweet love"

744
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,640
"brew day by day"

745
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,440
Alright

746
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,240
Okay

747
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,160
Alright

748
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,920
"A love loaf"

749
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,200
"The sweetness of a couple"

750
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,760
Let's try it

751
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,400
Okay

752
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,680
It's done

753
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,400
Finally, we have done it

754
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,800
So tired

755
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,600
Looks like I cleaned it all up

756
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,040
Me too

757
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,400
I helped you too

758
00:37:52,592 --> 00:37:54,592
[Here comes the Easter Egg...]

761
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,930
We'll be graduated after 2 months

762
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:12,214
Let's travel to Tibet

763
00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:13,071
As long as you like it,

764
00:38:13,095 --> 00:38:13,795
we can go whenever you want to

765
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:14,985
It's hard to book

the train ticket

767
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,460
Don't worry

768
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:18,623
The APP can make it

00:38:18,675 --> 00:38:19,475
Advance purchase 63 days

770
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,626
with auto ticket-grabber

771
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:22,025
I'm willing to go

772
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:22,972
anywhere with you

773
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:23,991
Me too

774
00:38:24,624 --> 00:38:25,924
"Advance purchase 63 days by APP"

775
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:36,960
Fu Pei

776
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,760
Why are you back?

777
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,080
Looking for you

778
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,120
Why?

779
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,280
To borrow money

780
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,000
I can't believe my ears

781
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,000
What about your scholarship? Finished?

782
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,040
Si Tu Mo is such a spendthrift

783
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,440
I haven't got it yet

784
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,800
Yes or not?

785
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,320
How much do you want?

786
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,000
How much can I borrow from you?

787
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,400
Say it

788
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,880
I'm a son of rich family, after all

789
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,040
RMB5,000

790
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,560
That's too much

791
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,880
RMB500

792
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,760
RMB50

793
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,960
See you

794
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,720
The business tycoons
who start from scratch

795
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,720
always being looked
down at the beginning

796
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,800
I'll not give up
