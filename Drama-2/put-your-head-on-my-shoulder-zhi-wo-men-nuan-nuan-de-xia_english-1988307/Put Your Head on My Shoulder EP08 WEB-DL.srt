[Preview]

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
What is your feeling with Si Tu Mo?

4
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,240
It has nothing to do with you

5
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,160
But it's very important to me

6
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
[Episode 8]

7
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,520
With the sea in my heart,

8
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,880
everywhere can be Maldives

9
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,640
I had a cat before

10
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,240
It liked to catch cockroaches

11
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,040
One day, after I woke up from a nap,

12
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,160
it put more than 10
cockroaches in front of me

13
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,880
and walked away proudly

14
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,040
Mine too

15
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,200
It gave me dead rats

16
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,920
Look similar?

17
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,760
Exactly

18
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,960
So beautiful

19
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,760
Meng Lu, your boyfriend is so charming

20
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,560
"I wish to give you all my good"

21
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,520
"Do you know?"

22
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,120
"You are very important to me"

23
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,520
"I appreciate every
moment we're together"

24
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,440
"Together we wait for the sunrise"

25
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,200
"Your breath became my heartbeat"

26
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,080
"I want to build a castle"

27
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,400
"with the smell of the ocean"
"Running barefoot at the beach with you"

28
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,680
I want to ask you something

29
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,360
Alright

30
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,520
What is your relationship
with Wang Shan?

31
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,560
Mo Mo wants you to ask me?

32
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,120
No

33
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,480
Why did you ask?

34
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,360
I want to know your feeling with Si Tu Mo

35
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,480
It has nothing to do with you

36
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,360
But it's very important to me

37
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,560
Why?

38
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,680
She is not the type 

39
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
you nerds like

40
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,920
You're not going to

41
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,400
fall out with me for her, are you?

42
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,840
You should

43
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,160
be thankful with these food

44
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,600
Quickly dig in

45
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,560
Who stole my sausage?

46
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,480
Who?

47
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:35,960
Don't know

48
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,560
Meng Lu

49
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,080
Mo Mo

50
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,520
Is it you?

51
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,960
I'll give you two back

52
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,520
No way

53
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,040
Three

54
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,520
Fine

55
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,360
Okay, three

56
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,120
Is it worthy you do that for a girl

57
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
who stole the sausage?

58
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,280
It's worthy

59
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,200
Are you okay?

60
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,840
I'm okay

61
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,360
I'll wash it with cold water

62
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,480
Go

63
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,320
Take a look at him

64
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,520
"Get myself in trouble"

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,960
"The spine at your mouth"

66
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,840
"Know well of your own shadow"

67
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,160
Are you alright?

68
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,920
I'm okay

69
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,560
Apply the medicine

70
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,960
You can't just
leave the wound behind

71
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,960
It's so serious

72
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
If there's a blister,

73
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
we should see how big it is

74
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,400
If it's big, you should poke it,

75
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,080
squeeze the water before applying the medicine

76
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,240
If it's small, it will recover itself

77
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,400
When we're at Gu Wei Yi's house...

78
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,920
I knew you were drunk

79
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
and mistook me for someone else

80
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,120
I'm so sorry

81
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,640
Buy me a meal as an apology

82
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,280
Are you falling in love with...

83
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,760
Are you dreaming?

84
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,720
I heard it from Mo Mo

85
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,880
that you always treat her luxury meals

86
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,520
So I want to steal a meal from you

87
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,760
Forget it

88
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,600
If you really feel sorry to me,

89
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,320
you should pass the CET-4

90
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,920
I don't want to see you anymore

91
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,400
Alright

92
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,360
I will buy you a luxury meal

93
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,760
Promise?

94
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,760
I'll keep my promise

95
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,200
If you're into someone for a long time,

96
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,920
but you didn't tell her because

97
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,400
you're afraid of losing her

98
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,360
Now, you will really lose her

99
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,000
if you keep hiding your feeling

100
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,120
What will you do?

101
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,720
If it were me,

102
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,350
I would let her know

103
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,110
What if you lose her after that?

104
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,880
Then I'll end it smartly

105
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,040
and start a new relationship

106
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,800
I have never thought
you are so experienced

107
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,960
Why should we move the tents?

108
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,880
The tents are too close to the sea

109
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,880
It's windy and the tide will be in

110
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,280
Moreover, we didn't drop any anchor

111
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,800
It's unsafe for lack of grip

112
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,640
What about here?

113
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,480
Okay

114
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,560
I will set it here

115
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,760
Alright

116
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,840
Si Tu Mo

117
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,280
Pull it

118
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,760
Slowly! What if I fall down?

119
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,480
Get up again

120
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,400
Are you finished?

121
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,520
Drop the anchor

122
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,000
How? Do we have a hammer?

123
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,640
Use your internal strength

124
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,520
It's not funny

125
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,960
I know who has it, wait for a while

126
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,360
How did you know I brought the heels?

127
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,920
Didn't you change it

128
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,440
in the car for selfie?

129
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,200
Hit it lightly, it's very expensive

130
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,080
What's wrong?

131
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,320
I couldn't sleep and came out for a walk

132
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,400
What are you holding?

133
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,520
A selfie stick

134
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,160
Just trying it

135
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,960
What's wrong?

136
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,800
Aren't you taking a photo?

137
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,360
Come on

138
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,200
Gu Wei Yi

139
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,440
What?

140
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,080
Are you hungry?

141
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,680
I'm starving

142
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,280
Any left over foods?

143
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,920
I guess no

144
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,760
I'm hungry

145
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,520
Let's go

146
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,200
Where to?

147
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,640
To get you some food

148
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,520
Can you catch it?

149
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,720
Sure

150
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
My god, you caught it!

151
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,080
A crab and it's still alive

152
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,480
Let me see

153
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,200
My goodness

154
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,000
Let me try

155
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,160
Can I?

156
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,520
What's that?

157
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,720
Quickly catch it

158
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,080
What was that?

159
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,400
A mantis prawn

160
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,400
You are so annoying

161
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,280
The prawn is alive too

162
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,960
How to grill this with no fire?

163
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,880
I wanted to try drilling wood for fire for a long time

164
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,760
Are you serious?

165
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,120
You tell me

166
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,680
So how to grill it?

167
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,880
As a nerd

168
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,720
what idea can you think of?

169
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,040
What a good smell!

170
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Any salt with you?

171
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,720
It will be delicious with some salt

172
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,880
What's this?

173
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,040
Sea water

174
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,120
Are you crazy? Is that edible?

175
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,160
The salt inside the
sea water was about 3.5%

176
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,400
It means

177
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,280
there's 35g of salt

178
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,040
out of 1000g sea water

179
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,880
Moreover,

180
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,440
the temperature of
an open fire is 700 degrees

181
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,080
So,

182
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,640
nothing can stay alive

183
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,360
Thanks to a scientist like you

184
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,720
You granted whatever I requested

185
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,320
You are my Doraemon

186
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,960
Let's eat

187
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,200
It's hot, be careful

188
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,360
Have some

189
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,880
What a nicely grilled prawn!

190
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,040
Nice smell

191
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,680
But we have only one

192
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,480
Take it

193
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,440
Take it, I don't like it

194
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,000
Why?

195
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,840
Allergy

196
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,400
and it looked like a giant cockroach

197
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,840
It sounds like sour grapes

198
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,160
If you don't want it

199
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,120
I'll throw it away

200
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,000
I want it

201
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,720
Take this

202
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,640
Mo Mo, we'll leave first

203
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,400
Bye

204
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,360
Drive safe

205
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,160
Bye

206
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,080
Drive safe

207
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,280
You hand was hurt

208
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,800
We don't want to risk our life with you

209
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,440
It doesn't matter

210
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,080
Gu Wei Yi, you drive the car

211
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,800
You'll be my navigator
Okay

212
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,879
Girls are weak in sense of direction

213
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,800
Let me help you

214
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,199
What did you say?

215
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,240
Say it again

216
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:21,840
Nothing

217
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,559
I'm weak in sense of direction

218
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,320
Turn left at the junction in front

219
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,960
There is no junction in front

220
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,920
Really?

221
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,080
Did I get it wrong?

222
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,160
Impossible

223
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,760
You are right, we're not there yet

224
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,320
Don't get nervous

225
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,600
Alright

226
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,200
Drink some water?

227
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,440
No, thanks

228
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,920
"Arrived the destination"

229
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,600
Si Tu Mo

230
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,640
Someone is waiting for you

231
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,360
Is my mother here?

232
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,840
It's it

233
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,040
Get back to work

234
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,200
Why don't you give it a name

235
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,880
and take it for a walk everyday?

236
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,560
Giving it a name is a good idea

237
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,760
Then give it one

238
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,320
I got it

239
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,720
What?

240
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,080
Circle

241
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,160
Circle fits its look, doesn't it?

242
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,000
Alright, thank you, bye

243
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,560
Hello

244
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,120

I'm the new intern, Si Tu Mo

250
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,120
The HR Dept. told me to report to you

251
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,280
Hello, welcome to our department

252
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,480

Li Na is our Creative Executive Director

256
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,240
Hello, I'm the new intern, Si Tu Mo

257
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,040
Hello, I'm Li Na, come with me

258
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,000
Alright

259
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,080
This is your seat

260
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,920
He is the Art Editor, Ain

261
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,960
New colleague, Mo Mo

262
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,640
Hello

263
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,640
Hello

264
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,200
I have done the introduction

265
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,440
You may report to the HR

266
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,200
and help me get a sample
of roll-up banner downstairs

267
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,120
Alright

268
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,480
What a...

269
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,800
So sorry

270
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,600
Be careful

271
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,880
Will you get together with Fu Pei 

272
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
after graduation?

273
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,040
Xu Jie Er

274
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,000
It's you!

275
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,480
Why are you carrying things here?

276
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,920
I'm an intern here

277
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,600
So am I

278
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,200
Which department are you in?

279
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,080
Creative Department No.4

280
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,240
Me too

281
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,240
Could you lead me the way?

282
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:12,720
Sure

283
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,080
Let's go

284
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,680
Let me help you

285
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,680
When did you report?

286
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,720
I just arrived

287
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,120
So did I

288
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,560
Is it heavy?

289
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,360
It's okay

290
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,920
Come in

291
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,400
Director,she is the new intern, Xu Jie Er

292
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,280
You are Jie Er?

293
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,800
Welcome

294
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,080
Mo Mo, you may leave now

295
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,480
How has Mr. Xu been?

296
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,880
Haven't seen him for a long time

297
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,800
He is fine

298
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,880
Let's go

299
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,800
Dear all

300
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,840
From today onward,

301
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
we're back to the new campus

302
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,640
Are you clear with the duty

303
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
I have just given to you?

304
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,040
Yes

305
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,880
Professor, you didn't give me any duty

306
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,280
You should focus

307
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,560
on your thesis of your Master Degree

308
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,240
But I want to join the experiment

309
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,520
The most important thing

310
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,840
is to select the topic of thesis

311
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,360
You will run out of time

312
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,040
It has no conflict between
the thesis and the experiment

313
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,800
Have you done the calculation

314
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,480
that I gave you the other day?

315
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,280
Not yet

316
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,600
Xie Yu Yin

317
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,400
Human has his limited energy

318
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,560
Now

319
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,680
you should focus on the thesis

320
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,680
But I really want to join the experiment

321
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,760
I have been doing it

322
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,080
since undergraduate

323
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,520
I can't accept that

324
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,720
you want me to stop

325
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,280
I don't mean to stop you,
but just afraid that

326
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,240
you may slow down the experiment

327
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,120
Can I join it

328
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,720
once I have done the calculation?

329
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,360
Alright

330
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,480
Pass up the calculation by tomorrow

331
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,880
Tomorrow?

332
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,200
Even the professor can't do it himself

333
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,880
No problem

334
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,320
Listen

335
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,200
I want a calculation without any error

336
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,400
Professor Jiang, I want to ask something

337
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,640
The experiment...

338
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,440
How far have you done the calculation?

339
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,400
Don't you need to pass up by tomorrow?

340
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,840
I just said it in anger

341
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,040
It's impossible to get it done

342
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,120
It can be done if we work together

343
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,920
Do you know how to do it?

344
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,120
Of course

345
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,640
Hello

346
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,480
Hello, we have put your parcel

347
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,120
in the mail box

348
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,240
It's fresh food

349
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,240
Please get it as soon as possible

350
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,040
Okay

351
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,160
Mo Mo

352
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,400
Why are you here?

353
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,320
To pick you up from work

354
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,240
Are you crazy?

355
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,080
Let me buy you dinner

356
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,800
No, thanks, I'm busy

357
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,600
Are you still angry with me?

358
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,640
What I have done to Wang Shan
was just a misunderstanding

359
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,080
It has nothing to do with me

360
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,240
I want to go back now

361
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,440
Mo Mo

362
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,400
Fu Pei

363
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,120
It's been a long time

364
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,560
How are you?

365
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,640
You two still together?

366
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,760
No

367
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,320
You two work together?

368
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,920
Why didn't you tell me?

369
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,520
We didn't know until today

370
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,680
Right?

371
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,040
I leave first

372
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,640
Fu Pei

373
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,520
Which way are you going?

374
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,920
That way

375
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,360
So am I. Let's go together

376
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,040
Alright

377
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,920
Let's go

378
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,040
Dad

379
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,080
I'll go to your place tomorrow
Have lunch with me

380
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,920
I don't have time

381
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,120
The signal is poor here, I'll hang up

382
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
Your dad?

383
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,920
I still can remember
what he had done to us

384
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,280
although it's been so many years

385
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
He made us so scared

386
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,480
that we broke up the next day

387
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,360
Let's go

388
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,800
Hello

389
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,640
Hello, mom

390
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,360
What did you send to me?

391
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,760
I have made you

392
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,960
some sauced beef

393
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,000
You and Xiao Gu may have it with rice

394
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,000
What rice?

395
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,400
We don't know how to cook

396
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,000
I knew it

397
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,000
That's why I made you the sauced beef

398
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,600
Xiao Gu can have it with beer

399
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,000
So troublesome

400
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,600
No trouble at all

401
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,560
Why should I take care of him?

402
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,040
I'm tired too

403
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,720
Alright

404
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,240
Are you really my mum?

405
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,880
Hello

406
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,480
Why aren't you back yet?

407
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,240
I'll stay at the lab tonight

408
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,720
You should tell me earlier

409
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
Okay, I will tell you next time

410
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,200
That's all, bye

411
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,600
It's not my concern

412
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,600
Shall we take a rest and grab a bite?

413
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,080
It's okay, let's hurry up finish it

414
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,760
Circle

415
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,160
Your dad is not coming back,
don't you care?

416
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,800
"Low power"

417
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
"Turning off"

418
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,840
"Low power"

419
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,200
"Turning off"

420
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,320
Thank you

421
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
I take a nap first

422
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,840
She made it

423
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,720
It's impossible

424
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,080
I think so too

425
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,280
Can I take part in the experiment?

426
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,440
Wait

427
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,400
Did you simply make up the data

428
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,320
to fool me?

429
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,360
Professor!

430
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,360
Let me pick a few and
do the calculation myself

431
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,400
Gu Wei Yi, Zhou Lei

432
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,440
Help me do it

433
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,680
Alright

434
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,800
Gu Wei Yi

435
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,280
You're disrespectful recently

436
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,160
Look at your senior

437
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,320
She has done such difficult
calculation in a night

438
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,320
How about you?

439
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,680
You're sleeping here

440
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,680
Professor, Gu Wei Yi...

441
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,440
See, she is trying to protect you

442
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,840
Don't you feel ashamed?

443
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,520
No, he doesn't

444
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,600
Because he did two thirds of these

445
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,240
What?

446
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,200
Yes, I did it, is the result wrong?

447
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,680
Impossible

448
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,520
An undergraduate can't do this

449
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,960
Professor, Xia Yu Yin is telling lies

450
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,200
just to protect him

451
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,960
It might be possible

452
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,320
if it was Gu Wei Yi

453
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,120
Then...

454
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,840
Professor, can you ask him
to do it in front of me?

455
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,480
Zhou Lei

456
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,840
only agrees with it
after he gets stricken down by Gu Wei Yi

457
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,320
The fighting of two geniuses

458
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,400
I feel pity for Zhou Lei
to get hurt every time

459
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,440
Professor

460
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,640
Can I take part in the experiment?

461
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,960
Forget about it

462
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,560
It was done by Gu Wei Yi

463
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,960
Not you

464
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,520
You said you wanted accurate results

465
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,920
You never specify who to calculate it

466
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,320
Can you really carry on?

467
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,320
Yes

468
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,920
Professor, can I stop?

469
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,280
I want to go back to sleep

470
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,960
Ask if Zhou Lei agrees

471
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,720
Why isn't he back yet?

472
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,760
That's all

473
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,760
Alright

474
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,480
Please wait for a while

475
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,080
The food here is delicious

476
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,760
Michelin 3 Stars

477
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,960
A very famous restaurant

478
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
Thanks a lot, Director Fu

479
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,240
Not Director Fu

480
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,200
You should call me Boss

481
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,880
You are so funny

482
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:55,960
Dad

483
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,800
Here you come

484
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,160
Sit down

485
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,800
Why didn't you pick up my call?

486
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,200
I put it in the silent mode

487
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,040
My son, Fu Pei

488
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,640
A student of Management
in Southern University

489
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,160
Southern University?

490
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,160
Must be a top student

491
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,360
Of course

492
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,440
Son, this is my new assistant

493
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,880
You may call her Aunt Ling Ling

494
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,360
Why are you here?

495
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,480
Where is mom?

496
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,040
I came here on business

497
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,400
Why would I bring her?

498
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,920
She can't help me in business

499
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,840
Is that so?

500
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,920
Mind your attitude

501
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,840
What major are you taking?

502
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,800
Are you about to graduate?

503
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,760
This year

504
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,200
An elder is asking you,
answer it properly

505
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,440
How did I teach you?

506
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,360
It doesn't matter

507
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,320
She's not my elder

508
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,240
She is about my age

509
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,040
But you call her my elder

510
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
How could you say it?

511
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,360
Director Fu

512
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,880
My schoolmate knew that
I'm here on business

513
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,200
and she wants to meet me

514
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,520
Perhaps, I shall leave first

515
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,240
Enjoy the meal

516
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,520
Come with me

517
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,440
Now you've grown up

518
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,120
Is this what you've learnt

519
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,520
from the university?

520
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,840
Do you think no one can bother you

521
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
after you get into the university?

522
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,000
Let me tell you

523
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,480
Don't dream of it

524
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,520
You are to listen to me

525
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,520
as long as you are my son

526
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,520
You're just like your mother

527
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,960
You two are ungrateful

528
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,920
Don't mention my mom

529
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,680
Why not?

530
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,960
Your mother is not a good person

531
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,360
She left you alone

532
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,920
when you're small

533
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,320
It's because you were messing about

534
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,400
So what?

535
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,560
She was the one who left you

536
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,560
Do you think she
came back for your sake?

537
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,840
You are wrong

538
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,000
All she wants is my money

539
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,280
I have plenty of money

540
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,560
If you don't have money,

541
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,480
no one will stay by your side

542
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,320
No one will care about you

543
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,760
I tell you

544
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,320
No one

545
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,120
What's that look?

546
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,600
How dare you?

547
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,880
There will be!

548
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,640
Gu Wei Yi

549
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,320
Gu Wei Yi

550
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,640
Gu Wei Yi

551
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,360
Gu Wei Yi

552
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,480
Is he dead?

553
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,400
What are you doing?

554
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,640
I'm calling you to eat the sauced beef

555
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,160
Come on

556
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,680
Has the ghost come out?

557
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,960
Has it?

558
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,160
Has it come out?

559
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,920
Has it?

560
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,280
Why did you watch it
since you're scared?

561
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,120
Why did you watch it since
you're not scared?

562
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,680
Finished

563
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,280
I sliced the meat, so you wash the plate

564
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,000
You finished so fast

565
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,240
There is more in the fridge

566
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,000
Go get it

567
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,440
Who is it?

568
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
Who will come during mid night?

569
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,880
What are you doing?

570
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,200
Let me open it

571
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,280
Just to open the door

572
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,400
Why do you bring the knife?

573
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,480
A girl shouldn't open
the door at night

574
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:51,300
Here comes the Easter egg

575
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,160
Si Tu Mo

576
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,120
What's wrong?

577
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,840
I know the pattern
password of your phone

578
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,040
How do you know?

579
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,080
You drew it many times in front of me

580
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,480
