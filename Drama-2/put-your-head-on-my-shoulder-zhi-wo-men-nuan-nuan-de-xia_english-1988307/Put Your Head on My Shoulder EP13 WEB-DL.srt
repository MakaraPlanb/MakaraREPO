00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,300
Do you think I'm cute?

4
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:52,860
Cute

5
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,300
So cute

[Episode 13]

7
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,540
We meet again

8
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,860
What a coincidence!

9
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,460
Yes

10
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,100
There's something that I'd like to ask

11
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,060
Do you think...

12
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,860
Do you think there's a pure friendship
between a man and a woman?

13
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,260
You're staying with Gu Wei Yi,

14
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,220
but you two are not a couple

15
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,500
So I'm wondering about it

16
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,260
Or you guys...

17
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:00,980
No

18
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,700
We're just friends

19
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,940
But when a man stays with a woman,

20
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,780
you might...

21
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,660
Absolutely no

22
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,700
Senior

23
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,020
Why did you ask?

24
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,500
Are you into Gu Wei Yi?

25
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,180
That's right

26
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,260
Oh yeah

27
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,620
He said he'll come for lunch with me

28
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,420
Why didn't he come?

29
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,580
I thought he's busy with the
experiments in the old campus

30
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,060
We moved here long time
ago, didn't he tell you?

31
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,220
No

32
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,740
Maybe he thinks I'm not important...

33
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,900
Maybe he thinks it's not important

34
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,380
and he doesn't need to tell me

35
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,420
Yeah, as you're not
helping in the experiments

36
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,220
Gu Wei Yi

37
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,700
Let me call him

38
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,780
You're so slow, don't eat

39
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,500
You...

40
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,060
I haven't taken my lunch yet

41
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,660
I'll buy you a treat

42
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,210
Where's Si Tu Mo?

43
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,780
Let's dig in

44
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,860
What's happened?

45
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:53,740
Let's eat outside

46
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,700
Didn't you want to eat outside?

47
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,620
What's happened?

48
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,820
The food at the canteen was suck

49
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,820
You seem like trying to run away

50
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,300
I'll buy you a treat outside

51
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:02,900
Want to go?

52
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,540
Sure

53
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,420
Let's go

54
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,540
Wait

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,100
I need to send the meal box to Ke

56
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,180
Let me call him to get it himself

57
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,660
What?

58
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,100
My mobile phone

59
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,780
I left it at the canteen

60
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,980
As well as my meal card

61
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,180
I'll kill you if my phone goes missing

62
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,540
No need, I'll commit suicide myself

63
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,260
Your phone is with you, huh?

64
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:27,940
Hello

65
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,900

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,460
See you in the lab

70
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,300
Okay

71
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,980
Gu Wei Yi is keeping it

72
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,820
and he's back to the lab

73
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,020
Let's see him after lunch

74
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,900
I've promised Ke to go for a movie

75
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,500
Help me to keep the phone in the dorm

76
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,380
Okay

77
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,380
Let's go for lunch

78
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,940
I must have something expensive

79
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,740
No way

80
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,340
No way

81
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,380
I have no money

82
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,780
Gu...

83
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,300
How? Is it cute?

84
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,740
It's so cute

85
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,500
How could you let
Professor Jiang to chase it out?

86
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,740
Don't bring me into this

87
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,620
Do you think I'm cute?

88
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,980
I'll come to you if you don't response

89
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,380
Okay

90
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,660
Cute

91
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,900
Are you Gu Wei Yi's friend?

92
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,660
Professor Jiang

93
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,140
Are you looking for him?

94
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,660
I want to get something from him

95
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,620
Where's he?

96
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,260
I don't know

97
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,020
I'm here

98
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,900
What are you doing there?

99
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,180
Thinking of something

100
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,020
Thinking?

101
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,540
Alright

102
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,300
Take your time

103
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,420
Have you been waiting long?

104
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,420
Just arrived

105
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,140

114
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,260
-I...
-I'm not alright

115
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,220
What's wrong again?

116
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,620
Jealous again?

117
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,740
I didn't do anything

118
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:16,940
Class

119
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,860
Let's call it a day

120
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,260
It's about time

121
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,820
Okay

122
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,060

125
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,020
Zhou Lei

126
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,980
Wait a moment

127
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,900
Stay here

128
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,220
Please clean the lab

129
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,860
thoroughly

130
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,379
Professor Jiang

131
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,820
Why me?

132
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,460
How dare you ask?

133
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,380
Your kitten made

134
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,780
the whole lab dirty

135
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,700
Didn't you see it?

136
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,180
You must clean it up

137
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:43,579

138
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,140
Let me clean it

139
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,420
Professor Jiang

140
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,460
He offered himself to clean it

141
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,610
Aren't you ashamed?

142
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,250
Look at Gu Wei Yi

143
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,460
and look at yourself

144
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,220
Oh, no!

145
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,020
Are you going to give
him an extra lesson?

146
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,340
Stay here for the extra lesson then

147
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,420
Take your time

148
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:09,700

149
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,340
What's your trick?

150
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,380
I'm waiting for someone

151
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,420
Who?

152
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,860
Okay

153
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,860
You may clean it yourself

154
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,980
I'm leaving first

155
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,820
Take your time

156
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,660
Love can make ones do everything

157
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,420
I'm leaving, take your time!

158
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,580
Bye

159
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:19,660
Xiao Gu

160
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,100
What brings you here?

161
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,220
I'm waiting for someone

162
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,420
Waiting for someone?

163
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,300
Call her and ask her to come down

164
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,940
She didn't pick up the call

165
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,700
Whom are you looking for?

166
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,180
Let me bring her

167
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,700
It's alright

168
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,500
I'll wait for a while here

169
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,700
Now you're here, don't be ashamed

170
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,420
Are you waiting for her?

171
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,820
Is she the girl you
mentioned on that day?

172
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,740
No

173
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,300
It creeps me out

174
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,140
Both of them are a lovely couple

175
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,660
You can't make them apart

176
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,660
They're a couple?

177
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,260
You know them?

178
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,860
The guy waits for her everyday

179
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,020
They used to bring many books along

180
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,780
when they went out

181
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,580
They study even in love

182
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,180
I have set hope on them

183
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,020
Stop!

184
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,060
This is girl's dorm.
What are you doing here?

185
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,940
I left something in the dorm

186
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,780
Call her and let her bring it to you

187
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:22,900
That's crap!

188
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,060
Remember to miss me

189
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,780
Gu Wei Yi

190
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,420
What brings you here?

191
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,660
Waiting for Si Tu Mo

192
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,740
Sorry for that day

193
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,260
That day?

194
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,340
What's that?

195
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,860
What he meant?

196
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,420
The day we went to Mo Mo's house

197
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,620
and cooked porridge for him

198
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,260
You don't have to be afraid

199
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,780
You helped him, didn't you?

200
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,780
He thought I helped you to get Mo Mo

201
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,540
He's angry with me

202
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,980
You really tried to bring us together

203
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,260
It's all my fault

204
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,180
Sorry

205
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,980
I accept your apology

206
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,340
Fu Pei

207
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,060
We need to talk

208
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,300
We shall go for a fight

209
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,980
because of the previous incident

210
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,940
Did you tell Si Tu Mo
about you and Wang Shan?

211
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,340
We have made it clear

212
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,380
You meant...

213
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,940
Gu Wei Yi

214
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,380
I seldom see you in the look

215
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,780
We've been living together
in the dorm for 4 years

216
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,500
You only look normal today

217
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,780
Answer my question

218
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,180
We have made it clear

219
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,460
She doesn't like me

220
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,620
I don't like her too

221
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,980
We're apart

222
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,300
She could

223
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,300
get into

224
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:35,860
someone else

225
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,020
I could get into Wang Shan too

226
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,500
We can't stop each other

227
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:46,940
Really?

228
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,020
Of course

229
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,780
Gu Wei Yi

230
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
You should back up me

231
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,620
I was hurt by Mo Mo

232
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,300
and it left a shadow in my heart

233
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,900
Why are you laughing?

234
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,020
You snatched my girlfriend

235
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,980
You're such a bad boy

236
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,620
You know?

237
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,180
Was she your girlfriend at that time?

238
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,940
Almost

239
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,860
I feel like give you a whack

240
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,940
Let's fight

241
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,140
Don't call her Mo Mo again
if I beat you down

242
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,340
Are you getting crazy today?

243
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,660
Are you calling me?

244
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,260
Why didn't you pick up the call?

245
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,420
I was in the bathroom and my
phone was in the living room

246
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,780
You're home?

247
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,020
Why didn't you tell me?

248
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,460
Why should I?

249
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,820
Alright, bye

250
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,580
She off the phone, huh?

251
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,500
Mo Mo is not easy to be handled

252
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,140
Alright

253
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
Si Tu Mo

254
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,380
Si Tu Mo

255
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,020
I won't call her Mo Mo again

256
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,260
Insane

257
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,960
Do you think I'm cute?

258
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,880
Cute

259
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,120
So cute

260
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,457
"Not cute at all"

261
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,079
You have the keys, right?

262
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,000
Can't you hear it?

263
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,439
It's a song

264
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,360
No

265
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:21,799
Listen

266
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,680
"If I had a wand"

267
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,680
"I can be big, small and pretty"

268
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,800
"I want to get a house which full"

269
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,110
"with comics and chocolates"

270
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,310
"If I had a machine cat"

271
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,280
"I'll call it Doraemon"

272
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,400
"A hopter and time tunnel
can bring us to everywhere"

273
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,040
Stop pressing it

274
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,320
Is the juice nice?

275
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,520
Try to drink more
than 10 bottles and see

276
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,600
Do you want to drink it with a mug?

277
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
I did use a mug

278
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,520
Si Tu Mo

279
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,880
What's wrong?

280
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,080
Are't you working in
an adverstising company?

281
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,840
Why did you only look into

282
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,920
the flavour?

283
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,800
What are you looking at?

284
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,320
Show you something magic

285
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,200
No, thanks

286
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,840
Take a look

287
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,240
Come on

288
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,280
The orange juice under zoom 2000X

289
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,000
What is this? Why is it moving?

290
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,880
Microorganism?

291
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,880
Let me see

292
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,960
Not microorganism

293
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,080
It's Brownian motion

294
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,880
Your cutie suddenly appears

295
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,480
Do you think I'm cute?

296
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,280
I'll come to you

297
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,840
if you don't response

298
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,280
Get back to your room

299
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
You are disturbing me

300
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,560
For you

301
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,680
What's this?

302
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,680
Take a look

303
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,360
I don't want it

304
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,160
This is out of print

305
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,640
Where did he get it?

306
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,800
I love it

307
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,760
Gu Wei Yi

308
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,960
Finally, you bring it back

309
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,040
Let me try it

310
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:03,880
Let me see

311
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,600
Gu Wei Yi

312
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,000
You're staying outside

313
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,600
So?

314
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,040
You are the one

315
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,720
who stays outside among us

316
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,240
Now we have an honour task

317
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,280
for you

318
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,680
I'm not interested

319
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,400
Professor Jiang doesn't allow me
to bring the kitten into the lab

320
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,800
He's extremely strict these few days

321
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,600
Are you willing to
see the kitten homeless?

322
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,520
Yes, I'm

323
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,920
What an emotionless killer!

324
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,200
We received the message
from the client yesterday

325
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,920
They have changed their spokesman

326
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,280
to a new artist

327
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,520
His name is...

328
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,600
Lin Zhi Cun

329
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,680
Yes, Lin Zhi Cun

330
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,240
Jie Er

331
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,920
Find out his information

332
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,480
and sort it out

333
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,120
Okay

334
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,520
So, we should change

335
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,080
our thinking as well

336
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,440
Don't think he's famous like super star

337
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,440
Zhao Xue Yu

338
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,520
Don't think about
the difficulty of shooting

339
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,160
Focus on the creativity

340
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,440
Li Na

341
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,040
Get several proposals
done in these few days

342
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,080
Okay

343
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,120
One more thing

344
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,400
There's a graphic

345
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,480
design competition recently

346
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,200
We have distributed the message in OA

347
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,680
You may look into it

348
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,600
if you're interested

349
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,120
Gu Wei Yi

350
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,440
What brings you here?

351
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,400
Buying books

352
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,480
The perspective of advertising?

353
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,280
What now?

354
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,800
Are you sitting for advertising?

355
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,000
I just read it for fun

356
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,880
For fun?

357
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,680
I don't think so

358
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,000
Let me think about it

359
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,800
Who works in an advertising company?

360
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,720
I knew

361
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,160
I'm leaving

362
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,480
Don't go

363
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,840
I haven't finished

364
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,520
Take your time, I'll walk around there

365
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,240
Why did you buy the book?

366
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,760
Si Tu Mo always gets mad
without reason recently

367
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,160
I'm wondering if it's related to her job

368
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,240
What's wrong with you?

369
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,440
You said you stop...

370
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,080
I feel happy for you

371
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,880
Finally, you're growing up

372
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,640
and know how to take your initiative

373
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,920
Do you think you can

374
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,800
find the answer from the book?

375
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,520
So?

376
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,600
Only several conditions
will make a girl mad

377
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,680
Can't eat or sleep well

378
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,760
and the menstruation pain

379
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,080
I don't think so

380
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,720
Well...

381
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,640
Tell me what happened recently

382
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,840
Lin Zhi Cun is quite handsome

383
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,640
Really?

384
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,600
Send me the picture

385
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
I'll send it to the chat group

386
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,040
Okay

387
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,000
Mo Mo, have a look

388
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,720
Is he good-looking?

389
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,960
Look at it

390
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,240
Is he good-looking?

391
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,480
Not bad

392
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,920
Look at his mouth

393
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,280
Do you want to kiss him?

394
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,400
No

395
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,840
You're loyal to Fu Pei

396
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,920
Fu Pei and I are not...

397
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,720
What?

398
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,800
We're not a couple

399
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,080
Who is your boyfriend then?

400
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,240
Look at your face

401
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,440
Tell me!

402
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,800
Get back to your seat

403
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,600
No way

404
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,520
See ya

405
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,720
Are you in love?

406
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,760
No

407
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,680
Liar

408
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,840
Your face told me that you're in love

409
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,760
Or you met

410
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,360
a flirt?

411
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,520
Cute

412
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,680
So cute

413
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,080
This is what happened recently

414
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,840
That means

415
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,400
Si Tu Mo was angry

416
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,440
because of your senior

417
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,480
it's easy

418
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,640
She gets jealous

419
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,000
Professor Jiang told me the same too

420
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,720
But the most recent,

421
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,640
she was angry outside of the lab

422
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,000
My senior wasn't there at that time

423
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,520
Are you sure?

424
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,240
Think about it again

425
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,160
Was she there?

426
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,040
Gosh!

427
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
She was in the room next to the stairs

428
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,160
She's playing with the kitten

429
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,040
I guess she was jealous
with our conversation

430
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,840
What a smart boy!

431
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,080
I know Si Tu Mo very well

432
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,560
Come to me

433
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,600
if you have any problem

434
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,640
I'll be your counselor

435
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,440
So, you'll get Si Tu Mo easily

436
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,120
You can't manage to get her, right?

437
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,280
Are you guys still chatting?

438
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,600
Just finished

439
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,240
Let's go

440
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Let's go for a movie

441
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,240
Don't bother the single man

442
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,560
See you

443
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,240
Senior

444
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,800
Don't set hope on Gu Wei Yi

445
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,000
He refused to help

446
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,440
Cold-blooded

447
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,120
Gu Wei Yi, can't you really...

448
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:52,800
Senior

449
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,920
Don't beg him

450
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,800
No need

451
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,400
When he finds his conscience back,

452
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,400
he'll be in tears of pain

453
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,520
and regret

454
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,560
Give it to me

455
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,240
I'll take care of it

456
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,840
No way

457
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,440
Cut it out! He just agreed

458
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Give the kitten to him

459
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,320
He refused to take care of it before

460
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,240
Why should I give it to him?

461
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,360
I tell you

462
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,320
Even if the kitten and I are homeless

463
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,600
or starve to death,

464
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,240
we won't beg him

465
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,200
What if I put the kitten

466
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,080
at the animal shelter

467
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,000
and bring it back after 2 days?

468
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,040
Will they allow it?

469
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,760
Call and ask them

470
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,000
Okay

471
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:40,960
Zhou Lei

472
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,160
Give it to me

473
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,600
I really want it

474
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
No way

475
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,720
What do you want me to do?

476
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,640
Beg me

477
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,360
I beg you

478
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,760
Gu Wei Yi

479
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,520
You begged me readily

480
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,920
I don't feel satisfied at all

481
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,520
Put it in my bag

482
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,000
Look

483
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,040
It's funny

484
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,800
Let me chat him first

485
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,880
That's right

486
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,440
The guy is handsome

487
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,520
Really

488
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,320
He's carrying a kitten

489
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,800
He must be a kind man

490
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,200
Try to chat him

491
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,720
-It's not appropriate
-Go!

492
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,440
Go ahead

493
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,640
Okay

494
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,400
Hello

495
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,920
The kitten is cute

496
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,400
I wanted to get a kitten for so long

497
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,680
Mew...

498
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,520
It's not mine

499
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,760
Where did you buy the bag?

500
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,600
I don't know

501
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,760
Could I add you in WeChat?

502
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:02,840
Look

503
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,840
Where did you get it?

504
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,760
I'll tell you later

505
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:09,680
Let's go home

506
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,400
All the handsome guys have a girlfriend

507
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,920
Where did you get it?

508
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,960
You want to raise a kitten?

509
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,080
It's Zhou Lei's kitten

510
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,200
He needs my help for several days

511
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,080
Cute?

512
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,800
Not bad

513
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,280
My senior said, this is
the cutest stage of a kitten

514
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,640
Really?

515
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,640
Wait, the kitten will have a faint

516
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,200
Alright

517
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,880
I'll teach you a secret
way from Si Tu Mo

518
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,520
A girl can't stop a sticker

519
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,720
Stick on her

520
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,880
Follow wherever she goes

521
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,720
What's wrong?

522
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,680
I don't know what to do with the kitten

523
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,680
Why did you

524
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,000
bring it back then?

525
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,040
Zhou Lei said, the rules
of the dorm is strict recently

526
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,880
He has nowhere for it

527
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,240
My senior stays in the dorm too

528
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,360
Please take care of it

529
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,000
Why should I?

530
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,680
I don't like kitten

531
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,640
Why did you bring it back then?

532
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,240
Because someone got it wrong

533
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,000
When we're in the
room next to the stairs,

534
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,640
I meant the kitten was cute,

535
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,960
not my senior

536
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,880
Actually...

537
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,800
Why do you want to
come for a movie suddenly?

538
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,000
I bought the tickets

539
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,440
We made a deal before

540
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,720
We wanted to make a date,
have a meal and go for a movie

541
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,400
I wanted to date you out

542
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,320
I won't let you out

543
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,760
I have an allergy to kitten

544
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,360
Stop mewing

545
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,560
I won't fall for that

546
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,960
Come out yourself

547
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,670
What's wrong?

548
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,520
I have an allergy

549
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,120
Really?

550
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,880
Even mantis prawn and kitten

551
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,440
You're really too much

552
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,080
I'm serious

553
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,320
I'll bring it into my room

554
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,630
So cute

555
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,720
"Arrived the destination"

556
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,160
Come on!

557
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,440
I want to kiss you

558
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,480
Good

559
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,080
I like you the most

560
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,640
Si Tu Ding Dang is so cute

561
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,440
Like your name?

562
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,480
Ding Dang

563
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,760
I'm calling you Si Tu Ding Dang, okay?

564
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,760
So good

565
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:01,800
Hello

566
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,800
Si Tu Mo is staying in the room

567
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,760
and I can't stick on her

568
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,960
What?

569
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,240
Go to her room

570
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,520
She has a cat there

571
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,160
Cat?

572
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,160
Lure her out then

573
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,160
I'm in a movie, bye!

574
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,160
What's wrong?

575
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,600
It's okay

576
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,560
Let's go out and let it stay in the room

577
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,400
You may go out yourself

578
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,720
We don't have to go with you

579
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,080
I want to play with it

580
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,120
Close the door when you go out

581
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,520
Don't let it out

582
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200

584
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,120
Anything?

585
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,160
Come out for a while

586
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,040
I'm playing with Si Tu Ding Dang

587
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,280
It will go out if I open the door

588
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:26,960
Who?

589
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,520
Si Tu Ding Dang

590
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,600
I gave it the name

591
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,560
Why did you call me?

592
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,600
Let's clean the house

593
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,080
It's night time now

594
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,560
The house full with cat hair

595
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,560
Let Circle clean it

596
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:50,840
Circle is tired

597
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:51,920
It needs rest

598
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,200
I'm tired too

599
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,720
I need rest

600
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,560

will have healthy skin"

601
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,520

and so much bubble"

602
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,720
"Si Tu Ding Dang is pretty"

603
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,960
Don't be afraid, Ding Dang

604
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,760
I'll bath you

605
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,000
Don't be afraid of water

606
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,400
Good boy

607
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,040
Did it hurt you?

608
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,680
No

609
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,000
It's afraid of water

610
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,600
So, it screamed when
I put it into the water

611
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,000
What's this?

612
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,160
Mosquito bite, I scratched it myself

613
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,840
Aren't you having an allergy?

614
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:01,920
Sit down

615
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,960
Step back

616
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,800
Don't be angry

617
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,800
It didn't hurt you purposely

618
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,000
I'll come to you if you're angry

619
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,440
I'm not angry

620
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,280
Don't come near

621
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,240
I'm not angry

622
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,840
Ding Dang wants to eat dried fish

623
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,920
I have only cat food

624
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,200
No, dried fish

625
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,800
Okay, I'll buy for you

626
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,640
Ding Dang wants to thank you

627
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,440
It wants to give you a kiss

628
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,680
What are you doing?

629
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,640
Don't be ashamed

630
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,160

Step back

633
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,360
What if I don't?

634
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,840
What do you want to do?

635
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,360
Huh?

636
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,240
I'll kiss you then

637
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,880
You did it before

638
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,040
When you're drunk...

639
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,040
I'm just kidding

640
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,680
Don't be serious

Gu Wei Yi, do it

645
00:40:36,257 --> 00:40:37,257
Too many options

646
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:37,768
It's hard

647
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:38,643
