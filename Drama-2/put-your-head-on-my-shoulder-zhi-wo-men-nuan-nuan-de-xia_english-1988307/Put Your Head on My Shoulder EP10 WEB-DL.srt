[Episode 10]

4
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,300
It fell!

5
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:04,820
Let me see!

6
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,660
Take a selfie

7
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,100
with someone you like

8
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:15,780
Who?

9
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,060
What?

10
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,340
This is selfie

11
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,740
He took a photo of himself

12
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,100
What now?

13
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,420
I like myself

14
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,060
So lame

15
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,340
Let's change to another game

16
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,340
Ke

17
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,860
Be careful

18
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,780
Can you manage to go back?

19
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,100
What about overnight here?

20
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,500
Forget it

21
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,900
This is far away from our place

22
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,340
We have schedules for tomorrow

23
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,220
Are you alright?

24
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,500
Alright, don't worry

25
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,460
Hurry up!

26
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,140
-The Fatty is heavy
-Bye

27
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:10,460
You...

28
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,220
Be careful

29
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,300
Let me know once you're home

30
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,300
-Okay
-Bye

31
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,540
Take care of your room-mate

32
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,860
Gu Wei Yi!

33
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,380
Gu Wei Yi!

34
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,900
Go back to your room

35
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,300
Gosh!

36
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,540
You're so heavy

37
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,460
Take your time, I won't bother you

38
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,220
Gu Wei Yi!

39
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:14,900
Gu Wei Yi!

40
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,620
Gu Wei Yi!

41
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,500
Gu Wei Yi!

42
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,139
Gu Wei Yi!

43
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,460
I...

44
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:39,820
I...

45
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,770
I should just let you freeze

46
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:51,980
Rascal!

47
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,780
Take your breakfast

48
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,340
Thank you

49
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,580
Last night...

50
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,660
Did I trouble you?

51
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,700
Sorry

52
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,300
I shouldn't do that

53
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,220
without your permission

54
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,260
Actually,

55
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,140
I've liked you

56
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,580
since long time ago

57
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,540
So have I

58
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,380
What the crap!

59
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,820
So have I?

60
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,500
Take your breakfast

61
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,500
Thank you

62
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,420
Last night...

63
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,380
Did I trouble you?

64
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,260
Sorry

65
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,900
I shouldn't

66
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,420
let you clean it up alone

67
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,260
I have cleaned the
balloons in the living room

68
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,220
What's wrong?

69
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,980
You forgot it?

70
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,620
Don't you remember anything else?

71
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,460
Anything else?

72
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,540
What?

73
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,420
What's that?

74
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,140
It's okay

75
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,780
I don't want to eat,
I'm going to be late

76
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,100
You'll be alright

77
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,460
after finishing past year's papers

78
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,700
I have done many papers

79
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,940
You used to tell me the same

80
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,260
You have been in so many relationships

81
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,140
and you're still saying the same words

82
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:08,940
Wang Shan

83
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:09,900
Yes

84
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,740
You say it easily because

85
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,260
you never have a boyfriend right?

86
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,980
So what?

87
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,780
Will I get fined?

88
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,540
Only those who have never

89
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,860
loved will say it easily

90
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,460
You have a lot of experiences

91
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,540
Then do me a demo

92
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,380
Sure

93
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,700
I'm worried that you can't hold it

94
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,020
Says who?

95
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,100
Do you really think
you are an expert in love?

96
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,460
3 steps in dating

97
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,340
Go out for a meal, for a walk and a movie

98
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,900
I'll show you one by one

99
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,900
Let's see

100
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,300
Let's go

101
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,100
Please

102
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,420
Lu Lu!

103
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,620
Lu Lu, get up

104
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
Lu Lu

105
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,140
Quickly get up, it's urgent!

106
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,980
Help!

107
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,100
What's wrong?

108
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,420
Are you pregnant?

109
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,360
[Sorry, I really don't want to lose you]

110
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,180
[Sorry, I really don't want
to lose a friend like you]

111
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,700
Why are you so quiet?

112
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,820
You make me feel awkward

113
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,380
You look good

114
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,820
You should get a change earlier

115
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,380
Let's go

116
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,740
It's so cold

117
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,460
Cold wave is coming soon

118
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,900
I brought some warming tea

119
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
Do you want it?

120
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,700
Only for Gu Wei Yi?

121
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,780
For everyone here

122
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,140
Why did you only ask him?

123
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,420
Cut the crap!

124
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,620
Professor, do you want some tea?

125
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,020
You're young,

126
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,940
but weak

127
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,820
Look at me

128
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,220
Cold waves

129
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,500
don't affect me

130
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,900
I don't need any warming tea

131
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,340
I never drink it

132
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,340
Come on

133
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,500
Take a rest

134
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,340
Drink the ginger tea

135
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,060
I don't want it

136
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,060
What?

137
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,380
I have worked so hard for it

138
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,060
Quickly drink it

139
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,620
No food or drink are allowed in the lab

140
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,820
I'll drink it at home

141
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,420
That's crap!

142
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,620
You're busy with the experiments

143
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,860
and only reach home
in late night every day

144
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,300
You would ave finished it

145
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,300
if you didn't grumble at me

146
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,740
Quickly finish it, cut the crap!

147
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,020
Three of you, come and drink it

148
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,060
The weather is so cold

149
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,900
You drink it

150
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
It's enough

151
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,220
I have taken 2 bowls of it

152
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,660
This is ginger tea, not medicine

153
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,580
Don't show me that face

154
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,260
Hurry up

155
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,820
Xiao Gu, take some

156
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,620
Why did you give it to him?

157
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,140
I still have it here

158
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,060
Enough

159
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,620
Hurry up

160
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,260
All your proposals

161
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,020
were rejected by the art director

162
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,740
and the project was
assigned to the 3rd group

163
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,860
We couldn't fight even among ourselves,

164
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,860
let alone

165
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,840
the others companies

166
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,460
You know what the art director said?

167
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,860
Old-fashioned,

168
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,020
boring

169
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,100
He said,

170
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,540
only the idea of Mo Mo
and Jie Er can be accepted

171
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,020
But their proposal

172
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,380
is not professional at all

173
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,899
How could your people

174
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,540
not as competent as the interns?

175
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:15,729
Sorry

176
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:16,690
Well,

177
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,020
we have no project now

178
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,620
Just take a rest

179
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,500
Miss Sha Sha, we received an email

180
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,969
We got a project of fruit juice

181
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,180
I'll leave it to you

182
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,060
I don't care

183
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,900
What now?

184
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,420
We're not as good as the interns?

185
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,100
That's right

186
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,620
Took me several days to work it out

187
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,020
Okay, stop grumbling

188
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,020
We'll discuss the juice project later

189
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,380
I don't want to be criticised

190
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,220
as not professional again

191
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,380
Okay

192
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,860
Get back to your work
and prepare the proposal

193
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,140
They received negative
comments from the art director

194
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,580
and only ours was accepted

195
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,060
How dare she scold us?

196
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,780
Do you want to buy anything?

197
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,700
Just look around

198
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,260
Since we want to experience a date,

199
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,220
we should be holding hands

200
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,260
There's a milk tea house

201
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,740
Let's go for it

202
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,140
Besides...

203
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,700
You're the first girl
who paid in a date

204
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,420
Only two cups of milk tea

205
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,700
I still can afford it

206
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,900
Let's go play games

207
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:16,980
Let's go

208
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,620
Are you ready?

209
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,380
Sure!

210
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,220
Come on!

211
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,020
I'm faster than you

212
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,980
You're left behind now

213
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,780
Wait! I'll overtake you

214
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,260
You can't beat me

215
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,140
I'm a super racer

216
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,260
Gosh...

217
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,340
You're speedy

218
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,460
I got you

219
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,660
No!

220
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,780
You're cheating

221
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820
What a speed!

222
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,260
Stop!

223
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,020
Let's play this

224
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,780
Can you catch it?

225
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,780
Don't look down on me

226
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,780
I'll catch one for you

227
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,180
I think I could break the record

228
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,460
Don't just stand here

229
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,700
Help me, Mo Mo

230
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,700
You didn't break the record

231
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,580
It's alright, play again

232
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,340
I suddenly recall

233
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,820
that I have an online class tonight

234
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,140
So sorry

235
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,180
We didn't go for a meal or a movie

236
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,740
Have to wait till next time

237
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,420
I'll tell you after I pick a movie

238
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,260
Why are you here?

239
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,060
We...

240
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,740
You guys went to buy

241
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,900
birthday gifts for Mo Mo?

242
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,420
I bought

243
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,700
a humidifier in Doraemon shape

244
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,300
Luckily we didn't buy the same one

245
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,060
No

246
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,500
We got it from the crane machine

247
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,180
Mo Mo's gift is on the way

248
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,340
I go back first

249
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,340
Bye

250
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,380
I actually didn't think so much

251
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,140
I thought all the girls like it

252
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:03,780
It's okay

253
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,180
It's not a real date anyway

254
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,220
But,

255
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,300
I hope you bear in mind

256
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,580
I don't like spicy food

257
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,300
horror films

258
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,220
or Doraemon

259
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,100
These are all Mo Mo's favourite

260
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,100
Not mine

261
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,340
I'm going to the class

262
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Can we

263
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,020
complete the process
of a date next time?

264
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,700
Sure

265
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,260
See you

266
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,780
The toys...

267
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,220
I'll keep them

268
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,540
Just to make you guilty

269
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,500
You're so mean

270
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,140
Bye

271
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,660
Just go ahead if you want to

272
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,140
text her or even meet her

273
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,420
Don't hesitate

274
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,740
I'll be late for experiments

275
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,380
Won't be back tonight

276
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,340
How could you forget the kiss?

277
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,300
Rascal!

278
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,620
Thank you

279
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,660
Gu Wei Yi, you caught a cold?

280
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,180
Don't come near to me

281
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,140
Mask

282
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,220
I'll find you a mask

283
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,300
Forget it

284
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,540
Xiao Gu

285
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,660
It doesn't matter

286
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,140
The experiment

287
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,100
is not urgent

288
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,220
You may go back and take a rest

289
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,820
"Don't come back then"

290
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,740
"I'll watch the ghost movie myself"

291
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,220
To avoid the infection,

292
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,340
I'll go back now
Alright

293
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,140
You did it very well

294
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,500
I wouldn't be able to do it

295
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,900
Fu Pei

296
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,900
Waiting for Si Tu Mo?

297
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,420
I'm rushing home, see you

298
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,420
Quarrel?

299
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,700
Let's go for hot pot together

300
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:55,780
Alright

301
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,660
I'll pass, enjoy yourselves

302
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,260
I want to go home

303
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,180
Let's go, the bill is on me

304
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,860
I want to thank you for
helping me on the proposal

305
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:02,740
I'll pass

306
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,660
Seriously

307
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,340
Let's go

308
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,340
-No, thanks
-Let's go

309
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,820
I'll pass...

310
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,060
This is the entrance to the office

311
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,100
People

312
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,660
might think we're fighting for a man

313
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,660
We did it indeed

314
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,540
Only spicy?

315
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,220
You guys didn't care

316
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,300
about me

317
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,380
Let's dig in and go home

318
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,140
Frankly, I never bless you guys

319
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
But I really wonder

320
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,180
what is happening now

321
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,460
Quarrel

322
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,820
or dishonesty?

323
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,260
It's my problem

324
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,700
I...

325
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,700
Sorry

326
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,100
Your problem?

327
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,700
It's most likely dishonesty

328
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,660
No

329
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,260
We're not the kind of relationship

330
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,700
Just normal friends

331
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,140
Alright

332
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,900
As long as you treat me as a friend

333
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,860
It seems I should

334
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,340
use the bathroom

335
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,860
to give you guys some space

336
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,780
Mo Mo

337
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:24,980
Sorry about that day

338
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,660
I wanted to say "that's alright",

339
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,100
but I can't do it

340
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,020
I'm still angry

341
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,780
Could you please don't turn up again?

342
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:36,820
And

343
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,700
I hope you don't treat Shan Shan

344
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,940
the way you treated me

345
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,060
I'm leaving now. See you no more

346
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,980
You said you won't be back tonight

347
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,700
Where did you go? Smell like hot pot

348
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,660
I just had a hot pot

349
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,380
With whom?

350
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,340
Fu Pei

351
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,660
You said you rejected him

352
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,980
He suddenly turned up

353
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,700
and he knows my colleague

354
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,380
It has nothing to do with me

355
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,060
Waiting for the bus?

356
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,660
Going back to the new campus?

357
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,860
So cold

358
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,260
What a waste!

359
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,620
We don't have radiators in the house

360
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,220
and it's not snowing

361
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,860
The weather is so cold

362
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,940
I...I wish to see snow

363
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,260
I've never made a snowman

364
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,500
I came from the North

365
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,220
So you're not afraid of cold, right?

366
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,380
We have radiators

367
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,460
Since it's so cold,

368
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,140
let's have a hot pot tonight

369
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,860
You had it last night, didn't you?

370
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,300
We can still have it tonight

371
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,060
It's cold

372
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,340
Hot pots are for cold weather

373
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,460
So lame

374
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,100
Here you are

375
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,860
Gu Wei Yi

376
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,460
What a smart boy!

377
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,220
Just in time when we
have adjusted the equipment

378
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,260
You're so smart

379
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,460
Turn it to the original then

380
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,220
I...

381
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,620
Gu Wei Yi, come on

382
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,420
Your senior is on a sick leave

383
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,860
So, you do it for her

384
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:38,580
Okay

385
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,260
Professor Jiang, why did you
ask him to do 2 experiments?

386
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,740
You never ask me to do it

387
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,220
This...

388
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,180
Take it

389
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:48,900
Please do it

390
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:08,980
Xiao Gu

391
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,660
It seems you're in a bad mood

392
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,660
Are you okay?

393
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,580
I'm okay

394
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,900
Really?

395
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,580
Yes

396
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,300
Gu Wei Yi

397
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,260
I told you I'm fine

398
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,540
I just want to ask about
the experiment record

399
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,180
Are you sure you're alright?

400
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,700
He just said it! Cut the crap!

401
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,340
Do your work

402
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,820
Hurry up!

403
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,260
That's right

404
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,500
I told you before

405
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,020
I really can't live with her anymore

406
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,340
I'm pissed off

407
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,940
She's really bad-tempered recently

408
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,900
It's hard to live with her

409
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,580
Like I owe her money

410
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,060
Always showing me her long face

411
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,460
As she's

412
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,580
not happy,

413
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,900
I wanted to buy her a treat

414
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,060
But she told me to get on diet

415
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,260
Too bad

416
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,140
Who knows?

417
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,620
I guess she's in love

418
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,140
People who are in love are insane

419
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,100
You meant,

420
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,900
the girl you like

421
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,620
met her ex-boyfriend?

422
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,060
The girl who pleaded for you

423
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,580
was not your girlfriend?

424
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,180
No interrupt please

425
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,260
You're worried she may leave you

426
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,940
but don't know what to do

427
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,740
And you are mad now, right?

428
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:52,940
Yes

429
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,980
It's so easy

430
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,820
The problem came from her ex-boyfriend

431
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,020
Is he also in our university?

432
00:31:59,380 --> 00:31:59,780
Yes

433
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,820
Beat him up

434
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,780
No way

435
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,620
You can't do that

436
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,180
No, you can't bring him down

437
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,740
Well,

438
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,500
you may request his counselor

439
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,220
to have a talk with him

440
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,020
Professor Jiang

441
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,060
Look at his face

442
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,140
What a snobby look!

443
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,420
Did I say it wrong?

444
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,860
How dare he doubt me!

445
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,380
Has he been in love before?

446
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,340
Enough

447
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,460
Carry on your experiment

448
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,660
Don't think too much

449
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,820
Do your work

450
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,260
Stay for a while after this

451
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,780
I'll give you something

452
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,980
It helped me to get my wife before

453
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,300
What are you chatting about?

454
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,340
Nothing

455
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,380
I want him

456
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,460
to clean the lab after this

457
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:49,820
I'm alright

458
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,340
Are you getting better?

459
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,980
Okay, I'll wait for you to come back

460
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,060
So handsome!

461
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,459
The hair style is extremely nice! So handsome!

462
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:15,820
Like a pineapple

463
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,020
What?

464
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,850
Like a pineapple

465
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,220
You hair looks like a toilet lid

466
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,620
So good-looking

467
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:39,809
Insane

468
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,539
I'll wait for you to come back

469
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,579
I'll wait for you to come back

470
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,180
To praise a girl

471
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:58,100
Not only her make-up or outfit,

472
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,380
but others

473
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,140
What's wrong?

474
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,980
I use a warming patch for stomach ache

475
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,060
I take you to the hospital

476
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,300
It's okay

477
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,900
Let's go

478
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,340
It's okay

479
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,140
I have my menstruation

480
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,860
Is it painful?

481
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,660
It's okay, I can stand it

482
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,780
You are strong

483
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,580
You folded the clothes nicely

484
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,860
Smooth and straight

485
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:06,980
Thank you

486
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,980
You're welcome

487
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,780
Most of the boys misunderstand that

488
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,260
all the girls feel scared
to talk about sex

489
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,220
When an energetic girl

490
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,060
is with the boy she likes,

491
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,540
talking about sex

492
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,780
in a simple and natural manner

493
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,100
will make her think you're interesting

494
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,780
The Animal's World?

495
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,500
Do you know why are

496
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,780
the Bombus Affinis going extinct?

497
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,940
What's that?

498
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,460
Bombus Affinis

499
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,860
Because they can't get
mating and breeding now

500
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,460
Why?

501
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,820
They're infected by a parasite

502
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,700
called Nosema bombi

503
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,860
The parasite

504
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,620
causes an edema so severe
that they can't breed

505
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,140
The edema swells up between

506
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,500
the soft tissues of its organ

507
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,980
So the drone is overweight

508
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,340
and can't bend to mate with the queen

509
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,460
The queen produces
male offspring by itself

510
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,220
But it needs fertilization
to get female offsprings

511
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,980
Could you explain it
in a straightaway language?

512
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,780
Overweight will cause

513
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,780
a failure in the sexual activity

514
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,860
Why are you laughing?

515
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,180
Nothing

516
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,820
I find it interesting

517
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,940
Overweight will cause extinction, huh?

518
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,300
Exactly

519
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,420
You're right

520
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,820
Where did you get

521
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,180
the strange information?

522
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,340
The Atlantic

523
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,460
What? I've never heard it

524
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,900
A foreign magazine

525
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,780
My senior brought it to the lab

526
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,740
I'll go to the bed,
remember to turn off the TV

527
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,420
In girl's view, what should

528
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,940
a sexy boy look like?

529
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,220
The answer might surprise you

530
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,940
First, hair

531
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,740
Among the girls whom I've interviewed,

532
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,700
hair style is their main concern

533
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,340
Mind your hair style

534
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,020
It is not only

535
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,060
important for actors

536
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,540
You hair looks like a toilet lid

537
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,860
[Here comes the Easter egg...]

538
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,860
Gu Wei Yi

539
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,420
What did Professor Jiang tell you?

540
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,860
To clean the lab

541
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:25,900
I wasn't born yesterday

542
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,420
I'm not falling for that

543
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,340
Xiao Gu, how?

544
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,260
Have you cleaned it up?

545
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,980
Stop! I bet you swapped the books

546
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,420
Just like in the movie

547
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,780
Swap them back!

548
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,260
Zhou Lei's always full of suspicion

549
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,620
I can't help him

550
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,380
See you

551
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,700
I just bought it

552
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,740
Professor Jiang

553
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,100
What did you tell him?

554
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,780
To clean the lab
