Yeah

70
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,680
It's a logo of the film studio

71
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,360
How can you make it in a rabbit's butt?

72
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,520
It's so cute

73
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,560
You don't know about it

74
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
What's this?

75
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:04,800
What's this?

76
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,840
You even draw the fur, huh?

77
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,440

88
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,160
I just want to see you

89
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Let's ask Aunt Xu's son

90
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,520
to take dinner together

91
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,080
Why didn't you listen to me?

92
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,520
I told you to inform me before you come

93
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,240
Why did you come in a sudden?

94
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,080
Why didn't you tell me?

95
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,320
You didn't respect me at all

96
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,880
I can't talk now

97
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,080
Don't ask him out

98
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,440
Or I'll be angry with you

99
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,520
Bye

100
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,080
What a beautiful place!

101
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Have a seat here

102
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,160
It's vacant

103
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,400
Come on

104
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,560
Look at the menu and
see what you want to eat?

105
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,400
Order here

106
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,240
So high-tech

107
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,720
I don't know about it

108
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,400
It's so simple, I'll teach you

109
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,400
It's okay

110
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,920
As long as your father can do it

111
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,120
Don't be so cheesy

112
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,440
Hi,

113
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,520

115
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,080
You're welcome

116
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,120
Let's dig in

117
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,120
How can we finish the food?

118
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,640
I told you to ask Xiao Gu out,

119
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
but you refused

120
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,120
I can finish it, you don't
have to call him

121
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,480
You're really cranky

122
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,600
You have been staying
at his house for so long

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,800
Now I'm here, I should visit him

124
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,560
and buy him a treat

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,400
It's alright, he's busy

126
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,760
Two of you seem so close

127
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,040
Mom

128
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,360
Alright

129
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,560
Don't be stubborn

130
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,560
I have

131
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,800
talked to Aunt Xu

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,720
Well

133
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,440
Let's go home
when Xiao Gu reaches home

134
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,480
Go home?

135
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,000
You and Xiao Gu's home

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,240
I told you that I will move out soon

137
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,440
Why do you want to go there?

138
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,880
You can't move out

139
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,320
I disagree with it

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,880
Moreover,

141
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
you are transferred

142
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,720
to another company now

143
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,040
Since you're mobile in workplaces,

144
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,560
where do you want to move?

145
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,480
Forget it

146
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,600
You must think about the safety

147
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,120
Aren't you worried
that I stay with a guy?

148
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,640
I...

149
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,920
That's why I'm here to observe him

150
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,039
Dig in

151
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,720
Aunt, have some tea

152
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,480
Be careful, it's hot

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,680
Thank you

154
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,360
What a nice tea!

155
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,040
Xiao Gu

156
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,240
Sorry that Mo Mo gives you

157
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,520
a lot of troubles recently

158
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,960
Thank you for taking care of her

159
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,360
I should have come earlier

160
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,200
But I had something
to do in the hometown

161
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,280
Thank you for coming

162
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,840
In fact, I did carry you

163
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,440
when you're small

164
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
My mother told me about it

165
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,960
You peed all over me

166
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,320
Well 

167
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,360
Time really flies

168
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,520
Now,

169
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,640
you're a big boy

170
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,000
You got a girlfriend?

171
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,040
No

172
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,720
You must choose a good one

173
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,600
Okay

174
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,400
Your mother said,

175
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,120
you're good at your studies

176
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,480
You have been sponsored by
the scholarship since you're small

177
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,040
But don't work too hard

178
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,560
in the studies

179
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,800
Okay

180
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,440
Studies is important

181
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,600
But you can't neglect
your personal things too

182
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,560
You must work hard

183
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,760
to get a girlfriend

184
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,120
Okay

185
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,760
How dare you?

186
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,160
Why are you laughing?

187
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,600
Do you have a boyfriend?
How dare you laugh?

188
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,280
Actually, both of you can...

189
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,680
Cut the crap, mom!

190
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,200
What did I say?

191
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,280
I'm not giving you pressure

192
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,120
I just merely say it

193
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,600
I just merely say it

194
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,480
Okay

195
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,760
What is your height and weight?

196
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,880
1.87m

197
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,040
65,000g

198
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,640
65,000g?

199
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
65kg

200
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,040
That's too thin of you

201
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,840
You have to take more food

202
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,240
Alright

203
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,480
I brought some walnuts for
you which I plant myself

204
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,680
in my hometown

205
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,280
This is good

206
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,840
for your brain

207
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Thank you, aunt

208
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,960
Well, let me make you

209
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,200
a dessert of walnut and black sesame

210
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,360
A scientist should eat
more walnuts and sesame

211
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,080
I'll make a yummy dessert for you

212
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,720
Mom, we don't have any sesame

213
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,480
It's late already. Let's go

214
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,880
Look

215
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,840
I brought some black sesame as well

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,960
The making is just simple and fast

217
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,720
Do you want to try my cooking?

218
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,360
I just don't want to disturb you

219
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,160
No, don't say that

220
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,160
Do you think I'm a busy body

221
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,080
and

222
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,360
you don't want to eat the dessert?

223
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,080
No

224
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,400
I'm craving for it

225
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,400
That's good

226
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,160
Well

227
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:40,800
What about

228
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,160
you help me

229
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,720
to open the walnuts

230
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,880
and get the nut from it?

231
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,480
I'll stir the sesame first

232
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,760
What's wrong with you?

233
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,500
[Midnight snack]

234
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,640
You girlfriend drinks beer too?

235
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,000
She is not my girlfriend

236
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,080
She doesn't drink beer

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I do

238
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,960
I want to stop my crush on you

239
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,920
You get drunk

240
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,160
Bullshit

241
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,720
What is our relationship?

242
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
What should we do between friends?

243
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,280
Hi

244
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,520
One take-away fried
rice noodle with beef

245
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,280
Okay

246
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,400
Please wait for a moment

247
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,200
Okay, thank you

248
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,520
Okay

249
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,200
Give me a baked noodle

250
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:19,840
Alright

251
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,640
Okay

252
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,960
Do you want it?

253
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,000
No, I don't

254
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,840
Just give me one

255
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,120
Okay

256
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,480
The food is ready

257
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,840
Thank you

258
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Come on

259
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,520
Okay

260
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,680
I'm so sorry
Are you blind?

261
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,920
What's wrong?

262
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,840

Laundry as well

266
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,200
Just forget it

267
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,040
-I'm so sorry
-Forget it

268
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,800
Forget it? Do you know
how much it costs?

269
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,280
You can't afford it?
What about you?

270
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,440
You pay

271
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,600
I'm so sorry

272
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,720
Nonsense!

273
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,000

Can you afford to pay it?

277
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,400
Do you know how much it costs?

278
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,040
Do you know how much it costs?

279
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,760
-Take it
-RMB3,800

280
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,800
Pay the bill as well

281
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,880
You're rich, huh?

282
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,800
Don't show off

283
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Do you know who am I?

284
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,920
Just forget it

285
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,920
Don't fight with the young man

286
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,240
Do you know who I am?

287
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,320
Come with me

288
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,680
Where are you going?

289
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,720
Just forget it

290
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,040
You're safe now

291
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,240
Thank you for helping me

292
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,640
I'll pay you back

293
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,040
It's alright

294
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,960
Why did you drink alone here?

295
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,360
I failed CET 4

296
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,840
It makes me down

297
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh, my goodness

298
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,120
You almost graduate,
but you didn't pass it?

299
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Yeah

300
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,800
CET 4 is not a big deal

301
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,440
Can it really make you drunk?

302
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,960
Yeah

303
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,800
I'm so sad

304
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,800
Work harder and sit for the exam again

305
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,440
No point sitting sadly here

306
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,320
I have no chance anymore

307
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,600
I'll help you

308
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,000
Take it as my thank you for the help

309
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,880
Didn't Mo Mo tell you
that I'm a whiz kid?

310
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,080
Mo Mo

311
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,200
Okay

312
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,600
What are you doing?

313
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,280
Open the walnuts

314
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,200
You can't do it this way

315
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,360
You press too hard. Let me show you

316
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,640
It will be cooked in paste

317
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
So, it doesn't matter

318
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,720
Let me see

319
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,320
Look at this

320
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,440
Let's celebrate

321
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,640
and eat this

322
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,680
Alright

323
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,240
So yummy

324
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,200
Do you still remember the correct way?

325
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,320
Just carry on

326
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,080
The size is not suitable

327
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,320
I'll get one for you

328
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,920
This is better

329
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,200
Mom, what are you doing?

330
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,800
I...

331
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,800
I'm looking at the two of you

332
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,840
We're opening walnuts

333
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,720
Opening walnuts

334
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,160
in that way?

335
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,640
So romantic

336
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,000
What should we do then?

337
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:04,959
Come on

338
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,400
Look at me

339
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,120
Come on

340
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,400
Give it to me

341
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,719
Give me one

342
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:10,839
I'll take this

343
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,920
When we're small, we used to
open walnuts

344
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,349
in this way. It has its own method

345
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,549
Look at this

346
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,159
There's a gap here

347
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,040
Put the key inside

348
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:25,959
See?

349
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,549
It's done, got it?

350
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,480
No one opens the
walnuts with a door

351
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,960
You will break the door

352
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,590
You're so smart, we'll leave it to you

353
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,120
What now?

354
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:35,830
Open them

355
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,590
Alright

356
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,550
I will keep quiet

357
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,880
and leave it to you

358
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,560
You two keep practicing

359
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,840
Carry on

360
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,320
I have to check the sesame

361
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
What about

362
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,760
you try to open it?

363
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,720
I don't have a key

364
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,640
Take the key

365
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,240
Taste it

366
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,760
Thank you, aunt

367
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,120
Come on

368
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,720
Stop playing. Come on

369
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,240
Wait a moment

370
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,320
Why?

371
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,520
It's better we dig in together

372
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,400
You're really a good boy

373
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,640
Let's dig in and stop playing

374
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,600
Hurry up!

375
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,120
Come on

376
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,320
Fragrant?

377
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,960
So yummy

378
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,800
I feel a little tired

379
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,600
Well...

380
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,200
Mo Mo

381
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,560
Take away the bowls later

382
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,640
and wash them

383
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,960
I'll go to bed first

384
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,880
Okay

385
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,160
Mom!

386
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,440
Where do you want to sleep?

387
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,280
Of course in your room

388
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,880
Mom!

389
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,360
Xiao Gu

390
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,120
Do you mind if I
want to take a rest here?

391
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,680
I don't mind

392
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,240
Have a good rest

393
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Look at Xiao Gu

394
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,520
Mom!

395
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,280
Cut it out.

396
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,960
I have booked a room
in the hotel, let's go

397
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,880
Don't trouble me, I'm so tired

398
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,920
Just one night here

399
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,400
I will leave tomorrow, okay?

400
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,680
-You're really annoying
-Mom

401
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,840
Mom

402
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,800
I'm really tired

403
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
So sorry

404
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,800
It's alright

405
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,720
Mo Mo, wake up

406
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,320
Mo Mo

407
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,960
Get up,
you are going to be late

408
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,520
No!

409
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,160
No!

410
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,280
You'll skip breakfast?

411
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,400
Yes!

412
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,400
Wake up! You are going to be late

413
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,040
I won't be late,
I haven't heard the alarm ring

414
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,560
Wake up!

415
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,240
Oh, no!

416
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,760
Wake up!

417
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,120
-No!
-Wake up!

418
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,360
You're really lazy

419
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,360
It's going to be late

420
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,360
You must get up now

421
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,280
Get up

422
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:46,760
Mom!

423
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,520
10 minutes

424
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,480
10 minutes please

425
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,440
You're just like a pig

426
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,440
You sleep

427
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,520
like a piggy

428
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,120
It looks like I'm slaughtering a pig now

429
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:58,920
Quickly get up

430
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,040
Just kill me!

431
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,840
Kill me now!

432
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,280
lower your voice

433
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,880
I'll beat you

434
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,360
if you wake Xiao Gu up

435
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,440
Mom

436
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,440
Quickly get up

437
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,320
No!

438
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,040
I'll come again in 10 minutes

439
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,080
You're awake

440
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,240
Let's take breakfast

441
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,760
Good morning, aunt

442
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,960
You're awake

443
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,680
Dear guest

444
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,560
Do you want to try our
fresh ground soy soup

445
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,840
with salty oil stick which

446
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,320
made by Spanish olive oil

447
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,840
or porridge with Chinese black egg

448
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,800
and braised meat in the wheat bread?

449
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,600
She's asking whether you want

450
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,520
soy milk and fried dough sticks

451
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,600
or buns and porridge with pork

452
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Buns and porridge will do

453
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,240
I want the other one

454
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,440
Hurry up get it

455
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,240
Are you waiting for someone to serve you?

456
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,280
Sit down

457
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,920
Get the porridge for Xiao Gu

458
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,600
Okay

459
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,400
Come on

460
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,240
Okay

461
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,280
Let's dig in

462
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,120
Behave yourself

463
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,080
Don't

464
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,520
put it in the drink

465
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,200
It's...

466
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,200
I like it

467
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,040
Freak

468
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,920
You learnt so fast

469
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,200
Freak

470
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,200
Freak

471
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,280
Alright, hurry up dig in

472
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,160
Senior, have you
completed the experiment?

473
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,560
Finally, it's done

474
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,440
Gu Wei Yi, do you have a pen?

475
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,880
I have a pen

476
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,000
Give it to me

477
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,840
I need it for myself

478
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,920
Nonsense

479
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,760
I wish to get back to the
university and I hate working

480
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,640
The digits and calculations
almost crack my brain

481
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,960
Eat more walnuts

482
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,640
Your mother said, it's good for brain

483
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,160
You remind me that

484
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,440
My mother asked me to give you this

485
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,080
She said, you need to
develop your brain too

486
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,640
She asked you to eat more
walnuts to get smarter

487
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,520
Senior

488
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,560
Thank you

489
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,680
Gu Wei Yi

490
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,360
Be professional

491
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,600
How could you bring walnuts to the lab?

492
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,040
Senior, take it

493
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,680
Thank you

494
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,480
I want it too

495
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,560
Be professional

496
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,480
You're so stingy

497
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,440
No food is allowed in the lab

498
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,520
Why did you bring
walnuts to the lab then?

499
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,120
What are you doing?

500
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,600
Who bring the walnuts?

501
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,720
The best way to open the walnut

502
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,640
Stop it now

503
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,920
Get up

504
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,480
Did I give you

505
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,160
too much freedom recently?

506
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,280
How could you dawdle

507
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,080
over the experiment?

508
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,280
Even though I used to joke

509
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,960
and be close to you guys,

510
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,600
but I'm always serious

511
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,560
in every experiment

512
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,320
I hope you do the same too

513
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,520
Don't you know that

514
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,160
food is not allowed in the lab?

515
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,760
Your attitude

516
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,360
and action today

517
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,360
really make me disappointed

518
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,160
I'm so sorry, professor

519
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,000
Listen carefully

520
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,240
I hope my students

521
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,240
are always serious and focused on the research

522
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,600
Okay?

523
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,920
Alright

524
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,120
I want you

525
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,440
to do the experiments

526
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
all over again

527
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,720
-Okay
-Okay

528
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,840
This is the budget of
the HR department

529
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,120
Are you the new trainee
of Qing's department?

530
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:13,800
Yes

531
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,680
Haven't graduated?

532
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,520
Not yet

533
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,560
Come on

534
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,960
Look at the advertisement

535
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,860
[Recruiting True Advertisers]

536
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
If I put

537
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,960
the advertisement in your university,

538
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,720
will you be interested in it?

539
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,680
Sure

540
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,440
Religion

541
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,040
Let's rest for a while

542
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,240
I have studied for 2 hours

543
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,960
I have a mental-block now

544
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,920
Let's go find Mo Mo

545
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,400
You knew that you have
only studied for 2 hours

546
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,080
How many times have you mentioned

547
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,920
to look for some fun since 2 hours ago?

548
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,840
I've had enough

549
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,920
I'll just quit

550
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,240
Lower your voice

551
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,400
If you could spell the 40 words

552
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,280
I told you to learn,

553
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,960
I'll bring you to Mo Mo

554
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,240
Okay

555
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,840
Mom, I'm home

556
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,120
You're back

557
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,600
Look at you

558
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,320
Behave yourself

559
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,680
You should behave like a girl

560
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,760
If Xiao Gu sees it,

561
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,520
he won't be into you

562
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,880
Who cares?

563
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,600
Xiao Gu, you're back

564
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,360
Aunt

565
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,560
Are you hungry?

566
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,720
No

567
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,600
Chop, chop!

568
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,520
Hurry up!

569
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,680
Put away the clothes

570
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,840
and fold them nicely

571
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,640
You come back

572
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,840
so late, you must be hungry now

573
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,680
I'll cook for you right now

574
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,880
Mo Mo, quickly help me
to clean the vegetables

575
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,720
Actually, Mo Mo is quite

576
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,640
hardworking

577
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,400
and good at doing chores

578
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,640
No!

579
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,320
Well...

580
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,720
You help me clean the vegetables

581
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,600
This...

582
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,840
-Okay.
-What a lazy girl!

583
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,520
You can't wash it in this way

584
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,080
You're wasting the water

585
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,080
Well

586
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,000
What about you

587
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,160
help me to cut

588
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,480
the carrot in cube?

589
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,760
Go

590
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,240
What is the size of the cube?

591
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,160
About 1cm

592
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,760
It's obvious that you
never do any chores

593
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,200
Mo Mo, come and help us

594
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,680
How many person
you need just for cooking?

595
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,240
Oh, my goodness!

596
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,280
What's wrong?

597
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,120
Are you kidding me?

598
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,000
I just want to make it similar

599
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,080
Do I need to find you a microscope?

600
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,880
You know nothing

601
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,960
He is a scientist, he made his point

602
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,160
You must respect to
the national pillar to-be

603
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,560
It's okay

604
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,040
It's good

605
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,400
Just carry on

606
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,840
It's good

607
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,960
Just carry on

608
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Are you myopia?

609
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,960
It's over 100 degrees

610
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,400
Why didn't you wear glasses?

611
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,520
The light will reflect on the glasses
when I check the microscope

612
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,920
and it affects the view

613
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,160
You seem to like Physics very much

614
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,840
Why did I do it if I don't like it?

615
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,680
Come on

616
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,280
Take a rest

617
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,560
Have some fruits

618
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,840
Come on

619
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,560
Come on

620
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,520
-Thank you
-Take this

621
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,160
Take one

622
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,920
Young people

623
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,520
can't just stay in the house
all the time

624
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,680
What about this?

625
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,400
Come on

626
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,040
Let's go out together

627
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,440
and feel the healthy

628
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,760
and happy living of the elders

629
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,720
Okay?

630
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,000
Where to?

631
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,160
Don't care about it, just come with me

632
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:41,840
Come on

633
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,840
Stop reading, it will spoil your eyes

634
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,680
Get up

635
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,480
I'm not going

636
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,680
Get up

637
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,640
Hurry up!

638
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,720
Let's go

639
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
Reshuffle the tiles

640
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,360
How did she know this place in this area?

641
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,120
The middle-aged women always
have the radar for this

642
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,480
I can't explain it to you

643
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,200
But I don't know how to play it

644
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,760
It's okay, I'll teach you

645
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,680
Arrange the tiles

646
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,600
Do you know how to play it?

647
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,760
I know

648
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,960
It's okay

649
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,840
Take it easy

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,080

677
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,200
I quit

678
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,640
What a bad day!

679
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,360
I quit

680
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,640
How smart

681
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,280
Clever

682
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,080
What a smart boy

683
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,520
He is a scientist

684
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,880
You play with your luck

685
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,640
But he played with his brain

686
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,000
You're really smart

687
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,520
Awesome

688
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,440
Excellent

689
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,920
Really smart

690
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,880
You're really something

691
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,760
Take it

692
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,440
You won so much

693
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,000
Be careful

694
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,520
You should be careful

695
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,240
Your purse

696
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,360
Just keep it

697
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,280
You are really forgetful
Can't you just lower your voice?

698
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,880
Did you see my books?

699
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,280
No, I did not

700
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,880
Come on

701
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,920
Have some sesame soup, are you hungry?

702
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,560
Come on

703
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,440
Hurry up dig in

704
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,360
Where did you get this?

705
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,360
Leftover

706
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,080
Don't keep the leftover next time

707
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,160
Don't sit on the floor, it's cold

708
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,920
Quickly get up

709
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,720
Come on

710
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,800
Sit on the sofa

711
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,520
Well

712
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,280
Come on

713
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,120
Xiao Gu, get up

714
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:55,880
Where is

715
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,120
my magazine?

716
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,560
Move aside

717
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,160
I remember

718
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,320
I put it somewhere here?

719
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,400
This...

720
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,280
Where did I put the magazine?

721
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,400
That...

722
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,040
Here it is

723
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,840
Mom

724
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,360
What's wrong?

725
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,520
It's okay

726
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,360
You get surprised easily

727
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,000
Two of you are matched

728
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,360
People might think

729
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,000
that you have been
living together for years

730
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,740
Here comes the Easter egg.

731
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,240
Wake up!

732
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,160
No!

733
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:29,720
Wake up!

734
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,280
No!

735
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,800
You're such a lazy girl

736
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,320
You're going to be late

737
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,200
No! Wake up now!

738
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,440
Mom, give me 10 minutes

739
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,080
You're really...

740
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,120
Xiao Gu

741
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,600
Are you awake?

742
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,400
Is he having a nightmare?

743
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,080
He looks peaceful even in a nightmare

744
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,840
Mo Mo should learn from him

745
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,320
He sleeps gracefully

746
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
Mo Mo

747
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,880
Aunt

748
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,360
I'm awake

749
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,760
Are you awake?

750
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,360
Did I disturb you?

751
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,480
No
