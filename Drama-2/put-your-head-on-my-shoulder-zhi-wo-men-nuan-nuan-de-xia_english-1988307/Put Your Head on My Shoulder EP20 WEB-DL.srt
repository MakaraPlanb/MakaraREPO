You bring a conch?

8
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,160
I'm late!

9
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,640
I...

10
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,440
Go away

11
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,720
What are you doing?

12
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,680
Going to work,
I'm going to be late

13
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,240
I took a day off for you

14
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,320
Really?

15
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,120
Yeah

16
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,600
I'm going back to bed now

17
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,640
What's on your neck?

18
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Rash, I have an allergy to alcoholic

19
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,760
Then why did you drink so much?

20
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,240
I didn't drink it on purpose

21
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,080
You're drunk without me, huh?

22
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,640
What's your mind?

23
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,160
It's part of my work

24
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,440
I promise I'll never drink it again

25
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,440
Even if they kill me

26
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,640
or fire me

27
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,600
Your face looks like an answer sheet

28
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,080
and you're smelling of booze

29
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,280
Is it?

30
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,560
Don't ever attend the occasion again

31
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,760
Don't mix up with the guy

32
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,800
Remember?

33
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,520
Go take a shower

34
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,920
I'm going to buy breakfast

35
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,760
I want the deep-fried
bread stick from the first shop

36
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
and the peanut soy milk

37
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
of the third shop

38
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
Not soybean soy milk

39
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,960
Take a shower

40
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,200
Yes, sir

41
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,040
You're back?

42
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,680
You bought the peanut soy milk?

43
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,040
Yeah

44
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,000

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,760
Take your breakfast, I'll help you

48
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,960
What's wrong with you?

49
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,760
This is...

50
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,120
This is my...

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,720
Yes, I know

52
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,760
It dropped, so I wash it again

53
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,480
No need

54
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,400
It's okay

55
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,760
You have washed it before, right?

56
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,800
It's not dirty

57
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,400

No

61
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,160

62
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,359
No

63
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,039
I have a younger brother

64
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,599
I used to hang all the clothes in my home

65
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,680
I'm used to it

66
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,840

67
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,280
I have no evil thought

68
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,400
We slept on a same bed before

00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,640

You are too weak

93
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,840
You fainted due to Hypoglycemia, huh?

94
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,040
And you don't even like to exercise

95

99
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,920
Don't say that again

100
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,160
There's a difference

101
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,760
Must be a difference

102
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,720
What's the difference?

"Since you have changed
to another field,

I won't embarrass you then"

156
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,060
He only asked several questions

157
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,180
Can I change to another field now?

158

as your research topics?

192
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,660
Because my lecturer spoil

193
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,660
the Ubbelohde viscometer in the class

194
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,140
So I tried to improve it

00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,340
Gu Wei Yi

196
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,220
Do you see

197
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,820
any deficiency in your thesis?

198
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,660
Was it too simple?

199
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,660
Since it's an unpopular topic,

200
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,220
you'd better don't ask

201
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,420
Alright

202
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,700
Do you guys

203
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,900
has any question

204
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,820
about the thesis of Gu Wei Yi?

205
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,140
Please bring it out

206
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,180
I...

207
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,900
Your oral defense ends here

208
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,620
Alright, thank you

209
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,220
Whom are you calling?

210
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:04,780
Is it fun?

211
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,900
Yeah

212
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:07,420
Let's go

213
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,140
We'll go for lunch

214
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,420
Shan Shan wants you to buy them a meal

215
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,460
Can I just pay the bill?

216
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,860
What do you think?

217
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,380
Can

218
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,420
No way

219
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:17,900
Let's go

220
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,820
Are all the dishes served?

221
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,500
Not yet

222
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,180
What?

223
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,460
Please wait a minute

224
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,500
It's too much

225
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,020
It's expensive, do you
have enough money?

226
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:31,900
Enough

227
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,180
I've got it all figured out

228
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,460
What?

229
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,220
Mo Mo

230
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,660
Meng Lu

231
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,540
It seems

232
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,700
Gu Wei Yi is richer than Fu Pei

233
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,780
who's a child of a rich family

234
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,180
Don't just stand here

235
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:54,740
Sit down

236
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,180
Mo Mo

237
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,020
You know me well

238
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,500
Gu Wei Yi

239
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,460
All the foods here

240
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,020
made my day

241
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,900
We can't finish all the food here

242
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,180
Young people

243
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,100
never says no to the delicious food

244
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,060
Moreover,

245
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,180
we can take it away
if we can't finish it

246
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,860
Niu Niu, I thought you're on diet

247
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,220
Didn't you heard it before?

248
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,180
Eat and drink properly

249
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,540
could deceive your body

250
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,260
that you're still the fatty

251
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,300
So, it will give you
the same metabolic rate

252
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,980
Or the metabolic rate will drop

253
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,060
Alright, stop talking

254
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,540
Dig in

255
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,580
Let's dig in

256
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,980
Eat more

257
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,060
Come here when you're done over there

258
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,970
"Okay"

259
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,580
Don't be surprised, dig in

260
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,700
Have you come here before?

261
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,300
No

262
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,740
The environment is good

263
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,060
It's comfortable

264
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,780
Hey

265
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,420
Stop playing with your phone

266
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,500
This is your school mate,

267
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,580
Lu Jian Shi

268
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,420
Xiao Lu is the pillar of the country

269
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,540
She studied abroad

270
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,820
Specializing in the
study of Mechanic Quantum

271
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,940
It's Quantum Mechanic

272
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,500
Let's order first

273
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,620
Let's order

274
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,260
Waitress

275
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,300
What's the most expensive food here?

276
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,420
I have a VIP guest today

277
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,140
Fish

278
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,900
How can the fish be most expensive?

279
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,500
Are you sure?

280
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,980
Call your manager

281
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,660
Sir

282
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,500
All of our fish

283
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,580
are imported from Canada

284
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,500
I don't care where it came from

285
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,100
I just want the most expensive dish

286
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,500
RMB3,800 for every 50 g

287
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,340
It's too expensive

288
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,700
Thank you

289
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,900
Give us the fish please

290
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:20,980
500 g

291
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:22,980
Jian Shi

292
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,220
Are you okay with the fish?

293
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,540
Okay

294
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,700
Then we should order

295
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,420
the fish today

296
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,540
It can express my father's love to you

297
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,820
Am I right?

298
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,500
Give me a fish of 500 g

299
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,740
Bill please

300
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,620
Wait a minute

301
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,220
The total is RMB3,453

302
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,380
Sorry?

303
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,340
RMB3,453

304
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,260
Why is it so expensive?

305
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,380
Are you cheating us?

306
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,380
Miss

307
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,140
Do you want to check the bill?

308
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,620
No need

309
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,580
Why not?

310
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,780
Must be something's wrong

311
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,260
Red wine, RMB899

312
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,860
Snowflake beef, RMB298

313
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,100
Grenadier Anchovy, RMB1,100

314
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:10,860
This...

315
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,860
What fish is that?

316
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,100
Grenadier Anchovy

317
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,180
The sweet sour fish

318
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,020
which is all pineapple mixed with

319
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,860
4-5 pieces of fish?

320
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,220
RMB7,800 per 500 g?

321
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,140
Gu Wei Yi

322
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,940
Are you crazy?

323
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,860
RMB7,800 per 500 g?

324
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,700
Miss

325
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,260
It is not so expensive

326
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,460
The restaurant next to us

327
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,980
is selling the fish at RM3,800 per 50 g

328
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,140
which is imported from Canada

329
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,900
I don't want to make you feel
that I'm stingy to your friends

330
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,060
And it's not the most costly one

331
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,540
If you did it,

332
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,940
I'll demolish Circle when I'm home

333
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,380
Sir

334
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,340
Miss

335
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,060
Can you pay the bill now?

336
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,660
You still want to check the bill?

337
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,700
No need

338
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,140
Do you have enough money?
I have some money here

339
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:06,900
Enough

340
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,940
I have figured it out

341
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,660
Can I use WeChat Pay?

342
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,380
Sure

343
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,100
You have made a payment of
RMB3,453 with the card

344
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,900
ends with 071 at 8 pm, 8th June

345
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,500
The balance of credit is RMB0.12

346
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,940
You calculation is just nice

347
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,260
We're busy eating the fish

348
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,860
and I didn't even introduce

349
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,900
my son to you

350
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,580
He's studying Management in
the same university with you

351
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,180
His result is good

352
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,980
and plays well in basketball too

353
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,820
But I already had a girlfriend

354
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,180
And she's prettier than you

355
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,500
She is more beautiful

356
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,900
Hello, uncle

357
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,700
Hello

358
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,860
Let me introduce her to you

359
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,620
This is my girlfriend

360
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,540
Wang Shan

361
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,860
Nonsense!

362
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,140
I disagree with it

363
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,220
None of your business

364
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,660
Didn't the education
of China teach you

365
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,380
how to respect each other?

366
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,940
Respect to each other?

367
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,020
Miss Lu

368
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,580
I couldn't believe my ears

369
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,500
Did you think of respect

370
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,700
when you ate the costly fish?

371
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,180
It seems the respect you learn abroad

372
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,340
is worthless

373
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,660
It was a nice meal

374
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,500
Luxury

375
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,220
I'm satisfied too

376
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,260
My girlfriend and I will leave first

377
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,340
Stop!

378
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,420
How dare you

379
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,620
walk out from here?

380
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,780
How dare you!

381
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,220
Are you okay?

382
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,540
I'm okay

383
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,140
Look at yourself

384
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,140
Where is your manhood?

385
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,140
Why do I have a useless son like you?

386
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,300
Uncle

387
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,980
You are in bad mood today

388
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,380
So I won't introduce myself first

389
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,620
We'll visit you next time

390
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,180
Let's go

391
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,020
Fu Pei

392
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,620
Fu Pei

393
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,580
What's wrong?

394
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,660
Nothing

395
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,420
I just feel funny

396
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,860
Didn't you see my dad's face?

397
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,460
He's pissed off

398
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,740
Did I just go too far?

399
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,500
When I saw your dad's attitude...

400
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,260
I...

401
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,380
It's okay

402
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,500
Very good

403
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,220
Let's go

404
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,140
I'm hungry

405
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,060
Drink it

406
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,820
I don't want to drink it

407
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,340
I can't drink it anymore

408
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,060
I think we're going to die,
if we go on like this

409
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,900
Eat the instant noodle then

410
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,820
How dare you!

411
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,340
You spent all your monthly
allowance just for a meal

412
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,220
That is our last noodle

413
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,660
I'll get the scholarship
before graduation

414
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,420
Can't you just spend my money?

415
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:32,860
No way

416
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,860
Well, what are we going to eat

417
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,700
before you get the scholarship?

418
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,140
I'll figure it out

419
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,580
If we don't eat that noodle,

420
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,900
we won't be able to hold
until the photo shooting

421
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:53,940
Alright

422
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,660
It smells good.

423
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,980
There is a surprise too

424
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,060
Where did it come from?

425
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,540
I found it stuck in
the seam of the fridge

426
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,300
when I was taking the noodle

427
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
So I cooked it

428
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,180
For you

429
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,340
For you

430
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,860
For you

431
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,100
Only one, you take it

432
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,380
You eat, I'm not hungry

433
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:51,820
Take...

434
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,740
Don't waste it

435
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,940
Let's dig in

436
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,100
Eat the vegetable

437
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,860
Eat more

438
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,980
Delicious

439
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,620
Tasty?

440
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,220
Where's the egg?

441
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:40,900
Where's the egg?

442
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,140
Where's the egg?

443
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,540
Eat the noodle

444
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,580
Eat more

445
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,220
Drink more soup to fill your stomach

446
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:02,860
Delicious

447
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,500
Can you wear a tie?

448
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:53,780
Em...

449
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,660
I was thinking to ask you too

450
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,660
I remember the technique in the video

451
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,460
is almost same with
wearing the red scarf

452
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,860
Should be like this

453
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,180
Isn't that right?

454
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:27,420
It goes around like this again

455
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,380
Like this

456
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,260
Like this

457
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,940
Just tie it up, it's going to be late

458
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,460
Don't rush me, I can do it

459
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,860
It looks like a tie shape

460
00:32:59,420 --> 00:32:59,900
Alright

461
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,980
Alright

462
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,220
Yes, I made it

463
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,340
Let me wear it for you

464
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,540
I will ask Lu Lu to help me

465
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,220
Let's go

466
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,700
[Welcome to the Graduate of 2018]

467
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,060
[A student turns to an alimony,
study hard even after the graduation]

468
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,040
[Don't eat too much in the future]

469
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,510
[Goodbye and good luck in everything]

470
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,660
Don't always stay up late, your
life is the most important thing

471
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,580
It is

472
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,950
[Sleep early even no one switch
off the light for you in the future]

473

Lu Lu

474
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,780
Are you looking forward

475
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,540
to see Ke in the bachelor's robe?

476
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,140
He showed me his selfie

477
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,580
I'm looking forward

478
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,260
to see Gu Wei Yi and Fu Pei
in the bachelor's robe

479
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,420
Two of them

480
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,299
are handsome and tall

481
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,820
Must be good-looking

482
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,940
You may look at Mo Mo's man

483
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,900
Don't look at mine

484
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,780
I want to look at him

485
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,100
-Me too
-I want to see both of them

486

489
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,260
Is this the hottest man in the campus?

490
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,500
He looks like a stupid

491
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,330
Who looks like a stupid?

492
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,180
You

493
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:31,580
Gosh!

494
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,179
Gosh!

495
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,019
Gosh!

496
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:33,699
Gosh!

497
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,180
I have something for you

498
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:37,980
What's that?

499
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,420
Surprise?

500
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,060
Does it hurt your chest?

501
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:43,900
Yes

502
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:44,980
But I can hold it

503
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,580
You're annoying

504
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,860
-As long as you're happy
-Does it hurt?

505
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:48,940
Lu Lu

506
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,810
Lu Lu, help me to wear the tie

507
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,250
Hold it for me

508
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:54,939
Can you do it?

509
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:55,860
Sure

510
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,290
Why are you all in
the bachelor's robe?

511
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,620
I have taken for you

512
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,770
I'll change it in the dorm

513
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,700
Where are you?
Let's take picture in the lab

514
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,980
Okay

515
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,020
See you there

516
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:10,810
-Can you do it?
-Sure

517
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,860
I'm going to the lab first

518
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,020
See you later

519
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,460
Okay

520
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:15,580
Wait a minute

521
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,580
I have a graduation photo program here

522
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,100
So we won't miss every memory

523
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,220
of the scenery

524
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,060
I found that

525
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,980
you have a better

526
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,780
planning nowadays

527
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,340
Of course

528
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,100
You teach me well

529
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,460
Let me see

530
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,980

537
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,980
Why is your boyfriend leaving?

538
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,500
Did he hide a girl in the lab?

539
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,420
You're right

540
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,260
I heard there's

541
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,900
a pretty senior in their lab

542
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,260
Lu Lu

543
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,540
What kind of pretty girl in the lab?

544
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,140
I swear

545
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,300
I just curious about it

546
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,540
She seems

547
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,820
like Gu Wei Yi very much

548
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,340
It's not what you think

549
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,340
Mo Mo

550
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,140
You're so sensible now

551
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,940
Gu Wei Yi didn't
even give you a flower

552
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,900
That's right

553
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,020
Look at Fu Pei

554
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,140
He's willing to get hurt
because of Wang Shan

555
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,300
He just didn't think about it

556
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,940
You have no flower too

557
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,740
I have it inside my heart

558
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,980
-In the heart
-In the heart, huh?

559
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,260
Alright, let's go

560
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,220
Let's go

561
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,340
Let's take photo!

562
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,860

-Let's go for photos

563
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,260
Sit tight

564
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:24,940
Okay

565
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,740

Blooming of flowers

570
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,390
As if we meet each other again

571
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,750

Yummy crabs

573
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,970
It is nicer when you add chilies

574
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,820
Oh! I'm craving for

575
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,030
the Large Crab in Yang Cheng Lake

576
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,320
But it's now peak season

The hotel must be expensive

578
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:07,910
