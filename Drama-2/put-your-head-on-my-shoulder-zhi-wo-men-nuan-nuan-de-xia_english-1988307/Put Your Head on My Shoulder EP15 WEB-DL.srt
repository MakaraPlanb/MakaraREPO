It's him!

00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,160
He is busy in love and doing nothing

Do you like me?

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,440
I...

13
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,120
I meant...

14
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,080
You...

15
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,160
Did you peek

16
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,400
at my form?

17
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,360
Forget it

18
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,120
It was a coincidence

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,160
Yes

20
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,600
It's a coincidence?

21
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,680
Yes

22
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,720

23
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,000
So?

62
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,680
He didn't even text me

63
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,760
and ask whether I arrive the office

64
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,000
Have you heard it?

When?

70
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,560
Do we need to help?

71
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,680
Not sure yet

72
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,560
But I wish to go there

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,520
Look

74
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,400

turns a cold shoulder to you

80
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,560
after the confession,

81
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,240
is he a playboy?

82
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,920
Tell me who's the guy first

83
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,240
You're still in an allergy, huh?

84
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,320
Professor Jiang, are you looking for me?

85
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,360
Zhou Lei

86
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,120
Why is he here too?

87
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,840
It's okay, have a seat

88
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,200
Mew...

89
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,880
Take a rest in your nest

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,760
Come on

91
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,000
Mind your tail

92
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,760
Take a rest

93
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,440
Stay here for a while

94
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,360
Let's play after this

95
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,640
You don't know

96
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,640
The kitten

97
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,800
creeped me out yesterday

98
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,080
But I found

99
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,040
it's a big eater

100
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,200
It could finish a fish in a meal

101
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,960
Professor Jiang

102
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Are you asking me to
pay for its expenses?

103
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,760
No

104
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:23,920
Gu Wei Yi

105
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,480
How are you and Si Tu Mo

106
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,160
recently?

107
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:28,840
That's right

108
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,760
Managed to confess at the playground?

109
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,000
Fail again, huh?

110
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,800
I made it in this morning

111
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,760
Can't you just finish your words?

112
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,920
Finally, we have

113
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,880
someone in love in the lab now

114
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,160
Professor Jiang, I've been in love too

115
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,520
You only help girls to do their
homework, that's not in love

116
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,070
Why not?

117
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,400
Did you hold their hands?

118
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,120
Did you hug them?

119
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,760
Did you kiss them?

120
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,280
You...

121
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,320
Do you know what's love?

122
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,240
Why are you laughing?
Don't think you know about it

123
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,560
Professor Jiang, look at him

124
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,480
He has no idea too

125
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,720
Gu Wei Yi

126
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,680
Tell him

127
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,040
after you confessed your love to her

128
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,120
Tell me

129
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,120
Gu Wei Yi

130
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,480
I'm going to work

131
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,160
Did she put on her make up today?

132
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,840
She looks pretty

133
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,280
Si Tu Mo

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,880
You're going to be late

135
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,280
Come back earlier

136
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,400
Gu Wei Yi

137
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,120
Gu Wei Yi

138
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,560
What happened after you
confessed your love to her?

139
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,640
It's only a short time

140
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,400
Did you hold her hands? Hug her?

141
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,240
Did you kiss her?

142
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,400
No

143
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,720
Look

144
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,480
I knew he did nothing

145
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,720
I kissed her

146
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,120
I knew

147
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,400
When you're drunk

148
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:11,960
Okay

149
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,200
So you should learn from Gu Wei Yi

150
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,000
No matter in scientific research

151
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
or affection, you...

152
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,880
Professor Jiang

153
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,080
Why did you want to see us?

154
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,240
Well...

155
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,320
Our experiment about

156
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,280
the Quantum Hall effect

157
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,520
was always been concerned
in the country and abroad

158
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,320
Before, my PhD student, Lu Jian Shi

159
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,960
went to a seminar in Germany

160
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,600
because of this experiment too

161
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
We didn't let the whole team to go there

162
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,520
due to the budget issue

163
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,320
Secondly,

164
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,480
our project was still immature

165
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,120
Professor Jiang

166
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,880
What are you trying to say?

167
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,520
Now,

168
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,920
the Heidelberg University in Germany

169
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,960
sent us the invitation

170
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,360
Professor Jiang

171
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,920
Is that he Heidelberg
University of Born,

172
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,840
the quantum mechanics founder?

173
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,200
I want to go!

174
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,880
The Heidelberg University

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,320
gave us 2 seats

176
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
You should know

177
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,400
One of the seats

178
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,560
will be reserved for your Xie Yu Yin

179
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,800
She has been joining me

180
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,040
during her post-graduation

181
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,600
The another seat

182
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,280
will be given to

183
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,200
either one of you

184
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,320
What about this?

185
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,440
Let the exam decide it

186
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,920
The top scorer can go for it

187
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,440
Take it easy

188
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,520
I'll try my best to figure it out

189
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,280
Even if I can't figure it out,

190
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll decide it through

191
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,960
a comprehensive assessment

192
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,800
Okay?

193
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,320
Let's make a date

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,280
We're in a date now

195
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,360
You're forcing yourself
to study together with me

196
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
There are people

197
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,600
You want dating, right?

198
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,840
This is a dating

199
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,080
I'll sleep for a while

200
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,400
This is my book

201
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,000
Read my book first

202
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,440
Don't disturb my dating

203
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Don't disturb my dating

204
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,440
Admission ticket?

205
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,920
Admission ticket

206
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,080
Post-graduate admission ticket

207
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,880
Where is mine?

208
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,680
Let me see

209
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,040
Our admission tickets connect together?

210
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,720
When you wanted
to register for the exam,

211
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,440
the registration was closing

212
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,680
Fu Pei

213
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,320
Do you really want to sit for the exam?

214
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,800
Of course

215
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,760
But you didn't even check

216
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,720
the registration date

217
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,600
I...

218
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,280
Fu Pei

219
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,280
What do you like?

220
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,880
What do you want to be?

221
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
If you know the answers,

222
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,480
I hope you carry on it happily

223
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,240
Don't be trapped by my future

224
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,280
Since we get together,

225
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,760
you seldom touch your basket ball

226
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,720
You seldom go out with your buddies

227
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
You only accompany me to study

228
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,200
Although you said you like it

229
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,240
and you're happy,

230
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,520
but I know that you're forcing yourself

231
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,600
Because you're worried
that I'll feel unsafe

232
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,640
and think too much

233
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,240
But I don't want you to do that

234
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,320
One day, you'll be tired

235
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,680
in out relationship

236
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,160
I'm not tired

237
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,440
I feel tired

238
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,320
Because I'm worried if you're tired

239
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,040
I told you I'm not tired

240
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,200
I was the one who confessed
my love to you first

241
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,360
Although you said you like me,

242
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,280
but I really don't know how long

243
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,320
it can last

244
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,400
In the conclusion,

245
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,560
you never believe my love on you

246
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,080
from the beginning

247
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,000
No

248
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,480
Alright

249
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,080
Stop talking

250
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,040
Fu Pei

251
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,560
Now, we're here

252
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,800
because the shooting
of the orange juice ads

253
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,800
will start tomorrow

254
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,800
You know

255
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,360
They have changed to a new spokesman

256
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,640
and cut the budget into half

257
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,280
But, we have adjusted

258
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,280
the relevant changes of the shooting

259
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,760
and I'll leave the
operational task to you

260
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,920
Tell me if you have any idea

261
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,040
I suggest myself to bring

262
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,720
Mo Mo and Jie Er to the shooting

263
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,360
Because the shooting is simple

264
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,760
The never go to any shooting scene

265
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,720
I hope they learn from there

266
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,239
We don't need so many people there

267
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,319
The shooting is simple

268
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,640
Mo Mo, you go

269
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,080
They're not using a super star

270
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,880
Call me if you

271
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,920
have any problem

272
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,560
Okay

273
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,559
Miss Sha Sha

274
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,920
Can I go with her?

275
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,399
We'll have a meal with
Director Chen tomorrow

276
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,999
Okay

277
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,119
That's it

278
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:22,960
Li Na

279
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,960
Brief Mo Mo about the process

280
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:25,910
Okay

281
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,200
Miss Sha Sha

282
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,110
Jie Er

283
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,320
Oh yeah

284
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,240
We'll have a meal with
Director Chen tomorrow

285
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,870
He is your father's old friend

286
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,560
We'll talk about

287
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,440
the ads of the coming season

288
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,600
Okay

289
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,520
Miss Sha Sha

290
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,120
Help me to look into the handsome guy

291
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,920
Yes, madam

292
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,680
I'll print out his pictures later

293
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
Help me to get his autograph

294
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
No way, it will spoil my professionality

295
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,480
I don't care, what if
he becomes famous one day?

296
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,720
I won't help you on that

297
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,720
I don't care, see you

298
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,480
You'd better don't text me forever

299
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:28,327
"On the way home"

300
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:38,884
"Want to watch TV together?"

301
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,160
Professor Jiang

302
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Gu Wei Yi is playing with his phone

303
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,960
Professor Jiang

304
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,360
I never play phone in the lab

305
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,360
To me, this is how a scientist

306
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,320
should behave

307
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,280
Especially those who will go to
a rigorous country like Germany

308
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,480
I saw you playing with a phone before

309
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,880
No, I didn't

310
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,160
Stop quarreling

311
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,000
I mentioned it before

312
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,040
During the recess,

313
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,600
you can do whatever you want to

314
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
But I'm still studying

315
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,320
during the recess

316
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,120
Xiao Gu is in love

317
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,320
and you are not

318
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,840
Who's in love?

319
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,320
It's him

320
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,400
He is busy in love and doing nothing

321
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,960
Who's your girlfriend?

322
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,080
Si Tu Mo

323
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,400
Don't ask, you don't know her

324
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,320
I know her

325
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,400
I know her too

326
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,480
How did you know his girlfriend?

327
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,840
Why didn't I know her?

328
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,560
Gu Wei Yi

329
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,320
I want to know your girlfriend

330
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,560
You're dreaming

331
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,120
What are you waiting for?

332
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,800
He didn't even text you,
he won't come and pick you up

333
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,240
No fragrant of flowers

334
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,400
Not tall as a tree

335
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,920
I'm a nobody

336
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,800
Why are you here?

337
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,640
To pick you up

338
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,720
It's crowded

339
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,040
The bus is coming soon

340
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,080
It's coming

341
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,400
Let's go

342
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,080
Come on

343
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,120
Have a seat

344
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,360
Sit down

345
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,000
It's okay, I'll sit there

346
00:21:59,440 --> 00:21:59,960
I'll sit there

347
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,360
I'll sit here

348
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,040
Hey girl! Mind your head!

349
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,480
Let me help you

350
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:54,840
You...

351
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,520
You...

352
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,120
You wear the wrong shoes

353
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,480
Let me help you

354
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,080
I'll do it myself

355
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,960
Sorry

356
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,320
What's wrong?

357
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,400
I want to ask you something

358
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,400
Okay

359
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,280
I'm getting together with Si Tu Mo now

360
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,920
You're trying to show off, huh?

361
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,560
I want to ask you

362
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,960
How should I

363
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,280
arrange for our first meal?

364
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,440
Asking me?

365
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,760
If you asked me before,

366
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,320
I'll tell you to get

367
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,960
a romantic candle-light dinner

368
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,000
Cut the steak

369
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,800
Then feed each other

370
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,280
I tell you

371
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,040
I see a girl's true colour now

372
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,440
The more you care of her,

373
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,560
the more she doubts your love on her

374
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,400
I knew it

375
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,640
See you

376
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,000
Pissed off!

377
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,320
Si Tu Mo

378
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,680
What's the matter?

379
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,160
Let's go for a steak tonight

380
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,800
I want to take bath

381
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,160
Let's eat at home

382
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,360
I have to wake up in the early morning

383
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,800
It's weekend

384
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,960
I have to go to the shooting scene

385
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,600
I'll call the food delivery then

386
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,440
Okay

387
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,280
Blackout?

388
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,600
No, the washroom is bright

389
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,680

390
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
I'm so sorry

391
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Continue it

392
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,840
Let's switch on the light

393
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,240
What are you laughing?

394
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:20,840
Nothing

395
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,680
What are we going to eat?

396
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,600
Food delivery

397
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Sir, this is your food

398
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,480
Thank you

399
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,240
What did you order?

400
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,520
Beefsteak

401
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,800
I think we're not suitable

402
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960

403
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,640
So as I

404
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,760
Wait

405
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,040
Take this

406
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,120
Treat it like a pork chop

407
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,040
Look at me

408
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,200
Actually,

409
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,240
I think we could slice it

410
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,840

411
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,480

413
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,600

414
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:04,960
"Shutter"

415
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:05,720

416
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,760

417
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,520
No! Don't switch it off!

418
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,520
Do you want to have some beers?

419
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,760
What do you want to do?

420
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,360
There is something we
can do even without beers

421
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,560
Whose phone?

422
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,200
Hello, Shan Shan

423
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:26,880
What's wrong?

424
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,040
I have a fight with Fu Pei

425
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,600
He bullied you?

426
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,120
You never register the exam for him

427
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,040
I think...

428
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,800
Well done!

429
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,600
Fu Pei deserves it

430
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,360
But

431
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,240
I feel like I didn't respect him

432
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,880
It's okay, he doesn't need it

433
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,080
He felt

434
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,280
that I never believe
him from the beginning

435
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,880
It's alright, he doesn't deserve it

436
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,280
Gosh!

437
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,040
You're scolding my boyfriend

438
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,520
Do you want to scold my boyfriend?

439
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,320
Since when you two get together?

440
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,400
Yesterday

441
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,880
My god!

442
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,280
Besides Niu Niu, everyone
of us has a boyfriend now

443
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
Oh, no...

444
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,080
I might become single soon

445
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,360
Don't think too much

446
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,120
Fu Pei will come to you after few days

447
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:28,158
"How to occupy your girlfriend's heart?"

448
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,400
What about this?

449
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,640
Come and study at my
house on the weekend

450
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,560
Don't think about others

451
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,840
You'll be sitting an exam soon

452
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,240
You must do your revision

453
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,080
I can't do that

454
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,520
You two just started the relationship

455
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,360
I can't be the spotlight there

456
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,600
I feel scared

459
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,760

460

"What should I do when my
girlfriend is hanging on the phone?"

461
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,079

462
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,880

handsome guy like me, huh?
