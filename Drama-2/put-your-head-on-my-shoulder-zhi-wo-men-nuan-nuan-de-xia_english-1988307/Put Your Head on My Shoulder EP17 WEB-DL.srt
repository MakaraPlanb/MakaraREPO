Let's go out and exercise

4
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,400
Don't tell me you can't play ping-pong

5
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,680
I can

[Episode 17]

7
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
What are you doing?

8
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,680
What's wrong with you?

9
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,320
What happened to your neck?

10
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,920
It's a little cold

11
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,200
I'll close the balcony door

12
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,040
No need

13
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,720
Not because of the wind

14
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,520
I'll close it

15
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,720
I just stood in front
of the fridge too long

16
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,480
The sound of closing door
will make Shan Shan awake

17
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,960
Will she go back to
the university tomorrow?

18
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,400
Will she leave tomorrow?

19
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,480
I don't know

20
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,360
Didn't she fight with Fu Pei?

21
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,120
I'll get Fu Pei to pick her up then

22
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,320
Wouldn't it be nice for us to do this?

23
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,360
Hello

24
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
I'm Gu Wei Yi

25
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,400
I'm Si Tu Mo

26
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,640
Are you two sick?

27
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,760
Why are you calling me in the night?

28
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,840
Cross talk?

29
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,440
Shan Shan is here

30
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,760
What's she doing there?

31
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,240
It's so far, I thought she has...

32
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,320
Come and pick her up now

33
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,160
Gosh!

34
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,800
Don't listen to him

35
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,240
Shan Shan's asleep

36
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,600
I just want to tell you

37
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,680
Shan Shan looks upset

38
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,320
-You...
-Pick her up in the early morning

39
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,360
Can't you just be a little tactful?

40
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,520
I was tactful

41
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,680
Is that called tactful?

42
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,000
Of course

43
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,840
What about with no tact?

44
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,960
Your girlfriend is at my house

45
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,120
It's annoying

46
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,520
Admission ticket, student card

47
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Identity card

48
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,560
Pencil, eraser

49
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,920
Why are you so early?

50
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,240
Sleep for a while

51
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,120
It's still early

52
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,600
It's okay, I'm awake

53
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,600
Take your breakfast

54
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,800
I bought breakfast

55
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,040
Let's don't wake him up

56
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,360
He's probably still asleep

57
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
I saw him drinking water

58
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,640
in the living room when
I went out in the morning

59
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,120
That's why I bought for 3 persons

60
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,040
He'll come out and eat

61
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,360
when he feels hungry

62
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,040
Breakfast?

63
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's go

64
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,200
I bought everything in the shop

65
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,360
Choose as you like

66
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,800
Chopsticks please, it's oily

67
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,200
Use your hands

68
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,240
Do you guys have any plan for today?

69
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,920
No

70
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,080
Shan Shan

71
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,920
I mean...

72
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,080
Meng Lu will go shopping
today, you want to go?

73
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
Of course I'll pass

74
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,640
Are you going to the library today?

75
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,720
What are you trying to say?

76
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,400
Nothing

77
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,240
I just wanted to say

78
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,320
If you don't go out today,

79
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,280
we may watch movie together

80
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,400
Crap! Of course I'm going out

81
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,680
I have the graduation exam today

82
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
Really?

83
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,240
You have the graduation exam today?

84
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,080
Why are you so happy?

85
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,720
I was thinking,

86
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,920
you'll be a graduate from now on

87
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,080
I'm so happy for you

88
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,560
Crazy

89
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,960
I don't know if I'll pass

90
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,400
You'll definitely pass it

91
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,120
You will make it

92
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Alright, I'm going to
pack up my thing first

93
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,400
Don't be nervous in the exam

94
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,360
I never nervous in any exam

95
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,640
Is the traffic going to jam here?

96
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
It's hard to say

97
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,800
But don't worry

98
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,880
I'm sure you have time

99
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,840
I'm leaving

100
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,520
Fighting!

101
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,600
I'm leaving, bye

102
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,800
Fighting!

103
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,200
Task completed

104
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,760
Wang Shan is walking downstairs

105
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,320
Shan Shan

106
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,600
What brings you here?

107
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,360
Let me send you

108
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,320
It's a traffic jam now

109
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,360
Let's go, or you'll be
late for the exam

110
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,440
I already called the cab

111
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:35,880
Shan Shan

112
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,160
My motorcycle is faster than a cab

113
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,200
Shan Shan

114
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
It's faster than a cab

115
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:41,840
Shan Shan

116
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,760
Wait...

117
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,720
It's faster

118
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,080
Shan Shan

119
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,400
It is faster

120
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,080
It is faster

121
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,320
Such a long queue

122
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,040
Mister

123
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,760
How long it takes?

124
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,200
It's going to be fast after this jam

125
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,520
I guess there's an accident ahead

126
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,200
Okay

127
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,240
Come on

128
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
You'll be late, hurry!

129
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,880
Keep the change

130
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,920
I'll send you, do you
still want to sit for the exam?

131
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,440
Hurry!

132
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,440
Put it on

133
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't...

134
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,840
I'll never come to you again

135
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,400
if you push me away

136
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:41,800
Good

137
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,400
Come on

138
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,520
Sit still

139
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,600
Here we are

140
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,400
So fast

141
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,560
It's near

142
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,280
Why are you taking me
on a motorcycle then?

143
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,640
I managed to borrow a motorcycle

144
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,120
What a pity if I didn't carry you!

145
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,600
Why did you borrow the motorcycle?

146
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,960
I'm trying to be a macho guy

147
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,480
so that you'll forgive me soon

148
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,720
But I'm the one who did wrong

149
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,120
That's right

150
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,040
I forgive you then

151
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,720
I'm a gentleman anyway

152
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,000
Thank you

153
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,200
It's alright

154
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,360
Go to the exam!

155
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,160
You're going to be late

156
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:44,560
Hurry!

157
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,280
See you

158
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,120
Fighting!

159
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,800
Bye

160
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,000
Try your best!

161
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,360
Alright

162
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,360
What are we going to do now?

163
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,440
Watch another movie

164
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,560
But we've watched two movies

165
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,440
Let's go shopping

166
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,120
We did it yesterday

167
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,760
Let's go for a meal

168
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,960
I'm full

169
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,840
Let's go out and exercise

170
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,280
I don't exercise

171
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,600
Walking is an exercise too

172
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,120
Don't tell me you can't play ping-pong

173
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,440
I can

174
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,040
Let's start

175
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,240
I'll serve

176
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,880
Here we go

177
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,200
Here it is

178
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,440
I'll really serve

179
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,880
Watch it!

180
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,440
I'm not ready yet

181
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,480
You serve

182
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,960
Come on

183
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,680
Come on

184
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,760
The table in the park

185
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,800
is not a standard one

186
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,040
It's a length problem

187
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,280
Get the ball

188
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,600
Who?

189
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,719
You should get it as you missed it

190
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,600
I'm not going

191
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,320
Hurry up!

192
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,710
Something wrong with
the elastic coefficient

193
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,240
of the racket

194
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,880
Something wrong with your skill

195
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,160
You have a problem

196
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,400
That...

197
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,040
The boy in the school
uniform is so handsome

198
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,200
Of course you're the most handsome

199
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,360
He is an awesome skateboarder

200
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:20,760
Hello

201
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,080
Hello

202
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,520
Gu Wei Yi

203
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,000
Can I have a try?

204
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,280
Sure

205
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,520
But, be careful

206
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Can you play this?

207
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,640
It looks hard and dangerous

208
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,560
Don't play it

209
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,800
Yes, it's hard

210
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,400
Physically,

211
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,200
he stepped on his tail

212
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,760
as the axis point of the torque

213
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,160
The moment equals to
force times force arm

214
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,960
He made a distance with
his feet and his skateboard

215
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,240
and it forms a moment

216
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,640
He used the explosive effort
to complete the action

217
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
In this action,

218
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,320
the static moment that maintains
the pivot point is almost zero

219
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,920
The tail press down

220
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,440
The gravity pushes the board

221
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,280
Watch out!

222
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,560
Are you okay?

223
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,360
Theory and practice

224
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,280
allow the existence of gap

225
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Is your waist okay?

226
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,080
It's okay

227
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,120
It's late

228
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,960
I have to work tomorrow

229
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,640
I go back to my room first

230
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,880
Have a good rest

231
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,880
Good night

232
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,280
Good night

233
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,000
Good night

234
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,000
Good night

235
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,360
I don't think it's late

236
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,680
You're right

237
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,760
Are you sleepy?

238
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,800
No

239
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,640
The ad is very interesting

240
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,920
Are you sleepy?

241
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,680
No

242
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,800
I'm learning now

243
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,320
The ad is really good

244
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,320
I'll change to another channel

245
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,360
"A little feeling"

246
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,080
"A little strong"

247
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,800
"Make the ordinary life different"

248
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,480
"Like surrounded by the warmth"

249
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,200
"The story was shaking the destiny"

250
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:30,520
"Take up the courage
to make a promise"

251
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,240
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

252
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,280
"The sky of glowing starlight"

253
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,200
"Slowly melt me into your eyes"

254
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,120
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

255
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,080
"It's all I miss"

256
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,080
"Shoulder to shoulder
with the touching moment"

257
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,840
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

258
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,880
"Despite the changing of world"

259
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,920
"Still holding each others hand"

260
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,360
"Let the time of a love song"

261
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,400
"witness our love forever“

262
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,440
Why do I close my eyes?

263
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,840
When should I open my eyes

264
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,160
so that I won't be awkward?

265
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,240
I should pretend from the beginning

266
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,720
I guess my head is heavy

267
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,880
Si Tu Mo

268
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,640
Stop pretending

269
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,720
Do you feel pain with your neck?

270
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,200
I'm going to work

271
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,360
Do you need the patch?

272
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,720
No need

273
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,240
Help me then

274
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:10,800
I...

275
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,200
I'm going to work

276
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,680
I'll send you

277
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,880
Are you going to campus today?

278
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,320
Later

279
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,440
The stool is cool

280
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,080
Morning!

281
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,240
Did you check the OA?

282
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,360
What's that?

283
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,360
I thought you laughed out loud

284
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,480
after you checked it out

285
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,120
What did it send?

286
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,640
Let me see

287
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,840
No need

288
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,960
Only two things

289
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,040
First, the company's notice

290
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,400
4 creative departments of the company

291
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,640
must submit at least one artwork

292
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,720
to participate in the Golden Pin
Advertisement Design Competition

293
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,480
It has nothing to do with us

294
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,080
The permanent staffs
are lazy to join it

295
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,680
They think they are not going to win

296
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,080
and it's a waste of time

297
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,080
So they let the trainee to join it

298
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,880
I have a lot of things to do

299
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,840
The second news is related to us

300
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,640
Trainees can leave for
winter holiday this year

301
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,560
Oh, my god!

302
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,720
Really?

303
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,680
Of course

304
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:15,880
I heard,

305
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,720
last year, there's a trainee said

306
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,080
the winter holiday is an
official holiday for graduates

307
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,800
He requested for 3 times of pay

308
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,360
and brought it to
the Human Resource Bureau
Then?

309
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,320
He was fired

310
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,400
What a sad ending!

311
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,880
Winter holiday

312
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,560
The photo edit is a little overdone

313
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,160
The face is too thin

314
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,120
I'll adjust it

315
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,000
Have you checked the OA?

316
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:46,960
Yeah

317
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,840
Please get ready
during the winter holiday

318
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,920
Give me 2 proposals

319
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,360
for each person after the holiday

320
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,240
Okay

321
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,000
Senior

322
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,600
How's the data?

323
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,640
It's done

324
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,080
I'll do the calculation later

325
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,080
Leave it to Gu Wei Yi

326
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,400
Gu Wei Yi?

327
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,320
I can count too

328
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,440
I'm from the math school, okay?

329
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,760
Why do you always

330
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,640
prefer Gu Wei Yi than me?

331
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,760
He can do it faster

332
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,280
Gu Wei Yi

333
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,920
Xie Yu Yin wants you

334
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,320
to make it done in 10 minutes

335
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,120
When did I say it?

336
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,120
You said he can do it faster

337
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,720
You can't say that anyway

338
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,720
It's okay for me

339
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,520
Class

340
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Look who's back

341
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,960
Senior

342
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,760
It's been a long time

343
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,040
When did you back here?

344
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,440
Come on

345
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,040
Gu Wei Yi

346
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,920
Come on

347
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,400
Is it?

348
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,680
You don't know her, do you?

349
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,920
Let me introduce

350
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,040
She is your senior, Lu Jian Shi

351
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,960
The student who went to
Heidelberg in German

352
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,600
The legendary God of Physics,

353
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,800
Senior Lu

354
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,360
Hello, I'm Zhou Lei

355
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:21,800
Hello

356
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,320
Hi

357
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,800
Are you Gu Wei Yi?

358
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:28,800
Hello

359
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,880
I have heard of you
before I went abroad

360
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,800
I hope we could go to Germany together

361
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,440
Professor

362
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,960
Is that cut and dried?

363
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,000
How could you do that?

364
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
No, I didn't

365
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,320
That's what the senior said

366
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,040
Don't lie

367
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,720
I told you

368
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,240
Now your senior is back

369
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,920
because the Heidelberg

370
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,880
authorized her to
watch you two with me

371
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,200
After the winter holiday,

372
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,560
I'll give you the exam

373
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,680
Listen

374
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,880
The result of the exam is a part of it

375
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,960
as well as the usual
experimental performance

376
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,360
There's no cut and dried

377
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,160
Look at you! Do you
look like a scientist?

378
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,800
Okay then

379
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,320
Let me calculate it, take your rest

380
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,400
Do your work

381
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,800
Awesome

382
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,280
Pause, I'll take off my coat

383
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,840
I've never expected
my Shan Shan is so great

384
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,400
I knew you're hot

385
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,400
Don't give me that!

386
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,760
When will Gu Wei Yi come?

387
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,760
Don't care about it, let's play first

388
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,080
Are you okay?

389
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,320
It's okay

390
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,560
I was hit by the racket

391
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,400
Be careful, don't hurt yourself

392
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,160
You'll take care of me anyway

393
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,520
Who's going to take care of you?

394
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,160
The one who feels heartache

395
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,240
I'm alright

396
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,840
Here I am

397
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,760
Go and teach him

398
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,640
You have to let me know

399
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,920
your level in table tennis first

400
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,520
Then only I can teach
in line with your ability

401
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,280
No level

402
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,480
No level?

403
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,000
I knew how to train you systematically

404
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,520
It's not easy

405
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,440
When will you let him to play?

406
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,040
Him?

407
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,480
Let him master the skill first

408
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,920
What time you'll off?

409
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,520
I can leave at 6 pm if no overtime

410
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,760
Are you coming to pick me up?

411
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,440
Rushing to off?

412
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,400
No, I'm just cleaning up the things

413
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,720
Come with me

414
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,480
You've been waiting for so long

415
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,440
Not at all

416
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,720
Before Si Tu comes,

417
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,360
we have gone through

418
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,120
the execution program

419
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,120
and plan

420
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,480
I asked you to bring her

421
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,680
because I want to say hi to her

422
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,840
Zhi Cun

423
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,120
needs your help and care in the future

424
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,280
It's all from

425
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,200
our effort together, right?

426
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,360
Otherwise, the company and brand

427
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,200
won't put us together again

428
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,120
And they requested for

429
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,960
the original crew

430
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,000
That's because you're good enough

431
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,720
Even she's a trainee,

432
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,240
Zhi Cun always praised

433
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,600
her excellent ability

434
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,760
He wants me to work with
er in the next program

435
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,680
Thanks for the compliments

436
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,680
Zhi Cun came right after work

437
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,640
and didn't clean his make up yet

438
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,920
You may go back and rest

439
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,520
Okay

440
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,200
I have a stomach-ache and
I want to go washroom

441
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,840
I'd like to visit the company

442
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Miss Sha Sha is busy

443
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,520
I don't need Miss Sha Sha

444
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,800
She can help me

445
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:52,960
Mo Mo

446
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,080
Bring them around the company

447
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,320
This is the 4th creative department

448
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,600
Nothing interesting in the office

449
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,880
An actor has to experience life

450
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,280
I'll go to the washroom

451
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,039
and we will leave after this

452
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,359
You have a job tomorrow morning

453
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,400
Don't you have a stomachache?

454
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,439
Linda went to the washroom

455
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,760
Why didn't you go with her?

456
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,160
Come on, I'll show you around

457
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,399
I don't want to go

458
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,439
You may off now

459
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,480
Why?

460
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,280
I'm a big-headed

461
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,920
Don't wait

462
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,960
He is not coming to pick you up

463
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,800
No reply means not coming

464
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,280
I'm a man, I know it

465
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,640
I let you off early

466
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,240
You shouldn't bite
the hand that feeds you

467
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,160
Didn't you say you're a big-headed?

468
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,040
I just wanted to try

469
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,280
to be a big-headed

470
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,160
to make Linda pissed off

471
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,800
You're too childish

472
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,920
My fans used to
call it "lovely contrast"

473
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,840
Stop looking at it

474
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,880
I told you that he is
not coming to pick you up

475
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,520
He's not like you

476
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,880
Why?

477
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,360
He's not childish?

478
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,560
Childish?

479
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,920
Get back to your work

480
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,120
That's lovely contrast

481
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,240
Is the car arrived? We're almost there

482
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,920
Gu Wei Yi

483
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,780
Si Tu Mo

484
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,860
Remember to keep the
clothes in the living room

485
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,740
Did you pay me for
keeping the clothes?

486
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,500
Gu Wei Yi, do you have money?

487
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,620
My bus card is running out
of credit, give me RMB2

488
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,220
The wallet is in my pocket

489
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,180
Take it yourself

490
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,940
Gu Wei !

491
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,700
What's wrong?

492
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,300
Where did you get it?

493
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,620
I printed it in front
of the restaurant

494
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,180
Where did you get it?

495
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,700
I don't know

496
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:05,700
I...

497
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,300
I'll give you RMB5

498
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,140
Gu Wei Yi, say it clearly

499
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,380
Gu Wei Yi

500
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,660
Gu Wei Yi
