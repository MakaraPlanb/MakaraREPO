Gu Wei Yi

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,840
What's wrong?

5
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,640
Do you think Mo Mo is pretty?

6
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,320
Hey!

7
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,480
Hey!

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,640
Hello

[Episode 2]

12
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,720
At the critical moment,

13
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,520
the black-face knight came
down from the heaven

14
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,639
Am I looking good?

15
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,440
Not bad

16
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,640
Let me continue the story

17
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,720
Riding on a motorbike

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,720
With the sound of vroom and black fume

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,320
The engine does not go-green, huh?

20
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,800
We have to report it to
the department of environmental

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,750
Don't interrupt

22
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,760
Just ignore them, continue your story

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,640
The black-face knight...

24
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,480
I can't describe it

25
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,600
He saved me and sent me to the hospital

26
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,560
I should not waste my time to hear it

27
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,880
Such a bad ending

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,920
I want to sleep

29
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,000
Shut up!

30
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,560
I'm full

31
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,560
I want to sleep

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,880
Niu Niu, throw the meal box

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,920
Else it will get stink

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,320
Mo Mo, please throw it for me

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,560
Hello

36
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,080
Hello, Mo Mo

37
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,160
Have you eaten your meal?

38
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,240
Yes

39
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,560
That's good

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,640
I forgot to send you meal

41
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,960
as I was busy playing in the cyber cafe

42
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,960
I never put hope on you

43
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,600
Don't be angry with me

44
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,920
Let's go for dinner tonight

45
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,360
I'll pass

46
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,040
Let's go together

47
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,800
Please

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
No

49
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,240
Mo Mo, slow down your voice

50
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,480
They are sleeping

51
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,480
I'll put down the phone first

52
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,200
So early you come back from your lunch

53
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,680
Sir

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,720
I'm not going to meet Professor Jiang

55
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,880
Don't come again

56
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,840
I just came here to chat with you

57
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,640
I'd like to interact with you too

58
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,480
I want to take care

59
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,160
of your study life as
you are our top student

60
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,680
I'm going to do an experiment

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,560
But there's only one goggle

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,960
You...

63
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,360
Take your time

64
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,680
Think about it

65
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,480
I'll come again

66
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,920
Awesome

67
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,840
Mo Mo

68
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,040
Why do you go back so early?

69
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,320
Don't you want to see my game?

70
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,320
I still have some assignments to do

71
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,640
I have something to tell you

72
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,760
What's wrong?

73
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,400
I think

74
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,360
we're quite suitable

75
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,120
Let's get together

76
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,960
after we finish the studies

77
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,360
I knew

78
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,240
today is April's Fool

79
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,400
What say you?

80
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,280
If you say yes, it means I'm serious

81
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
If you say no,

82
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,320
just take it as April's Fool

83
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,760
What say you?

84
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,680
I'll to hit you with
the ball if you say no

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,840
Mo Mo

86
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,800
What's wrong with you?

87
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,720
Nothing

88
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,040
Nothing

89
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,560
Where are you going?

90
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,160
Your limbs are injured

91
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
Don't act recklessly

92
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,480
My leg is almost recovered

93
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,200
I have an interview this afternoon

94
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Interview?

95
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,600
The interview on that day?

96
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,560
That's right

97
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,440
You're really bold, huh?

98
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,360
I will scare if I have no job

99
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,760
I'll go with you

100
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,280
Oh, no

101
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,400
I'll be busy in the afternoon

102
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,040
I can go by myself

103
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
No

104
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,320
I can't let you go alone

105
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
Wait me at the bus station

106
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,480
I won't wait for you

107
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,920
You will wait for me

108
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,080
Are you waiting for the bus?

109
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,680
Fu Pei asked me to come here

110
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,720
Hello

111
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,200
Hello, Gu Wei Yi

112
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,200
I need a favour from you

113
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,960
Accompany Mo Mo to her interview

114
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,000
No way

115
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,600
Please

116
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,040
That place is quite isolated

117
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,760
-She is a girl...
-Why don't you go yourself?

118
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,160
I have a basket ball match

119
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,680
with the media school in the afternoon

120
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,040
No way, you look for someone else

121
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,760
Do you really refuse to go?

122
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,040
I won't go

123
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,400
There will be one more video
on the school forum later

124
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,880
What kind of video?

125
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,280
What say you?

126
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,560
The military training

127
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,280
I have deleted it

128
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,840
I have backed-up a copy

129
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,120
If you go,

130
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,600
I'll delete the video

131
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,120
You don't want me to go with you, right?

132
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,240
Tell him yourself

133
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,320
That place is quite isolated

134
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,680
We have to hurry up get there

135
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,520
You...

136
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,440
Gu Wei Yi

137
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,880
What's your final decision

138
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,600
after you thought thoroughly?

139
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,240
Sir

140
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,680
I'm in a relationship

141
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,160
So, I'll leave it behind first

142
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
In a relationship?

143
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,840
With me?

144
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,320
That's right

145
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,240
Do you have any problem with it?

146
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,920
Yeah, we're in a relationship

147
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,400
Hello

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,560
I'm Gu Wei Yi's lecturer

149
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,800
My name is Si Tu Mo

150
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,760
I agreed with your relationship

151
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,080
Especially when Gu's in a relationship

152
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,360
Thank you

153
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,360
But,

154
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,000
we have an important

155
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,480
selection examination two days before

156
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,640
Gu couldn't sit for the exam because

157
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,520
he didn't bring his student card

158
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,560
I didn't understand

159
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
why would he

160
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,320
make the mistake

161
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,080
But, I fully understood it

162
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,960
when I see you today

163
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,920
It's understandable that someone might

164
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,800
make mistakes when
they're in a relationship

165
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,640
Is his student card with you?

166
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,000
Sir

167
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,680
Please don't disturb us

168
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,760
Last one

169
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,280
We have arranged it

170
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,880
to give him the last chance

171
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
But he claimed

172
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,680
it's unfair to the others

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,720
and refused to meet Professor Jiang

174
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,680
So, I...

175
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,040
Last one, right?

176
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,200
No point you tell her about it

177
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,520
I'm the decision maker

178
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,880
Says who?

179
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,120
I'm the decision maker too

180
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,440
Station of West Road of South

181
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,400
If you want to get down,
please use the back exit

182
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,040
Try to convince him

183
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,040
Advise him

184
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,880
I'll leave now, please advise him

185
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,680
Please advise him

186
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,200
Do you want to get down?

187
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,240
The door is closing

188
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,720
Is it because I took your bag that day?

189
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,520
I took the bag first

190
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,000
It's not your fault

191
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,960
I didn't hear it clearly

192
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm so sorry

193
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,080
It's okay

194
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,200
I'll go to the interview,
what about you?

195
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,360
I'll walk around here

196
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,640
Okay, I'll try to hurry up

197
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,320
Uncle

198
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,480
Uncle

199
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,400
Which floor is Au Xin Advertising?

200
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,920
The lift is under maintenance,
you have to take the stairs

201
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,840
Fifth floor

202
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,400
Thank you

203
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,120
Wu

204
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,520
When will you make

205
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,760
the last payment of RMB250?

206
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,680
Don't worry, I'll work for it

207
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,720
Mr. Zhang, someone comes for interview

208
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,760
Mr. Zhang, someone comes for interview

209
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,040
Wait a moment

210
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,400
Okay?

211
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,720
That's it

212
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,120
Okay

213
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,200
Wang

214
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,240
When will you make

215
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,240
the last payment of RMB500?

216
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,760
You promised to pay on 19th

217
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,640
It's 20th now

218
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,760
What's wrong with you?

219
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,760
We're businessmen, must keep promises

220
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,800
Miss

221
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,240
Hello, I'm here for an interview

222
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,400
Show me your resume

223
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,160
University of South

224
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,960
Not bad

225
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,880
Yes

226
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,240
But, you're not suitable for dog

227
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,800
I don't have a dog

228
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,320
I mean, you major
doesn't match advertising

229
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,680
Yes

230
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,120
I audited advertising class

231
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,120
when I was in the university

232
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,760
Okay

233
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,800
Tell me

234
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,200
What is your expected salary?

235
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,560
The salary is not the
most important thing

236
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,400
To me, the growing and the experience

237
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,400
of the position is more important

238
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,280
Mei!

239
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,280
Mei!

240
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,840
Any courier for me?

241
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,400
Who are you?

242
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,760
I'm the CEO of the company,

243
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,040
Zhang Da Fa

244
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,040
What happened to you?

245
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,640
You don't even know me?

246
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,880
Nothing for you

247
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,760
Go back and wait for our news

248
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,880
Okay, thank you

249
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,080
Can we go now?

250
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,360
Let's go

251
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,280
Thank you for coming here with me

252
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,640
Welcome

253
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,880
I'll buy you a meal

254
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,520
It's alright

255
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,160
I have some calculations to be completed

256
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,200
Let's eat together

257
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,120
I'm serious

258
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
When someone is in bad mood,

259
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,280
he must eat something

260
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,040
I heard a story about a person

261
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,400
wanted to commit suicide with gasoline

262
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,680
He saw a sweet potato beside him

263
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,000
So, he baked the potato

264
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,000
After he finished the potato,

265
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,000
he off the gasoline and went to bed

266
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,680
I'm in good mood

267
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,720
Happy birthday to you

268
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,400
Happy birthday to you

269
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,240
Happy birthday to you

270
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,440
Make a wish

271
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,350
Okay

272
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,310
Cheers

273
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,280
What are you thinking?

274
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,600
Let me show you

275
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,040
Look

276
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,720
No

277
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,960
The scene has limited my performance

278
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,480
The scene has limited my performance

279
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,680
It's easy

280
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,920
I have it too

281
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,680
I have it too

282
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,680
Let's play for a match

283
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,080
Kids

284
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,800
It's hard to play this

285
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,400
You'll cry if you lose to me

286
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,760
You dare not play with us, huh?

287
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,280
You must be the loser

288
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,040
You must be the loser

289
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,920
Heard it?

290
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,960
You must be the loser

291
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,600
Kids

292
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,640
Are you ready?

293
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,120
We're ready

294
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:45,960
Okay

295
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
3, 2, 1

296
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,800
Start!

297
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,560
Fighting!

298
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,640
Fighting!

299
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,600
Fighting!

300
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,400
Fighting!

301
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,400
Let's run away

302
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,080
Wait for me!

303
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,520
It's okay

304
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,600
You are the winner

305
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,600
You won

306
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,800
I told them that they will lose to me

307
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,320
In Physics,

308
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,960
moment of inertia is a physics moment

309
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,560
to describe the spinning object

310
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,800
The more quality,

311
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,320
the more moment of inertia

312
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,560
Although the spinning tops are same size

313
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,800
But my energy is stronger

314
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,400
So...

315
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,720
Okay

316
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,080
I don't believe it

317
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,280
Carry on, I'm hungry

318
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,760
Bro

319
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,080
I can play faster than you

320
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,000
Let's have some cakes

321
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,160
My spinning top

322
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Let's fight

323
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,560
Come on

324
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,400
Run, they're coming

325
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,000
Do you really know how to play?

326
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,720
Play again

327
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,000
I must beat them down

328
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,680
Why do you come back so late?

329
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,080
We went for a meal

330
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,800
Not bad

331
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,080
You treated Mo Mo a meal?

332
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,320
I'll pay you back

333
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
Si Tu Mo treated me

334
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,040
What? You let her treat you?

335
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,640
Why not?

336
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,800
You're really awesome

337
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,480
Well

338
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,920
How was her interview?

339
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,640
I couldn't get her

340
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,280
She is sleeping

341
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,440
Who touched my things?

342
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,840
You created an automatic curtain, right?

343
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,520
I just helped you to test it

344
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,080
Don't touch my things again

345
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,760
Gu Wei Yi

346
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,120
What's wrong?

347
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,320
Do you think Mo Mo is pretty?

348
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,680
I didn't look at her thoroughly

349
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,680
Wake up

350
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,440
I'm awake

351
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,080
How was the interview?

352
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,240
It's not a professional company

353
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,800
But he said my major doesn't
match with the professional

354
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,600
It's hard to get a job
from another field

355
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,720
Don't be sad

356
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,880
Have you eaten your meal?

357
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,840
Yes

358
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,240
With whom?

359
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Fu Pei?

360
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,640
No

361
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,920
The funny man

362
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,680
whom I told you before

363
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,920
Who is he?

364
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,200
Recently, the black-face knight

365
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,360
always turns up

366
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,200
in front of Mo Mo

367
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,120
You don't know him

368
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,800
Just tell us

369
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,600
Gu Wei Yi

370
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,920
We know him

371
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,960
How could you know him?

372
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,600
He always competes

373
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,840
with me for the scholarship

374
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,920
What are you talking about?

375
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,320
He's holding Grade 1

376
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,560
and you're holding Grade 3

377
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,040
Don't brag

378
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,960
Okay, fine

379
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,640
I think,

380
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,560
he is a low-profile handsome guy

381
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,560
Good-looking and low-profile

382
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,320
What a nice guy!

383
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,880
How come I don't know him
since he's so famous?

384
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,640
You didn't focus on it

385
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,240
You only watch dramas and

386
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,040
follow the guy every day

387
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,000
That's why you don't know him

388
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,400
It's a pity

389
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,480
Why?

390
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,800
He is now the negative example

391
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,880
in every graduation meeting

392
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
I heard he didn't bring his pass to sit

393
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,680
for an important selection examination

394
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,120
Some people said his talent

395
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,600
makes him arrogant

396
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,440
Hey!

397
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,880
Hey!

398
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,000
Hello!

399
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,040
Hello!

400
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,680
Do you know Mr. Xu?

401
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,800
Which Mr. Xu?

402
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,640
The lecturer of Physics 1

403
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,800
Gabble Xu?

404
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
I'm looking for him too,
let's go together

405
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,040
Thank you

406
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,880
Come in

407
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,000
Mr. Xu

408
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,560
Professor Jiang asked me to bring

409
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,040
the paper and result to you

410
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,080
How?

411
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,440
None of our students were selected?

412
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,680
Mathematics School got the highest mark

413
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,160
Put it here

414
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,200
Thank you

415
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,480
I'm leaving

416
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,680
Okay

417
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,080
You are...

418
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,520
Good day, I'm Si Tu Mo

419
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,240
We met on the bus

420
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,000
Gu Wei Yi's girlfriend

421
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,320
How is it?

422
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Any good news for me?

423
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,280
I wanted to know

424
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,760
how can you help

425
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,600
Gu Wei Yi

426
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Please come on

427
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,160
Professor Jiang

428
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,640
Why are you here again?

429
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,920
Come on

430
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,280
I guess you will gabble around again

431
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,880
Help me to clean the white board

432
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,920
Okay

433
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,920
Professor

434
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,720
Do you still remember my student,

435
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,040
Gu Wei Yi?

436
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,360
The fact is you didn't sit for the exam

437
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,640
No point even if you're grumbling here

438
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,200
You?

439
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,360
Me?

440
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,320
At the beginning,

441
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,400
I told the school that

442
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,800
I want the top student

443
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,720
But they want to follow
the selection procedure

444
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,600
At the end,

445
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,640
the student of

446
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,440
Mathematics school got the highest mark

447
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,080
Now they told me...

448
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,720
Professor

449
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,120
She is not Gu Wei Yi

450
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,880
She is Gu Wei Yi's girlfriend

451
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,760
What are you

452
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,720
doing here?

453
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,600
Tell your boyfriend

454
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,960
No matter who plead with me,

455
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,440
you must show me your ability
to take part in my project

456
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,760
Professor Jiang

457
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,680
Are you saying that
you only believe the ability?

458
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,480
That's right

459
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,520
You never see

460
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,800
my boyfriend's ability

461
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,480
How could you know

462
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,240
if he is the top student?

463
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,160
He is number 1 in Physics school

464
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,320
Didn't you feel regret

465
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,440
if you didn't test his level?

466
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,480
That's right

467
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,600
He is the top student of Physics
school for continuous 3 years

468
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,120
If he is taken away
by other professor...

469
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Well

470
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,160
I have a set of papers

471
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,360
of graduation examination

472
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,320
Let him do the test

473
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,880
I want to see

474
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,040
his level

475
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:33,960
Thank you, Professor Jiang

476
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,120
Okay

477
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,760
Mr. Xu, I'm leaving

478
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,800
Professor Jiang, see you

479
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,240
Mo Mo

480
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,800
You're here for me?

481
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,280
What a lucky day!

482
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,680
I need your favour

483
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,200
What's it?

484
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,800
I will do everything
for you no matter what

485
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,760
Help me to look for Gu Wei Yi

486
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,480
What is it about?

487
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,400
I wrongly took his bag that day

488
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
That's right

489
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,040
At last, he didn't bring
his student card

490
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,400
and gave up from the selection

491
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,960
You knew it?

492
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,560
Yeah, what's wrong?

493
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,400
I feel guilty

494
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,800
as it is related to me

495
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,120
You're so kind

496
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,040
It's okay, it's only an accident

497
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,080
Don't put it in your heart

498
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,480
I got a set of papers
from Professor Jiang

499
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,360
Just let him complete it

500
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,920
He might have a chance

501
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,000
You don't know him

502
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,520
I'm sure he will talk about

503
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,320
fair

504
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,400
and square

505
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,840
I'm afraid that I can't convince him

506
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,800
Look for him

507
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,200
and I can convince him

508
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,280
Don't you believe me?

509
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,880
You'll know it later

510
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,640
I knew where is he now

511
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,360
Let's look for him

512
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,920
Mo Mo

513
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,600
What's wrong?

514
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,080
Do you think Gu Wei Yi

515
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,080
is good-looking?

516
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:04,880
Forget it

517
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,280
Don't think about it, hurry up

518
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,560
Does he look like Cyclops

519
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,120
of The X-men?

520
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,440
Cut the crap

521
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,920
Slowly

522
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,800
Why are you here?

523
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,760
I have a set of papers

524
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,000
of Physics graduation exam

525
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
How did  you get it?

526
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,280
I met Professor Jiang today

527
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,240
Professor Jiang gave me the paper

528
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,760
None of your business

529
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,720
Stop doing the useless things

530
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,680
It has nothing to do with you

531
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
Professor Jiang said,

532
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,800
he doesn't care about
the student like you

533
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,320
He said,

534
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,880
there is a top student
of Physics in every year

535
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,720
The first place is nothing

536
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,280
Not many people can follow
the path of scientific research

537
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,360
Because the scientific research

538
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,200
needs the sharpest brain

539
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,800
and calmest heart

540
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,160
He thinks that

541
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,720
you are not qualified

542
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,800
I think Gu Wei Yi meets the requirements

543
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,880
I told him the same

544
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,080
So,

545
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
Professor Jiang gave me the paper

546
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,320
He said, the paper was prepared

547
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,080
for the graduation examination

548
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,440
It's high level and tough

549
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,600
He wanted to test your level

550
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,840
I said no to Professor Jiang

551
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,440
Gu Wei Yi is only

552
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,800
an undergraduate student

553
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,040
How can he do the graduation exam?

554
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,080
That's right

555
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,840
Professor Jiang is trying to trouble you

556
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,880
That's right

557
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,000
Professor Jiang never expect you

558
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,040
to complete the examination

559
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,440
Thank you

560
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,360
I haven't finished the calculation yet

561
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,840
What? You haven't got the answer?

562
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,640
So sorry

563
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,600
Done?

564
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,320
This is the first time I see you smile

565
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,160
Calculation makes me happy

566
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,520
Fu Pei

567
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,200
I don't want to eat that

568
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,720
He's done, let's go

569
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,880
-Let's go
-I don't want it

570
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
Let's go

571
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,200
He's done?

572
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,120
Let's eat something

573
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,520
Let's go for a steamboat

574
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,120
Let's go

575
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,440
Xuan Xuan

576
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,040
Will you come for the match tomorrow?

577
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,480
I'm telling you in advanced

578
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,520
Didn't you say your buddy is strong?

579
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,760
Bring him along tomorrow

580
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,440
Let's have a match

581
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,520
Beauty

582
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,880

583
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,560
Will you come for the match tomorrow?

584
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,800
Fairy

585
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
Will you come for the match tomorrow?

586
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,600
Let's play together again

587
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,160
For the dual fight

588
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,240
Look

589
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,800
You're quiet when I
talk about basket ball

590
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,200
Are you afraid to lose?

591
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:16,879
Thank you

592
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,520
Thank you

593
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,040
Welcome

594
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,000
Your drinks

595
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,600
Thank you

596
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,360
Your girlfriend drinks beer?

597
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,190
She is not my girlfriend

598
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,150
She doesn't drink beer

599
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,120
I want a beer

600
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,280
Mo Mo

601
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,640
Eat something, don't
keep on taking the beer

602
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,840
Don't you know why I drink so much?

603
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,360
I knew, that's why I'm asking you

604
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,600
You really like to act

605
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,240
Fu Pei

606
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,360
What kind of girls you like?

607
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:47,880
Why?

608
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,880
You want to get one for me?

609
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,960
There are many girls in your school

610
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,400
Please get a girl for me

611
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,880
Okay

612
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,960
I will get a silly girl for you

613
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,760
Are you Gu Wei Yi?

614
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
Are you on a date with Si Tu?

615
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,480
That's right

616
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,000
Okay, carry on

617
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,320
I'm okay

618
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,720
You can't even walk properly

619
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,560
Fu Pei

620
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,120
What's wrong?

621
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,560
You're so ugly

622
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,720
Since you're so ugly,
I want to stop my crush on you

623
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,240
You're drunk

624
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,360
Bull shit

625
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,080
What's the relationship
between you and Mo Mo?

626
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,720
You asked me to accompany
Si Tu Mo to an interview that day

627
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,320
We met Mr. Xu on the way

628
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,680
He wanted me to meet Professor Jiang

629
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,760
So I lied

630
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,080
that I was having a date with Si Tu Mo

631
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,720
I just didn't want him to disturb me

632
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But you have finished
the examination paper

633
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,840
Why did you lie again?

634
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,680
I just wanted to give you a lesson

635
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,520
What do you mean?

636
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,240
You are trying to
avoid Si Tu Mo's feeling

637
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,560
We're just friends

638
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,400
Is it?

639
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,120
Then what makes you questioning me now?

640
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,360
Well

641
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,040
Stay away from Mo Mo

642
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,560
I'm alright

643
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,280
You should ask yourself

644
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,880
Can you control me?

645
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,560
Don't be sad

646
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,360
That's right

647
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,640
Just treat him as a scum

648
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
It's alright, don't be sad

649
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,680
Don't cry

650
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,240
Enough

651
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,920
No

652
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,080
Will you get together with Fu Pei

653
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,680
after the graduation?

654
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,920
We will not be together

655
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,800
Mo Mo

656
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,880
Mo Mo, I didn't mean it

657
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,160
I just want to cut the crap

658
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,920
After all, we're going to graduate soon

659
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,640
Are you afraid?

660
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,000
I don't have to

661
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,000
I'm not afraid

662
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,720
Mo Mo

663
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,440
Forget it

664
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,600
Just forget it

665
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,440
I said it merely as a joke

666
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,280
The girl grabbed Fu Pei

667
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,000
Here is she

668
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,800
Don't be angry

669
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,520
I knew that you didn't
take serious in everything

670
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,080
I knew that the promise
was merely a joke

671
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,120
But I thought that
I could make you changed

672
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,040
I'm so sorry

673
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,600
I was too cocky

674
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,040
Not that serious

675
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,560
Forget our promise then

676
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
I told you that I just said it merely

677
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,840
You just said it merely

678
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,360
Okay

679
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,920
I asked it merely

680
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,480
Now we reach a consensus

681
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,120
So we're just friends in the future

682
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,160
Do you really lack of friends?

683
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,480
Where are you going?

684
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,800
None of your business

685
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,240
Mo Mo

686
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,080
Do you really refuse to go?

687
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,320
I won't go

688
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,200
There will be one more video
on the school forum later

689
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,280
What kind of video?

690
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,880
What say you?

691
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,400
The military training

692
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,480
Attention!

693
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:43,960
Stand at ease

694
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,640
Sir

695
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,600
I want to be your student

696
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,840
Why?

697
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,600
Because you are one of

698
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,520
the greatest physicians in the world

699
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,800
Your effort in the human development

700
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,800
made the decisive catalyst effect

701
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,040
Since you admire me so much,

702
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,000
do you know what's my name?

703
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,120
The greatest

704
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,200
Albert Einstein
