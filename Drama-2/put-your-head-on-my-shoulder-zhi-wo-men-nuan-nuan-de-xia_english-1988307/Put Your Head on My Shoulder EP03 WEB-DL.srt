Hello, are you Si Tu Mo?

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,880
Don't mention it

49
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,120
I couldn't remember it

50
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,160
Did I do anything shameful last night?

51
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,680
Yes

You

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,040
hugged me tightly

54
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,040
After that,

55
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,039
you held my face

56
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,280
and wanted to

57
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,200
kiss me

58
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,680
I said no

59
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,280
Behave and be calm

60
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,800
And you touched me

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,840
in this way

62
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,720
You touched here,

63
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,840
here

64
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,520
and here

65
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,990
At last, you hold me in this way

66
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,760
Is that Fu Pei?

67
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,320

68
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,200
Yeah

69
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
You kissed me and hugged me

70
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,760
I said no as there're many people around

71
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,280
You said, it's alright

72
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,200
You enjoyed it very much

73
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,080
Come in

74
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,440
Good day, Professor Jiang

75
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,600
You're

76
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,400
Gu Wei Yi

77
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,920
Did you complete the paper alone?

78
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,200
Yes

79
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,840
Well,

80
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,760
you should join our project team

81
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,160
I think

82
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,440
you're quite suitable

83
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,080
This is out of the rules

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,200
There's a top scorer
in the last examination

85
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,800
He should join your project team

86
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,320
You didn't sit for
the examination, did you?

87
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,360
I have checked your level

88
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
If you sit for the examination,

89
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,320
you may get the highest mark

90
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,960
How can you say this?

91
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,120
Yes, you're absent

92
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,720
Look at this

93
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
I have taken the top scorer

94
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,120
to join our project team too

95
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,680
Don't you want to

96
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,520
work and study together

97
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,440
with the top students?

98
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,760
You can even fight with him

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,200
Are you recruiting for 2 person?

100
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,480
2 person?

101
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,000
If the experiment needs more people,

102
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,320
I can recruit more candidates

103
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,400
After all, I don't have to pay you guys

104
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,040
Piss off?

105
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,480
Think about it

106
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,720
This is the top team of the college

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,640
Don't you want to join us?

108
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,200
Look

109
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,240
If someone gossips behind you,

110
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,520
I'll attack him with this

111
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,640
Thank you, Professor Jiang

112
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,520
Finally, you agreed to join us?

113
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,240
Mr. Xu

114
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,880
told me that you're so fussy

115
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,400
and won't join us easily

116
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,200
So, I have prepared a lot of reason

117
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,720
to convince you

118
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,440
It's alright

119
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,360
I want to join in the best team

120
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,720
I'll brief you about

121
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
our company's background

122
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,680
Recently, we'll recruit some trainees

123
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,280
We'll pick the elites among them

124
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,360
and keep them in our company

125
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,560
How many trainees

126
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,320
that you have recruited?

127
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,240
10

128
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,640
But, you're the only
trainee in my department

129
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,040
If you have no problem,

130
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,120
just do your best

131
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
I will try my best to
keep the position for you

132
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,280
Alright, thank you, Sis Qing

133
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,280
Anyway,

134
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,400
the employment

135
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,320
is a two-ways choice

136
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,160
You may think about it after this

137
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,440
Mom, I'm not going back

138
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,040
Your father has talked to Uncle Li

139
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,240
Uncle Li wants you

140
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,240
to work as an accounting
clerk in his factory

141
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,760
I found a trainee job
and I'm not going back

142
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,520
Why don't you back to the hometown?

143
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,880
You don't have to pay for
the rental and eat outside

144
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,280
Then, you can save more money

145
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,400
I found a job in a big company

146
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,040
May people want to work for them

147
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,720
What company is that?

148
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,760
Pu Hua Accounting Firm

149
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,720
What?

150
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,120
Putonghua?

151
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,880
I have never heard it, is it reliable?

152
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,600
You went to several interviews before

153
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,680
and still jobless

154
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,760
Don't decide recklessly

155
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,760
Quickly come back after the graduation

156
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,120
Even if you found a trainee job,

157
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,880
you don't know if they want to
keep you as a permanent staff

158
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,480
It's hard to make a living in a big city

159
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,280
You have to go out

160
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,800
in the early morning
and work until late night

161
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,960
You are a girl

162
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,640
Your father and I are worried about you

165
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,270
Mo Mo, I'm talking to you

166
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
You...

167
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,720
Mo Mo

168
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,960
Mo Mo, are you listening?

169
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,680
I'm talking to you

170
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,720
How is the company?

171
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,080
You don't know about it

172
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Mind your words

173
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,920
Let me try

174
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,560
Where is the location of the company?

175
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,000
Is that far from your college?

176
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,760
It's in Guomao's area,
a bit far from here

177
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,360
I'll look for a room later

178
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,960
My friend has a house

179
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,720
What about...

180
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,680
Mom, let me handle it myself

181
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,600
You?

182
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,520
Since you're so smart,

183
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,920
can't you just give birth to yourself?

184
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,000
Alright

185
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,600
You're really...

186
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,120
Okay, bye

187
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,360
Bye

188
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,160
Attention to everyone

189
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,920

Si Tu Mo

191
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,720
If you need help,

192
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,880
you may look for her

193
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Hello, everybody!

194
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,600

That's your seat

196
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,840
You just sit there

197
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,840
I'll get the

198
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,400
administration department
to set up the computer for you

199
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,520
Thank you

200
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,680
Do your work

201
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,360
Sis Qing

202
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,480
Sis Qing

203
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,480
Please record the certificate

204
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,480
Okay

205
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,920
Hello

206
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,720
Don't push

207
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,760
Don't push

208
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,720
I never push

209
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,720
Hurry up

210
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
-Move inside please
-My bag!

211
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,600
Just move inside

212
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,520
Can't board it

213
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,920
Forget it, let's take another bus
Ths bus is full

214
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,280
Hello, mom

215
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,760
Mo Mo, are you back to the dorm?

216
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,480
Have you taken your meal?

217
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,320
No

218
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,960
Why aren't you back at this hour?

219
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,120
Still on duty?

220
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,080
I was unable to board the bus
because it was too crowded

221
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,400
I'll walk to the next two station

222
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,880
You travel so hard everyday

223
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,800
I have talked to Aunt Xu

224
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Her house

225
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,880
is near to your office

226
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,160
No one is staying there now

227
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,760
You just need to clean it up

228
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,680
Aunt Xu

229
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,280
left the keys in the mailbox

230
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,440
I'll send the number to you

231
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,880
Okay

232
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,720
Gu Wei Yi

233
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,160
What's your name?

234
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,840
Xie Yu Yin, I'm from Graduation Class 2

235
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,040
Hello, Senior Xie

236
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,320
You got it wrong here

237
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,280
Here

238
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,840
Thank you

239
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,040
It's okay as long as you correct it

240
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,280
FP

241
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,080
FP

242
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,080
Fart?

243
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,960
It's done

244
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,080
Let's go to have some food

245
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,240
Okay

246
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
What are we going to eat?

247
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,280
There's a new beef noodle downstairs
The food is nice

248
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,920
Alright

249
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,840
Si Tu...

250
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,160
Mo

251
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,200
I'm Kang Lin

252
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,160
You can call me Xiao Lin

253
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Hello, Xiao Lin

254
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,640
Are you having lunch in the office?

255
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,000
That's right

256
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,440
The smell of Liuzhou River
Snails Rice Noodle

257
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,440
is too strong

258
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,760
It lasts for the whole noon

259
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,680
You might not smell it

260
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,760
But all of us are going
to be crazy in the chat group

261
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,920
I'm so sorry

262
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,680
I don't know that you hate it

263
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,600
Aren't you invited to the chat group?

264
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,160
You have been here for several days

265
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,800
Let me add you into the group

266
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,040
Be smart

267
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,240
Okay

268
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,480
Scan my ID

269
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,880
Let's eat together

270
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,520
Where should we go for

271
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,600
Liuzhou River Snails Rice Noodle?

272
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,760
Wait, let me look for it

273
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,720
Xiao Lin

274
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,280
The shop was penalized
due to the hygiene problem

275
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,760
You have a strong stomach

276
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,080
Fortune telling?

277
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,280
Please check my fortune

278
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,240
It's not funny

279
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,720
I heard you joined Professor Jiang's lab

280
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,200
You made it, didn't you?

281
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,080
You're right

282
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,720
Si Tu Mo

283
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,759
Do you smell something stinking?

284
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,680
No

285
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,600
It comes from your body

286
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,030
I just took
Liuzhou River Snails Rice Noodle

287
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,200
You'd better take bath in the dorm first

288
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,200
I'm no longer staying in the dorm

289
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,520
I have moved out for a week

290
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,440
If I go back to the dorm,

291
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,120
they will ask me to pay on the bill

292
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,640
I'm quite poor recently

293
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,040
Have you ever rented a house?

294
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,040
No

295
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,880
My landlord is really strange

296
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,600
The decoration of the house
is just like a sample house

297
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,080
Cool and lack of sense of humanity

298
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,960
I feel like sleeping in the mortuary

299
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,120
So, I'll

300
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,400
I want to read a book here

301
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,920
It looks like a mortuary here

302
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,880
Hello, mom

303
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Are you staying in Aunt Xu's house?

304
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,240
Yes

305
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,080
Did you dirty the house?

306
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,400
No it's clean

307
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,920
Alright

308
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,240
Aunt Xu said,

309
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,000
her kid might go back to
the house for several days

310
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,520
When?

311
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,040
Tomorrow

312
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Are you cleaning up the house?

313
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,520
Don't dirty the house

314
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,560
No it's clean

315
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,000
Why are you here?

316
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,880
Are you

317
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,880
Aunt Xu's son?

318
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,120
Hello

319
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,440
So,

320
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,680
you said

321
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,360
that my house is a mortuary?

322
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,240
I'll increase the temperature

323
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,560
It's a bit cold

324
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,840
I can explain for it

325
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,080
Explain it

326
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,280
I wanted to restore it

327
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,840
to original before tomorrow

328
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,640
My mother told me that
you'll be back tomorrow

329
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,080
I had an experiment in the old school

330
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,720
and I couldn't get a cab as it's raining

331
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,440
Will you stay here tonight?

332
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,040
Why did I back here then?

333
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,600
That's right

334
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,960
I don't know Aunt Xu's kid

335
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,680
is a boy

336
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,640
I don't know the child

337
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,720
of my mother's friend is a girl

338
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,800
I'll move out then

339
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,240
I'll back to the dorm now

340
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,200
Can I just

341
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,800
move out tomorrow?

342
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,920
Okay, keep the things

343
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,080
Okay

344
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,960
Throw the Liuzhou River
Snails Rice Noodle first

345
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,280
I haven't finished it

346
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,600
Throw it

347
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,160
Please

348
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,600
Okay

349
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,520
I'll throw it

350
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,320
What are you waiting for?

351
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,360
Put down the bolster

352
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,000
It will be smelly

353
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,960
I won't throw it

354
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,160
You throw it

355
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,720
Help me throw it

356
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,160
It's stink and I don't want to touch it

357
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,360
I'll throw it later

358
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,560
It's stink

359
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,600
Okay, wait a moment

360
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,640
Why?

361
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,520
Can't you just throw it right now?

362
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,880
Wait a moment

363
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,400
Right now

364
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,440
I don't wear my inner

365
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,400
Understand?

366
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,280
Take your time

367
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,480
Take your time

368
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,800
Why didn't you wear it?

369
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,160
Are you wearing an inner in the house?

370
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,760
Let me clean it

371
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,400
Thank you

372
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,840
Let me help on it

373
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,560
It's done

374
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,840
You or me first?

375
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,320
You first

376
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,400
Wait for me then

377
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,720
Hurry up

378
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,280
So tired

379
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,640
Done?

380
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,000
Almost done?

381
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,040
Not yet

382
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,560
I'm done, go ahead

383
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,280
I'll go to bath now

384
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,080
Si Tu Mo

385
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,200
You have only one toothbrush?

386
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,720
That's right

387
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,840
My toothbrush!

388
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,600
Wait a moment

389
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,760
This is the only toothbrush
that I could find in the house

390
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Thanks

391
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,920
What now?

392
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,600
Can you give me one?

393
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,960
Mom, what's wrong with you?

394
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,320
Why didn't you tell me

395
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,120
that Aunt Xu's kid is a boy?

396
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,440
How?

397
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,280
I heard he's good-looking

398
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,680
Mom

399
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,880
Okay

400
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,640
It's alright

401
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,560
Aunt Xu said, he won't be always there

402
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,040
Moreover,

403
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,080
it's alright for you
two to stay together

404
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,320
Then you can know him better

405
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,200
I heard he has been holding

406
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,440
the scholarship all the time

407
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,040
and he's handsome

408
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,240
He won't fall into you

409
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,000
I'll have to pray in the
temple if he's into you

410
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,800
Si Tu Mo, are you listening to me?

411
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,920
Yes, I'll move back to the dorm tomorrow

412
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,360
You're really pig-headed

413
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,200
You really piss me off!

414
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,440
You piss me off too

415
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,120
Mom

416
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,680
What's wrong?

417
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,800
Why didn't you tell me
the kid of your friend is a girl?

418
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,160
What's the problem?

419
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,560
You don't like a girl, do you?

420
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,560
I mean...

421
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,520
You don't like a girl

422
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,280
and even a boy

423
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,960
Moreover,

424
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,280
you're not staying there now

425
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,080
You pissed off by me?

426
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,240
It's okay, I'll go to bed now

427
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,840
Okay

428
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,120
What's wrong?

429
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,800
I only sleep on my bed, so I'd like
to exchange the room with you

430
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,240
What's wrong with you?

431
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,280
I'm stomach-ache

432
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,000
Wait, I'll get the medicine for you

433
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,560
I used to take this when I was
stomach-ache during my childhood

434
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,720
Hold it

435
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,760
Si Tu Mo

436
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,080
Si Tu Mo

437
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,000
Hello, this is service of 120

438
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
I'm in Guan Mei Garden
of Xiu Xin Road, Gu Qian

439
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,720
My house number is 1708

440
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,840
I need an ambulance

441
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,680
Okay, where did the patient hurt?

442
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,600
She is having a stomach-ache

443
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,400
When will the ambulance arrive?

444
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,360
I have arranged it for you

445
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,000
Is she conscious?

446
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,760
No, when will the ambulance arrive?

447
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,120
Is the breathing smooth?

448
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,120
Has she taken any medicine?

449
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,600
When will the ambulance arrive?

450
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,320
Sir, please calm down

451
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,600
and answer my question

452
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,280
Has she taken any food
or medicine before?

453
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,320
I killed her with poison

454
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,920
When will the ambulance arrive?

455
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,160
What happened?

456
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,680
She took the dirty Rice Noodle

457
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,840
and it caused Acute Gastoenteritis

458
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,000
Poison?

459
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,200
She took the expired gastric pill

460
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,560
and her boyfriend was very anxious

461
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,080
Let's go and check it out

462
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,840
Okay

463
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,320
I told you that I can't go back now

464
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,240
My child is sick

465
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,440
That's all

466
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,520
Okay

467
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,840
You look familiar

468
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,479
You checked her limbs when
she was injured that day

469
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,800
The wheelchair

470
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,840
You again, huh?

471
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,839
She is having Acute Gastoenteritis

472
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,390
and the pain makes her fainted

473
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,520
She only needs to finish the drip
and to be observed for one night

474
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,199
Then, she can go home

475
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,350
Doctor

476
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,519
Why isn't she awake?

477
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,389
Are you sure it's Gastoenteritis?

478
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,999
Yes, it's only Gastoenteritis

479
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:37,869
Don't worry

480
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,429
She's just sleeping

481
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,120
Well

482
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,950
If you love your girlfriend so much,

483
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,599
please take good care of her

484
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,200
Don't give her poison

485
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:52,559
Doctor

486
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,390
Look at my child

487
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,240
He's painful for a long time

488
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,720
What's his problem?

489
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
What happened to him?

490
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,240
He said that he's having a stomach-ache

491
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,720
since the morning

492
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,520
The examination shows everything's fine

493
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,640
But he cried when we got home

494
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:06,910
Let me check it out

495
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,000
It's okay

496
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,240
It's okay

497
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,160
It's painful

498
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,080
Boy, you have an
examination tomorrow, right?

499
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,600
How did you know?

500
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,040
It's okay, you can go home now

501
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,600
Doctor
He's crying

502
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,800
How could you say it's fine?

503
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,040
He has an examination tomorrow

504
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,880
So, he's pretending

505
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,520
It's painful

506
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:30,960
Wait a moment

507
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,960
My boy is painful

508
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,120
How could you say he's pretending?

509
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,320
Are you really a doctor?

510
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,560
Mind your words

511
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,480
I'm a doctor

512
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,480
When I said he's fine, he is just fine

513
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,520
So what?

514
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,000
You must check his body

515
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:44,760
I tell you

516
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,040
This is a hospital, don't act recklessly

517
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,560
So what?

518
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,600
If you heal my boy, I'll keep quiet

519
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,800
Otherwise,

520
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,520
I'll destroy the hospital

521
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,400
Gu Wei Yi

522
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,960
Happy birthday

523
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,000
Thank you

524
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,400
Why do you look so cool?

525
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,080
Thank you

526
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,720
Happy birthday

527
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,640
Come on

528
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,640
I have a present for you

529
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,240
Who gave you the
permission to lie on my bed?

530
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,360
Come down

531
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,920
I'm giving myself to you

532
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,120
Come down now

533
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,720
Don't show a fierce look on your face

534
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,760
Come on

535
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,320
I have a present for you

536
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,360
Take off the blanket

537
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,840
Be patient

538
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,480
Fu Pei

539
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,960
The basketball is me

540
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,560
I'm a basketball

541
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,520
I'm giving myself to you

542
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,840
Fu Pei

543
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,920
You're so shameful

544
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,440
We paid for the present together

545
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,320
Why did you only put your name?

546
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,760
I'm the one who bought it

547
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,400
I'm not going to play the basketball

548
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,560
You have to work it out
