[Put Your Head On My Shoulder]

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,540
[Summary]

3
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
Make a contract with me

4
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,200
What contract?

5
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,800
The contract of
"You Will Never Move Out"

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,000
[Episode 6]

7
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,120
Two of you are matched

8
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
People might think

9
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,520
you've been
living together for years

10
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,200
Mom

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,840
Could you please stop
talking nonsense?

12
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,760
What did I say?

13
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,720
You think too much

14
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,600
When are you leaving?

15
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,920
You said you'll stay for a night,
but it's going to second night

16
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,120
Alright

17
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,120
I knew

18
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,320
Xiao Gu never asks me to leave

19
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,280
How can you ask me to leave?

20
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,080
Am I right, Xiao Gu?

21
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:47,920
Yes

22
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,800
This is nice

23
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,640
Morning

24
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,800
Morning

25
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,680
Let's dig in

26
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,920
Take a bun

27
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,520
Take it

28
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,280
Look like you guys are not rushing today

29
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,400
I'm going back to school

30
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,920
to discuss about my thesis

31
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,760
I'm going as well

32
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Are you going together?

33
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,000
What's wrong?

34
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,040
Nothing

35
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,280
You answered it without a hitch

36
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,120
Why are you going back to school?

37
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,440
How is the experiment in the old campus?

38
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,280
Professor Jiang will stay
at the new campus today

39
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,440
I need to see him for something

40
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,040
I see

41
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,200
Are you still listening the cross talk?

42
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,320
Are you still listening the cross talk?

43
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm too busy recently and forgot
to download the new show

44
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,120
I have downloaded it

45
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:55,920
Thank you

46
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,560
Surprise!

47
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:50,920
Mo Mo

48
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,640
It creeps me out

49
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,960
It creeps me out

50
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,200
Why do you look guilty?

51
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,320
The staff will check on those
high power consumption today

52
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,720
Put it at the place we used to hide

53
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
The small room at the
end of the corridor

54
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,960
was found by her

55
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,160
Then what should we do?

56
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,320
I plan to hide the boiler
inside the dirty clothes basket

57
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,280
She will never touch the basket

58
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,680
Then I'll be safe

59
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,680
How long you didn't wash the socks?

60
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,640
Meng Lu took it from his boyfriend

61
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,440
Her boyfriend then took

62
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,160
a pile of stinking socks from others

63
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,440
What are you doing?

64
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,680
Cleaning up the room

65
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,760
Or hiding your boiler?

66
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,040
No, we're not

67
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
We collect those dirty clothes

68
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,840
and plan to wash them together

69
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,840
What is this?

70
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,040
Dirty clothes

71
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,040
Hands off

72
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,080
We didn't wash it for two weeks

73
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,120
The clothes are very dirty

74
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,240
Well

75
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,600
The room hygiene is part of

76
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,640
the spot-check

77
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,720
Are you really hungry?

78
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,120
You cook the socks as well?

79
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,680
Come get it after your graduation

80
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,160
I...

81
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,000
Aunt...

82
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,240
It creeps me out

83
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,040
Aunt...

84
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,120
Aunt...

85
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,920
Hello

86
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,400
I'm not interested in fitness,

87
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,400
nor health care products

88
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,400
No

89
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,840
I'm Si Tu Mo's friend

90
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,720
My name is Fu Pei

91
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,640
Do you still remember me?

92
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,520
Maybe I'm getting older

93
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,120
That's why

94
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,400
I can't remember you

95
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,640
I went to your house before

96
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,880
I sent the report card to Mo Mo

97
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,440
and you treated me with walnuts

98
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,800
It's such a waste

99
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,400
What did you say?

100
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,480
Nothing

101
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,080
I need to prepare the meal,
let's chat next time

102
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,800
Mom

103
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,800
With whom you're chatting with?

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,760
You're back

105
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,240
You're back

106
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,160
Let's go, I'll make you soup

107
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,680
Hurry up!

108
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,160
Aunt

109
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,800
We have to

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,080
go back for dinner

111
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,840
You shall go back too

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,640
Hurry up go back

113
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,280
Let's go

114
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:28,880
Aunt

115
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,640
Fu Pei again?

116
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,160
There's once

117
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,560
during your secondary school,

118
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,680
you locked yourself inside the room

119
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
and cried for a whole night

120
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,360
Your diary was full
with the words of "Fui Pei"

121
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,080
Mom, how could you read my diary?

122
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,800
Because you cried for the whole night

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,880
Your father and I couldn't
sleep for the whole night

124
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,560
It is too exaggerated

125
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,600
I thought you have broken up with him

126
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,440
I don't want to keep
in touch with him

127
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,760
Mo Mo

128
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,560
Since you're small,
you are

129
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,880
more sensible than your brother and sister

130
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,960
You don't usually cry

131
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,720
and you do everything independently

132
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,320
But at that time,

133
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,840
you were depressed

134
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,240
for quite some time because of him

135
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,880
However, you pretended
like nothing happened

136
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,560
We dare not ask you

137
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,800
Did you know how sad we were?

138
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,320
My little Mo

139
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,320
Actually, your father and I

140
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,200
never put any expectation

141
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,120
or hope on three of you

142
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,520
We never expect you
to make any big achievement

143
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,120
We just want you

144
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,720
to live happily

145
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,600
I knew

146
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,600
about Fu Pei

147
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,280
He wasn't a bad boy,

148
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,000
but only fickle

149
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,920
If you really get together with him,

150
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,400
I bet you will always

151
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
keep everything in your heart

152
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,360
and get things settled in tears

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,680
Mo Mo

154
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,280
Don't stoop to reach a compromise

155
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,080
You can't do so

156
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,280
That's not the right way

157
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,640
Mom

158
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,520
Alright

159
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,560
Stop talking about him

160
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,240
Let me tell you some good news

161
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,720
What kind of good news?

162
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,240
I'll go home tomorrow

163
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,400
I have packed everything up

164
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,800
You always want me to go back

165
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,560
Like I'm forcing

166
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,040
you and Xiao Gu to do something

167
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,560
Mom

168
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,880
I'm not driving you away

169
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,320
I'm...

170
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,080
Alright

171
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,280
I know you very well

172
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,280
Okay, I won't interfere
your business again

173
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,040
Mind your business

174
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,560
by your own in the future

175
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,640
This boy is so stupid

176
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,800
You must not find a boyfriend like him

177
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,840
Okay

178
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,120
This girl is so stupid too

179
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,680
You must not act like the girl

180
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,440
Understand?

181
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,440
Okay

182
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,480
So stupid

183
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,160
I'm back, aunt

184
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,120
Xiao Gu, you're back

185
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,120
Come and sit here

186
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,560
Have you taken your dinner?

187
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,160
Yeah

188
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,640
I'm thinking

189
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,000
to tell you something

190
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,040
I'll go back to my home tomorrow

191
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,760
I hope

192
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,640
you'll take a good care of Mo Mo

193
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,440
Okay

194
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,680
You are always welcomed

195
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,880
Alright

196
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,400
Take your seat first

197
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,480
I'll go and bring you some oranges

198
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,440
Gu Wei Yi

199
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,040
You very smart, right?

200
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,600
Perhaps, you can help me
write my graduation thesis

201
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,040
Just forget it

202
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,400
You won't understand it as
we are not in the same subject

203
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,080
What is the topic of your thesis?

204
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,640
It will creep you out

205
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,880
I'm ready for it

206
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,200
To informationize the SME Accounting

207
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,640
by cloud computing model research

208
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,840
Is that making you confused?

209
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,200
What is the topic of your thesis?

210
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,320
The law of Viscosity of Polyvinyl

211
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,080
The improvement of viscosity-
average molecular weight

212
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,920
Sorry for disturbing you

213
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,880
Your thesis is not going well?

214
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,160
I was scolded by the lecturer

215
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
He said the thesis doesn't show
my own point of view

216
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,480
and the points are unclear

217
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,000
He didn't see any of my view pertaining
to the future of accounting

218
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,480
How should I know it?

219
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,640
Just like I don't know

220
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,760
whether I'll be an accountant or not

221
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,400
What do you want to be?

222
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,000
Advertising designer

223
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,040
It's good to be an accountant

224
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Don't think too much other than that

225
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,880
Am I right? Xiao Gu

226
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,840
It's more important that

227
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,560
we can do a job we love

228
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,560
I'll wash my hand first

229
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,000
Okay

230
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,160
Don't you want me to send you?

231
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,600
It's okay

232
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,120
You need go back to the office, right?

233
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,400
I don't want to trouble you

234
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Be careful then

235
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,400
Okay

236
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,960
You have to make a contract with me

237
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,520
What kind of contract?

238
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,760
The contract of
"You Will Never Move Out"

239
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,120
You said that you won't force me

240
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,440
and let me make my own decision

241
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,160
After thinking twice of it,
I think I can't let you go

242
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,260
[Contract]

243
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,760
When did you prepare this?

244
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,160
You don't need to know

245
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,280
Sign it

246
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:33,840
No

247
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,760
No?

248
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,440
No

249
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,600
Really?

250
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,560
I will not sign it

251
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,640
Fine

252
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,840
I won't go back then

253
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,520
I feel hard to leave Xiao Gu too

254
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,920
Mom

255
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,880
I sign it

256
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,640
That's what I want

257
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,440
Take it

258
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,080
and sign it

259
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,520
Alright

260
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,360
I'll take my leave now

261
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,480
Take care of yourself

262
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,680
Come and give me a kiss

263
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,080
Come

264
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,120
Okay

265
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,200
I leave first

266
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,720
Alright

267
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,640
Bye

268
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,360
Don't let me go?

269
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,880
I'll go now

270
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,040
Gu Wei Yi

271
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,160
My mother left

272
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,720
and I'll move back to dorm

273
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,440
Sorry to trouble you
for the past few days

274
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,840
I'll buy you a meal when I'm free

275
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,120
I'm so sorry

276
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,920
I'm craving for Liuzhou
River Snails Rice Noodle

277
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,840
I'm craving for Liuzhou
River Snails Rice Noodle

278
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,160
So delicious

279
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Hurry up dig in

280
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,160
Fragrant?

281
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,000
Eat more

282
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,280
What are you doing?

283
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,560
Open the walnuts

284
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,800
You can't do it in this way

285
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,800
Don't press too hard

286
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,720
Let me show you

287
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,960
It will be cooked in paste

288
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,840
So, it's okay to be broken

289
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,020
[Girl's Dorm]

290
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,000
Aunt

291
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,000
Aunt, please open the door

292
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,880
Aunt

293
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,440
You again, huh?

294
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,400
Thanks, sorry to trouble you again

295
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,880
Then, you shouldn't come back so late

296
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
I told you before

297
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,240
I worked overtime

298
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Right

299
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,680
This is the typical excuse for
those who came back late

300
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,080
Come register your name

301
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,720
Thank you

302
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:19,840
Take it

303
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,440
Thank you

304
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,320
You have registered 4 times in this week

305
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,920
If you really work overtime,

306
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,000
I shall

307
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,560
call you boss then

308
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,680
That's the truth

309
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,360
Believe it or not

310
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,760
I'm done, thanks

311
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,960
I go back to the room first

312
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,200
If you come back late so often,

313
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,800
you should move out from here

314
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,400
Then I don't need to
open the door for you

315
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,480
You ruined the rules of the dorm

316
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,240
I shall do it as your wish

317
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,400
There's a house waiting for me outside

318
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,640
I have been teaching
you for quite some time

319
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,680
Try to do the mock test

320
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,600
Any award?

321
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,120
You still want to go to Mo Mo's house?

322
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,320
Why can't you just tell her
you want to go out with her?

323
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,280
Why must you bring me together?

324
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,520
There will be no surprise then

325
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,840
If I suddenly show up

326
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,040
when you meet her at her house

327
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
This would be a surprise

328
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,840
I don't know what you are thinking about

329
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,600
What?

330
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,320
I said alright

331
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,240
If you manage to pass the test,

332
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,920
I'll make an appointment with Mo Mo

333
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,800
You must keep the promise

334
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,680
Alright

335
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,880
Mo Mo

336
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,840
Mo Mo

337
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,680
-Help
-What's wrong?

338
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,440
What's wrong?

339
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,640
The graduation fair is coming soon

340
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,840
My poster has been rejected
and I need to redo it again

341
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,440
Would you help me to do it together?

342
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,160
You should look for your course mates

343
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,280
I'm too busy with

344
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,200
the thesis and practical training

345
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,000
I thought you were very interested

346
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,080
in advertising

347
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,120
So, it's more reliable
to do it together with you

348
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,120
Nevermind, I will look for others

349
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,400
if you can't make it

350
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,400
It's more important that

351
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,040
we do a job we love

352
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,920
I'll do it with you

353
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,240
Really?

354
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,560
That's great

355
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,600
Have some water

356
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,520
Are you serious?

357
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,720
Have you done your thesis?

358
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,080
Have you done the work
of your practical training?

359
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,080
How come you still have time for this?

360
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,880
I must squeeze the time out to do this

361
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,320
Mo Mo

362
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,920
You must know the priority
and importance of it

363
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,520
What should you do with
your practical training?

364
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,560
I'm thinking to resign

365
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,880
I know you're having
a hard time recently

366
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,280
But I think

367
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,320
you will regret if you give up

368
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,560
because of the hardship

369
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,080
I'm giving up because of that

370
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,440
I just think that's

371
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,040
more important to do a job I love

372
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,440
"Love is the sweet transformed by rain"

373
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,960
"Dropping one by one"

374
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,840
"The eyes full with sunshine"

375
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,840
"Warm the memories"

376
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,760
"Can't speak out most of the plots"

377
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,520
"Just keep it warm inside the heart"

378
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,920
"The little time of aromatic"

379
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,680
"Growing naturally in noise"

00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,000
"Looking and greeting you in happiness"

381
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,920
"It's worth to keeping it forever"

382
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,600
Sis Qing

383
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,160
I have done the report you asked

384
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,880
Thank you

385
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,600
How is your thesis?

386
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,320
When would you be my permanent staff?

387
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,880
I'm thinking to tell you about this

388
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,880
I want to resign

389
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,720
Resign?

390
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,040
You're doing well, aren't you?

391
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,400
I'm thinking to turn you
as a permanent staff

392
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,680
Thank you, Sis Qing

393
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,160
I have thought about it for a long time

394
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,680
I prefer to be an advertising designer

395
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Advertising?

396
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,080
How could Ori Advertising steal my staff?

397
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh, no!

398
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,720
I don't get any job yet

399
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,600
I just personally like advertising

400
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,560
and wish to be an ad designer

401
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,000
Means you don't like finance

402
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,400
Many people might feel
bored with finance

403
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,160
Sometimes, it brings lots of fun

404
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,360
You can even use your
professional knowledge

405
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,640
to save a company

406
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,600
Really?

407
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,400
Of course

408
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,600
How?

409
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,240
Why should I tell you

410
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,760
since you don't like the job

411
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,360
Forget about it

412
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,200
If you don't like it,
I won't force you then

413
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,680
I hope you will get a job

414
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,960
that you love

415
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,360
Thank you

416
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,440
I'm going out first

417
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,120
Okay

418
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,840
I wish you a good future

419
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,680
Thank you

420
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,560
Is it clear?

421
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,400
Okay

422
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,160
Good

423
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,280
Morning, Professor Jiang

424
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,040
-Professor
-Busy?

425
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,800
Hi

426
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,760
Carry on your job

427
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,200
Gu Wei Yi, what are you doing?

428
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,800
I'm writing the thesis

429
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,360
Thesis?

430
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,800
How can you do something

431
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,160
not related in the lab?

432
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,600
I have told you before, you must be

433
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,800
serious and respect all the experiment

434
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,160
Don't you remember it?

435
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,560
Writing a thesis?

436
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,880
Have you done the experiment?

437
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,400
I have completed it

438
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,760
Done?

439
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,680
You have done it, then...

440
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,240
you can help them

441
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,440
Are you really writing the thesis?

442
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,600
I'm checking the origin of the surname

443
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,520
You should redo the experiment

444
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,840
and please focus on your duty

445
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,600
Okay

446
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,680
Gu Wei Yi

447
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,560
Why are you here?

448
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm lost

449
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,440
I'm unfamiliar with this area

450
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,200
and it has been too long
since I left

451
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,120
Where do you want to go?

452
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,160
Where are you going?

453
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,160
To an interview

454
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,880
Then we can go

455
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,720
together

456
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,880
How did you know I got an
interview at Ori?

457
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,760
I heard it from someone

458
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,200
It spreads so fast?

459
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,440
Let's go

460
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,080
Here it is

461
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,880
Is the place
you want to go far from here?

462
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,760
Not far, just around here

463
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,680
Then I go in first, bye

464
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,560
Bye

465
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,000
How come you are still here?

466
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,400
How's the interview?

467
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,800
Should be okay

468
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
They asked me when can I start working

469
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,680
Let's go

470
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,400
Let's go

471
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,840
I'm going back first

472
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,680
Okay

473
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,800
Go ahead

474
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,560
Okay

475
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,960
You wanted to get into the building

476
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,160
to sell your products, huh?

477
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,280
I'm not a salesman

478
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,880
Are you sure?

479
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,480
You are standing here with
the flyer for quite some time

480
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,960
Are you new in sales?

481
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,520
I've been working here

482
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,360
over the years

483
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,480
I know what you are trying to do here

484
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,840
Hurry up, get away

485
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,480
I'm not a salesman

486
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:48,920
Pei Lan

487
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,800
Wait a moment

488
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
I'm catching a salesman

489
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,800
Where?

490
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,160
Here

491
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,320
He is my student

492
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,240
Gu Wei Yi, he is not a salesman

493
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,720
Your student?

494
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,560
Yes

495
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,920
He is holding the...

496
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,400
Draft papers?

497
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
Draft papers

498
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,520
Another bookworm

499
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,760
I really don't understand
what is in your mind

500
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,960
Are you trying to tease me?

501
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,240
Hurry up get away from here

502
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,400
You have been standing

503
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,960
at the girl's dorm for so long

504
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,200
That's why I treated you as a salesman

505
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,280
Fine

506
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,320
Let's go, Xiao Gu

507
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,080
Pei Lan

508
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,920
What about we...

509
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,400
There is no "we"

510
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,320
Do you realize your mistake?

511
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,160
Yeah

512
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,040
Say it loudly

513
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,400
I realized my mistake

514
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,600
Will you smoke behind me again?

515
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,280
No, I won't

516
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,000
You're not sincere at all

517
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,840
Hurry up give me the key

518
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,760
I need to take some files from home

519
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,960
I'm leaving

520
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,480
Xiao Gu, go back

521
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,560
Aunt

522
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,440
You and Professor Jiang...

523
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,360
He is my husband

524
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,200
Finally, I have done the thesis

525
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,360
Can I make a curse?

526
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,000
Congratulations!

527
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,200
At this moment,

528
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,040
I want to dedicate the thesis to...

529
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,120
Gu Wei Yi

530
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,000
Hello

531
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,120
Si Tu Mo

532
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,200
Come back home now

533
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
Whose home?

534
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,760
My home

535
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,200
Why?

536
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,400
Your mom wanted to come

537
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,560
What?

538
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,360
Did you tell her that I moved out?

539
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,320
No

540
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,640
Okay, hold on a while

541
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,439
I'll be back soon

542
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,519
Hurry up! I'll try my best

543
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,600
Okay, bye

544
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:18,840
My god

545
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,510
What are you doing?

546
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,160
I told you before

547
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,990
My mom wished to make
me a match with Gu Wei Yi

548
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,399
She forced me to share rent with him

549
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,720
Gu Wei Yi just told me

550
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,080
my mother will come to his house

551
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,200
I need to rush back and
pretend I never move out

552
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:35,919
How about

553
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,599
I go together with you

554
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,470
I'm just curious

555
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,079
what the house of

556
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,200
the Physics genius look like?

557
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,509
You said it looked
like mortuary, right?

558
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:50,319
Moreover, your mother will believe

559
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,440
you didn't move out

560
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,440
if you bring a friend home

561
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,359
Perhaps, she will never do
the spot check again

562
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,120
That's right

563
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,640
Hurry up, pack the things up

564
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:49,880
Hi

565
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,760
I'm Wang Shan, Mo Mo's roommate

566
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,160
She is my friend, Wang Shan

567
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,000
Hi

568
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,080
Where's my mother?

569
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,240
She decided not to come

570
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,040
Why?

571
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,400
She's playing mahjong with someone

572
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,440
Really? She tricked me again

573
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,080
You can call and ask her

574
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,440
Never mind, forget about it

575
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,000
So, we will leave first

576
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,480
Wait a moment

577
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Someone is coming

578
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,080
Who?

579
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,040
You will know later

580
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,640
Open the door

581
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,000
Let's celebrate for Mo Mo
as she has done the thesis

582
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,200
We shall celebrate

583
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,040
for Mo Mo today

584
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,600
Do you mind if we
make your house a mess?

585
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,280
What if I say I mind?

586
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,920
Then you are a niggard

587
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,360
Any drink you want?

588
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,200
We have beer,

589
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,320
juice

590
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,760
and soft drinks

591
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,160
Give me beer

592
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,520
Mo Mo should not drink the beer

593
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,760
What's he doing here?

594
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,320
You have so many films here

595
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,360
Why all horror movies?

596
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,160
Let's

597
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,680
watch a movie

598
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,960
This granny wasn't a human

599
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,400
Have she gone away?

600
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,600
Yes

601
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,640
He will eat the candle later

602
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,120
Please don't say it

603
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,960
Why did you stop talking?

604
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,240
You asked me not to say it

605
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,640
You shall say

606
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,120
Shall I say or not?

607
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,120
I don't know

608
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,040
No tomato flavor?

609
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,880
It has been sold out

610
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,960
-I go and...
-It's alright

611
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,480
I just merely said it

612
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,120
You were forced to stay together

613
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,680
because of your mother, right?

614
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,840
Yes, what's wrong?

615
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,520
Why didn't you tell me?

616
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,440
Why should I?

617
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,560
You are not my boyfriend

618
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,800
Where are you going?

619
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,640
I remember we have
tomato flavour chips in the house

620
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,000
Fu Pei

621
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:42,880
Fu Pei

622
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,080
Fu Pei

623
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,400
I'm okay

624
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,880
I'm okay

625
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,760
I'll bring him water

626
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:06,880
Si Tu Mo

627
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
Come and find me the honey

628
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,840
Fu Pei

629
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,760
Fu Pei

630
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,920
Are you okay?

631
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,560
Let's go back

632
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,400
Mo Mo

633
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,640
Fu Pei

634
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,920
Fu Pei, you are drunk

635
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,060
[Here comes the Easter egg.]

636
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,200
Hello

637
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,560
Xiao Gu

638
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,360
Is Mo Mo okay there?

639
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,400
She's pretty good

640
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,320
I sent you something
several days ago

641
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,560
Should be arriving today

642
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,040
Please check it

643
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,920
Okay

644
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,840
You must tell me

645
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,720
if Mo Mo bullies you

646
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,840
I'll scold her

647
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:42,800
Okay

648
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,360
Si Tu Mo, come home for a while
