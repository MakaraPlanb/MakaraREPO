Do you think you are the super star?

8
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,680
How did you greet the Director?

9
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,080
People might think

10
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,080
you're the famous super star

11
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,440
Lin Zhi Cun

12
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,760
If you're really smart,

13
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,960
you should know

14
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,000
the girl is a trainee

15
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,560
of the advertising company

16
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,360
She is just a trainee

17
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,480
If you're a super star,

18
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,400
they won't send a
trainee to deal with you

19
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,080
Think about it yourself

20
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,440
What's wrong with a trainee?

21
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,600

Alright

27
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,360
The shooting time

28
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,960
will take longer

29
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,520
You should discuss with the artist

30
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,280
No problem

31
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,640
Alright

32
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,200
Don't worry

33
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,440

00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,400
Let me explain

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,320
our next shooting details

42
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,000
First, you have to act

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,800
as a famous hacker

44
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,400
You're busy hacking everyday

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,360
The heavy work load makes you tired

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,880
Hence, you are out of condition

47
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,560
However,

48
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,480
after you drink

49
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,840
the orange juice,

50
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,680
you're full of energy

51
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,880
and manage to hack

52
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,160
the alien's computer

53
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,520
You stop the war

54
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,360
in the earth from the aliens

55
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,760
and manage to save all the human

56
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm bored

57
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,520
I'm bored

58
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,640
"Arrived the destination"

59
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Don't throw the rubbish everywhere

60
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,960
Please keep clean

61
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,440
Alright

62
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,480
Don't sit here

63
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,840
Sorry

64
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,560
It's okay

65
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,360
Luckily there is a jacket

66
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,080
Why can't I sit here?

67
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,960
You can't sit on the equipment box

68
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,240
That is our rule

69
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,120
Don't do that again

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,520
Don't do that

71
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,360
and let every body knows that you're a trainee

72
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,960
This is my first time here

73
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,080
I don't know about it

74
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Sit here and eat

75
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,680
Or sit on the floor, nobody will care

76
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,200
Thank you

77
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,680
Why don't you eat in the rest room?

78
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,720
I don't want to meet the witch

79
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,800
I'm on diet

80
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,320
You? Even the wind can blow you away

81
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,760
My face is different with yours

82
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,960
My face has to show on screen

83
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,920
and watched by the people

84
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,560
all around the world

85
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,600
What you meant?

86
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,400
Are you laughing at me?

87
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,720
It's just a big burp

88
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,840

Director

94
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,000
Excuse me, it's mine

95
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,480
So sorry, Director

96
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,800

Working

100
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,160
What about you?

101
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,640
I'm thinking of you

102
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,280
Is it disgusting?

103
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,920
I'm thinking if you need
my help in your work

104
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,760
What you can help me?

105
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,800
This is too indirect

106
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,800
You left anything at home?

107
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
I can send it to you

108
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,560
Anything I can ask him to send here?

109
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,720
There is an envelope on my desk

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,440
Please send it to me

111
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,840

husband, from Lin Zhi Cun's wife"

112

I'm at the entrance

113
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,640
Wait a moment

114
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,400
We will rest after the shoot

115
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,160
Take it easy

116
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,000

Are you interested to be an artist?

120
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,040
No

121
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,160
Never mind, think about it first

122
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,200
You can logon the web
and check our company

123
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,600

124
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,640
No need

126
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Have you been waiting long?

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,840
No

128
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,760
No one is looking for me

129
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,240
I'll continue to take a rest then

130
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
I woke up too early in the morning

131
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,160
What's wrong with your shoulder?

132
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,720
A bit aching

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,560
I massage for you

134
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,640

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,400
"The story was shaking the destiny"

141
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:43,080
"Take up the courage to make a promise"

142
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,040
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

143
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,040
This is all in my mind

144
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,840
"Shoulder to shoulder
with the touching moment"

145
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,000
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

146
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,880
"Despite the changing of world"

147
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,560
"Still holding each others hand"

148
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,360
"Let the time of a love song"

Hello, Miss Linda

151
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,600
Where are you?

152
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,400
Come to rest room now

153
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,360
Alright

154
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,920
They're looking for me

155
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,760
Take care on the road, bye

156
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,000
What happened?

157
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,840
The shirt is too small, he can't wear it

158
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,880
We prepared it as what you requested

159
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,880
Look at here

160
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,400
No any other patterns

161
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,520
Can you alter it?

162
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680
We're running out of time

163
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,720
Can we borrow the coat

164
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,560
from the crew?

165
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Their coats are old-fashioned

166
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,040
It can't fit him

167
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
Alright, wait a second

168
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,520
I forgot to give it to you

169
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,760
This is not important,
take off your coat now

170
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,720
Take off the coat

171
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,840
This is too plain

172
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,000
It is out of sense of design

173
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,520
Gu Wei Yi is good-looking in it

174
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,240
Are you okay with it?

175
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,480
I think...

176
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm okay with it

177
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,120
Let's take a good shot

178
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,240
and go home, okay?

179
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,480
I'm going to washroom

180
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,080
Please order me a coffee

181
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,880
Cappuccino

182
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,440
Okay

183
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,600
It is damn cold

184
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,320
Excuse me...

185
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,040
Can I borrow your jacketï¼Ÿ

186
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,840
Take it

187
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,600
Thank you

188
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,560
Mr. Lin, everything is ready

189
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,680
Are you feeling cold? Quickly put it on

190
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,920
I'm going to make money, be a good boy

191
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,000
Don't fight with other kids

192
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,320

From Lin Zhi Cun's wife

222
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,880
My colleague was kidding with me

223
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,200
Don't care about it

224
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,760
The photos are so-so

225
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,560
Do I look better in person?

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,640
Give it to me

227
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,400

No need

230
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,800
My colleague was...

231
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,800
She was kidding

232
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,880
I tell you

233
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Don't be touched

234
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,080
I'm almost in tears

235
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,320
Mr. Lin

236
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,280

00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,320
Thank you for your hard work

246
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,320
You have worked hard too

247
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,600
Although you're a trainee,
but you're capable

248
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,560
Thank you

249
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,280
We have to work together in the future

250
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,120
Get well-prepared

251
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,000
Don't sit on the equipment box again

252
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,400
Okay?

253
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,200
Okay

274
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,400

322
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,480

340
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,080

You can't kidnap a child!

345
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,320

356
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,320
Be careful

357
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,280
Where do you want to stick it on?

358
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,360
On my back

359
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,200

just to share my status online

391
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,560
What a hard-hearted! How can
you ignore me for so long?

392
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,280
You should make an apology first

393
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,040
I'm coming down!

394
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:51,920
Let's go

395
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,600
You should take care of Xiao Jie

396
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,280
All the kids made it themselves

397
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,800
Me too

398
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,920
It's really fun

399
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,720
Let's go for it

400
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,560
Let's go

401
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,160
Let's go

402
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,880
Come down, don't be afraid

403
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,840
Gu Wei Yi, come down

404
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,600

405
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,880
Don't be afraid

406
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,960
It's fun

407
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Come down, don't be afraid

408
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,120
Come on

409
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,320
Did you have some fun?

410
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,320
Fun?

411
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,640
Gu Wei Yi!

412
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,040
Gu Wei Yi!

413
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,680
You are a liar!

414
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,000
Have some fun?

415
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,160
There's something better

416
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,040
Hey kids, let's bury him

417
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,800
Where's the girl?

418
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,400
I didn't see her

419
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,960
Let's go

420
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,840
Let's go

421
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,720
She's there

422
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,520
Go!

423
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,200
Gu Wei Yi!

424
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,480
Gu Wei Yi!

425
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,560
What are you looking at?

426
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,840
Printing photos for free

427
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,400
What photo you want to print?

428
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,200
You'll know it

429
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,440
It's done

430
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:06,800
Look

431
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,720
Cute?

432
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,560
Cute?

433
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,480
Not really

434
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,280
What a bad taste!

435
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,520
Si Tu Ding Dang is so cute

436
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,560
Let's print a photo of two of us

437
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,120
Did we take

438
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,600
a photo together?

439
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,560
No

440
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,040
No

441
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,640
We don't have it

442
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,600
Check your mobile phone

443
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,600
Do I have it?

444
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,520
Look

445
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,640
I don't have it

446
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,360
Look

447
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,600
We never take photo together

448
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,240
Can we have a chat?

449
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,080
Sure, what's wrong?

450
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,200
Yeah! We took it at the beach

451
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,720
Yeah

452
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,960
Give it to me and you print it again

453
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,400
No way

454
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,800
Cool man

455
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,720
You can print it for free

456
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,040
Si Tu Ding Dang
and me are alike

457
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,480
So nice

458
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,680
Keep it in my purse

459
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,080
We have many side dishes

460
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,640
You'll feel squeezed if you sit here

461
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
It's alright

462
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,960
Okay

463
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,120
You may order now

464
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,640
Pork belly

465
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,520

Okay

477
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,520
Sea weed

478
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,000
Okay, that's all

479
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:22,960
Okay

480
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,680
Why didn't you order?

481
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,000
It's enough

482
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,720
Please serve it as soon as possible

483
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,600
Okay

484
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,920
Let's chat

485
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,680
About what?

486
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,440
Let's play Finger Guessing

487
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,560
The loser have to eat chilli

00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,040
No

489
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,800
Are you afraid of losing?

490
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,480
Let's guess

491
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,200
You bet, you pay

492
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,240
Eat the chilli

493
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:23,960
Come on

494
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,080
Play it in 5 rounds

495
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,120
Okay

496
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,440
Let's guess

497
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,280
Eat the chilli

498
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,040
Let's play it in 8 rounds

499
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,160
Are you sure?

500
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,280
Will you cheat again

501
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,280
and ask for more round?

502
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,360
I'm sure

503
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,080
Let's guess

504
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,600
Let's guess

505
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,760
I feel hurt for you

506
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,840
Eat the chilli

507
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,960
Come on

508
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,440
I don't like spicy

509
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,680
I knew

510
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,680
I can't take spicy food

511
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,840
Okay

512
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,640
Show me a coquettish look

513
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,040
I have no idea on it

514
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,080
Eat the chilli then

515
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,600
Come on

516
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,280
Wait

517
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,214
"How do you coax a woman?"

518
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,520
I don't want to eat

519
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,640
I'm done

520
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,800
You're not sincere

521
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,480
I don't want to eat

522
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,120
Almost there

523
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,600
I don't want to eat

524
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,000
Gu Wei Yi

525
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,400
You...

526
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,360
The meat is going to burn

527
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,120
So cold

528
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,680
What about this?

529
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,280
Still cold?

530
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,520
Not really

531
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,080
What's wrong?

532
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,240
I feel warm now

533
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,360
Hurry up!

534
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,360
Let's go home

535
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,400
What do you want to do at home?

536
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,360
Get a blanket and watch a horror film

537
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,760
Blanket?

538
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,640
Why?

539
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
Let's have some beers

540
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,800
I'm not going to drink it,
enjoy yourself

541
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,960
I shall drink it

542
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,160
You drink it for nothing

543
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,440
Why not?

544
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
What do you mean?

545
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,280
Why do I drink it for nothing?

546
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,760
It's so cold, let's go home

547
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,640
What do you mean? Say it clearly

548
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,920
What do you mean?

549
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,160
Say it clearly

550
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,200
Let's take the blanket
to the living room

551
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,760
You can do that

552
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,520
But you can't have beers

553
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,000
Shan Shan

554
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,190
Why are you here?

555
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,670
Have some water

556
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,960
Am I disturbing you?

557
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,400
No

558
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,400
Let's chat in my room

559
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Come on

560
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
When will she leave?

561
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,560
Mo Mo

562
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,520
I'll let Fu Pei come and fetch her

563
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,160
What's the matter?

564
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,800
Do you want some water?

565
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,280
No, thanks

566
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,160
I think we'll break up soon

567
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,880
if we still carry on it

568
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,800
Fu Pei used to be

569
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,360
casual and offhand,

570
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,600
but he didn't bother me
when we had a fight

571
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,880
I'm a girl

572
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,120
I can't go to him first

573
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,560
What should I do now?

574
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,800
Mo Mo, give me an idea

575
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,920
Do you want to bath?

576
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,520
I...

577
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,120
I bathed in the dorm before

578
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,400
We're so tired
-Mo Mo

579
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,640
We must bath again

580
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,200
What?

581
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,120
Nothing

582
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,600
Continue your talk

583
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,000
What should I do now?

584
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,120
I passed by the court today

585
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,880
