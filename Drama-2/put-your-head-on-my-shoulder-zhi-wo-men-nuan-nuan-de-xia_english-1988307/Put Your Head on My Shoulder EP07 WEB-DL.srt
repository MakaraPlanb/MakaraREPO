But, not everyone
will take caution on it

18
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,480
They'll think

However, when they open the packing,

23
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,320

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,640
You didn't come back last night

197
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,600
Tell me

198
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,960
You stayed at Gu Wei Yi's house?

199
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,240
I have told you, right?

200
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,120
Don't pretend you don't know.

201
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:00,920
Go on

202
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,080
Mo Mo

203
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,920
How come Niu Niu's eyebrow

204
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,880
can't fit in any of the colors?

205
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,040
Will it be fine if you draw it thicker?

206
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,960
Thicker?

207
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,719
She will then become Crayon Shinchan

208
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,600
Let me try it

209
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,360
No way

210
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,000
Niu Niu

211
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,039
-Help me!
-No way

212
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,910
Don't run, Niu Niu

213
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,670
Help!

214
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,480
Thicker will be nicer

215
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,200
Believe me

216
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:22,759
No way

217
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,670
Believe me

218
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,670
Don't move, I'm coming

219
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,280
I don't...

220
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,150
Niu Niu

221
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,430
Niu Niu

222
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,760
Don't run, Niu Niu

223
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,430
Don't run

224
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,520
Help me! Shan Shan

225
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,560
You're back

226
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,430
Yes

227
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,920
Hello

228
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,480
Hello, are you Si Tu Mo?

229
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,680
Yes, I am

230
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,240
I'm calling from Ori Advertising

231
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,560
I'm pleased to inform you that

232
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,040
you have passed the interview and test

233
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,480
Really?

234
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes

235
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,160
Thank you very much

236
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,000
Bye

237
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,720
Bye

238
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,640
Mo Mo

239
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,520
What happened to you and Shan Shan?

240
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,920
Nothing

241
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,920
Are you sure?

242
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,600
Really nothing

243
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,600
Oh yeah, I'm going to move out again

244
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,840
Why?

245
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,280
I was shortlisted by Ori Advertising

246
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,360
Really?

247
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,600
Mo Mo, you're so awesome

248
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,400
What a smart girl!

249
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,320
I knew it

250
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,800
You do a gathering just because of that?

251
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,000
Don't you feel troublesome?

252
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,160
Girls are always meddlesome

253
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,400
Just a small quarrel

254
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,720
They'll be fine in several days

255
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Who touched my drawer?

256
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,840
Ah Ke

257
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,760
Where are my socks?

258
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,200
He gave all the socks in our room

259
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,000
to his girlfriend to hide the boiler

260
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,320
Hide the boiler?

261
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,240
That was the story

262
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,640
Such a nice boyfriend

263
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,640
His girlfriend has been calling him

264
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,600
to do a club gathering

265
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Are you going?

266
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,400
No

267
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,440
I knew that

268
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,880
Okay

269
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,440
I'll off the phone, bye

270
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,120
Can you help me?

271
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
My girl has low marks in co-curricular

272
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,920
She wanted to do a club gathering

273
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,160
I hardly get people to participate

274
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,480
I don't do this stuff

275
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,480
We seniors

276
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,400
have no time for gatherings

277
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,200
The girls who join it are still single

278
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,680
I suddenly have time now

279
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,440
Right?

280
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,520
You must go

281
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,840
No, thanks

282
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,640
Mo Mo

283
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:31,680
Here

284
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,200
You know each other?

285
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,520
He is my boyfriend

286
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,280
You have a new boyfriend?

287
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,480
How long we didn't

288
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,800
share secrets to each other?

289
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,640
I have broken up with my ex

290
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,760
and I met

291
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,960
a new guy through games
after the campus merged

292
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,160
What?

293
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,600
Haven't I told you before?

294
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,920
I remember I have.

295
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,360
Mo Mo

296
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,440
He's Ah Ke

297
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,600
Si Tu Mo

298
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,240
Hello

299
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,960
For you

300
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,120
Thank you

301
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,560
I'm Meng Lu

302
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,040
Hello

303
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,400
My girlfriend

304
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,240
I knew

305
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,040
How come I don't know anything?

306
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,800
Both of you are...

307
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,040
-Roommates
-Roommates

308
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,240
Felt like I've been fast-forwarded

309
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,280
Eat the prawn

310
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,720
Take off the shell for me

311
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,760
Try this, it's delicious

312
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,320
Give me an egg

313
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,400
Okay

314
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,280
Well

315
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,560
Did Ah Ke tell you

316
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,120
about the gathering?

317
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,120
Yeah

318
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,720
What?

319
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,640
How come I knew nothing?

320
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,600
I'll take you out for fun

321
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
For fun?

322
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,160
Don't bother so much

323
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,080
Just come with me

324
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,360
But I'll be on internship

325
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,240
It's before your internship

326
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,720
I have to get more co-curricular marks

327
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,800
You must support me

328
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,680
But I...

329
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,840
No but

330
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,000
Don't you want to Take a rest

331
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,400
before the internship?

332
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,080
Furthermore,

333
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,160
we'll go to the beach

334
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,600
Count me in

335
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,840
Will you go?

336
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,760
He won't

337
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,160
I'll go

338
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,520
Didn't you say you wouldn't go?

339
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,040
You didn't mention the beach

340
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,360
But, we used to go to the sea...park

341
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,600
I got it wrong
It's a sea park

342
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,120
You like the beach too?

343
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,080
Yes

344
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,240
Eat more vegetables

345
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,320
I'll send it to you once
I complete the schedule

346
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:13,960
Okay

347
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,000
We'll go dating

348
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,040
You may do whatever you like

349
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,680
You free this afternoon?

350
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,680
Yes

351
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,720
Help me move my things,
I'll treat you watermelon

352
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,560
OK

353
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,120
Let's go

354
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,560
Tell me once you've done the calculation

355
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,840
So I can rent the tents

356
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,360
Okay

357
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,600
Okay, no worries

358
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,880
Go and take a bath

359
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,400
You stink

360
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,000
How can it be only 14 person?

361
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,480
Have you included Si Tu Mo?

362
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,120
What's wrong?

363
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,200
What activity?

364
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:57,880
We...

365
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,520
I'm in

366
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,560
I'm okay, it's not heavy

367
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,320
Help me to hold it then

368
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,920
Give it to me

369
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,640
Take out the key

370
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:28,960
Where is it?

371
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,960
The first slot

372
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,680
Not here

373
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,480
I got it

374
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,440
The chewing gum we bought?

375
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,240
Don't...

376
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,160
-Not me...
-I knew

377
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,560
Sorry

378
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,040
Sorry

379
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:09,880
First floor?

380
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,840
I found it in the bag

381
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,400
when we bought

382
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,280
the sweeping robot

383
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
I must have thought it was a chewing gum

384
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,000
and took it

385
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,400
Shall I

386
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,320
put it in your drawer?

387
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,640
Throw it away

388
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,960
Are you sure?

389
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,480
Then you keep it

390
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,960
Throw it

391
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,760
I'll throw it

392
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,120
Actually, I want to ask you

393
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,120
Why did you keep it in your bag?

394
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,960
Any activity tonight?

395
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,360
You want to join?

396
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,080
Do you want watermelon?

397
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,360
Come in

398
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,160
Anything else?

399
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,920
That...

400
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,840
The rectangle paper

401
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,480
Are you listening to me?

402
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,400
Yeah

403
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,760
Give me the contract my mom sent you

404
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,640
I didn't take it

405
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,880
Where is it?

406
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,360
I can't find it

407
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,800
I don't know

408
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,960
Didn't you take it?

409
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,400
Why should I?

410
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,040
It's true

411
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,000
You won't be so bored as to keep it

412
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,560
to help my mum to threaten me

413
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,200
I won't

414
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,560
Alright, I will look for it

415
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,160
A Chance!

416
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:35,920
Yes!

417
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,600
A Chance!

418
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,200
No! No!

419
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,640
No Chance!

420
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,800
A loan, usurious loan

421
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,400
-Can I?
-No way

422
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,000
You are back

423
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,520
How long will you get here?

424
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,400
I saw you guys

425
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,680
Get into the car

426
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,120
The security won't allow us
to stop for long

427
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,000
Get in

428
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,440
I can smell the sea

429
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,720
Help carry the things

430
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,040
Look at Xiao Pang

431
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,800
Okay, shall we go now?

432
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,440
Is this the sea?

433
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,240
More like a river

434
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,920
A river is much cleaner than it

435
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,000
This is not what I expected

436
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,280
Since we're here

437
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,760
can't just go back

438
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,960
Let's set up the tents

439
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,360
Chop, chop!

440
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,360
"Happiness is ringing beside the ears"

441
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,880
"So happy to be young"

442
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,400
"Love is the sweet transform by rain"

443
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,000
"Dropping one by one"

444
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,720
"The eyes full with sunshine"

445
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,880
"Warm the memories"

446
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,840
"Can't speak out most of the plots"

447
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,560
"Just keep it warm inside my heart"

448
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:37,720
"Never get tired of missing you"

449
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,640
What are you doing?

450
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:40,680
Taking a selfie

451
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,880
Come join me

452
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,800
Alright

453
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,800
What are you doing?

454
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,280
What...

455
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,120
You guess it

456
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,880
What do you think?

457
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,280
Help me, Shan Shan

458
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,920
Be careful

459
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,520
"Speak slowly and don't be nervous"

460
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,520
What are you doing?

461
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,840
Slow down

462
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,840
"Like the sunny day we just met"

463
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,600
"The little time of aroma"

464
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,320
"Growing naturally in noise"

465
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,840
"Looking and greeting you in happiness"

466
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,080
"It's worth keeping it forever"

467
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,550
"The little time of aroma"

468
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,319
"Speak slowly and don't be nervous"

469
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,680
"The sky is warm"

470
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,640
"Like the sunny day we just met"

471
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,200
"The little time of aroma"

472
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,880
"Growing naturally in noise"

473
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:43,359
"Looking and greeting you in happiness"

474
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:48,599
"It's worth keeping it forever"

475
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:53,759
Mo Mo

476
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:54,799
Anyone inside?

477
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:55,679
No

478
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,720
Get changed

479
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,360
Don't catch a cold

480
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,480
Meng Lu, help me tie my hair

481
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,520
Thank you

482
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,480
Let's have a fair competition

483
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,760
For Fu Pei?

484
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,520
I won't do that

485
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,000
What do you mean?

486
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,960
All of a sudden I feel like

487
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,520
I don't like him anymore

488
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Is it because of me?

489
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,720
You don't need to...

490
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,640
I swear

491
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,040
It's not because of you

492
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,680
Let's go

493
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
Why are you standing here?

494
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,080
You walking the kite?

495
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,720
Fly it if you're so smart

496
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:27,960
Take it

497
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
The wind is blowing this way

498
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,000
Let it go when I say so

499
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,680
Alright

500
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,040
Let it go

501
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,000
It's up

502
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,120
It's up to the sky

503
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,720
Higher

504
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,000
Get higher

505
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,760
Slowly

506
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,520
Get higher

507
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,080
I don't know how

508
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,200
It's simple

509
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,960
Pull it when you feel it loosened

510
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,040
It's flying up

511
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,560
Are you okay?

512
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,760
Some people are just like a kite

513
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,320
Keep flying out once the string

514
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,840
is held in someone's hands

515
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,240
They never think that

516
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,040
the person holding the string
might get tired

517
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,720
They don't let it go

518
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,560
only because they feel hard to do so

519
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,280
It's not hard this way

520
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,320
Gu Wei Yi

521
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,280
It's not easy for me to fly it up

522
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,560
I want to kill you

523
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,200
Calm down

524
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,440
I'll kill you

525
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,000
My footprints are so deep

526
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,200
Mine are deeper

527
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,080
By visual check, mine are deeper

528
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,200
My visual check is different

529
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,680
You should follow my visual

530
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,200
Look, what is this?

531
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,600
A shell

532
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,840
What shell is it?

533
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,920
A shell

534
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,280
This...

535
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,320
This...

536
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,480
Is this a gem?

537
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,400
A mosaic tile of the toilet

538
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,600
I heard we can hear
the ocean through a conch

539
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
It's true

540
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,240
Listen, it is really the sound of ocean

541
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,920
Have you watched the SpongeBob?

542
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,720
There's a magical conch

543
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,280
It knew all the secrets of the ocean

544
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,680
This one might know

545
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,680
many secrets too

546
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,240
It is really the sound of ocean

547
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,800
You're just hearing

548
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,160
the blood flows in your brain

549
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,120
and the sound of air

550
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,320
In the theory of resonance,

551
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,200
when the vibration frequency of sound equals to

552
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,720
that of the inside of the conch,

553
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,800
both the amplitude and intensity
of the sound wave will be magnified

554
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,880
and form a resonance

555
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,640
So

556
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,560
what you heard was

557
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,240
the sound of air flowing
inside the conch

558
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,680
and your blood flowing

559
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,440
What?

560
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,520
It's the same if you put a thermos

561
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,400
near your ear

562
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,720
Why should I do that?

563
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,000
A glass will do too

564
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:26,920
No way

565
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,200
Pick it yourself

566
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Anyway, I know nothing

567
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,440
See what can you get?

568
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,300
Here comes the Easter egg

569
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:09,880
Morning

570
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,400
Morning

571
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,320
Wait a moment

572
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,400
Get in later
