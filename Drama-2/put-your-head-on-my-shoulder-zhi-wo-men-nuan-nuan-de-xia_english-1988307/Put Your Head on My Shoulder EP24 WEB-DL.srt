It's okay

Not maybe, but I'm pretty sure

25
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,340
She's not my girlfriend

26
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,260
She's my wife

27
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,380
I don't believe you

28
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,580

Just like what you saw it

32
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,100
She's been annoying

33
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,020
and I can't get rid of her

34
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,300
She won't be so brave

35
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,180
if you didn't give her hints

36
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,780
I didn't

37
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,620
Alright, I trust you

38

Your turn to explain it

39
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,340
I just got my visa, so I came here

40
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,620
That's not what I'm asking

41
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,420
What then?

42
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,700
What is the meaning of pregnant

43
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,620
in Chinese?

44
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,020
I don't understand

45
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,620
So as I, I don't understand

46

You just said it

47
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,500
What?

48
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,980
My English is poor

49
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,220
and I can't remember any words

50
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,340
I only know "Yes" and "No"

51
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,340
"Come" and "Go"

52
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,300
That's all you know?

Don't make noise,

75
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,220
Do you really think I'm stupid?

76
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,900
Can you understand that?

77
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,460

To live with him
for the rest of your life

To always love him

94
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,820
To comfort him

95
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,420
To follow him at all times

96
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,460
And to be faithful to him

It's okay

102
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,060
If you don't want...

103
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,980
I just want you to know

104
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,700
You're really in my plan

105
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,060
Yes, I do

106
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,580
Congratulations

107
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,540
I now pronounce you
man and wife officially

108
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,580
I've been here once before

109
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,860
The sausage platter here is delicious

110
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,260
Still angry?

111
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,260
Shouldn't I be angry?

112
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,900
I didn't even wear a wedding gown

113
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,140

114
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,340

What's wrong?

125
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,260
The bank offered me a loan

126
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:21,900
Really?

127
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,420
Really

128
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,420
I didn't even wear the wedding gown

129
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,740
And where's the ring?

130
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,860
Where's my ring?

131
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,500
Not even a ring

132
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,700
Gu Wei Yi

133
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,780

Gu Wei Yi, get up

138
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,420
No breathing, what should I do now?

139
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,700
Oh yeah, CPR

140
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,340
You're dead

141
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,460
You're finally dead

142
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,420
You're finally dead

143
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,980
CPR requires artificial respiration

144
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,580
You know?

145
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,620
I don't know

146

147
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,940
May I?

148
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,380
That's what I wanted to ask you

149
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,260
You'll know it

150
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,350
What's going on

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,470
with Zhi Cun's blog today?

152
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,510
How could he have

153
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,150
Si Tu Mo's resignation letter?

154
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,310
I'm working on it too

155
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,510
I can't reach him now

156
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,310
I'll call you back after this

157
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:35,790
Bye

158
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,190

Are you okay?

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,110
You're going to be a dad, huh?

165
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,110
Shut up!

166
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,590
Why did you throw up all of a sudden?

167
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,390
We ate the same food, right?

168
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,430
I don't know

169
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,590
I threw up several times
when you were asleep

170
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,830
Did you eat anything else?

171
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,750
I took some medicine

172
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,310
What medicine?

173
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,630
Contraceptives

174
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,030
Where did you get it?

175
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,550
His girlfriend gave it to me

176
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,870
Don't mention it

177
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,950
Give me the medicine

178
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,230
It has a strong side effect

179
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,510
Before you eat, you're
on an empty stomach

180
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,990
Your stomach can't stand it

181
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,870
Still want to throw up?

182
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,950
I'm better now

183
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,310
That's good

184
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,630
Why did you take the medicine?

185
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,070
The baby might not

186
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,710
be in your plan yet

187
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,190
Everything about you is in my plan

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,990
with Lin Zhi Cun, huh?

196
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,230
What are you talking about?

197
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,270
Don't you surf the Internet?

198
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,390
Lin Zhi Cun stands up for you

199
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,030
regarding the artwork

200
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,310
What?

201
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,630
I'm not sure from where

202
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,310
he got your resignation letter

203
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,430
He posted it in his blog

204
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,110
and it's a hot topic now

205
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,310
Miss Sha Sha was soon found out

206
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,710
Now the company says

207
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,350
they'll look into her problem

208
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,150
I just saw an interview on the TV

209
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,910
A reporter asked her about it

210
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,230
Guess what she said

211
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,310
What did she say?

212
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:16,910
Si Tu Mo

213
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,430
Congratulation!
Finally, the justice served

214
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,030
What are you talking about?

215
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,150
You're so lucky

216
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,430
Even my idol stands up for you

217
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,630
I didn't expect you two

218
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,990
have a relationship

219
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:31,950
I envy you

220
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,870
You forgot to take me

221
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,030
Let's go home

222
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,630
Welcome home

223
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,670
Welcome home

224
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,150
What is going on here?

225
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,670
I just studied it on the plane

226
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,510
How did you make it?

227
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,550
As long as I'm on a same
local area network with it,

228
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,030
I can control it with my phone

229
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,350
I called its current state

230
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,270
as pet mode

231
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,790
Have you studied other modes too?

232
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,990
You want me to try it all for you?

233
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:11,710
Okay

234
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,670
I've set up an escape mode as well

235
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,790
If there is a fire,

236
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,310
it will automatically
run to the balcony

237
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,790
and jump down into the bushes

238
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,390
I've set the parabola

239
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,150
Did you ever think

240
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,710
how many pieces it will break into?

241
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,990
Don't worry

242
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,670
We're on the 17 floor

243
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,830
The height of each floor is about 3.5m

244
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,510
Altogether

245
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,150
is about 59.5m

246
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,590
So,

247
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,470
even if it jumps down...

248
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,190
Gu Wei Yi

249
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,990
Welcome home

250
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,470
Welcome home

251
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,390
Welcome home

252
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,430
Welcome home

253
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,350
I cleaned it up and
found something's wrong

254
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,630
What's wrong?

255
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,470
I think we should

256
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,750
live in the same room

257
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,830
What about the empty room?

258
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,390
I'll change it to a lab

259
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,590
I'll divorce

260
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,390
I'll tell your mom then

261
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,310
My mom didn't even know
I was getting married

262
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,190
I haven't told my parents

263
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,670
about our marriage

264
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,550
It's okay, I didn't
tell my parents either

265
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:43,740
Let's call them

266
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,790
and tell them later

267
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,220
Okay

268
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,070
No way

269
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,510
If my mom knew

270
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,950
that we're married in
a church in Germany

271
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,710
without her knowledge...

272
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,870
Oh, no!

273
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,870
We haven't got the
marriage certificate yet

274
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,470
So, in a legal sense,

275
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,710
we're not married

276
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,630
That's good

277
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:06,790
I'm safe

278
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,670
I've made a booking online

279
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,870
for the marriage registration

280
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,910
When?

281
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,190
On the plan

282
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,830
Why did you do
so much things on a plane?

283
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,510
You want to go?

284
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,190
Sure

285
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,910
Come on, please sit down and smile

286
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,110
Smile

287
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,510
The photo will be used for a life time

288
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,830
Ready

289
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,390
1, 2, 3

290
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,190
Why did they give us
2 copies of the certificate?

291
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,470
To avoid of losing it?

292
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,390
Since there are 2 copies,

293
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,990
it doesn't matter if you lose one

294
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,470
Let me keep it

295
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,830
Why?

296
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,310
One of the certificates is mine

297
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,390
Give it to me

298
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,830
Give it to me

299
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,150
Give me back

300
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,950
Give me back

301
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,830
Cut it out! Your mom is calling

302
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,150
My mom

303
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,750
always calls you

304
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,590
and she seldom calls me

305
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,350
Hello, aunt

306
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,030
Xiao Gu, have you two
got your certificate?

307
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,910
Yes

308
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,470
Don't call me aunt again

309
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,710
Mom

310
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,350
Wishing you a happy marriage

311
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,310
I planned to have a meal together

312
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,870
for celebration

313
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,030
after you two got the certificate

314
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,030
But Mo Mo's sister

315
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,350
suddenly wants to study abroad

316
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,470
They...

317
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,470
Dad, please drink the tea

318
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:18,670
Okay

319
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,310
It's okay

320
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,350
It's okay

321
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,630
So good

322
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,910
Thank you

323
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,470
Mom, please drink the tea

324
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,510
So sweet

325
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,750
So sweet

326
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,110
You're so sweet

327
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,270
Mo Mo

328
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,110
I just talked to Xiao Yi
about the banquet

329
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,430
He still rejected it

330
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,030
Can I just tell him that
my family insisted to do so?

331
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:01,630
Okay?

332
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,590
Forget it, it's okay

333
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,310
Since he didn't want it,

334
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,950
I just feel hard to force him

335
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,990
In fact, we're here to see you two

336
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,510
Aunt, you may...

337
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,590
Mom

338
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,870
You and dad can stay here longer

339
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,510
No way

340
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,630
You are just married

341
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,030
If we stay here longer,

342
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,790
Xiao Yi will get mad with us

343
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,910
No, he won't

344
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,390
Xiao Yi, come on

345
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,630
What's up?

346
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,110
Look, it's amazing

347
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,350
The sunset is nice,

348
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,350
but it just near dusk

349
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,790
It's going to rise again tomorrow

350
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,910
It just the Earth's rotation

351
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,950
Xiao Yi

352
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,310
It's not scary to get married

353
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,270
But marriage is not that easy

354
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,270
I know

355
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,550
Do you really know that?

356
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,590
Marriage is not like doing
a scientific research

357
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,790
which always with traces

358
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,550
Just like what you said just now

359
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,470
The Earth's rotation

360
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,030
If you say it to your mom,

361
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,750
she's going to be
nagging for a long time

362
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,470
But, Si Tu Mo won't

363
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,550
My son, I wish you

364
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,310
have a very good time

365
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,350
in your marriage life

366
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:20,990
Thank you

367
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,430
Why? You've never seen
anyone looking for a job?

368
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,230
Can't get a job?

369
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,750
Look at here

370
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,430
This company doesn't recruit
married women with no child

371
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,350
And this one

372
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,990
Must drink 500ml of liquor

373
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,990
And this one

374
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,470
Must recognize 300 stars

375
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,470
This is more outrageous

376
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,110
Must have a story in your eyes

377
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,430
Let me see

378
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,630
There's a story in your eye

379
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,150
No gloating please

380
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,710
I want to hit the person who doesn't

381
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,030
have to look for
a job like what you do

382
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,270
You really hit me, huh?

383
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,590
Because you're gloating

384
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,270
Don't look for a job first

385
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,390
Take a break first

386
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,350
Think again whether you want
to further studies or work

387
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,750
Are you going to
raise me if I'm jobless?

388
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,270
Sure

389
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,470
Do you have enough money
in your bank account to raise me?

390
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,710
My grandma sent it to me when
she knew that we got married

391
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,630
How can we spend Grandma's money?

392
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,790
Actually, I gave all my scholarship

393
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,030
to her since I was small

394
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,390
Unexpectedly, she saved it

395
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,470
That means, it's not much

396
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,150
RMB240,000

397
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,870
You're so generous

398
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,550
I was really terrified

399
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,190
Forget it

400
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,470
No way

401
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,030
You can't keep the money

402
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,670
Or some weird machines will appear

403
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,390
in our house tomorrow

404
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,630
I'll keep it for you

405
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,190
I won't spend it

406
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,910
Don't you want to sleep?

407
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,190
Wait a minute

408
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,670
I'll sleep when
I'm done with this test

409
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,230
What test?

410
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,830
The most reliable company

411
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,830
means in unit time

412
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,910
would be the one asking people
to recognize 300 stars

413
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,630
So I found their test

414
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,270
and tried to do it

415
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,750
Gu Wei Yi

416
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,190
You know the Four Flow Men after 1985?

417
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,190
Flow?

418
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,790
I knew

419
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,190
You know Flow, huh?

420
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,910
The "flow" in Physics

421
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,230
means the flow through a closed pipe

422
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,630
or the amount of fluid
in the effective cross section

423
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,870
of the open channel in a unit of time

424
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,550
It's also known as instantaneous flow

425
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,710
Isn't that flow?

426
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,350
Forget it, I think too much

427
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,990
You wouldn't know it

428
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,510
You probably don't even
know who are the Four Kings

429
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,150
What is that?

430
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,190
Oh, my goodness

431
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,190
You really don't know, huh?

432
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,630
Isn't that common sense?

433
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,030
Even my dad knows that

434
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,470
Do I need to know it

435
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,550
Do you know the
Four Physical Mechanics?

436
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,110
The Four Kings of Hong Kong

437
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,430
Andy Law, Jacky Cheung,
Leon Lai and Aaron Kwok

438
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,510
Four Physical Mechanics

439
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,950
Theoretical, statistical,
quantum and electrodynamics

440
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,510
You're awesome! You're knowledgeable

441
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,470
Awesome

442
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,190
I'll sleep first

443
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,990
Take off your glasses first

444
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,670
Come down

445
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,870
No, I'm going to
sleep like this tonight

446
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,270
You'll regret it then

447
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,830
Why should I?

448
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,470
Your parents are in the next room

449
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,310
What can you do to me?

450
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:10,710
Here it comes

451
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,950
I'll go to the lab first

452
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,470
Alright

453
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,350
Wait a minute

454
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,950
Mom cooked the herbal tea

455
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,390
Drink it first, it will
make your body cold

456
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,830
Bitter?

457
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,190
What say you?

458
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,110
Come back early

459
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,230
Mom, I'll clean it up

460
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,350
Come back early

461
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:28,910
Professor Jiang and seniors

462
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,430
will arrive at 8 pm tonight, right?

463
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,290
8 pm tonight

464
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,030
So, the four swordsmen

465
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,390
of the lab finally reunite

466
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,830
Why must be four swordsmen?

467
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,150
What's the special meaning

468
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,630
of four?

469
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,070
Yeah, why they always use four?

470
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,110
Four Masterpieces

471
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,750
Four beautiful women

472
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,670
Four Kings

473
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,990
You know who're the Four Kings?

474
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,910
I know, don't you know it?

475
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,630
Have you finished reading
the German experiment report?

476
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,990
I sorted it out for you
before I came back

477
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,790
I'm done, wait for me

478
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,750
Hello, Shan Shan

479
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,310
Mo Mo

480
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,830
Where do you think I am?

481
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:15,870
Where are you?

482
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,910
I'm at Fu Pei's company

483
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,150
Why are you back? Break?

484
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,390
I'm here to spend the
anniversary with Fu Pei

485
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,550
Anniversary?

486
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,270
I thought Fu Pei is going to...

487
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,390
Si Tu Mo, shut up!

488
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,350
When are you going
to buy us a meal?

489
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,350
Why should I?

490
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,670
You two get married

491
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,910
You should invite us to the banquet

492
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:36,990
You should ask Gu Wei Yi

493
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,070
I'm jobless

494
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,190
and it has nothing to do with me

495
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,350
You haven't got a job yet, huh?

496
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,590
Do you want a part-time job?

497
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,430
Please design posters for me

498
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,790
How much you're going to pay me?

499
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,750
We're old friends

500
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,750
Don't hurt our relationship with money

501
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,390
I'm going to an interview

502
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,110
You should call Gu Wei Yi,
don't bother me

503
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,150
Why is it so dark?

504
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,190
Dad! Mom!

505
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,030
Fell asleep?

506
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,590
I don't think so

507
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,270
Dad! Mom! We're back

508
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,710
They aren't here

509
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:24,830
They already went home

510
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:26,830
Impossible

511
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,630
They will tell us before that

512
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,470
Are they taking a walk?

513
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,510
They will tell us before that

514
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,030
Mo Mo, Xiao Yi

515
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,510
We're going back

516
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,750
We didn't mention it earlier
just to avoid you to send us

517
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,710
And I have an urgent job,

518
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,190
that's why we're rushing back

519
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,390
We're at ease

520
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,910
when we saw the way
you two get along

521
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,710
There's pepper mantis prawn
in the pot, remember to eat it

522
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,470
Don't forget to post
the wedding photos to us

523
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,990
They already went home

524
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,870
And they left a lot of mantis prawn

525
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,310
So strange

526
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,630
Aren't you allergic to mantis prawn?

527
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,590
I can't finish it

528
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,110
But we'll turn them down

529
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,710
if we don't finish it

530
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,310
It's alright

531
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,310
Just leave it to me

532
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,390
Let me help on it

533
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,710
It smells good

534
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:45,910
So fresh

535
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,190
The mantis prawn is so nice

536
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,430
Can't you just eat one and clean one?

537
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,430
You don't understand

538
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,990
We must eat the whole plate of it
to feel a sense of accomplishment

539
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,790
Okay

540
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,670
Let's just eat this first

541
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,830
It is too fresh

542
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,750
You can have one

543
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,950
It doesn't matter if you eat little

544
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,629
It's alright

545
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,429
Allergies don't kill people

546
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,589
At worst you'll be admitted

547
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,790
It doesn't matter

548
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,950
Forget it, you'd better don't eat

549
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,030
If anything happens on you,

550
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,110
I can't carry you

551
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,030
If you're admitted,

552
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,470
how should I explain to mom and dad?

553
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,470
You'd better don't eat

554
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,750
Just one, it won't be allergic

555
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,300
Yes

556
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,030
Mom said,

557
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,339
someone ate a lot of

558
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,630
mantis prawn during the New Year

559
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:44,949
Definitely not allergic

560
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,989
So you started to fall into me

561
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,150
when we're by the sea

562
00:34:59,470 --> 00:34:59,910
No

563
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,230
No?

564
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,550
Why did you give me
the mantis prawn then?

565
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,590
I suspected the mantis
prawn was poisonous

566
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,550
You're poisonous

567
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,190
You hate it because you love it

568
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,590
What's wrong with you?

569
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,990
You've been quiet since the dinner

570
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,830
What are you doing?

571
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,750
Get up

572
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,150
I...

573
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,430
I'm proposing

574
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,350
We're in a long-distance love

575
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,310
You still have to study

576
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,350
and I just started my business

577
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,190
I have no achievement yet

578
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,630
But, if we get married,

579
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,630
everything will be okay

580
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,030
What do you think?

581
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,310
Okay

582
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,270
Maybe you think

583
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,230
it's so sudden

584
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,830
But, I'm sincere

585
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,190
Wait a minute

586
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,270
What did you say?

587
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,990
I said "Okay"

588
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,150
She said Okay

589
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,790
Did you hear that?

590
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,190
Calm down

591
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,390
Hello

592
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,990
The bride is still changing
clothes on the second floor

593
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,830
Please wait a moment

594
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,150
Okay, thank you

595
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,470
Not ready yet?

596
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:55,910
Almost there

597
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,550
That's what you said an hours ago

598
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,670
You may leave first

599
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,390
Take your time

600
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,790
Why? Spellbound by my beauty?

601
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,910
No

602
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,470
Let's go

603
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,430
We're going for outdoor shooting first

604
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,110
I was really caught by Si Tu Mo

605
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,550
I got 187 in my IQ

606
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,430
After meeting Si Tu Mo,

607
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,590
it seems only 87 left

608
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,390
I started to do a lot of stupid things

609
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,670
Buy for your girlfriend?

610
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,110
It's really comfortable

611
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,830
Wait!

612
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,230
"Like surrounded by the warmth"

613
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:12,110
"The story was shaking the destiny"

614
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,790
"Bamboo Dragonfly and the Time Tunnel"

615
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,270
"can go anywhere"

616
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,430
I started to do craps

617
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,630
Are you writing a thesis?

618
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,910
"The sky of glowing starlight"

619
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,750
"Melt me into your eyes"

620
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,990
"I want to go further with you"

621
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,350
"It's all I miss"

622
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,110
And lost the calmness I've always had

623
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,470
I poisoned her
When will the ambulance be here?

624
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,870
"I want to go further with you"

625
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,910
"Despite the changing of world"

626
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:43,990
You got scratched by it?

627
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,230
Aren't you allergic to cats?

628
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,550
And watch her giggling at all times

629
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,630
"Strand the lost memories"

630
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,230
"Write a new romantic poem"

631
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,830
I haven't driven a car
since I got my driving license

632
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,070
Do you know where the
throttle and the brakes are?

633
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,670
Do you really think I'm a stupid?

634
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,270
The shooting theme

635
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,750
which was chosen by
you is kind of stupid

636
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,150
"I want to go further with you"

637
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,190
"Despite the changing of world"

638
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,030
Let's just forget it

639
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,110
But,

640
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,670
I found my IQ

641
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,230
is in the continuously declining trend

642
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:25,830
For example,

643
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,310
Although I knows it's dangerous,

644
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,590
but I still get into the car
when she drives it

645
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,350
I'm willing to

646
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:47,070
"Promise me to be
by my side every day"

647
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:58,830
Gu Wei Yi

648
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,150
Please tie my hair

649
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:22,790
Just fine

650
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:50,510
Gu Wei Yi, bring me a glass of juice

651
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,590
I'm Si Tu Mo

652
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,310
Gu Mo Wei

653
00:43:14,353 --> 00:43:15,353
[Brainstorming]

654
00:43:15,817 --> 00:43:16,617
Gu Wei Yi

655
00:43:16,642 --> 00:43:18,442
We'll be graduated after 2 months

656
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,740
Let's travel to Tibet

657
00:43:19,784 --> 00:43:20,384
As long as you like it,

658
00:43:20,854 --> 00:43:21,554
we can go wherever you want to

659
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:22,872
It's hard to book

660
00:43:23,148 --> 00:43:24,748
the train ticket

661
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:25,549
Don't worry

662
00:43:25,627 --> 00:43:26,697
The APP can make it

663
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:27,454
Advance purchase 63 days

664
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:28,654
with auto ticket-grabber

665
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:29,779
I'm willing to go

666
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:30,789
anywhere with you

667
00:43:30,864 --> 00:43:31,664
Me too

668
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,060
