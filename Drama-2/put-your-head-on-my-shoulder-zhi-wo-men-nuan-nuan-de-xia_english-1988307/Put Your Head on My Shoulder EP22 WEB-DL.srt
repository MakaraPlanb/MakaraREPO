He got mad with me
I didn't get mad with her

3
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,630
I just asked her what's going on

4
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,470
I've already asked 100 times

5
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,150
But she kept quiet

6
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,150
Look at his attitude,
why should I tell him?

7
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,150
If she refused to tell,

8
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,430
what for I show her my tolerance?

9
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,070
Let's have a cold war

10
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,270

Finally, we have done it

13
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,430
So tired

14
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,150
Looks like I cleaned it all up

15
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,710
Me too

16
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,030
I helped you too

17
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,870
I'll take a shower

18
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,070
No, I mean,

19
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,070
we can have a good rest after a shower

20
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,590
I'll go now

21
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,470
It's time for you to take a bath

22
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:30,830
Okay

23
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,830

No need

26
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,390
You've washed the both bed sheets,

27

where do you want to sleep tonight?

28
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,750
It's okay, I can sleep on my mattress

Sleep in my room

30
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,310
Why

31
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,190
I don't mean it

32
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,990
I sleep on the mattress

33
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,030
and you sleep in my room

34
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,350
No need

35
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,030
It's up to you

36
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,830
Got water in my ears?

37
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,110
Are you going to sleep
in the living room?

38
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,070
What's wrong?

39
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,710
The cotton bud poked into my ear

40
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,670
Let me see

41
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,670
Is it bleeding?

42
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,310
It's not bleeding

43
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,150
Still painful?

Si Tu Mo's ears are sensitive

45
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,750
What are you doing?

46
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,790
Just test it

47
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,710
What kind of test? Insane

48
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,750
I want to check if your
eardrum is broken

49
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,390
Are you sure?

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,230
I wanted to ask you
a question for so long

56
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,030
I heard you have a good temper

57
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,350
But why are you

58
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,550
always having trouble with me?

59
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,670
Alright, I'll sleep in your room

What's wrong with you??

62
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,390
I can't sleep at other place

63
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,470
besides on my bed

Si Tu Mo

65
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,270
What's wrong?

66
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,990
I'll sleep outside

67
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,430
I can't sleep here

68
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,670
Sleep

69
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,230
I trust you

70
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,350
Don't trust me

71
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,990
I'll sleep outside

72
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:30,830
Sleep

73
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,870
Your touched my...

74
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,030
I'm so sorry

75
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,310
The light is still on

76
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,070
I'm going to turn it off

77
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:24,750
Gu Wei Yi

78
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,830
Do you really like me?

79
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,950
Why do you suddenly ask this?

80
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,749
I just wanted to make sure

81
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,180
I love you

82
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,750
Me too

83
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,670
It's okay

84
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,270
You always said,

85
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,590
there's a difference
between theory and practice

86
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,190
Not to mention

87
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,630
we didn't even learn the theory

88
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,230
Anyway, the teacher felt ashamed

89
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,630
to explain it when I was
in the physiology class

90
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,190
So,

91
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,710
it's normal that you don't know

92
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,790
how to do it for the first time

93
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,550
I can understand it

94
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,150
Can you stop talking?

95
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:32,910
Why are you so quiet?

96
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,030
Didn't you ask me to stop talking?

97
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,350
Say something

98
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,070
What do you want me to say?

99
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,950
I don't know

100
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,710
Let me sing you a song

101
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,910
You'd better sleep

102
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,270
The ovary size and shape
is similar to an almond

103
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,270
Almond?

104
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,630
At the end of the fallopian tube,

105
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,270
close to the pelvic wall

106
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,990
The uterus is in the
middle of the pelvic cavity

107
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,270
Inverted pear-shaped

108
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,750
Why do they describe it with food?

109
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,150
The above is attached to
the opening of the fallopian tube

Gu Wei Yi

111
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,710
You get up so early

112
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,670
What are you looking at
in the early morning?

113
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,150
Open class of the Stanford's College

114
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,670
What open class?

115
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,350
Do you think I can understand it?

116
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,070
What are you listening to?

117
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,070
Human sexuality

118
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,190
Why are you studying this
in the early morning?

119
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,590
Continue it

120
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,470
Continue

121
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:50,830
Where are you going?

122
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,070
Go to work

123
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,230
I thought you're off today

124
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,030
Xu Jie Er texted me and asked
me to cancel my leave

125
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,790
She said there's something important

126
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,190
Let me send you

127
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,990
No need

128
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,310
Just do your work

129
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,430
Take your time

130
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,410

131
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:41,850
Mo Mo

132
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,170
Hurry, come with me

133
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,250
What's wrong?

134
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,050
Where are you going?

135
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:45,970
Don't ask

136
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,410
-Come with me
-What happened?

137
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:48,690
Don't ask that much

138
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,930
Hurry up

139
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,570
What makes you so mysterious?

140
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,410
Do you know why
I told you to come back?

141
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,250
They've announced the short-list of

142
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:58,770
the advertising designing contest

143
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,690
Both of us are shortlisted

144
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,650
Really?

145
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,290
Where can I check it out?

146
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,690
Take it easy

147
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:04,810
Let me finish it first

148
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,210
What's wrong?

149
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,330
It didn't show our name on the artwork

150
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,490
Why?

151
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,650
Did we forget to put it

152
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,370
or the organizer made it wrong?

153
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:13,610
No

154
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,210
It only shows the company's name

155
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,250
Just change it

156
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,410
Are you stupid?

157
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,410
We took part by the
name of the company's

158
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,210
4th creative department

159
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,850
They won't let us change it

160
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,530
You meant they did it on purpose?

161
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,850
That's why I looked for you

162
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,330
to figure it out together

163
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,770
Let's talk to Miss Sha Sha

164
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,490
It shows Miss Sha Sha's name as well

165
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,250
What for we talk to her?

166
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,610
You meant...

167
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,930
I don't know

168
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,450
We have a meeting later

169
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,050
I guess they will talk about this

170
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,290
Let's listen to them first

171
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,210
That's all we can do

172
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,010
Let's go

173
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:02,890
Hello

174
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,570
Gu Wei Yi, the result will be
announced tomorrow

175
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,730
Did you check the mark?

176
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,050
What mark?

177
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,050
What's wrong with you?

178
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,370
Didn't you mark the exam
of the Germany exchange?

179
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:13,609
No

180
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,650
Let me mark for you

181
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,449
What did you put
for the first question?

182
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,170
I don't remember it

183
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:33,240
Hello

184
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,290
The number you've dialed is engaged

185
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,770
Please dial again later

186
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
I'll read you the question

187
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,480
You do it again

188
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,240
First question

189
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,440
During the Compton effect,

190
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,770
if the speed of the Compton electron

191
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,730
is 60% of the speed of light,

192
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,050
how much the energy

193
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:54,810
will be acquired?

194
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,850
0.25 times

195
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:57,610
Okay

196
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,490
When the microscopic particles
which don't keep zero static mass

197
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,850
stand as a high-speed movement,

198
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,170
what's the relation between
the wavelength and the speed V

199
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,250
of the particle?

200
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:08,810
Hello

201
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,130
Let's summarize the recent work

202
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,210
The orange juice ads

203
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,250
received a lot of compliments

204
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,330
On this occasion,

205
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,250
I want to praise Mo Mo

206
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,810
In this project,

207
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,930
she made a very good impression

208
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,050
on the client on behalf our company

209
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,450
There's one more thing

210
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,930
The artwork of the
4th creative department

211
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,730
was shortlisted to the final round

212
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,770
in the advertising contest

213
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,970
Mo Mo and Jie Er has made

214
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,490
a very big contribution

215
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:38,970
So the company decided

216
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,290
to transfer them to be

217
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,490
our permanent staff earlier

218
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:42,970
Congratulation!

219
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,010
Alright, let's talk about other work

220
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,290
About the next project

221
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,170
Li Na

222
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,010
What's your idea about
the next projects?

223
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,250
I'm in a meeting,
let's talk after this

224
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:15,930
What should I do now?

225
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,410
What are they doing?

226
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,570
Turn to permanent staffs, huh?

227
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,210
Maybe they want

228
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,850
to block our mouth with it

229
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,450
Why do you come back so early?

230
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,330
I'm going to pick you up

231
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,290
What's wrong?

232
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,730
Tired?

233
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,890
Why did you call me?

234
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,530
You engaged for so long
today. Who's calling you?

235
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,970
I couldn't even get you

236
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,210
Zhou Lei

237
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,530
What's wrong?

238
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:28,890
What's wrong?

239
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,090
The Harvard open class
says hugging is important

240
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,650
Harvard open class?

241
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,170
The importance of
touching, sleep and love

242
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,530
So you hugged me as
you just wanted to...

243
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:48,770
What?

244
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,050
Get off me

245
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,170
What's wrong?

246
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,210
What makes you angry?

247
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,330
Think about it yourself

248
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,330
Because of this?

249
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,370
Gu Wei Yi

250
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,410
Can't you think of something else?

251
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,210
What else?

252
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,010
Say it directly, I don't understand

253
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,490
Don't regret if
I straight to the point

254
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,010
Why should I regret it?

255
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,530
You know I'm angry

256
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,370
Why are you still trying
to do that with me?

257
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,370
So that's what you think of me?

258
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,650
Forget it

259
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,010
Go to hell

260
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,170
Do we really want to
do it in the classroom?

261
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,970
It's free of charge here

262
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,770
It seems that I'm poor

263
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,370
Cut the crap!

264
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,090
Find it

265
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,090
Where is it?

266
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:54,770
Got it

267
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:07,530
Shan Shan

268
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,730
We always date at somewhere

269
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,770
we could avoid spending recently

270
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,450
Will you feel unhappy?

271
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:14,930
No

272
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,330
Let's quickly figure
out the total cost

273
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,170
Alright, I'll read it
and you calculate it

274
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,290
Software development 20,000

275
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,130
Monthly rental 4,800

276
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,050
6 months in total 28,800

277
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,490
Total 389,300

278
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,890
80,000 more than

279
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,810
our budget

280
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,650
it's a big amount

281
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:14,450
It's okay

282
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,410
I still have a lot of
limited-edition jerseys

283
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,170
How much you can get from the jerseys?

284
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,370
My mother said she'll sell
her handbags to support me

285
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,210
I don't need to trouble my mother

286
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,490
I can just sell the jerseys

287
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,690
It's more than enough

288
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:56,850
There's a temple in the building

289
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,450
The girl with the white
top is the mastermind

290
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,170
You haven't cleaned it yet

291
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,570
The color of your
picture is a bit strange

292
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,330
I think so

293
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,610
I've asked them to
adjust it for several times

294
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:48,970
It's getting worse

295
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,370
Let's ask Mo Mo

296
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,730
to sort it out

297
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,650
and we follow her idea

298
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,210
Sure

299
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,970
Mo Mo is calling me

300
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:09,970
Hello

301
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,930
I worked so hard to
complete the artwork,

302
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:13,930
but it didn't show my name

303
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,370
And he got mad with me

304
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,530
I didn't get mad with her

305
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,130
I just asked her what's going on

306
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,810
I've already asked 100 times

307
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:20,810
But she kept quiet

308
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,130
Look at his attitude,
why should I tell him?

309
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,250
If she refused to tell,

310
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,890
what for I show her my tolerance?

311
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:26,930
I don't care

312
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,530
Anyway, I've had enough

313
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,290
If he doesn't apologize to me,

314
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,570
I'm not going to talk to him

315
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,010
Why should I apologize?

316
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,210
I didn't do wrong

317
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,530
The unconditional apologies

318
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,770
when there's a dispute

319
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,290
is unreasonable

320
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,890
Let's have a cold war

321
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,370
I'll never be afraid

322
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,330
I'm not going to apologize anyway

323
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,130
Si Tu Mo

324
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,050
What's wrong?

325
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,570
Why did you just knock on my door?

326
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,650
I didn't

327
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,370
You did

328
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,810
I didn't knock on your door

329
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,330
I heard it clearly

330
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,530
You knocked on my door

331
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,130
Don't scare me

332
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,690
Maybe I misheard it

333
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,210
Why is it suddenly no sound?

334
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:10,650
I don't know

335
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:18,610
Gu Wei Yi

336
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,170
Don't scare me

337
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,770
Because I'm really going to cry

338
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,330
I'm kidding with you

339
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,770
I'm so sorry

340
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:48,730
It's all my fault

341
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:52,850
Don't be angry

342
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,250
Don't touch me

343
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,530
You're not crying, are you?

344
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,170
Don't cry

345
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,370
I didn't cry

346
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,290
Okay

347
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:17,810
Alright then

348
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,890
Why don't you bite me?

349
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,330
Why are you so silly?

350
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,370
You should run away

351
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:44,850
What happened today?

352
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,490
I was shortlisted

353
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,690
in a designing competition

354
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,570
But the company didn't
put my name on the artwork

355
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,170
What's the name of the competition?

356
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,330
Golden Pin Advertising
Designing Contest

357
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,130
Why are you asking that?

358
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,330
I can hack into their website

359
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,890
and change all the
artworks to your name

360
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,530
Insane

361
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,610
It's so simple

362
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,170
And I can keep them from knowing

363
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,570
No need

364
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,370
I'll listen to you then

365
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,010
Where's my snails powder?

366
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,810
I remember there's another packet

367
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,250
Don't you have to work today?

368
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,130
Replacement leave of yesterday

369
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,570
I'll go to the lab first

370
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,330
Okay, I'll see you at the campus later

371
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,370
We'll have dinner
together tonight, right?

372
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,410
Did you see my snails powder?

373
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,050
I remember there's another packet

374
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,730
Didn't you eat it yesterday?

375
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,930
I was so angry and
only ate a few bites

376
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:08,930
I'm craving for it now

377
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,730
Gu Wei Yi

378
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:13,570
Did you actually

379
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,610
see my snails powder?

380
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,850
Above the second cupboard

381
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,650
Nothing

382
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,810
I just checked it

383
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,810
It's here

384
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,730
Why do you keep it there?

385
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,410
I put it up yesterday

386
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,290
Why?

387
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:57,890
Because you ignored me yesterday

388
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,690
I want you to beg me to get it for you

389
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,050
Gu Wei Yi, you're here

390
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,010
The result will be announced today

391
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,290
Are you nervous?

392
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,330
No

393
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:27,890
I tell you

394
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,210
I can feel it

395
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,970
that I definitely did better than you

396
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,970
When I checked your answer yesterday,

397
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,050
I felt my score

398
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,290
is much more than yours

399
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,770
The most important thing is

400
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,450
Senior Lu

401
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,930
is especially nice to me recently

402
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,050
Because she knows that

403
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,930
we're going abroad soon

404
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,730
We'll need to get along in the future

405
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,210
So she wants to build a
good relationship with me

406
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,130
Because I told her, you've
been rehabilitation center before

407
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:53,570
Gu Wei Yi

408
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,290
How can you...

409
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,730
How can you slander me?

410
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:57,650
She didn't

411
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,810
bully you again, did she?

412
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:00,850
Think so

413
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,090
We're going to be
rooted in the lab soon

414
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,410
I can't

415
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,730
sleep in the lab again

416
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,130
Senior Lu is terrible

417
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:10,650
You're all here

418
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,210
Professor Jiang, you're here

419
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,850
You have the result?

420
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:15,970
Are you going to announce it?

421
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,090
Take it easy

422
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,770
Sit down first

423
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,570
Sit down

424
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:23,690
Okay

425
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,170
Professor, what are you doing?

426
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,650
Hurry up announce it

427
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,690
Xie Yu Yin is not here yet

428
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,610
Wait for her

429
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:47,850
Why?

430
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,090
We should make it in formal

431
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:50,970
Right?

432
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,210
Okay

433
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,050
Senior

434
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,370
Professor Jiang, she's here

435
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,090
Professor said,

436
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,650
he'll only announce the
result when you're here

437
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:03,930
Announcement?

438
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:06,330
This...

439
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,810
Now that we're all here,

440
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,449
I'll announce the result

441
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,210
In this examination,

442
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,209
two of you made it

443
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,370
very well

444
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,970
It's beyond my imagination

445
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,370
Especially Zhou Lei

446
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,170
You managed to answer
the questions of Physics

447
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,810
as good as the student of Physics

448
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,530
But,

449
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:31,759
Gu Wei Yi is from

450
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,250
this professional, after all

451
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:38,410
So, in terms of scores,

452
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,690
he's slightly better

453
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,250
than you

454
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,010
Just a little bit

455
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,090
How little?

456
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,090
Not much

457
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,170
From the paper,

458
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,410
it's about 10...

459
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,170
More than 10 marks?

460
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,090
19 marks

461
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:12,530
Impossible

462
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,450
Did you mark it wrongly?

463
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,210
Zhou Lei

464
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,930
I tell you

465
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:23,930
Gu Wei Yi

466
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,370
is a student of this major

467
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,570
By judging from the result,

468
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,650
he's far from your efforts

469
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,930
He has an unfair
advantage in the competition

470
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,210
One day,

471
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,010
you must be able to overtake him

472
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:38,890
Don't worry

473
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,210
Impossible, I marked
his answer yesterday

474
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,610
I definitely did better than him

475
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,930
This is impossible

476
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,170
Gu Wei Yi, Xie Yu Yin

477
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,250
Come to my office

478
00:35:58,930 --> 00:35:59,610
These are

479
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,770
the forms for you

480
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:02,970
There's a lot of information

481
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,210
Go back and check it out

482
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:05,530
Oh yeah

483
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,690
You have to do a body
checkup and a vaccine first

484
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:09,810
Okay

485
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,130
That's all

486
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:12,530
You can go now

487
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:15,610
How?

488
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:16,730
I'm done

489
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:17,490
Oh yeah

490
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,450
You two have to

491
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,970
take a look at Zhou Lei

492
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,010
pay attention to his emotion

493
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:24,370
You can go now

494
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,450
Wait a minute

495
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,330
Did you tell your parents?

496
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,930
There was a female student before

497
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,730
Her parents suddenly
came and looked for her

498
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,930
after she went abroad for a month

499
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,690
They didn't know their
daughter went abroad

500
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,930
I have already told them

501
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,010
I didn't tell them

502
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,170
You...

503
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,610
I won't tell if that's not confirmed

504
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,010
Well.

505
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:45,730
Gu Wei Yi

506
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,090
Did you think you're not
doing as well as Zhou Lei?

507
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,810
There's a 5% chance too

508
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,570
Moreover, I always

509
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,890
make my own decisions

510
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,730
I'll make the decision and inform them

511
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,210
What about your girlfriend?

512
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,650
You didn't tell her too?

513
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,170
I didn't tell her

514
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
[Brainstorming]

515
00:37:19,814 --> 00:37:20,614
Gu Wei Yi

516
00:37:20,627 --> 00:37:22,427
We'll be graduated after 2 months

517
00:37:22,747 --> 00:37:23,977
Let's travel to Tibet

518
00:37:24,107 --> 00:37:24,707
As long as you like it,

519
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:25,432
we can go wherever you want to

520
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,080
It's hard to book

521
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,710
the train ticket

522
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:29,593
Don't worry

523
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,720
The APP can make it

524
00:37:30,898 --> 00:37:31,698
Advance purchase 63 days

525
00:37:31,755 --> 00:37:32,825
with auto ticket-grabber

526
00:37:32,903 --> 00:37:33,973
I'm willing to go

527
00:37:34,053 --> 00:37:34,993
anywhere with you

528
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:35,849
Me too
