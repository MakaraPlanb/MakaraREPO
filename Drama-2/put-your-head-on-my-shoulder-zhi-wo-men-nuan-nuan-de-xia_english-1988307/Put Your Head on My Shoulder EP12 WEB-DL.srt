What's wrong?

00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,540
Please tell me earlier

00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,820

00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,380
Hello, Mo Mo

10
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,540
Hello, Shan Shan

11
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,980
What should I cook for a person

12
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,860
who has a fever?

13
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,420
Porridge

14
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,580
Who has a fever?

15
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,060
Gu Wei Yi

16
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,020
My mom used to cook this way

17
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,300
First, wash the rice

18
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,020
Put little oil and salt

19
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,140
into the rice

20
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,740
Put dried tangerine peel
in cold water and boil it

21
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,540
Put the rice in after it's boiled

22
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,380
When the water bubbled up again,

23
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,860
turn it to medium or low heat

24
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,580
Make sure it doesn't stick to the pot

25
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,420
When it's almost done,
take out the peel

26
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,580
Forget it, let him starve to death

27
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,940
He doesn't need the porridge anyway

28
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,540
It sounds complicated

29
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,100
In fact, it's simple

30
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,420
Come and help me

31
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,740
Okay

32
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,100
See you soon

33
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,580
Don't pretend sleeping

34
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,660
Gu Wei Yi is sick

35
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,900
Not my concern

36
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,860
Don't you want to visit him?

37
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,020
Don't you want to go to his house?

38
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,940
Mo Mo doesn't want to see me

39
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,180
I went to see her a few days ago

40
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,620
She told me not to turn up again

41
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,140
That's why you're
getting mad in the court

42
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,420
Have you guys made it clear?

43
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,060
She didn't give me the chance

44
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,180
Alright, I'll bring you there

45
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,620
Are you sleeping?

46
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,540
No

47
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,580
You want some water, right?

48
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,740
Check your temperature

49
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,700
Where are you going?

50
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,970
Remind me when it's done

51
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,770
I'll check it out in 10 minutes

52
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,180
What is the temperature?

53
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,540
We must go to the hospital

54
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,020
No way

55
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,460
You're having a high fever

56
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,860
I've taken the pills

57
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,820
No way, let's go to the hospital

58
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,060
No way

59
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,180
Gu Wei Yi

60
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,940
Gu Wei Yi

61
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,740
Why do you bring him along?

62
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,300
I need a helper

63
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,260
You bought the dried tangerine peel?

64
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,460
You told me you'll bring it

65
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,580
That's right

66
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,940
I'll go and get it now

67
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,100
Shan Shan

68
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,660
Cut it out

69
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,300
You two go and buy it

70
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,460
I'll wash the rice first

71
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,140
It's alright, I'll go myself

72
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:30,940
Hurry up

73
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,340
Hello

74
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,260
Hello, Aunt Xu

What's up?

77
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,180
Am I disturbing you?

78
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,940
No

79
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,460
Alright

80
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,060
I just want to tell you

81
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,980
Xiao Yi

82
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,300
gets sick easily when
the weather changes

83
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,340
How has he been recently?

84
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,900
He is having a fever,
but refused to go to hospital

85
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,060
What's the temperature?

86
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,380
Is it high?

87
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,580
38.3 Celsius

88
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,140
Over 38 Celsius

89
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,380
It's alright

90
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,420
He used to have a fever at 39 Celsius

91
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,540
Give him medicine and take
a rest, he will be alright

92
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,140
Can you advise him to go to hospital?

93
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,100
Xiao Yi scares of injection

94
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,540
Scares of injection?

95
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,540
So he never goes to any hospital

96
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,820
It's better check it out in the hospital

97
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,100
I'm not going to convince him

98
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,980
He's terrible

99
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,420
when he gets mad

100
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,060
Don't make him angry

101
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:35,940
Alright

102
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,940
Don't worry

103
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,580
Thank you

104
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,060
Alright

105
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,500
Bye

106
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,780
Nothing to be scared
when Gu Wei Yi gets mad

107
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,260
He just looks unfriendly

108
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,500
That's right

109
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,620
Gu Wei Yi never gets mad

110
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,860
Gu Wei Yi scares of injection

111
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,900
How did he get injections before?

112
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,220
Do you still remember?

113
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,740
When we got injection in high school,

114
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,660
a fat guy stood in front of you

115
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,380
He suddenly fainted and fell on you

116
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,220
In fact, you stood in front of me

117
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,780
You ran away when he fainted

118
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,220
That's why he fell on me

119
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,980
Think so

120
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,220
But I did help to bring him up

121
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,100
That's crap!

122
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
You're laughing out loud there

123
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,660
Was I?

124
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:31,940
Fu Pei

125
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,539
I have stopped my feeling on you

126
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:36,819
I know

127
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,140
It's good that you knew about it

128
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,540
Of course I knew

129
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,980
You treated me like a ghost

130
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,100
I'd rather see a ghost than you

131
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,250
Si Tu Mo

132
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,820
Can we go back to the past?

133
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,180
Why do you want to do so?

134
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,420
Did we have any good memory in the past?

135
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,420
Fu Pei

136
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,860
Do you like Wang Shan?

137
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,060
I don't know

138
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,180
You should go to hell!

139
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,940
Why do you come out? Getting better?

140
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,260
Where is Fu Pei?

141
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,380
He left

142
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:43,900
Where is Shan Shan?

143
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,740
She left

144
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,460
So fast

145
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,740
I was hoping to talk to her

146
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,940
About what?

147
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,260
Nothing

148
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,700
I bought the dried tangerine peel

149
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,820
Let me boil some porridge for you

150
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,220
No need

151
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,700
You should eat something
after the medicine

153
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,060

Please tell me earlier

156
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,020
Okay

157
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,460
Are you awake?

158
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,580
Anything?

159
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,260
Are you getting better?

160
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,300
Yes

161
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,580
Check the temperature again

162
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,380
No need

163
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,300
I cooked some porridge,
do you want to have some?

164
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,620
Or I bring it here?

165
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,140
Thank you

166
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,060

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,620
you need are in the bag

196
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,340
We need to talk after the exam

197
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Please enter the room
as soon as possible!

198
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,380
Go ahead

199
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,740
Recheck it thoroughly

200
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,140
Don't rush or pass up before time's up

201
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,500
I'll wait outside

202
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,860
You're like my mother

203
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,540
Go

204
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:40,940
Fu Pei

205
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,620
Good luck!

206
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,460
Crazy

207
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,780
Recheck it thoroughly

208
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,540
Don't rush or pass up before time's up

209
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,900
I'll wait outside

210
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,700
He really called the food delivery

211
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,260
Senior

212
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,860
My team members asked me
to come and visit Gu Wei Yi

213
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,740
And I bring over his shipment too

214
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,340
Please come in

215
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,180
Wait a moment

216
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,700
Gu Wei Yi

217
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,220
Your senior is here

218
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,420
Why are you here?

219
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,860
You have a shipment in the lab

220
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,820
And Zhou Lei

221
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,540
asked me to check your condition

222
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,060
and he'll consider to
let you back to the lab

223
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,580
Are you getting better today?

224
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,380
I'm alright

225
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,460
I'll clean the table

226
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:00,900
Let me help you

227
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:01,980
Thank you

228
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,420
Are you doing an experiment?

229
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,380
My company has an
ads project of orange juice

230
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,140
So I tried to look into
the others brands

231
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,220
Do I disturb you?

232
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,380
It's alright

233
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,220
-What's this?
-What's this?

234
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,900
Microscope

235
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,780
I know, what is it for?

236
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,100
Polarized?

237
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,260
Can it connect to computer?

238
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,180
Yes

239
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,740
It has two-way synchronous
magnification calibration function

240
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,700
Let me see

241
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,420
Take a look

242
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,060
What is the greatest zoom?

243
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,220
2540 times

244
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,220
So clear

245
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,460
You want to use it

246
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,780
to see the sphaero crystal
of Polypropylene?

247
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,300
Why don't you use
the one in the lab?

248
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,940
In fact, Professor Jiang

249
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,180
asked me to order it for the lab

250
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,300
But you brought it over

251
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,100
I shouldn't have brought it over

252
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,500
It's quite heavy

253
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,220
I'll bring it to the lab tomorrow

254
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,020
What about other functions?

255
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,700
It's more advanced than the one in lab

256
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,620
Senior

257
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:43,980
Where is Gu Wei Yi?

258
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,260
He go get changed

259
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,100
We're going out for a meal

260
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,180
Do you want to join us?

261
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,100
Let's go

262
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,740
I'm asking Si Tu Mo to join us

263
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,620
Do you want to go?

264
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,220
I'll pass, enjoy yourselves

265
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,300
I'm so hungry

266
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,500
I just finished a pot of porridge

267
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,460
So happy

268
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,140
Sir, enjoy your food

269
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,980
I thought you didn't like
spicy food, all these...

270
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,420
Si Tu Mo always ordered these
when we're here

271
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,500
I'm used to it

272
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,580
Moreover, it's not that spicy

273
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,100
Dig in

274
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,100
Fatty has no future

275
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,420
No food, no future

276
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,140
I thought Gu Wei Yi was sick

277
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,140
Why did you finish the porridge?

278
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,500
Still chatting, huh?

279
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,140
Your thesis was rejected

280
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,420
Quickly come back, we need to talk

281
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,940
Senior

282
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,540
I have to go first

283
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,660
Take your time

284
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,580
It's on me

285
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,740
Thank you for bringing me the good

286
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,820
So soon? You guys should chat more

287
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,500
Where are you going?

288
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,540
Dump

289
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,300
Tear off the consignment note

290
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,860
There's personal information

291
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,020
Okay

292
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,300
This is a shipment to the lab

293
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,420
in the new campus?

294
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,820
Aren't you working in the old campus?

295
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,500
Hello, senior

296
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,140
Okay

297
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,180
It is handled by Zhou Lei

298
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,340
Senior

299
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,020
I don't know about it

300
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,580
Say it

301
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,900
What?

302
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,820
You said you wanted to talk to me

303
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,980
I don't know how to put it

304
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,540
Fu Pei

305
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,380
I don't want to carry on like this

306
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,620
Because I really like you

307
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,860
Don't interrupt

308
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,900
I say nothing

309
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,140
But the more I like you,

310
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,780
the more I feel humbled

311
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,340
I thought I could

312
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,820
replace Mo Mo

313
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,140
in your heart

314
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,540
Or

315
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,060
I could stand by your side

316
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,460
even if you miss her

317
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,300
No...

318
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,580
But I found it's tiring

319
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,220
I don't want to carry on

320
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,380
Si Tu Mo and I

321
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,020
are just normal friends

322
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,420
But you still like her

323
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,860
No

324
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,900
How could you say it easily?

325
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,140
You're such a fickle guy

326
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,940
I didn't mean it

327
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,140
What do you mean?

328
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,060
I knew what's in my mind

329
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,580
But I don't know

330
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,580
how to tell you

331
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,700
when I see you

332
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,700
I just feel I should tell you

333
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:39,940
the shitty things

334
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,580
I've been through in the past 20 years

335
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,380
before becoming who I am now

336
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,580
So, you might feel sympathy to me

337
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,500
and forgive me

338
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,780
I want to hold you by my side forever

339
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,580
But, I don't know what to say

340
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,540
when I see you

341
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,940
Because you know everything

342
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,540
Be it

343
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,220
the English words I couldn't memorize

344
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,260
or the relationship
between Si Tu Mo and me

345
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,540
You always have a
clearer picture than I

346
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,060
I feel that I'm full of flaws

347
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,100
by your side,

348
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,740
but you never reveal it

349
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,460
You even mend it secretly

350
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,980
When you said you like me

351
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,220
When you applied the medicine for me

352
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,460
When you helped me with the revision

353
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,340
Even when you asked
me to look for Si Tu Mo

354
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,020
I felt...

355
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,660
How could a girl

356
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,020
be so strong like you?

357
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,420
Until I was scolded by Si Tu Mo

358
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,020
that I realized

359
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,500
that I've been making the same mistake

360
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,020
over the years

361
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,340
By assuming you don't like me

362
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,420
I gave myself a chance to escape

363
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,020
I pretended I didn't like you either

364
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,500
so that I could accept the fact
that you didn't like me

365
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,580
Now I want to stop it

366
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,060
Because I like you

367
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,660
I really like you very much

368
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,900
It doesn't matter if
you don't accept me now

369
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,260
I will keep bugging you

370
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,860
The sense of self-respect
and pride are nothing

371
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,700
When you accept me,

372
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,780
you'll surely

373
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,620
mend it and give me back

374
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,700
the pride that I lose

375
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,540
like you always do

376
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,300
Why are you looking at me like that?

377
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,940
Are you serious?

378
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,980
Sure

379
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,420
Say something

380
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,860
What?

381
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,180
Be with me

382
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,100
will you?

383
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,620
I'll hit myself if you reject me

384
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,660
Crazy

385
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:28,940
Insane

386
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,500
Circle

387
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,420
You concern about me?

388
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,740
What happened?

389
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,700
I broke the mug

390
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:09,820
Let me clean it

391
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,500
No need

392
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,020
What're you doing?

393
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,660
Check if it is clean

394
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,420
I can't beat your senior

395
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,900
She could clean it very well

396
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,740
I meant...

397
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,140
She does clean the lab perfectly

398
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,380
But, how did you know?

399
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,740
Go away!

400
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,020
You're disturbing me now!

401
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,700
Circle is injured

402
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,500
So?

403
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,340
Do you want to take my life?

404
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,100
A girl suddenly gets mad

405
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,380
Collectomania for mugs

406
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,980
Gu Wei Yi

407
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,820
Why do you come empty-handed?

408
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,940
Where is the microscope?

409
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,020
I forgot to bring it

410
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,140
What?

411
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,580
Forgot to bring it?

412
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,500
You forget it?

413
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,220
How can you forget it?

414
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,500
What's wrong with you?

415
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,420
-What's wrong?
-The...

416
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,460
Professor

417
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,540
Gu Wei Yi forgot to bring the microscope

418
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,100
I bet he wanted to steal it

419
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,580
Xiao Gu

420
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,420
You seldom forget this kind of things

421
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,060
What's wrong?

422
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,140
Did the girl

423
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,620
see her ex-boyfriend again?

424
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,140
Any updates?

425
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,660
Look like bad news

426
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,820
Think so

427
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,020
Professor, what are you doing?

428
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,260
I haven't done my experiment

429
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,020
Look at it

430
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,340
The distance should be calculated from here, 

431
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:02,900
Like this

432
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,060
What's wrong with it?

433
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,860
What were you guys talking about?

434
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:09,980
Senior

435
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,060
Gu Wei Yi forgot to bring the microscope

436
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,819
It's on your side table

437
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,540
How can you forget it?

438
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,180
You went to his house?

439
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:25,819
I...

440
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:26,980
Zhou Lei

441
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,700
He said Gu Wei Yi was still sick

442
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:32,219
and didn't allow him to come back, so...

443
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,180
Stop

444
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,500
Stop explaining

445
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,699
I knew why you

446
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,219
went to his house

447
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:55,179
Apparently, you guys
are trying to boycott me

448
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,060
from the scientific research

449
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,370
This is not new

450
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,700
It's too bad

451
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,660
That's right

452
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,100
You...

453
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,020
Xie Yu Yin

454
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,220
Tell me! Why did you boycott me?

455
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,740
Why did you boycott me? What now?

456
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,620
What's wrong with you??

457
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:13,940
Why?

458
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,700
Xiao Gu

459
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,660
Xie Yu Yin went to your house?

460
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,940
Did the girl know about it?

461
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,540
No wonder you can't get her

462
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:27,820
She's jealous

463
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,500
She's jealous, got it?

464
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,460
Jealous?

465
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:34,980
What are you talking about?

466
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,940
Nothing, we're talking about the data

467
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,460
What's that?

468
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,940
Come on

469
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,260
Let me tell you

470
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,500
Check the data

471
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,660
Hurry up do the calculation

472
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,260
Hurry up

473
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,860
Farther please

474
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,740
That's right

475
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,140
Scan here

476
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:02,620
Okay

477
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,580
Look thinner

478
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,460
Si Tu Mo

479
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,780
Senior

480
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,460
You want to top-up too?

481
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:09,820
Yes

482
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,540
Mo Mo, hurry up!

483
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,260
It's our turn

484
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,500
Senior, you go first

485
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,740
It's okay, go ahead

486
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,180
I want to top up RMB100

487
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,980
Mo Mo, I'll get the food first

488
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,460
Hurry up!

489
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,580
RMB100 please

490
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:31,820
Take it

491
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,700
Thank you

492
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,540
Senior, see you

493
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,300
RMB50, thank you

494
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,700
Who is the girl?

495
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,060
She's quite pretty

496
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,420
Gu Wei Yi's senior

497
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,940
They are in the same lab

498
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,900
So, Gu Wei Yi stays with her every day

499
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,500
Aren't you worried?

500
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,500
Cut the crap!

501
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,660
Worry?

502
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,620
Why should I?

503
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,260
You trust him so much, huh?

504
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,260
I...

505
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,700
Trust him?

506
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,300
It has nothing to do with me

507
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,140
Alright then

508
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,340
If I were you,

509
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,900
I'd surely be worried

510
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,060
After all, Gu Wei Yi is good-looking

511
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,740
Even if he doesn't fall for her,

512
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,220
she might have a crush on him

513
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,220
I never have a crush on him

514
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,660
It has nothing to do with me

515
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,260
You can't run from it

516
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,500
You'll be the first to be splashed by acid

517
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,060
as you're staying with Gu Wei Yi

518
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,340
You're so terrible

519
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,100
I'm a bad woman

520
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,020
Men

521
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,660
like bad women

522
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,620
I'm going to buy a meal for Ke

523
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,860
I'll be right back

524
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,540
Keep a watch on my phone

525
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,220
I'll be right back

526
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,540
Be careful

527
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,860
The bad woman is here

528
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,580
What a coincidence!

529
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,820
We meet again

530
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,460
Yeah

531
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,300
There's something I'd like to ask

532
00:38:46,108 --> 00:38:48,108
[Here comes the Easter egg...]

533
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,220
Are you getting better?

534
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,380
You might think that you're great

535
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,660
But I don't admire

536
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,860
your spirit of self-sacrifice

537
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,620
And

538
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,020
your self-sacrifice affected me

539
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,180
I hope you leave now
