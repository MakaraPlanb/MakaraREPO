What are you doing?

4
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,120
Don't look at my girlfriend

5
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,080
Are you in the bad mood?

6
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,880
I thought you want to beat me

You had pressed on the infusion tube

10
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,320
Hello

11
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,240
Hello, what do you want to eat?

12
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,880
Give me one bowl of porridge

13
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,000
One baked roll

14
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,120
Two Youtiao

and salty Douhua

17
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,560
Lao Wang, is the porridge ready??

18
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,400
Okay

19
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,680
Others are ready

20
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,520
Only the porridge is still cooking

21
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,920
Are you okay with the soy milk?

22
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,480
Our soy milk is rich in taste

23
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,320
No, thanks

24
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,040
You must try it and
you will believe it

25
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,360
My friend has a gastroenteritis and
she needs only the porridge

26
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,280
Okay then

27
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,160
Please take a seat and wait for a while

28
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,000
Why you came so early?

29
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,600
She has vomited yesterday

30
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
I'm worrying that she will
get hungry after wake up

31
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,760
You treat your friend so good

32
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,320
My husband has never treated me

33
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,240
like what you did when he ran after me

34
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,480
Am I right?

35
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,600
Never buy me a breakfast
in 6am morning

36
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,760
Why not?

37
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,680
I was always worried
that you'll get hungry

38
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,080
and I always treated you with nice food

39
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,760
Now your body weight can prove it

40
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,840
Pardon?

41
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,800
Okay, I dare not say it anymore

42
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,960
Quickly get his order ready

43
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,240
Okay

44
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,080
Hello

45
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,080
Where are you?

46
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,000
Could you send me
a pair of sport shoes now?

47
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,120
I have a match this afternoon

48
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,760
My shoes were wet last night

49
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,320
although I have tried to dry it up

50
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,360
Hair dryer is prohibited at our dorm

51
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,760
Could you ask Ke to send it to you?

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm not in the university now

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,760
They can't help

54
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,080
Otherwise, I won't trouble you

55
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,360
Take it yourself then

56
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
I'm in the training now

57
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,480
Or else I won't stay here overnight

58
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,200
It won't take you so much time

59
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,720
Are you saying that you refuse to help?

60
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,800
Well

61
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,400
I'll pay the fare for you

62
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,640
I'm in the hospital now

63
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
What's wrong with you?

64
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,560
Are you okay?

65
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,760
Si Tu Mo was admitted

66
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,000
What are you looking at?

67
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
The body check monitor

68
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,000
Why?

69
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,800
Thinking how to on it

70
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,680
Are you an internet addiction?

71
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,280
Have your breakfast first

72
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Porridge

73
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
It's alright for me to eat others

74
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,440
I vomited and my stomach is empty now

75
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,960
You see...

76
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,160
Are you Si Tu Mo?

77
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,160
How do you feel?

78
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,160
It's getting better

79
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,720
You were suffering in gastroenteritis

80
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,920
You can't eat those food

81
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,400
I eat only the porridge

82
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,040
That's good

83
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
Dr. Liu will come here in a short while

84
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,680
You will get scolded

85
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,240
if he sees it

86
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,280
You can't eat this

87
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,480
Have a good rest

88
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,600
What are you doing?

89
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,160
Give way

90
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,760
I can't

91
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,440
Why?

92
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,560
Don't look at my girlfriend

93
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,440
Look like she has been fully recovered

94
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,360
My hair is so oily

95
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,680
Do you have rubber band?

96
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,320
Do you think I will have it?

97
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,640
You made the point

98
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,520
Wait for a while, I need to go
through the discharge procedure

99
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,480
Okay

100
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,720
This is for you

101
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,480
Thank you

102
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,000
Don't eat snail noodle anymore

103
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,920
It's so dirty

104
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,720
You'll get stomach-ache again

105
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,640
I got it

106
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,040
I buy you some delicious food

107
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,400
I'm better now

108
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,120
You always made people in worry

109
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,600
Are you okay now?

110
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,520
Okay

111
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,440
So fast you are here?

112
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,520
Yeah

113
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,520
This is a small matter for me

114
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,640
Master, can it be fixed?

115
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
I'm rushing

116
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,920
I need more time to fix it

117
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,480
You are out of the range

118
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,960
The power will be cut off,
you'll not able to return the bike

119
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,400
You are out of the range

120
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,160
The power will be cut off,
you'll not able to return the bike

121
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,280
This is really a small matter for me

122
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,480
Let me take it

123
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,280
You really helped me a lot

124
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,360
But how come you sent Mo Mo here?

125
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,880
-She's now living in...
-We met at the roadside

126
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,440
So I asked him to come with me

127
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,560
It's okay, I can walk myself

128
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Are you okay?

129
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,640
Slowly

130
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,360
Dr. Liu

131
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Where is your boyfriend?

132
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,240
Your boyfriend asked him to help?

133
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,680
Boyfriend?

134
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,160
Take a good rest after this

135
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,760
Don't always get admitted

136
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,280
You have made your boyfriend in worry

137
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,320
If you admit again,

138
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,200
he will be crazy

139
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,360
It's not as what you said, Dr. Liu

140
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,520
Not like that

141
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,720
Your boyfriend is coming

142
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,240
I'm leaving first

143
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,640
Waiting for me?

144
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,720
Let's go

145
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,160
Gu Wei Yi

146
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,720
The doctor said you
are Mo Mo's boyfriend

147
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,200
What's wrong?

148
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,600
The doctor must be mistaken

149
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,120
Is that true?

150
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,120
Of course, what are you thinking then?

151
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,080
It's true

152
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,320
Gu Wei Yi doesn't like
the girl like Mo Mo

153
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,120
What type of girl I like?

154
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,400
Maria Curie I guess

155
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,280
Not at all

156
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,840
Take the money

157
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,080
Okay, thank you

158
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,880
My princess Mo Mo

159
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,080
Please

160
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,480
Okay, don't act anymore

161
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,560
Yes

162
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,080
My lady

163
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,080
Okay, good luck in the match

164
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,600
Give me a call in anything

165
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll leave first

166
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,960
Let me help you

167
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,120
It's okay

168
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,480
It's so heavy

169
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,640
Don't worry

170
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,360
I will carry it to your dorm

171
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,120
Mo Mo has moved out from here

172
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:16,840
Why are you

173
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,520
still wandering around here?

174
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,400
What?

175
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
You don't know?

176
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,080
I knew it

177
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,840
I just sent her back

178
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,320
Thank you

179
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,360
Good bye

180
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,560
See you

181
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,360
She's not at here

182
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,200
Hey

183
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
Enjoy your tea

184
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
But, could you please
stop making the sound?

185
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,200
Don't you think

186
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,480
this will make your office

187
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,800
more vitality?

188
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,360
Cut the crap

189
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,400
It's bored

190
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,400
Professor Jiang, the senior
looked  down upon me

191
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,600
What's wrong?

192
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,160
Mr. Wang, Professor Jiang, look at this

193
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,600
This is my experiment report

194
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,920
She marked my report

195
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,320
without my knowledge

196
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,000
Who gave her the authority?

197
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:26,920
Professor Jiang

198
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,360
I am your student but not her

199
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,320
How can she mark my report?

200
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,080
I have just argued with her about this

201
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,160
She told me that

202
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,280
even Gu Wei Yi could

203
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,720
accept her guidance modestly

204
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,040
Why can't I?

205
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,200
Why did she compare Gu Wei Yi with me?

206
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,720
I'm smarter than him

207
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,200
I get here by my strength

208
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,440
But he get here through
the back door, am I right?

209
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,880
You're wrong

210
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,360
You...

211
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,640
You...

212
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,840
The red color remark

213
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,600
is to keep you reminded

214
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,680
the mistakes you did in the report

215
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,240
As a senior, I'm trying to help you

216
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,520
But you refused to accept it

217
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
That's why I can only give you

218
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,000
an example of a successful person
after he accepted my guidance,

219
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,080
Gu Wei Yi

220
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,920
I didn't expect that you'll
in such big response

221
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,080
You...

222
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,920
Professor Jiang, look at here

223
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,880
How could she...

224
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,240
Look at it

225
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,440
Xie Yu Yin

226
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,800
has marked

227
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,120
the mistakes

228
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,080
and she has also written

229
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,400
the correct answers at the bottom

230
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,080
Wang, check it out

231
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,480
It's wrong

232
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,560
All wrong

233
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,720
Where?

234
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,080
How can it be wrong? I have
calculated it for a few times

235
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,760
I can't see any wrong too

236
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,040
It's wrong

237
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,440
Yes

238
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,760
It's because your writing

239
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,440
is too horrible

240
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,560
Gu Wei Yi

241
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,400
Professor Jiang, here is
my experiment report

242
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,640
Don't read it

243
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,760
We won't look at his report

244
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,520
Well, I'll check it later

245
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,800
Zhou Lei

246
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,320
I have checked your experiment report

247
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,839
The calculation part was wrong

248
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,920
I have written the correct
answer by pencil

249
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,600
If you find it wrong,

250
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,310
just erase it and
do your own calculation

251
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,960
Let's discuss it later

252
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,159
It's okay for the others

253
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,759
I'm leaving first

254
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,310
Okay

255
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,440
The writing is so nice

256
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,880
Why? Are you going to leave here?

257
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,280
How long you'll go back for this time?

258
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,720
About a week

259
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,920
I'll come back after the completion

260
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,120
of Professor Jiang's experiment

261
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,160
Why can't you do it at here?

262
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,720
What's the purpose to move in here?

263
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,240
Some equipment is still
at the old campus

264
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,200
I don't really understand
the scientific research

265
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,720
Could you lend me your house key?

266
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,760
My key was left at your house

267
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,680
I need to go back to pack my belonging

268
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,120
Please don't tell anyone that

269
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,920
I stayed at your house before

270
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,720
I really had my bad day

271
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,040
After I failed in interviews,

272
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,920
I noticed that the girl I like

273
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,640
still entangles with her ex-boyfriend

274
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,080
He visited her everytime
when she was sick

275
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,120
It has nothing to do with him, right?

276
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,160
Hello, you there?

277
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,720
Her ex-boyfriend

278
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,160
never wants to be with her again

279
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,320
and why he still disturbs her?

280
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,160
However, she is happy with it

281
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,480
Tell me what is actually
in lady's mind?

282
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,720
Si Tu Mo

283
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,160
Remember to bring back the
report that I have passed to you

284
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,720
Okay

285
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,480
Let's go to Ao Li Advertising
together tomorrow

286
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,760
Okay

287
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,880
What's wrong? Don't scare me

288
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,960
Hello

289
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,760
Gu Wei Yi

290
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,360
Why you never reply my message?

291
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,880
I have set my phone to silence mode

292
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,280
You have forgotten
to bring the key, right?

293
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,360
Let's go back together

294
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,720
Bus or cab?

295
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,000
Anything

296
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,760
Gu Wei Yi

297
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,360
Gu Wei Yi

298
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
What's wrong again?

299
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,720
The luggage is not in proper zipped

300
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,880
Thank you, let's go

301
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,280
Is that your girlfriend?

302
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,160
No

303
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,920
Let's go

304
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,320
Where do you want to go?

305
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
Anywhere

306
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,640
Thank you

307
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,360
Not at all

308
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,800
Young man

309
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,040
I saw many kinds of people
when I was driving around

310
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,840
Don't be sad

311
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,680
I guess you

312
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,920
are not married yet, right?

313
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,640
I'm not cheating you

314
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,840
I used to take a female
passenger in the past

315
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,880
She asked me to wait at the downstairs

316
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,080
because she wanted to beat
her husband and the mistress

317
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,440
She said she will be leaving after that

318
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,240
But unexpectedly,

319
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,880
her husband has rented a room

320
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,760
to put those plastic dolls

321
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,040
What you called it?

322
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,440
Alright

323
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,400
The sex dolls

324
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,200
They have quarrelled

325
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,520
on the way back

326
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,600
She acted without checking

327
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,440
and made a joke

328
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,160
Master

329
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
Please u-turn

330
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,960
Why do you look at me?

331
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,560
Nothing

332
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,320
I...

333
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,160
I'm looking at the fridge magnet

334
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,200
It's so cute, how wasted it's with you

335
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,960
Take it

336
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,440
Don't waste it

337
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,200
Are you in a bad mood?

338
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,800
No

339
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,560
I have washed your bed sheet yesterday

340
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,040
But it's not dry yet due to rain

341
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,000
I dry it for you now

342
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,520
You can set it back after it's dry

343
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,720
Wait until it's dry

344
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,280
I don't know how to set it on

345
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,360
I will help you to do it
when I'm free, okay?

346
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:37,960
No

347
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,120
Are you trying to make me in trouble?

348
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,640
If you don't set it on,

349
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,600
then I can't sleep on it

350
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,520
Alright

351
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,160
Crazy

352
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,840
I should beat him up, he must be crazy

353
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,600
Come on

354
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,320
Take it

355
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,720
Why did you let it go?

356
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,560
I thought you want to beat me

357
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
No, I won't do that

358
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,640
Go and get the bed sheet

359
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,440
Try this, see whether can get it or not

360
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,240
Give it to me

361
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,520
Hold it high, can you reach it?

362
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,800
Hold it higher

363
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,280
Pick it up

364
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,200
Pick it up

365
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,640
Why did you jump?

366
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,560
You told me to jump, right?

367
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,040
I told you to pick it up

368
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,560
and swing it out, I'll catch it

369
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,960
Try to pick it up

370
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,280
Why did you jump again?

371
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,640
I'm not tall enough

372
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,840
I'm 1.87m

373
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,080
Is it?

374
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,880
It's true

375
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,720
Alright

376
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,760
Alright, the man of 1.87m,

377
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,920
please pick up the bed
sheet and swing it down

378
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,520
Jump

379
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,840
You almost get it

380
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,160
Jump higher

381
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,600
How come there's no fruits?

382
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,160
This plate looked strange

383
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,080
It's green color

384
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,240
Fu Pei

385
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,320
This is a misunderstanding

386
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,920
I'll bring you some fruits next time

387
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,920
What fruit you like to eat?

388
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,800
Watermelon...

389
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,200
Watermelon is good

390
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,200
Are you okay with the watermelon?

391
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,120
Watermelon is good for summer

392
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
Do I look great in this?

393
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,480
Fashion

394
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,120
Not bad

395
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,000
This hat is not bad

396
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,160
It's dirty

397
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,560
Have your time here,
I'm going out for a while

398
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,960
Sit down

399
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,680
Where do you want to go?

400
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,160
This is your house, right?

401
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,800
Understood

402
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,560
I am disturbing you

403
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,240
I'll be leaving here shortly
Is that okay?

404
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,440
It's not like what you think

405
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,600
You got it wrong

406
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,400
What?

407
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,720
How could it be?

408
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,160
Are you saying that
you never live together?

409
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,000
Gu Wei Yi, are you okay?

410
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,480
The green color bed sheet

411
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,480
is not suitable for you

412
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,560
It's fit to me

413
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,680
Look

414
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,280
Is it nice?

415
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,520
Together with the hat

416
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,040
Nice?

417
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,920
Green Light Hero

418
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
The house is just nice

419
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,080
for you two to live together

420
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,720
Fu Pei

421
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,360
Gu Wei Yi, are you feeling shamed?

422
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,400
Don't shame on it

423
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,720
Don't keep it from me as you
guys have been living together

424
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,600
Am I right?

425
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,400
Moreover,

426
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,640
look at Mo Mo

427
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,800
She's so good

428
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,040
It is good to settle down now

429
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,560
Mo Mo, you shouldn't do this to me

430
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,040
How can you

431
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,600
keep it from me as we're good friends?

432
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,240
This is not something you
shall do to your friend

433
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,560
What is our relationship?

434
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,880
What shall we do between friends?

435
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,880
As your best friend,

436
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,760
I shall tell you that

437
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,280
Si Tu Mo,

438
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,680
Gu Wei Yi really suits you

439
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,000
Wish you good in happiness

440
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,680
Alright,

441
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,400
I won't disturb you anymore

442
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,600
I nearly forget that I have
a game in this afternoon

443
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,240
I shall leave first

444
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,640
Gu Wei Yi, Mo Mo

445
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,920
I leave first

446
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,720
Si Tu Mo

447
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,480
It's really look strange that

448
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,560
the plate with no fruit

449
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,400
I'll go and buy some

450
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,320
Si Tu Mo
I'm asking you, what fruits you like?

451
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,040
Watermelon

452
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,200
Watermelon

453
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,120
I like watermelon too

454
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,680
I go and wash the bed sheet

455
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,000
Si Tu Mo

456
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,280
It gets dirty again

457
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,200
Let me see

458
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,520
Painful?

459
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,840
Yes

460
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,960
You can cry it out, it's alright

461
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,240
It's painful, but I don't want to cry

462
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,040
I buy you a band-aid

463
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,870
Young man, this is the last station

464
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,759
Fu Pei, why are you here?

465
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,040
Do you want to be a cleaner?

466
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,600
I'm so sorry, coach

467
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,760
I'm speechless to you

468
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,080
Think about it yourself

469
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,680
You're back?

470
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,040
Why you bought the watermelon?

471
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,360
I bought the watermelon

472
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,680
because the plate was really empty

473
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,440
We wanted to buy watermelon, right?

474
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,800
Thank you

475
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,320
Your hand still painful?

476
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,760
No

477
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,880
You and Fu Pei...

478
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,080
What?

479
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,280
Look like yours is sweeter

480
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,800
I'm hungry

481
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,120
Can the Gastroenteritis
patient eat watermelon?

482
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,520
I can

483
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,800
It's up to you

484
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,720
Do you really like to eat watermelon?

485
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,440
Yes

486
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,840
But you don't look really like it

487
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,120
How about like this?

488
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,280
I like watermelon

489
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,560
more than like you do

490
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,160
Hello

491
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,160
Have you done the report?

492
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,800
It's done

493
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,560
Bring it to office now

494
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,480
Okay

495
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,320
Which is nicer?

496
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,080
This one

497
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,120
All are looking good

498
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,760
My baby is so pretty

499
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,840
No matter how I comb,
you still look pretty

500
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,160
This one, okay?

501
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,360
This is too small

502
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,920
The bigger will look nicer

503
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,800
Pink colour just fits to you

504
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,880
This one?

505
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:41,880
Keep it first

506
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,600
I will comb for you

507
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,960
the most beautiful hairstyle

508
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,320
Hello

509
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,640
What's wrong?

510
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,600
Could you please give me a rubber band?

511
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,560
Sure

512
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,360
This is mine

513
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,200
Sweet heart, you got so many of it

514
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,520
Just give him one, okay?

515
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,240
No

516
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,120
I'm so sorry

517
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,400
She has been spoiled by me

518
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,480
I'll pay RMB10 for one

519
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,320
RMB20

520
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,280
Deal
