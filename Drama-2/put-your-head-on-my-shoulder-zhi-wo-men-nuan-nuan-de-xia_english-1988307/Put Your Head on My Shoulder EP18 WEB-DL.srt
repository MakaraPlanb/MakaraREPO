00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,720
Come on

4
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,640
I'll let you listen it again!

5
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,400
Listen!

[Episode 18]

7
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,560
Is the car arrived? We're almost there

8
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,200
Gu Wei Yi

9
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,600
Why are you coming

10
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,680
without replying my message?

11
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,160
My phone's dead

12
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,160
So-called lovely contrast?

13
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,840
What are you looking at?

14
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,840
Let's go

15
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,320
Are you going to pick
me up in the future?

16
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,240
Yeah

17
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
What if I work overtime?

18
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,080
I'll pick you up

19
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,280
What if it is cold, rains heavily,

20
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,320
flood or typhoon?

21
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,680
I'll pick you up

22
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,240
What's wrong with you?

23
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,320
Is your colleague

24
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
very close to you?

25
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,720
Who? Xu Jie Er?

26
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,000
The man who was hit in the eyes

27
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,320
Lin Zhi Cun

28
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,640
That's special effects makeup

29
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,760
He's the artist of the advertising

30
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,680
So?

31
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,880
What?

32
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,760
Are you two very close?

33
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,440
Is this so hard to answer?

34
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,720
Not bad

35
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,760
We used to have lunch together

36
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,120
What did you eat?

37
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,760
Snails Rice Noodle?

38
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,760
I only eat that with you

39
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,680
You're jealous!

40
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,920
You're jealous!

41
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,040
I want to eat Snails Rice Noodle

42
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,680
No way, it stinks

43
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,840
It doesn't stink

44
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,640
Your Snails Rice Noodle

45
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,560
Where do you want to eat?

46
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,920
Here

47
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,040
This is not healthy

48
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,160
That is not healthy either

49
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,360
If my mom gets to know,

50
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,200
she'll definitely kill us

51
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,240
She invites me

52
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
to visit your hometown

53
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,640
You two always chat?

54
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,600
What did you chat about?

55
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,400
She always asked me about Mah-jong

56
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
and I explained the
logical probability to her

57
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,920
as well as the
arrangement combination

58
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,840
You two really chat, huh?

59
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,560
Can she understand it?

60
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,800
You want to hear it?

61
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,000
No, thanks

62
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,400
What's wrong?

63
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,440
Didn't you say
Snails Rice Noodle stinks?

64
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,840
I'm used to it

65
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,600
Since you're used to it,

66
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,080
try it out then

67
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,520
It's delicious

68
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,520
It stinks, but tasty

69
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,600
Try it out

70
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,560
Delicious?

71
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Eat more then

72
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,120
What if you

73
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,600
put the instant noodle

74
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,440
into the soup of

75
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Snails Rice Noodle?

76
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,640
Forget about it
I'll eat it then

77
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,760
The Snails Rice Noodle is
tastier than the instant noodle

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,320
It doesn't stink

79
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,080
Take it

80
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,440
Thanks for washing the bowl

81
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,720
Thanks for cooking the
Snails Rice Noodle for me

82
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,040
I found you always drink tea at home

83
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,920
Yeah, my father is a tea lover

84
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,800
I used to drink with
him since I was small

85
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,880
My mom told me

86
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,320
you're brought up by your father

87
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,880
My father works for
artifacts restoration

88
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,560
I used to go to his
workshop when I was small

89
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,480
Sometimes, he fixed a bottle

90
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
without saying a word
in a whole afternoon

91
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,880
And he didn't let me talk

92
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,160
I always read "Tell Me Why?" there

93
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,680
No wonder your mom complained to me

94
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,080
that your father made you an oddity

95
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Do I look like oddity?

96
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,680
Yes,

97
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,920
but pretty good

98
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,760
Did your father teach you
how to fix the porcelain?

99
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
I can do the simple one

100
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,560
I should have let you

101
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,040
fix the broken mug

102
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,400
If you see an antique, can you guess

103
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,920
the estimated price at a glance?

104
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,320
No

105
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,120
But I can see the approximate dynasty

106
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,880
Let's go to the museum and
guess the age of the antiques

107
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,199
When do you want to go?

108
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,160
During the winter holiday

109
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,400
You have a winter holiday?

110
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,280
Yeah

111
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,680
I thought I wouldn't
have it for this year

112
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,000
- I never...
-Are you going back to your hometown?

113
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,680
Yeah, I must go home for the new year

114
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,310
When are you going back?

115
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,190
When the holiday starts

116
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,480
My mom has been urging me

117
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,720
Are you going back?

118
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,400
You're going back

119
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,760
Why do I stay here then?

120
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,760
I'll go back to my hometown later

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,200
and come back early

122
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,520
How late and how early?

123
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,280
Don't show me this look

124
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,040
What look did I show you?

125
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,640
I promised you I'd be back there later

126
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,880
But my mom has been pushing me

127
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,560
I'll be back here early

128
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,320
Really

129
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,280
How early?

130
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,000
After the new year

131
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,280
Once they burn the firecrackers

132
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,240
and before it's finished, I'll bring
my luggage out of the house

133
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,960
Tell me when you get on the plane

134
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,000
It's almost the time

135
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,160
Hurry up!

136
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,840
I'm leaving

137
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,640
Gu Wei Yi

138
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,720
Gu Wei Yi...

139
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,920
Hey, move on

140
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,520
I'm in the bus now, what about you?

141
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,680
Be careful

142
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,240
I'm taking off soon too

143
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:41,920
Sir

144
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,400
We're going to take off soon

145
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,360
Please turn off the electronic device

146
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,200
I'm going to off my phone,
tell me when you get there

147
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,080
Alright, have a safe journey

148
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,540
I'm home, what about you?

149
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,620
Are you home yet?

150
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,340
The plane is so slow

151
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,500
Where are you now?
Why didn't you reply me?

152
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,580
Sis, let's dig in

153
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,300
Mom cooked a lot
of your favorite food

154
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,860
Don't we need to wait for sis?

155
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,220
You don't know?

156
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,660
She went on a trip to Thailand

157
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,820
She won't come back for new year

158
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,180
Dad was pissed off

159
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,660
What a carefree life she had!

160
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,140
Oh yeah

161
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,900
Mom said, sis had some cats and dogs

162
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,100
in her house before

163
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,260
Where are they?

164
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,820
I sold it all to my classmates

165
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,340
I thought mom said dad liked it

166
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,820
We secretly sold it

167
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,020
when dad was away to work

168
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,100
Dad wanted to buy it back,

169
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,820
but my classmate refused

170
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,860
Dad even offered a higher price

171
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,780
Then, my classmate double up the price

172
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,020
and dad finally left

173
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,780
Where's the money then?

174
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:04,940
Let's eat

175
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,540
You're really something

176
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,380
I'm home

177
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,500
I'm ready to have dinner
with my parents

178
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,780
Take the drumstick

179
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,620
Mom, it's alright

180
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,420
I can't finish it

181
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,860
Eat slowly then

182
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,940
You seldom

183
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,180
eat delicious food at outside

184
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,020
No

185
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,020
Come on

186
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,220
You have to eat more
for building up your body

187
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,740
Mom, give it to sis

188
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,540
Don't give it to me

189
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,500
I'll give you this too

190
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,780
What do I eat then?

191
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
You have a fatty liver,
shouldn't eat meat

192
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,100
I'm eating too

193
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,300
Are you happy?

194
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,020
So much, can you finish it?

195
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,660
What do you want to eat for dinner?

196
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,060
Anything

197
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,180
Do you want to go to my workshop?

198
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,700
I have collected a porcelain which

199
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,820
was broken to more than 10 pieces

200
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,860
Are you interested in it?

201
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,980
He's just home

202
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,460
He should have some good food

203
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,220
Why do you bring him to your workshop?

204
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,500
I want to go

205
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,580
I can't finish the food

206
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,260
Dad, what are you doing?

207
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,340
I want to eat the meat

208
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,420
No way

209
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,660
Eat the bitter gourd

210
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,300
Eat the bitter gourd

211
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,020
It's not easy

212
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,060
That's why it's challenging

213
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:40,900
How?

214
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,140
Do you want to fix it with me?

215
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,780
Let's dig in

216
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,180
Mom, you eat first

217
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,860
Dad and I will eat later

218
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,980
Honey

219
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,260
Let's dig in first

220
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,900
Okay

221
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,180
That's right

222
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,820
Eating on time is good for health

223
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,580
Xiao Yi

224
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,020
Don't learn from your dad

225
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,580
He care about nothing when he works

226
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,820
Moreover, you have an hypoglycemia

227
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,300
You must take care of your health

228
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,060
I'm thinking

229
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,780
if someone can take
care of you one day

230
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,340
-If...
-That's enough

231
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,980
Just cut it out

232
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,900
Xiao Yi is busy in scientific research

233
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,860
He has no time to think about it

234
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,340
Let's don't be so vulgar

235
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,340
Only think whether
our son is going to marry

236
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,700
or having a baby or not

237
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,700
We should think

238
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,260
about his ambition,

239
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,180
happiness

240
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,500
and the goal

241
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,300
of his life

242
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,500
He is...

243
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,100
All right, stop it

244
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,180
Professor Gu, this is a family dinner

245
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,140
You don't have

246
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,020
to talk about the philosophies

247
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,060
You're depriving me of speaking

248
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,420
Well, continue your talk then

249
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,780
Don't eat

250
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,740
Dig in

251
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,980
Xiao Yi, dig in

252
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,900
Xiao Yi, eat more

253
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,620
There's no way out of there

254
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,140
But every cloud has a silver lining

255
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,500
Finally, we managed
to restore the artwork

256
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,100
to the original

257
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,620
Congratulation! Mr. Gu

258
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,180
It's finally done

259
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,060
Oh, my goodness

260
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:12,980
Video call

261
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,380
Si Tu Mo, I can't see you

262
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,380
I know

263
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,940
You can see me, but I can't see you

264
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,780
It's not fair

265
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,060
I'm afraid that I'm too pretty

266
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,700
and it will break your screen

267
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,580
What's that look on your face?

268
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,340
You must believe it

269
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,580
I'm wearing a sling sleepwear now

270
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,820
It's very sexy

271
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,820
I'm afraid that you can't hold it

272
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,900
Mo!

273
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,020
Do you have any cloth to wash?

274
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,100
No

275
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,660
Look at your pants

276
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,220
You have been wearing it for a week

277
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,020
Don't you want to wash it?

278
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,380
Look at your hair

279
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,740
It is so oily

280
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,740
Even the flies and

281
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,060
the mosquitoes will slip on it

282
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,740
Hurry up go to bath!

283
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,500
What kind of sin
I committed in the past?

284
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,100
How could I have a
lazy daughter like you?

285
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,100
You're such a big girl

286
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,380
I really can't hold it

287
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,260
Xiao Yi

288
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,340
You can't eat too many mantis prawn

289
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,060
How did I educate you
when you're small?

290
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,860
Don't be choosy about food

291
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,700
Moderate and don't eat too much

292
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,500
It's alright, honey

293
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,300
It's new year now

294
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,940
Let him eat whatever he wants

295
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,300
Xiao Yi, eat more

296
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,580
I thought you have an allergy

297
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,020
to mantis prawn

298
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,620
Last time when we had dinner

299
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,540
with Si Tu...

300
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,300
Who's Si Tu?

301
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,620
My friend's daughter

302
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,580
She's living with Xiao Yi now

303
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,500
What?

304
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,260
Xiao Yi lives with a girl?

305
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,820
How come I don't know?

306
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,300
You are busy with the broken

307
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,140
bottles, tanks and jar every day

308
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,260
Of course you don't know

309
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,100
That's crap!

310
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,740
It's terrible mess!

311
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,820
A man and a woman together

312
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,500
will cause suspicious

313
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,420
You should avoid it!

314
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,220
Alright

315
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,740
Don't scold during the new year

316
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,140
What's wrong with you?

317
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,540
Do you know

318
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,700
what's flat share?

319
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,740
The girl and Xiao Yi

320
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,900
are sharing a house

321
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,380
Moreover,

322
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,980
she's polite and

323
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,580
understanding

324
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,940
She's pretty too

325
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,660
I think...

326
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,300
It has nothing to do with Xiao Yi
no matter how good is she

327
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,540
She's not Xiao Yi's girlfriend anyway

328
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,380
They are not in love

329
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,100
Yes

330
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,540
You see

331
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,780
No matter how good is she,

332
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,100
it has nothing to do with Xiao Yi

333
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,140
Well...

334
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,620
Since the girl is living there...

335
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,860
Wait

336
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,420
Son

337
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,740
You said "Yes"

338
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,420
I feel like

339
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,340
you and Si Tu already...

340
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,940
We're already in love

341
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:23,980
Sis

342
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,980
Give me one!

343
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,700
Mom, sis bullies me

344
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,660
Mom, scold her

345
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,180
Watch out

346
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,140
Don't fight with your brother

347
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,020
Go over there

348
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:52,660
Hello

349
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,180
Hello

350
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,860
We are having firework here

351
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,060
What about you?

352
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,100
Let me see

353
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,020
Can you hear the fireworks?

354
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,700
Listen it!

355
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,900
Hear it?

356
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,980
Yes

357
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,900
Do you have nice fireworks there?

358
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,220
Nice

359
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,900
I'll let you listen
to the firework again

360
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,820
Listen

361
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,660
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

362
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,700
"The sky of glowing starlight"

363
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,700
"Melt me into your eyes"

364
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,500
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

365
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,500
"It's all I miss"

366
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,300
"Shoulder to shoulder
with the touching moment"

367
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,420
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

368
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,380
"Despite the changing of world"

369
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,300
"Still holding each others hand"

370
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,940
Look, the firework is so beautiful!

371
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
It's colorful

372
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,420
Yeah

373
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,260
It's wonderful

374
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,580
It would be nice to
enjoy it with Si Tu Mo

375
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:11,929
[Half a month later...]

376
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,660
No one answering it

377
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,020
Si Tu Mo

378
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,220
Here I am

379
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,020
Why didn't you answer the phone?

380
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,340
I was skateboarding

381
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,780
It's dangerous to answer the phone

382
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,980
I am skateboarding

383
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,940
How did you learn it in a sudden?

384
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,460
It's just a sudden

385
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,260
It's just a sudden?

386
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,420
Yes, do I look awesome?

387
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
Well

388
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,580
How do you

389
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,020
take my luggage with skateboarding?

390
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,460
It's okay

391
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,500
I'll hold the skateboard

392
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,060
Are you sure?

393
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,380
I think I can

394
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,180
Take it

395
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,940
Let's go

396
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,500
Heavy?

397
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,540
Let me take it

398
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,620
-I'll hold the skateboard
-No need

399
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,260
Give it to me

400
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,460
I can do it

401
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,700
Okay

402
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,580
What a good maintenance!

403
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,700
They have even changed

404
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,940
the dustbin after the winter holiday

405
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,180
Let me hold your bag

406
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,820
I'll hold the luggage
and you hold my hand

407
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,260
It's more romantic

408
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,580
Gu Wei Yi

409
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,220
I wanted to hold it,

410
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,060
but you refused

411
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:27,580
Let me do it

412
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,620
Give it to me

413
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:36,900
Let's go

414
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,740
Finally, we're home

415
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,220
I'll hold the luggage

416
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,860
and you hold my hand

417
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,220
It's more romantic

418
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,460
Forget about it

419
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,500
Where did you learn all this?

420
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,940
I didn't learn it

421
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,820
Gu Wei Yi

422
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,860
What's wrong?

423
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,780
Give me back my luggage

424
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,260
Gu Wei Yi

425
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,260
Give me a hug

426
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,940
Gu Wei Yi

427
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,620
You're romantic

428
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,300
Thank you

429
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,460
Si Tu Mo

430
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,580
I miss you very much

431
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,780
I thought it was Senior Lu

432
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,500
I'm your senior too

433
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,820
But you never respect me

434
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:36,860
You can't decide

435
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,780
whether I can go to
Heidelberg University or not

436
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,060
If I'm not going,

437
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,220
you'll be able to go then

438
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,700
You're not going?

439
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,500
Of course I'll go

440
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,220
Gu Wei Yi, you'd better don't go

441
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,540
You're just in love, aren't you?

442
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,660
You have no time for it

443
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,140
Senior Lu

444
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,380
Morning

445
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,420
This is my lab report
for last semester

446
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,460
Why did you give it to me?

447
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,340
I didn't join

448
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,580
your experiment in last semester

449
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,380
I know

450
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,460
I just want you to see

451
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,060
the quality of my lab report

452
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,980
I've seen it

453
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,900
I've seen all your lab reports

454
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,300
Gu Wei Yi's reports
are better than yours

455
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,060
You should refer more about his report

456
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,500
Professor Jiang

457
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,700
Are Gu Wei Yi's reports
better than mine?

458
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,260
Yu Yin

459
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,100
Look at here

460
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,300
and here

461
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,780
See it?

462
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,660
Yes

463
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,820
Right?

464
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,820
It's true

465
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:49,860
Mo Mo

466
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,460
Jie Er

467
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,260
Submit 2 proposals to me

468
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,260
before the coming weekend

469
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,060
Okay

470
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,700
We need it in CDR format

471
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,500
I used PS

472
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,780
Me too

473
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,420
Can you convert the format?

474
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,100
Do I look like that smart?

475
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,420
I'll go home and study it tonight then

476
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,940
Teach me when you're done

477
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,620
Professor

478
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,540
Why does Zhou Lei act like a child

479
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,220
but no one's ever corrected him?

480
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,340
Don't you think Zhou Lei is funny?

481
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,420
I don't think so

482
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,700
In my observation,

483
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,900
Gu Wei Yi's level is much
higher than Zhou Lei

484
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,660
It's unnecessary for us

485
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,300
to give them the exam

486
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,660
You don't understand Zhou Lei

487
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,300
The examination is a must

488
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,860
I don't understand

489
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,100
Why do we have to do

490
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,260
the useless thing just
to comfort his emotion?

491
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,820
This is the fairness that
I must give it to them

492
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,580
But you don't know,

493
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,500
the two guys're so
excited about the exam

494
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,180
So,

495
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,780
just treat it as their benefit

496
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,460
But there are many questions

497
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,140
of calculation in the paper

498
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,900
It's more beneficial to Zhou Lei

499
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,300
who's from math school

500
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,780
You don't understand Gu Wei Yi either

501
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:36,900
Thank you

502
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,100
Welcome

503
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,100
Are you going to the lab?

504
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,420
I want to get something

505
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,220
I'll open the door for you

506
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,180
Thank you

507
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,740
You have something here?

508
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,820
I'll check if all the
equipment are closed

509
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,980
Is this a hand dynamo?

510
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,460
You made it yourself?

511
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,420
I did it long time ago

512
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,820
There's always been
a blackout at my home

513
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,860
I want to improve it and bring it back

514
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,020
When I went to your house,

515
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,540
you two haven't in love yet

516
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,820
Why did you suddenly fall in love?

517
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,420
I wanted to be in love for a long time

518
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,020
What are you doing?

519
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,740
What brings you here?

520
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,740
Xie Yu Yin

521
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,060
Are you giving tips to Gu Wei Yi?

522
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,900
Do you think he needs it?

523
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,780
You're right

524
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,180
What are you doing here?

525
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,980
We just chatted about his girlfriend

526
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,380
I'm leaving first

527
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,580
Remember to lock the door

528
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,660
Gu Wei Yi

529
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,460
Why did Xie Yu Yin ask
about your girlfriend?

530
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,540
Why does everyone

531
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,140
care so much about your girlfriend?

532
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,700
They don't even care about me

533
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,420
The seminar of Heidelberg University

534
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,980
makes me can't eat

535
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:16,820
and sleep well

536
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,660
What about you?

537
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,780
I'm okay

538
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,060
The man in love is really different

539
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,420
What did you do when you're in love?

540
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,620
Doing math questions?

541
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,380
We did whatever we
should do in a relationship

542
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,020
You've done all of it?

543
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,100
No

544
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,540
Don't be ashamed

545
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,740
We're all adults

546
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,620
You are living with Si Tu Mo

547
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,780
You can do everything easily

548
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,580
Tell me about it

549
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,860
I'm leaving

550
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,020
Remember to lock the door

551
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,140
Why would everyone
remind me to lock the door?

552
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,180
Gu Wei Yi, let's dig in

553
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,460
Gu Wei Yi

554
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,980
Gu Wei Yi

555
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,180
Gu Wei Yi

556
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:14,339
I'm here

557
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,180
There's a blackout

558
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,100
I turned off the switch

559
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,900
This is my hand dynamo

560
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,130
We won't need to be afraid
of blackout in the future

561
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,860
You made it yourself? How?

562
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,130
The conductor coil

563
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,530
rotates in the magnetic field

564
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,180
makes the magnetic flux

565
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,340
kept on changing constantly

566
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,260
It forms alternating
current in the wire

567
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,980
The faster the flux changes,

568
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,260
the greater the voltage

569
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,180
The greater voltage can
produce greater current

570
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,260
as well as the brightness of the light

571
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,900
How bright is that?

572
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,500
Don't tell me

573
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,620
it's the brightest now

00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,100
This hand dynamo

575
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,380
was just my preliminary experiment

576
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,420
I'm sure it can achieve the brightness

577
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,860
of normal lighting after improvement

578
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,420
It's twinkling

579
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,780
and you have to generate it by hands

580
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,100
But,

581
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,260
it can't beat the light of my phone

582
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,020
I'm not saying you're not good

583
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,300
You're really...

584
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,300
I'll improve it

00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,460

586
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,060
I'll switch it on

587

00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,980

Any can tell me

597
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,220
how to convert PS into CDR?

598
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,140

00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,580
Try to drag it

602
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,940
into the layer you want

603
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,300
I've tried it out, it isn't useful

604
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,420
I know

605
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,780
What's the matter?

606
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,660
Help me!

607
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,940
I don't know why

608
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,300
I can't fill the color

609
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,980

610
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,540
Let me see

611
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,580
How? Can you do it?

612
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,940
Of course

613
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,580
Will it take a long time?

614
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,660
Don't know, I'll try

615
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,540
You can sit in my bed and wait

616
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,020
Tell me after you convert it

617
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,820
I'll wait in my room

618
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,460
What are you afraid of?

619
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,980
I don't afraid

620
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,580
Why don't you dare to sit here then?

621
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,940
Says who?

622
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,700
Sleep for a while if you're sleepy

623
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,540
I'll tell you when it's done

624
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,780
Will it take a long time?

625
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,380
I'll try my best

Make sure you call me

629
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,340
Okay

630
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,860

631
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,540
