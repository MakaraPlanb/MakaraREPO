I'm craving for it

199
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,860
Let's go buy some

200
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:55,620
Let's go

201
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,500
Boss, how long will it take?

202
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,740
It will be ready in 3 minutes

203
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,900
I have never expected

204
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,100
to see the snow again
in South City in my life time

205
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,340
I saw it for the first time

206
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,180
when I was in the kindergarten

207
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:31,820
What a pity

208
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,380
it melts when it falls onto the ground

209
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,060
I wish to make a snowman

210
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,660
Gu Wei Yi, you came from the North

211
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,220
Have you made a snowman before?

212
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,020
Yeah

213
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,980
I have never seen a real snowman

214
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,700
If only I had a chance

215
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,580
to see a snowman in real

216
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,700
Boss, it seems you make a big
money during the snowy days

217
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:01,740
Yeah

218
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,500
My hot chestnuts

219
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,740
are made for such cold weather

220
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,420
Alright, I'll pack for you

221
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,340
Don't take so much, I can't finish it

222
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,260
Sure you can

223
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,220
Your are wearing too little

224
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,940
Take more and

225
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,220
hold it in your hands to make you warm

226
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,380
Thank you

227
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,500
You're welcome

228
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,140
It's okay, I'm not cold

229
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,020
RMB 20

230
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,340
Take it

231
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:34,780
Here

232
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,180
Okay

233
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,060
Thank you

234
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,540
Take it

235
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,540
Wait a moment

236
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,380
Thank you

237
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,860
So cold

238
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,700
It's damn cold

239
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,100
What is that?

240
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,740
When did you buy them?

241
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,020
So smart

242
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,900
I saw the notice

243
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,380
on my way out this morning

244
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,580
Forgot to tell you

245
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,340
Warming patch with Doraemon

246
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,700
I have never seen it

247
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,060
I don't know

248
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,180
I simply bought it

249
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,460
You like Doraemon too?

250
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,700
I saw you draw one

251
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,900
on your note

252
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,260
Light up the candles

253
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,820
Have you successfully confessed?

254
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,500
No

255
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,460
Why?

256
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,100
Why

257
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,140
She doesn't get it

258
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:43,927
[Professor Jiang]

259
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,940
Gu Wei Yi, how come she doesn't get it?

260
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,220
It's so simple

261
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,500
That's right

262
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,300
Schrodinger Equation is about the particles

263
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,620
Particles stand for the
structure of everything

264
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,780
You are telling her

265
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,860
she is the structure of your everything

266
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,460
And you said when multiplying it by time,

267
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,049
it will be a complete wave function

268
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,290
It means

269
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,219
she makes

270
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,419
your life more complete

271
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,860
It's so simple and romantic

272
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,940
How can she not get it?

273
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,010
Did she pretend it purposely?

274
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:24,860
Why are you two staying together?

275
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,340
We're doing an experiment

276
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,290
I'm not like you

277
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,380
Xiao Gu

278
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,900
What field is she studying?

279
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:55,940
Xiao Gu

280
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,420
What field is she studying?

281
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,460
Accounting

282
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,220
What about you write it in Math?

283
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,300
Well...

284
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,980
She will understand then

285
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,700
Si Tu Mo

286
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,100
Have you learned Further Math?

287
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,860
Yes

288
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,100
What is this?

289
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,220
Solve it

290
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,100
Did I annoy you today?

291
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,060
What's wrong?

292
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,780
Why did you keep

293
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
insulting my IQ?

294
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,900
Don't trouble me with

295
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,580
science again

296
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,620
Did she solve it?

297
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,620
I never expect you're so romantic

298
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,380
I would say yes if I were a girl

299
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,780
She didn't solve it but got mad

300
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,700
I think she doesn't like you

301
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,900
Better forget it

302
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,500
Don't listen to Zhou Lei

303
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,420
I guess this is indirect for her

304
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,740
Learn it from me

305
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,180
Lower your level to match up with her

306
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,900
Use the poem I wrote to my wife

307
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,780
Wind of Autumn, blooming of flowers

308
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,500
As if we meet each other again

309
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,500
Straight to the point

310
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,460
Si Tu Mo

311
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,740
What?

312
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,860
Wind of Autumn, blooming of flowers

313
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,540
As if we meet each other again

314
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,460
How's that?

315
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,820
Wind of Autumn, blooming of flowers

316
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,540
As if we meet each other again

317
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,540
I've only heard of this

318
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,180
Wind of Autumn

319
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,500
Yummy crabs

320
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,820
It is nicer when you add chillies

321
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,780
Forget it, I go to bed now

322
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,700
I'm the one who should be angry

323
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,540
Rascal!

324
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,620
I think she doesn't like you

325
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,700
Better forget it

326
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,860
"The difficulties in the books"

327
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,500
"are not a problem"

328
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,460
"All the puzzles come with axiom"

329
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:05,540
"I thought I have the perfect logic"

330
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,860
"Now I find no solution"

331
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,740
"That's how"

332
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,740
"you came into my heart"

333
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,420
"Sweet and childish"

334
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,820
"Nothing can describe your smile"

335
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,300
"You bring me courage"

336
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,420
"Put your head on my shoulder"

337
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,940
"Pass over the seasons hand-in-hand"

338
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,740
"The youth marks my
heartbeat and feeling"

339
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,780
"Our love is passionate"

340
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:59,820
"Never fade"

341
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:22,300
"Put your head on my shoulder"

342
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,620
"Pass over the seasons hand-in-hand"

343
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,540
"The youth marks my
heartbeat and feeling"

344
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,500
"Our love is passionate"

345
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,260
"Never fade"

346
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:03,780
Gu Wei Yi

347
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,980
How was it?

348
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,060
You didn't reply our message

349
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,820
You made it?

350
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,140
How was it?

351
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,340
Wait

352
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,060
Did you use the direct way

353
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,380
which I have told you?

354
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,140
Yes, I did

355
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,220
Wind of Autumn

356
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,100
She said, yummy crabs

357
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,140
Yummy crabs?

358
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,380
Impossible

359
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,580
Was she playing dumb?

360
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,940
Professor Jiang

361
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,060
The girl doesn't like him

362
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,900
Impossible

363
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:40,900
Professor

364
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:42,940
Here you are

365
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,620
Feeling better?

366
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,660
I'm alright

367
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,460
That's good

368
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,140
You're not fully recovered

369
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:48,700
You'd better

370
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,460
stay away from me,
I don't want to be infected

371
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,980
I don't want to be near you

372
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:55,900
It's too bad

373
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,140
You shouldn't come as you're sick

374
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,260
Do you want everybody to get infected?

375
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,460
Never care about other's feeling

376
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,180
Don't worry

377
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,620
Human flu

378
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,460
can't infect you

379
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,100
Xie Yu Yin

380
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,260
Why are you fighting

381
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,500
in the early morning?

382
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,620
Do your work

383
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,620
What's wrong with you?

384
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,900
You are responsible to check

385
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,900
the mailbox this week

386
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,260
I have checked it out

387
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,140
and forwarded it to Miss Sha Sha

388
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,180
It's not like I can make her read it

389
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,620
Why didn't you send

390
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,580
a cc copy to Miss Li Na?

391
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,300
I thought Miss Sha Sha
would read it

392
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,140
Forget it, we've taken the blame already

393
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,420
No point to argue anymore

394
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,820
I'll check the mailbox from today on

395
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,220
Come on. I'll be more careful in the future

396
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,820
I'm hungry, let's eat something

397
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,940
I haven't done it

398
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:03,940
I knew

399
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,100
Let's go for a meal first

400
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,580
Alright

401
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,660
I want to go for a hot pot

402
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,580
We don't have time

403
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,260
Where did you learn

404
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:14,980
the unfriendly tone?

405
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,900
From my room-mate

406
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,780
Which room-mate?

407
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,700
It's almost lunch time now

408
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,300
Take a rest

409
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,340
and continue after lunch

410
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,100
Okay

411
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,060
Which canteen? 1st or 2nd?

412
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,500
2nd, they are selling claypot rice there

413
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,140
I like it the most

414
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,620
Gu Wei Yi?

415
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,940
I'll pass, enjoy yourselves

416
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,780
What's wrong with you??

417
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:44,820
Nothing

418
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,300
Are you having a fever?

419
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,300
So hot

420
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,580
He's burning

421
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,260
He's burning!

422
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,340
Oh, my god!

423
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,900
Let's go to the hospital

424
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,420
I'm okay

425
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,660
No, you must go to the hospital

426
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,700
I'm leaving first

427
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,340
Or else the claypot rice
will be out of stock

428
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,180
I just need to take a rest

429
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:37,860
Gu Wei Yi

430
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:39,780
Gu Wei Yi

431
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,660
Gu Wei Yi

432
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,620
Gu Wei Yi, get up

433
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,420
Finish the food

434
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,180
You'll get hypoglycemia
if you eat nothing

435
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,020
Take it

436
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:53,900
Take it

437
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,580
No food allowed in the lab

438
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,500
I don't care

439
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,460
I bought it for you

440
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,180
Quickly dig in

441
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,540
Don't move

442
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,180
I've applied for leave for you

443
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,020
Quickly go home after lunch

444
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,900
I said I have applied for leave for you

445
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,540
Quickly go home after lunch

446
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,700
I'm not that serious

447
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,620
I want to chase senior out too

448
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,020
You two are mobile virus

449
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,500
I...

450
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:27,940
Don't move

451
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,940
Stay away from me

452
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,420
Getting better?

453
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,300
Much better

454
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,780
I bring some medicine for you

455
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,420
Thank you

456
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,020
I just met Zhou Lei

457
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,140
Radiation protection suit?

458
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,980
He has

459
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,100
a sharp tongue, but kind

460
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,780
He even let you have the last

461
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,620
claypot rice

462
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,060
and applied for leave for me

463
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,100
He urged me to go home quickly

464
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,660
For me too

465
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,820
Go! Go!

466
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:08,780
Hurry up!

467
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,660
How did you play?

468
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,300
Sorry, bro

469
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,540
He's in a bad mood

470
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,260
Forget it

471
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,140
Calm down

472
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,460
Wang Shan is watching

473
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,340
Don't scare her

474
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,060
Didn't you see he hit my hand?

475
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,980
This is normal in games, right?

476
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,660
You used to be pushed when
you tried to score a goal

477
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,100
But you didn't get mad

478
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,540
I was timid before

479
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,420
Okay?

480
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,300
So you have the nerve now, huh?

481
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,740
What's wrong?

482
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,220
Something's wrong with him recently

483
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,020
I don't know who's eating him

484
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,340
He refused to tell

485
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,540
Please comfort him

486
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,260
Go for a date!

487
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:54,940
Let's go

488
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:55,620
Okay

489
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,140
Come on

490
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,260
Forget it

491
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:21,740
Let's go

492
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:20,860
Miss Li Na

493
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,820
Why are we buying so much juice?

494
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,620
This is my personal habit

495
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,060
I'll compare the product of our project

496
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,340
to the other of the same kind

497
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,100
It doesn't help much,

498
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,860
but it could inspire your mind

499
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,420
Shall we bring it back to the office

500
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,820
and taste together with the others?

501
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,660
You live nearby?

502
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,380
Yes

503
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,900
Bring the info and juice to your home

504
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,500
Make a report after analysis

505
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,060
Can save you some time

506
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,980
I drink it all alone?

507
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:49,900
Any problem?

508
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,180
No

509
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,100
Pay then

510
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:53,820
Okay

511
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,180
My god!

512
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:56,980
I...

513
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,260
Did I leave the key in the office?

514
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,540
Hello

515
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,420
What's wrong with your voice?

516
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,820
Fever

517
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,340
How come?

518
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,020
Taken any medicine?

519
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,380
Seen a doctor?
Where are you?

520
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,380
I didn't see any doctor

521
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:09,299
or take any medicine

522
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,500
At home

523
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
Do you have medicine at home?

524
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:16,820
No

525
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,259
Wait a moment, I'll be right there

526
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:19,930
Okay

527
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:56,659
Why are you here?

528
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,260
Zhou Lei chased me out of the lab

529
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,220
I saw your unfinished report

530
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,500
So I bring it to you

531
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,980
and see your condition

532
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,500
How did you know my address?

533
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,180
Zhou Lei told me

534
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,780
What's wrong? You don't want to see me?

535
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:14,900
Come in

536
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,620
Shall I change my shoes?

537
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,460
It's alright

538
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,100
Have a seat, I'll bring you water

539
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:30,940
Let me do it

540
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,140
You're sick

541
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:32,940
Have a seat

542
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,140
Let me open the door

543
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,140
It's heavy

544
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:52,820
I...

545
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:18,820
Have some water

546
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:19,820
Thank you

547
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:21,740
Take the medicine

548
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,460
Have some water first

549
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,500
I gave you the medicine in the morning

550
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,400
Will it harm you if you take it again?

551
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,180
I forgot to bring it back

552
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,860
Hurry up take the medicine

553
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,060
Later

554
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,860
Gu Wei Yi

555
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:55,820
Take the medicine

556
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,740
So, are you staying together

557
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,940
because of your parents?

558
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,780
My mother and his mother were classmates

559
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,060
What a coincidence!

560
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,220
Done

561
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,580
So fast

562
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,340
I shall go back

563
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,620
I'll walk you out

564
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,540
Gu Wei Yi

565
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,780
Are you sick

566
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,220
because you get infected by me?

567
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,300
If so,

568
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,580
you'd better go to the hospital

569
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,060
as my condition was quite serious

570
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,140
It's alright

571
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,060
I'm leaving first

572
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,460
Bye

573
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,780
Take care

574
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:11,820
See you

575
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,100
Why did you buy so much juice?

576
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:20,940
Testing

577
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:21,740
Leave it to me

578
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,060
You want to take a rest, don't you?

579
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,180
Where to put it?

580
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,020
In the fridge

581
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,780
Do it yourself

582
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,260
So strange

583
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,420
Open it for me

584
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:46,740
Open it yourself

585
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,220
What's wrong?

586
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,180
Put it in the freezer

587
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,540
How do I drink if it's frozen?

588
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,980
No more space in the cooler

589
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,420
What's this?

590
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:05,660
Branch?

591
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,180
I don't know, I go to bed first

592
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,020
Branch, wolfberries and a leaf

593
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,020
What's this?

594
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,420
I bought it?

595
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,540
Can't remember

596
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,100
Hello, Mo Mo

597
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,300
Hello, Shan Shan

598
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,740
What should I cook

599
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,820
for a person who has a fever?

600
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,060
Porridge

601
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,260
Who has a fever?

602
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,380
Gu Wei Yi

603
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,740
My mom used to cook in this way

604
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,300
First, wash the rice

605
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,460
Put little oil

606
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,900
and salt into the rice

607
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,660
Then, boil the water

608
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,780
Put dried tangerine peel 

609
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,020
in cold water and boil it

610
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,460
Put the rice in after it's boiled

611
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,300
When the water bubbled up again,

612
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,980
turn it to medium or low heat

613
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,780
Make sure it doesn't stick to the pot

614
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,460
When it's almost done,

615
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,500
take out the peel

616
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,780
Forget it, let him starve to death

617
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,980
He doesn't need the porridge anyway

618
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,660
It sounds complicated

619
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,260
In fact, it's simple

620
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,740
Come and help me

621
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:28,860
Okay

622
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,220
See you in a bit

623
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Don't pretend sleeping. Gu Wei Yi is sick

624
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,700
Not my concern

625
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,660
Don't you want to visit him?

626
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,780
Don't you want to go to his house?

627
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,620
Mo Mo doesn't want to see me

628
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,980
I went to see her a few days ago

629
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,420
She told me not to turn up again

630
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,980
That's why you're
getting mad in the court?

631
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,140
Have you guys made it clear?

632
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,820
She didn't give me a chance

633
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,980
Alright, I'll bring you there

634
00:41:11,403 --> 00:41:13,403
[Here comes the Easter egg...]

635
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,900
In girl's view, what should

636
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,460
a sexy boy look like?

637
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,740
The answer might surprise you

638
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,380
First, hair

639
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,260
Among the girls whom I've interviewed,

640
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,180
hair style is their main concern

641
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,860
Mind your hair style

642
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,540
Hair style is not only

643
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,660
important for actors

644
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,460
You hair look like a toilet lid

645
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:49,860
Handsome!

646
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,380
Which hair style do you like?

647
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,020
This one?

648
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,140
This is not suitable for you

649
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,380
I want it exactly the same

650
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,980
You need to have a perm then

651
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:07,780
A perm?

652
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,380
Yes

653
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,180
Direct Current or Alternating Current?

654
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,860
Of course Alternating Current

655
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,060
Otherwise, I can't do it

656
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:13,620
Right?

657
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,900
It's really not suitable for you

658
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,340
I'm okay

659
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,140
Okay

660
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,060
Thank you

661
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,300
Let me make you another hair style

662
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,380
It's alright

663
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,780
Get another one

664
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:48,980
You'll spoil my reputation

665
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,260
if you go out like this

666
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,620
You'll break my name

667
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,940
It's alright

668
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,740
No way

669
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,100
Let me make you another one

670
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,500
Come on

671
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,060
Very fast

672
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,380
I'll make a new hair style for you
