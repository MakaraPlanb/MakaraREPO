[Episode 1]

3
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,480
RMB 10?

4
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
Hello

5
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,360
Did I wake you up?

6
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,880
No

7
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,880
I awoke earlier

8
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,240
I am going to fetch you now

9
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm waiting for you at downstairs

10
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,840
I'm Si Tu Mo

11
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,560
I'm a senior student

12
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,080
of Accounting,

13
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,760
but I wanted to work in advertising

14
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,240
So, I have yet to get a job

15
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,920
This is Fu Pei

16
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,720
He is my

17
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,600
good friend

18
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,720
You're arrived

19
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,760
Let's go

20
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,600
I always think that

21
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,800
our relationship will be closer one day

22
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,920
So I'm waiting for the day to come

23
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,360
Unexpectedly,...

24
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,280
You...

25
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,760
You?

26
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,520
Are you okay?

27
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,800
I'm okay

28
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,520
I have a swift response

29
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,480
I'm not asking you

30
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,680
Mo Mo, are you okay?

31
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,520
Quickly get up

32
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,360
We are rushing

33
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,520
Are you okay?

34
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,880
Are you rushing?

35
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,120
I...

36
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,320
It's alright

37
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,000
Mo Mo, come on

38
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,080
We will be late

39
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,360
Come on

40
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,400
Let's go

41
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,160
Next, Zhang Tao

42
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,840
What's wrong?

43
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,720
We're in the cyber cafe, come on

44
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,040
I am unable to go there

45
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,320
Do you still remember the girl

46
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,240
who teamed up with us that day?

47
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,680
Who?

48
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,000
She's an excellent player

49
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,040
who has a nice voice

50
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,400
She beat you down, right?

51
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,440
That's right

52
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,480
She promised to give me her WeChat ID

53
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,720
if I win for 3 times

54
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,600
It has nothing to do with me

55
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,360
I can't beat her down

56
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,440
I'm looking for you to help me

57
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,800
No, I'm not going

58
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,960
I'll give you all the equipment

59
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,920
Take my words

60
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,840
Okay, wait a moment

61
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,520
Mo Mo

62
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,720
Let me

63
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,000
buy you a dress

64
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
You're so kind

65
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,120
I'll go now

66
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,040
Go

67
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,120
Next, Si Tu Mo

68
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,400
Hey

69
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,800
May I borrow a pen from you?

70
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,520
Please
Okay

71
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,400
Okay, stop talking

72
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,240
Prepare for your exam

73
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,760
Please take out your student
card and admission ticket

74
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
and put it on the table

75
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,640
Please introduce yourself

76
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,120
Hello, I'm Si Tu Mo

77
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm a senior student of Accounting
in the University of South

78
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,760
I would like to do my practical

79
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,200
in your good office

80
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,760
You're from Accounting background

81
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,560
Why are you here
for advertising's practical?

82
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,640
I like advertising

83
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,920
My family registered the
course for me

84
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,440
as they thought it's easier
to get a job in Accounting

85
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,360
But after I studied in the university,

86
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,880
I found that I was
much prefer advertising

87
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,160
and I have learned advertising too

88
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,320
I read a lot of books of creativity

89
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,640
Such as Ogilvy's creatives

90
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,480
I also audited advertising's
class in the university

91
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,480
The lecturer said I'm
suitable to learn advertising

92
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,080
I hope you will give me a chance

93
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,560
to learn more in advertising

94
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,600
Did you bring any creative artwork

95
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
for our reference?

96
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,080
Either image or text

97
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,280
Yes

98
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,680
I have completed a creative artwork

99
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,480
when I was in the university

100
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,440
Quantum force? A Genius game?

101
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,920
What kind of advertising is this?

102
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,800
Well

103
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,520
It's an advertising of game

104
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,320
Gu Wei Yi

105
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,400
You should know that

106
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,400
our company stress on reverence

107
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,440
We respect our client and the creativity

108
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,760
Your image

109
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,720
and the artwork you showed us

110
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,960
made us think that

111
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,280
you are not serious for the interview

112
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,040
Let's don't waste our time

113
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,440
I'm so sorry

114
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,680
I'm so sorry

115
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,920
I'm so sorry

116
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Gu Wei Yi

117
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,560
Are you here for the exam too?

118
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,600
It seems it is a valued exam

119
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,600
Sir

120
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,240
I didn't bring my pass
because some reason

121
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,840
Can I sit for the exam first?

122
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,440
Well,

123
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,200
I can't help on this

124
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,480
Many pupils wanted
to join Professor Jiang's class

125
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,760
Although

126
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,960
everybody knows you,

127
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
but you must hold the pass

128
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,200
I will get someone to send it to me now

129
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,600
Can please let me

130
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,080
sit for the exam first?

131
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,680
5 minutes to go

132
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,320
Can he send it here on time?

133
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,960
No

134
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,160
I can't help you

135
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,480
Please go out

136
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,240
Okay

137
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,640
You are still young

138
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,320
I think you guys

139
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,400
are not trying your best

140
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,920
Mo Mo, I have done it

141
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,120
Have you finished your interview?

142
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,880
I don't know about Mo Mo

143
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,560
But my exam is screwed up

144
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,960
Hello

145
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,720
For you

146
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,960
For you

147
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,040
This is mine

148
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,840
She is

149
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,400
Si Tu Mo whom I always
mention in the dorm

150
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,400
Call her Mo Mo

151
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,400
Now, both of the new and
old school are combined

152
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,640
It gives us chance to
meet up and know each other

153
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,400
He is the top student in our dorm,

154
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,760
Gu Wei Yi

155
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,240
He always gets good results

156
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,520
I used to protect him

157
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,360
Else, he couldn't stay in the dorm

158
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,240
Let's straight to the point

159
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,600
Exchange your bags please

160
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,440
Gu Wei Yi

161
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,280
What's wrong?

162
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,240
Do you think Mo Mo
will steal your belonging?

163
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,040
You'd better check it out

164
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,880
I wanted to check it

165
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,680
So strange, I just bought it yesterday

166
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,080
What? Anything was missing?

167
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,240
I don't think so

168
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,760
You don't need it

169
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,880
What's that?

170
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,680
Menstruation pad

171
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,000
I can explain

172
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,120
Forget it, just take it as a gift

173
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,720
I don't need it

174
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,440
Give it to me then

175
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,480
Bye

176
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,400
Look for me if you have anything

177
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,040
I'm wearing a pair of torn shoes

178
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,760
I'm wearing a torn hat

179
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,920
I'm wearing a torn robe

180
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,960
You're back

181
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,000
You're so happy

182
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,120
Did you make it in the interview?

183
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,880
No, I did not

184
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
What's the name of the student

185
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,520
in the old school?

186
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,000
Fu Pei

187
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,520
Fu Pei made a confession to you?

188
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,400
No

189
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,120
Mo Mo, what's wrong with your dress?

190
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
How could it get torn?

191
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,640
Nothing, I was just unlucky today

192
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,720
What happened?

193
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,720
Nothing, don't worry

194
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,360
I just fell down from the bike

195
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,280
and failed in the interview

196
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,200
That's all

197
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,960
You refused to attend
the interviews of Accounting jobs,,

198
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,560
but looking for Advertising

199
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,080
You need an Advertising background

200
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,760
Moreover,

201
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,480
even if you make it in the interview,

202
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,640
when you start

203
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,320
to work in the advertising company,

204
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,120
you will find that

205
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,040
you can't fight with those
graduated from Advertising

206
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,200
Then, you will need
to start it all over again

207
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,040
So, you'd better...

208
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,080
I knew

209
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,840
Stop gabbling

210
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,000
So, don't act on impulse

211
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,680
You must plan for it

212
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,440
I planned it

213
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,400
Look

214
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,440
This is my proposal

215
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,400
I forced you to do this

216
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,880
when we were freshmen

217
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,640
I knew that I would not do this

218
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,320
Did you complete it?

219
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,680
Meng Lu

220
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,240
Niu Niu

221
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,640
Niu Niu

222
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,040
Where's my thing?

223
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,040
Don't act

224
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,400
I have planned nothing

225
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,080
I want to get married now

226
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,080
I decided to get married once I get the

227
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,040
graduation certificate

228
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,640
I have a target

229
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,280
My life of game

230
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,920
is going to start soon

231
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,720
I want to be a
government staff, that's all

232
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,640
Look

233
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,280
We are all having our own plan

234
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,920
I must complete the form
before the graduation

235
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,880
Stop bragging

236
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,720
Don't ruin the on-campus
recruitment on tomorrow

237
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,360
I must accomplish the mission

238
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,680
It must match our major

239
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,360
It must match our major

240
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,080
It must match our major

241
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,920
Understand?

242
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,640
Alright

243
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,400
Mo Mo

244
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,880
Why were you so happy

245
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,320
when you entered the room?

246
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,880
I can explain

247
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,960
Forget it, just take it as a gift

248
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,840
I don't need it

249
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,439
Give it to me then

250
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,000
Someone was funny

251
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,520
when I was on my way back

252
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,480
The talent concept of our company

253
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,480
is very attractive

254
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,560
Besides

255
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,680
competitive remuneration,

256
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,519
we also provide
regular professional training

257
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,110
Our working environment

258
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,880
is very good

259
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,760
Look at it

260
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,240
Our office building

261
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,000
Working area

262
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,880
Rest area

263
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,080
And...

264
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,160
What's wrong? It's still

265
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,840
Hurry up call the university

266
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,320
Let them send someone from computer base

267
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,480
Okay

268
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
Dear all

269
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,600
Let's do a Q&A session

270
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,120
If you have any question

271
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,800
about our company,

272
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,680
please do not hesitate

273
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,520
Question

274
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,840
I don't want to go

275
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,760
So handsome

276
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,680
Gu Wei Yi

277
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,080
So fast

278
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,240
Come with me

279
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,240
A computer base student

280
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,560
needs to wear a white coat?

281
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,680
Is this important?

282
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,800
The important thing is,
he's such a handsome guy

283
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,040
What's wrong?

284
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,160
It hanged in a sudden

285
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,040
Now I can't even shut it down

286
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:45,800
What's wrong with you?

287
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,680
Who will be responsible
if it breaks down?

288
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,320
The technician is here

289
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,520
He is...

290
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,720
You're not technician, stop doing this

291
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,880
It will be alright very soon

292
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,800
It's okay now

293
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,800
It's okay

294
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,680
Si Tu Mo

295
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,400
What's wrong?

296
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,560
Please take the keys

297
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,840
from the drawer on your right

298
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Thank you

299
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,160
I've got the keys

300
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,000
I won't help you again

301
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,720
Ke, Fatty and I have something to do

302
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,520
It's near your lab

303
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,600
I'll buy you a meal after this

304
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,880
Okay

305
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,240
Mr. Xu

306
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,160
Why didn't you sit
for the exam yesterday?

307
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,480
There's some reason and

308
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,920
I didn't bring my student card

309
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,280
Many students of other university

310
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,760
tried hard to take part
in Professor Jiang's project

311
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,480
How could you make the mistake?

312
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,800
It is past

313
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,840
Unless you have a solution for it,

314
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,720
else, we don't have to talk about it

315
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,160
Today, I'm here for this issue

316
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,040
Professor Jiang has the right

317
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,200
to decide the project's participant

318
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,640
I hope you try your best to get it

319
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,160
After all, it is related to our class

320
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,120
and the name of the Faculty of Physics

321
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,360
Are you asking me
to give him some gifts?

322
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,240
Can I claim it from the university?

323
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,320
I don't mean it

324
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,640
At the beginning,

325
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,320
Professor Jiang wanted

326
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,640
to pick top students for his project

327
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,960
But the university insisted
to follow the procedure

328
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,800
So,

329
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,040
we will back up you

330
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,480
and let you meet Professor Jiang

331
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,040
I don't want to do that

332
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,200
It's unfair to others

333
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,000
Gu Wei Yi

334
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,000
You have yet to step into the society

335
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,080
You don't know

336
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,160
Most of the time, many things

337
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,080
could adapt to the circumstances

338
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,720
Sir

339
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,000
I need to pass up the experiment report

340
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,040
Could you please let me
finish the experiment first?

341
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,720
Okay

342
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,360
Would you go if I
reimburse all your expenses?

343
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,080
I'm just kidding

344
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,080
Do you understand
what the lecturer said?

345
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:15,960
Yes, I got it

346
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,000
Shan Shan, want to eat something?

347
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,840
I'm going to the canteen

348
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,640
I'll pass

349
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,800
I'm going to the graduate class

350
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,800
You ask two of them

351
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,480
Alright, bye

352
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,960
Mo Mo

353
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,680
Please buy us rice with meat

354
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,640
and vegetables when you're back

355
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,720
Scrambled egg with tomato
and shredded meat

356
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:36,880
Hello

357
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,800
Mo Mo

358
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,200
Do you want to eat something?

359
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,040
Are you free to entertain me?

360
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,440
I have to take my lunch
no matter how busy I am

361
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,160
Take your time then

362
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,560
I'm on diet

363
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,480
You can look at me

364
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,120
I'm not sick

365
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,560
Here I am

366
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,720
You're really naughty

367
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,600
Surprised?

368
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,400
Let's go for lunch

369
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,760
Don't touch me

370
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,520
Let's go for lunch

371
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,320
What do you want to eat?

372
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,280
You may order anything

373
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,440
I have money to pay the bill

374
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,880
It has been 2 weeks after
the combination of schools,

375
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,680
but I never buy you treat

376
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,800
Let me

377
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
buy you 3 meals in a day after this

378
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,600
I'm serious

379
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,800
I didn't take good care of you

380
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,400
when I was studying in the old school

381
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,160
Now, we're staying together

382
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,120
I'll protect you in the future

383
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,000
What's wrong?

384
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,200
There's an interview tomorrow,

385
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,960
but I never see the address

386
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,160
I need to check it out

387
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,440
Let me see

388
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,800
I see

389
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,960
Quite far from here, I'll go with you

390
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,400
Forget it

391
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,400
I don't want to hear

392
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,600
any poor excuse again

393
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,800
I promise that I won't do that again

394
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,680
Really

395
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,760
I'm familiar with the place

396
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,680
It's nearby the old school

397
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,720
Alright

398
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,640
While I attend the interview,

399
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,120
you may walk around the old school

400
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,280
See if you need anything

401
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,640
I will find it for you

402
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,120
Hello, I want to change the screen

403
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,720
Wait a moment

404
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,760
I only want to buy a screen

405
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,120
The price of the screen

406
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,680
is same as the repair cost

407
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,680
No problem

408
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,840
But I want to use your
tools to change the screen

409
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,120
Can you do that?

410
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,160
I never try

411
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,600
So I want to try

412
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,080
Okay

What's wrong?

416
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,280
I'll change it for you

417
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,640
It's okay

418
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,160
I have successfully changed it

419
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,120
Congratulation!

420
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,640
I will pay for the repair cost for you

421
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,160
I can pay by myself

422
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,720

423
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,920

429
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,560
No

430
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,680

442
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,920
Senior Gu

443
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,560
I don't know that
you're good at mechanic

444
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,160
I'm a freshman of mechanic

445
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,280
Can I have your contact number?

446
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,280
So, we can...

447
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,600
I'm not going to work here

448
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,120
Excellent!

449
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:56,880
Awesome!

450
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,120
I've waiting for you for so long

451
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,320
I will be late if I miss the bus again

452
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,120
I'm leaving, you don't have to come here

453
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:35,920
I...

454
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,840
Help!

455
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,640

456
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,680

457
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,000
Give it to me!

458
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,440
My bag!

459
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,120
My bag!

460
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,760
Hello

461
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,520
Hello

462
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,720
I'm Si Tu Mo who has
an interview with you today

463
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,440
But I have an urgent accident now

464
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,360
Can we make it on another day?

00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,440
Hello

468
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,680
Fu Pei

469
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,000
I'm Gu Wei Yi

470
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,960
Can you look for Fu Pei?

471
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,200
I don't know where is he

472
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,600
Please help me to inform him

473
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,560
I'm now at the bus station

474
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,440
of Luo He Road nearby the old school

475
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,160
My bag was robbed and
I have no money for the fare

476
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,120
My mobile phone is going to die

477
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,680
Please get him to come and look for me

478
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,560
As soon as possible...

479
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,360
Ke

480
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,040
Do you know where is Fu Pei?

481
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,120
I don't know, what's wrong?

482
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,040
I'm waiting for you at the canteen

483
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,200
I'll pass

484
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,760
Gu Wei Yi, why are you here?

485
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,360
I didn't want to come

486
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,080
Where is Fu Pei?

487
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,880
I couldn't get him

488
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,560
Come on

489
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,840
I let the driver to wait for a while

490
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,720
It's hard to get a cab here

491
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,760
Please go to the nearest hospital

492
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,880
Okay

493
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,200
It's okay

494
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,760
You have to clean your wound first

495
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,680
See if it is serious

496
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,760
Wait a moment

497
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Let me help you

498
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,280
It's not that serious

499
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,920
We don't have to go to the hospital

500
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,880
You'd better go

501
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,440
I'll apply some cream in the dorm

502
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,840
A big wound on the skin surface

503
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,040
will cause bacteria invasion

504
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,160
Bacteria invasion
will cause virus infection

505
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,320
Do you know what is

506
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,480
the most serious subsequent?

507
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,120
What is that?

508
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,190
Amputation

509
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,880
So serious

510
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,600
Please speed up

511
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,960
Okay

512
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,150
Do you have any
document for registration?

513
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,120
All my cards are in the
bag and it was robbed

514
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,840
Wait here for a while

515
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,040
I'll figure it out

516
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,880
Okay

517
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,960
What are you doing?

518
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,120
You get a wrong person

519
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Come on

520
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,320
Come on

521
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
I don't want to sit on a wheelchair

522
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,760
Do you know what is

523
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,320
the most serious subsequent?

524
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,760
What's wrong?

525
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,800
She fell down and injured

526
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,480
Where does it hurt?

527
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,440
And my leg too

528
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,640
Did you do any scan?

529
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,920
Give me the scanning result

530
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,120
The bone is alright

531
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,640
It means your ligament is hurt

532
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,720
Only a small wound

533
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,320
So why are you using the wheelchair?

534
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,560
To show your affection?

535
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,880
Alright

536
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,560
Sit here as you're injured

537
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,720
Just sit down

538
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,400
What's your name?

539
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,320
-Gu Wei Yi
-Si Tu Mo

540
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,000
I'm asking the patient

541
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,800
Si Tu Mo

542
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,240
Alright, I have cleaned your wound

543
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,400
Take the prescription and get
the medicine at the pharmacy

544
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,520
Don't get water onto your wound

545
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,680
Take light meals

546
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,200
Thank you

547
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,880
Push it away, I don't need it

548
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,520
You don't have to feel shamed

549
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,800
It's a hospital facility

550
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,320
Sometimes, you may take it

551
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,080
to show your affection

552
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,440
and romantic

553
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,080
Let's go, hurry up

554
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,800
It's okay, nobody sees me

555
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,720
-It's okay
-Si Tu Mo

556
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,120
What's wrong with you?

557
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,120
So serious

558
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,480
It's okay, just a small would

559
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,040
How can you say it's a small matter?

560
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,480
You're sitting on a wheelchair

561
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,720
It's just a small would

562
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,200
Thank you for your help

563
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,520
I'll buy you a meal later

564
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,640
Leave it to me

565
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,760
You go back first

566
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,920
Mo Mo, where should we go now?

567
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,440
To get the medicine at the pharmacy

568
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,800
Medicine?

569
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,520
Gu Wei Yi is holding the prescription

570
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,360
Give me the prescription

571
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,760
Thank you

572
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,880
Let me help you

573
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,800
Where's the pharmacy?

574
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,000
Walk straight and turn right

575
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,760
Walk straight and turn right?

576
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,320
That's right

577
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,160
Okay, thank you

578
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,000
There

579
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,280
Why do we always have
the different frequency rate?

580
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,640
Maybe I shouldn't expect for it

581
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,120
I didn't cry

582
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,440
Wipe your sweat

583
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,360
For your girlfriend?

584
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,400
No, I lost it

585
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,480
What's her favourite brand?

586
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,720
I don't remember

587
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,800
It's okay, let me recommend to you

588
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,960
Look at this

589
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,560
Feel it, it's comfortable

590
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,920
and different from other brand

591
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:45,960
Touch it

592
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,760
It's different from other brand

593
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,680
Touch it

594
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,520
It's comfortable

595
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,320
It's okay

596
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,320
It's comfortable

597
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,680
Don't go

598
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,680
Boy

599
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,120
Don't be shamed

600
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,880
It's comfortable
