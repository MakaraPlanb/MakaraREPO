00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,630
I'll miss you

[Episode 23]

5
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,150
Did you tell your parents?

6
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,150
I did

7
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,310
No

8
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,710
You

9
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,910
I won't tell if it's not confirmed

10
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,830
Moreover, I always

11
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,310
make my own decisions

12
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,150
I'll make the decision and tell them

13
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,630
What about your girlfriend?

14
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,830
You didn't tell her too?

15
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,390
I didn't tell her

16
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,100
Alright then

17
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,070
You'd better

18
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,870
watch out

19
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,070
Is there something you want to ask me?

20
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,590
If you were Si Tu Mo,

21
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,990
will you get mad if I didn't

22
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,070
tell you about the trip?

23
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,670
You should ask her

24
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,230
Okay, I remember

25
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,710
I'll see you in a minute

26
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,150
Bye

27
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,750
I left something

28
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,390
in Professor Jiang's office

29
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,990
I'll go back and get it

30
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,350
Come on, I'll take you to the lab

31
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,750
Let's go

32
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,110
Where are the others?

33
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,190
I don't know, they're here just now

34
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,950
You used to do experiments
in the new lab

35
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,030
Why did you suddenly
go back to the old lab?

36
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,630
The new project needs to be done here

37
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,230
And the old lab

38
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,870
is more in line with the
experimental environment

39
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:53,750
Take it off

40
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,750
Take off your white coat

41
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,470
I want to wear it for a long time

42
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:19,870
Nice looking?

43
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,310
Xiao Gu

44
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,580
Get the nitroglycerin for me

45
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,630
The nitroglycerin is explosive

46
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,310
But I can only
think of "Nitroglycerin",

47
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,630
which seems

48
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,550
a very professional word

49
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,990
What are these?

50
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,750
I have something to tell you

51
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,590
What's the matter?

52
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,750
In the last exam,

53
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,590
I did better than Zhou Lei

54
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,230
Congratulation!

55
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,670
So,

56
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,190
I'm qualified to join the
Heidelberg University exchange

57
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,950
in Germany with
Professor Jiang and my seniors

58
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,790
Congratulation!

59
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,950
What?

60
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,430
Germany?

61
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,710
How long?

62
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,310
More than 6 months

63
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,150
When?

64
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,190
The school is now
speeding up the visa for us

65
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,150
It may take two weeks if it's fast

66
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,230
The university

67
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,550
sent the invitation
at the end of last year

68
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,030
So a lot of the process is done

69
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,150
You knew it last year

70
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,790
and you're just telling me now

71
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,030
As I was not sure
that I'll be qualified

72
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,670
Maybe Zhou Lei can do
better than me in the exam

73
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,430
After all, he's been serious

74
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,590
And I'm busy falling in love with you

75
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:02,990
Do you mean

76
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,590
I disturb your studies?

77
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,550
I didn't mean it

78
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,390
Who else is going with you?

79
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,510
Professor Jiang,
Lu Jian Shi and Xie Yu Yin

80
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:22,870
Don't follow me

81
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,270
It takes so long

82
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,550
It's normal,

83
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,550
girls always slow

84
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,390
Must be Meng Lu busy with make up

85
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,390
She makes them late

86
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,950
Meng Lu is pretty by nature

87
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,630
She doesn't need to make up

88
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,030
Only Meng Lu likes to make up

89
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,190
Must be Wang Shan makes up for so long

90
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,870
Wang Shan is simple

91
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,030
Here they are

92
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,710
-Come on!
-Hurry up!

93
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,350
What makes you late?

94
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,870
We need to make up

95
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,990
Get up, why did you take my seat?

96
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,350
Go away

97
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,110
Fatty, why are you laughing?

98
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,310
You shouldn't laugh

99
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,310
Order my favorite food

100
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,070
Beef

101
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,510
Crayfish

102
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,870
Clean it for me

103
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,430
Alright

104
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,230
You're so beautiful today

105
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,550
Still angry?

106
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,350
All the best for our bright future!

107
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,470
Fatty, I tell you

108
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,270
Stop playing online games again

109
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,790
Battlegrounds, huh?

110
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,990
Stop playing it again

111
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,550
Watch out

112
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,510
I'm better than you

113
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,270
Stop it

114
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,659
I can swim faster than you

115
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,660
Cut it out!

116
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,270
You swim

117
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:44,780
Swimming

118
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,420
Swimming

119
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:48,870
Swimming

120
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,390
Hurry up!

121
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,030
Fu Pei

122
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,830
I told you not to drink so much

123
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,270
Alright, get up

124
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,230
Honey

125
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,070
Don't be angry

126
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,150
You shouldn't scold me
as I can drink so much

127
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,990
Don't do this again

128
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,430
Let's go, walk properly

129
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,430
Let's go

130
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,830
What are you doing?

131
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,990
I'm drunk and can't stand

132
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,870
Really?

133
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,750
But you were just fine

134
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,950
It just kicked in

135
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,870
It's just beer, not strong alcohol

136
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,110
Gu Wei Yi

137
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,350
Stand up

138
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,310
I don't know if you're really drunk

139
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,430
I'm really drunk

140
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,350
That's crap

141
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,790
Watch out

142
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,310
Sit down

143
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,670
Sit down

144
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,230
I'll bring you a glass of water

145
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,590
I'm not thirsty

146
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,030
Are you sure you're drunk?

147
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,230
Yeah

148
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,670
I'll ask you for one last time

149
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,150
Are you really sure you're drunk?

150
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,470
No

151
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,070
Say it

152
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:53,910
What?

153
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,150
Why didn't you tell me

154
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,310
that you're going to Germany

155
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,630
with Xie Yu Yin?

156
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,710
I told you

157
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,510
I know it's my fault

158
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,070
I didn't tell you in the first place

159
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,310
I've never thought

160
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,110
about it before

161
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,710
Because I made

162
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,390
all the decisions myself
since I was small

163
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,270
I just need to inform them
after making the decision

164
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,190
This is the most efficient way

165
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,430
that I communicate with them

166
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,310
Because they didn't have time for you?

167
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,910
Because they didn't understand

168
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,390
what I'm going to do

169
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:57,950
But,

170
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,350
if you don't like it that way,

171
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,350
I'll change my style for you, okay?

172
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,830
You have such a good attitude

173
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,070
I shouldn't lose my temper with you

174
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,390
Do you want me to go to Germany?

175
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,190
Will you retreat
if I don't let you go?

176
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,190
Just do it as your planned

177
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,550
I'll wait for you

178
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,550
You should take the blood first

179
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,670
I'll get the vaccine number

180
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,270
for you

181
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,910
No rushing

182
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,950
Just do the checkup today

183
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,630
and do the vaccine next time

184
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,390
No way

185
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,550
We must get it done by today

186
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,350
Is it not easy for me to
accompany you to the hospital?

187
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,990
Your turn, let's go

188
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,030
What's wrong?

189
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,030
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

190
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,870
I don't want to see the color of blood

191
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,510
Alright

192
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,430
Let's go

193
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,350
You're going to get two vaccines

194

Yeah

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,510
Can I have

203
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,510
my trainee nurse to do it for you?

204
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,670
It's okay

205
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,550
Come on

206
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,390
Push the needle

207
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,830
It's a little deep

208
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,190
Pull the needle, but don't pull it out

209
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:16,870
It's okay

210
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,230
Don't look, just look at me

211
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,870
How are you?

212
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,430
It's okay

213

Still feeling pain? Let me see

214

00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,630
It's still bleeding

217
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,270
I'll get the cotton for you

218

How is your preparation
for going abroad?

221
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:57,950
Pretty good

222
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,390
Did Mo Mo mess with you?

223
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,110
No

"A little strong"

229
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,550
Mo Mo will be a bit different

230
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,830
when she feels reluctant

231
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,830
So you mustn't be angry with her

232
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,990
She will be always picking
about something with you

233
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,590
and make you annoyed

234
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,350
Don't move

235
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,750
Your glass will leave a mark

236
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,070
Your glasses are all over the place

237

"I want to go further with you"

238
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,350
Then, she'll start to be cold

239
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,150
and pretend that you
do not exist in this world

240
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,909
"I want to go further with you"

241

"witness our love forever"

248
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,380
In the end, she's going
to stick with you

249
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,030
Like a super glue

250
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,800

251
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,140

When the executive
gave us the lollipop,

294
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,670
she wanted us to stop making noise
about the name of the artwork

295
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,270
That's what the company means

296

with me for 6 months about it

00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,070
I think,

299
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,310
you'd better make more

keep such attitude,

00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,230
I think our company

00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,550
She should bring you
to the hospital first

385
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,950
I just have a cold

386
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,870
I just need to take a break

387
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,990
Wear more cloth at home

388
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,590
Si Tu Mo

389
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,830
What's wrong?

390
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:49,870
Okay

391
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,990
My mom is calling me,
I have to go out for a while

392
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,070
Mom, I don't drink Chinese medicine

393
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,910
It's not Chinese medicine

394
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,030
I cooked the walnut soup for you

395
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,270
Your grandmother said,

396
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,710
it's effective to heal a cold

397
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,790
I couldn't find the mug

398
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,870
you often use just now

399
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,990
So I took a bowl

400
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,110
Drink it while it's still hot

401
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,150
You'll be recovered after this

402
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,350
Finished, I'll go and
clean up my things

403
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:34,910
Wait

404
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:35,630
Well

405
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,510
I need to talk to you

406
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,270
Well

407
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,630
Mo Mo

408
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,230
How's your German visa going?

409
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,070
It's passed

410
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,150
They rejected me before
as they suspected

411
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,270
I'm going to migrate

412
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,470
Then, Gu Wei Yi planned

413
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,710
an itinerary of Germany trip for me

414
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,190
And the application is passed

415
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,350
Xiao Gu is really awesome

416
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,670
I've never thought a scientist
could in charge of a visa too

417
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,150
Mom

418
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,910
What are you trying to say?

419
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,790
I just want to ask you

420
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,470
When are you two going to marry?

421
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,390
Why are you asking me again?

422
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,630
Wait

423
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,470
What do you mean by asking again?

424
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,110
It's been more than 6 months
Xiao Gu went to Germany

425
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,390
I can understand that you're not able

426
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,310
to get your visa to Germany

427
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,190
But it's been such a long time

428
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,310
Did he ever think

429
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,750
want to come back and see you?

430
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,270
Don't you feel panic?

431
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,950
We keep in touch every day

432
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,350
Why should I panic for?

433
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,710
Don't pretend

434
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,630
I don't want to talk,
I have a headache

435
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,190
I don't want to talk to you either

436
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,310
You're back

437
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:43,910
What are you doing?

438
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,910
Finding clothes and going out

439
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,470
Si Tu Mo

440
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:51,950
What's wrong?

441
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,990
Your mother said anything to you?

442
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,390
Nothing

443
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,310
I just don't know which dress to wear

444
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,030
Alright then

445
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,430
Now

446
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,750
Do you believe that
I have a girlfriend?

447
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,430
I don't care

448
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,790
She's in China

449
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,630
I can be your girlfriend here

450
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,910
I won't tell her

451
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,590
Stop bothering me

452
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,470
Anna

453
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,310
Did you turn her down again?

454
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,190
You're so cool, aren't you?

455
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,990
She's the professor's daughter

456
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,350
You didn't give any face to her

457
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,110
Why are you so anxious?

458
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,150
It's not your daughter

459
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,230
To get a daughter,

460
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,630
I surely need time and space

461
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,630
I don't want to go out today

462
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,070
Why?

463
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,670
My girlfriend's sick

464
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,630
She might contact me at anytime

465
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,510
You may go out

466
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,830
and find a place to sit down

467
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,950
and drink a cup of coffee
while waiting for her

468
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,670
I just bought a flight
ticket to go back

469
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:33,830
I'm broke

470
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,670
That's why you don't eat

471
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,270
It's up to you

472
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,430
You will be awkward anyway

473
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,270
Who knows?

474
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,550
What are you guys talking about?

475
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,430
I love you

476
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,870
I love you very much

477
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,350
You're so sweet

478
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:57,070
You're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen in my life

479
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,190
Really?

480
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,310
Are you kidding me?

481
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,910
No, I'm sure

482
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,270
Please have a seat

483
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,150
Director Sha Sha will
come down in a minute

484
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,230
You sit here for a while

485
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,550
I'm going out to answer a call

486
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:31,270
Wei Wei

487
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,910
Ye Tian

488
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,910
Did you hear that
Si Tu Mo has resigned?

489
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,590
Of course, it's all spread

490
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,830
But the reason of her
resignation is interesting

491
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,790
If I were Sha Sha,

492
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,630
I'll apply leave too

493
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,310
Shame on her! How could she do that?

494
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,310
She took the winning
design of her staff

495
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,790
and put it under her name

496
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,470
And the resignation letter

497
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,110
directly kept her mouth shut

498
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,710
I really want to upload
the letter to the Internet

499
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:54,790
Stop talking about her

500
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,390
Let's go to the photocopy room

501
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:57,270
Come on

502
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,990
What are you doing?

503
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,830
Circle is out of battery

504
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,350
I want to recharge it

505
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,390
I'm bringing you a glass of water

506
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,270
Why are you sitting on the floor?

507
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,230
It's cold

508
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,270
You just caught a cold
Quickly get up

509
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,790
Get up

510
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,350
What is this?

511
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,510
I don't know

512
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:49,990
Well

513
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,110
Only the people like your father

514
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,710
who always hide private money

515
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,670
could think of that place

516
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,950
I couldn't think of it

517
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,390
Not you?

518
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,990
That's...

519
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,270
-Gu Wei Yi
-Xiao Gu

520
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,310
The scientist's brain is so strange

521
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:33,750
I'm done

522
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,750
The abnormality of the
scientist influenced you, huh?

523
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,670
You...

524
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,189
What are you doing?

525
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,710
Why are you packing up the thing?

526
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:17,830
I'll go to Gu Wei Yi

527
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,470
Gu Wei...

528
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,509
He's in Germany

529
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,030
You're still sick

530
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,670
Don't be crazy

531
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,390
You may go there when you're recovered

532
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,870
I'm going to force him to marry me

533
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:41,630
Go away

534
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,310
Go away

535
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,830
Stop packing it

536
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,630
I'm going to Germany instead of outing

537
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,750
You can eat it later

538
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,500
Bring it along

539
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:56,870
Alright

540
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,070
Let's go

541
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,110
Shall we

542
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:04,980
give him a call?

543
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,020
You can't suddenly go there

544
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,350
Why do you want to call him?

545
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,150
What if he runs away

546
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,150
from me after that?

547
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,710
It's impossible

548
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,910
He's scientist

549
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,590
He does everything thoroughly

550
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,390
with plans

551
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,350
What about beyond the plan?

552
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:17,940
Let's go

553
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,590
Attack him

554
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,790
when he's unprepared

555
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,590
Go!

556
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,110
Come on

557
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,550
Fu Pei, I'm Gu Wei Yi

558
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,230
Hey bro

559
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,750
Before you introduce yourself,

560
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,750
can you check out the current time

561
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,470
of Beijing first?

562
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:54,830
I couldn't

563
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:55,910
contact Si Tu Mo for almost one day

564
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,550
Have you and Wang Shan been
in touch with her these few days?

565
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,550
Yes, she said she was busy

566
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,670
Her mother is taking
care of her, right?

567
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,550
Her mum didn't pick up my call

568
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,190
Of course

569
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,150
It's 2 am in Beijing right now

570
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,670
I'm tired, bye

571
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,590
Hey scientist, what's going on?

572
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,790
I'm playing games

573
