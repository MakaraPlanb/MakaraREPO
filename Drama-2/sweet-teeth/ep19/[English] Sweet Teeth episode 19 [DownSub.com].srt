00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,400
Do you really plan

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,440
to bring him to meet your parents?

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes.

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,630
I think he was right.

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,360
I will grow old too.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,800
No matter how long I wait,

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,070
I'm still older than him.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,250
It's now or never.

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:24,810
What about you?

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,520
Are you not planning to introduce

12
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,420
Dr. Ai to your mom?

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,900
I think we should
wait a little longer.

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,370
My mom had a slight

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,710
misunderstanding
towards Mr. Ai before.

16
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:32,920
How about this?

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,230
Let's schedule it on the same date.

18
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:34,870
After meeting the parents,

19
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,120
we shall drink up immediately.

20
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,120
What do people call that?

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,920
You only live once.

22
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,510
I don't think I'm up for it.

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,670
Mr. Ai and I haven't dated

24
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,600
for long.

25
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,790
Meeting the parents abruptly

26
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,240
would make him think
I'm being impatient.

27
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,350
Aren't you?

28
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,880
Not at all.

29
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,200
We're dating already.

30
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,390
He can't possibly run away.

31
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,710
That's uncertain.

32
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,520
Dr. Ai is very popular.

33
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,320
I trust him.

34
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,240
Dr. Ai has always been popular,

35
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,240
but he was never

36
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,790
caught in a scandal with anyone.

37
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,280
I remember on that day,

38
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,920
Yi Yi made him look
for me the whole day.

39
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,920
Not only he wasn't mad,

40
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,430
he confessed his feelings to me

41
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,280
sincerely.

42
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,710
Are you listening to me?

43
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,760
Check this out.

44
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,200
I think I just found

45
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,789
something unbelievable.

46
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,120
This...

47
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,710
This belongs to Yi Yi, right?

48
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,230
Back when we started with the launch

49
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,510
of the cafe,

50
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,430
everyone brought over

51
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,310
some books.

52
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,000
It was always here.

53
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,479
No one was interested to flip through.

54
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,150
This photograph...

55
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,710
Zeng Li.

56
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:46,310
Make me a cup of coffee.

57
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,840
The traffic was congested.

58
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,039
I'm exhausted.

59
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,920
Ma Yi Yi.

60
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,789
There was traffic.

61
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,000
I wasn't late on purpose.

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
I'm getting changed.

63
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,200
Look at what this is.

64
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,070
What is this?

65
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,740
[Sweet Teeth]
[Episode 19]

66
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,120
I'll send you

67
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,870
the list of stocks to buy.

68
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,150
Just trust me and go for it.

69
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,870
Will I make a huge profit

70
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,310
like before?

71
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,680
Well, there's no guarantee,

72
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,790
but

73
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,280
I'm 70% confident.

74
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,760
You're asking me to go for it.

75
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,030
What happens if I make a loss?

76
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,870
Well, I've extra money in my pocket.

77
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,120
I bought the stocks with them.

78
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,000
Like I always say,

79
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,079
you don't know a thing.

80
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,310
Either you follow my lead
and buy these,

81
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,630
and sell them off when
I tell you to,

82
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,840
or stop trusting me entirely.

83
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:29,840
I don't want you to come for me

84
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,360
when you make a loss.

85
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,360
No, I trust you.

86
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,560
Something isn't right.

87
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,910
Why are you being so kind to me?

88
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,470
You came when I asked you out.

89
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,590
You recommended stocks

90
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,400
when I asked you to.

91
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,000
Are you reminded of how great I am

92
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,079
that your feelings for me rekindled?

93
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,000
You're being paranoid.

94
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,030
How is

95
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,560
Chris doing recently?

96
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,840
Why are you asking about him again?

97
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,630
Are you altering your sexuality?

98
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,960
I was casually asking

99
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,710
and making conversation.

100
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,750
We don't have anything
else to talk about.

101
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,800
My brother told me

102
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,630
Chris has been depressed recently.

103
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,750
He finally

104
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,710
found someone he likes,

105
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,000
yet the girl was cold.

106
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,680
In my opinion, for someone

107
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,870
as great as Chris,

108
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,630
the girl

109
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,000
is probably blind.

110
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,280
I...

111
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,030
I've a message.

112
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,400
We're not going to pry.

114
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,150
[How are you and]

115
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,870
[Chris doing?]

116
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,960
[Not bad.]

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,560
[I've a date tonight.]

118
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,710
Date?

119
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,300
[Ma Yi Yi]

120
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,630
Didn't you reject

121
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,560
Chris already?

122
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,710
Are you provoking my brother?

123
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,140
[Ma Yi Yi: Not bad. I've a date tonight.]

124
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,030
I can't believe she's denying it.

125
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,430
What are you laughing at?

126
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,630
The weather is great.

127
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,870
The weather is great?

128
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,710
Let's catch a movie in the afternoon.

129
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,280
Both of us

130
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
are just friends.

131
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,150
Coming out for tea

132
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,520
or meal gatherings are fine.

133
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,910
Forget about a movie.

134
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,080
Let's get back together.

135
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,560
You slapped me previously

136
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,190
and said,

137
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,630
you shouldn't have
wasted your time on me.

138
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,280
I gave it some thought.

139
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,520
One's youth is meant

140
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,400
to experience adversities.

141
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,160
Ever since we broke up,

142
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,390
I haven't met

143
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,680
anyone better than you.

144
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,270
I kind of miss you.

145
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm still young anyway.

146
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,240
Wasting two years of my life

147
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,630
isn't a big deal.

148
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,600
It is a big deal to me.

149
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,360
My principle is to never look back.

150
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,950
That's impossible.

151
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,920
Ma Yi Yi isn't one

152
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,310
to look back.

153
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,430
Besides, my brother

154
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,120
is an utter douche.

155
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,270
It's fine that he'd

156
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,480
fool around back in university.

157
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,750
Yi Yi, no way.

158
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,190
No way.

159
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,480
Honestly though,

160
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,070
am I that unreliable?

161
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,600
Extremely unreliable.

162
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,630
You're easily bored.

163
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,630
Your thoughts are erratic.

164
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,680
You do not provide
a sense of security.

165
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,040
It's fun to date someone like you,

166
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,040
but if one were to settle down,

167
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,510
you show many red flags.

168
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,510
Nope.

169
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,750
It seems like I do have a little

170
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,000
feelings for Deng Hao Ran.

171
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,600
Don't worry.

172
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,800
I think it's because

173
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,830
I do not have a great man

174
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,800
around me right now.

175
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,920
When a better man

176
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,480
shows up,

177
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll be able to control myself

178
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,630
from falling into

179
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,510
the fiery pits known
as Deng Hao Ran.

180
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,480
Don't worry.

181
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,830
Don't worry.

182
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,680
Don't stare at me.

183
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,800
The fiery pit is my brother.

184
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,750
I'm unable to voice

185
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,560
my opinion objectively.

186
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,870
In regards to your feelings,

187
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,360
you shall call the shots.

188
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,390
If you'd really
throw yourself into it,

189
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,000
all we have to do

190
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
is put out the fire.

00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,430
[Where are you?]

194
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,160
Check out the building here.

195
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,720
The entire property and its unit

196
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,950
face southward.

197
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,160
It's north-south oriented.

198
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,800
It's a great place.

199
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,510
Not to mention,

200
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,310
the lighting

201
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,560
here is sufficient.

202
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,600
During the day,

203
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,480
from morning till evening,

204
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,430
sunlight would reach the units.

205
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,600
It'd make the place comfortable.

206
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,390
Wu Ying!

207
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,870
Yes.

208
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,270
Why are you dressed this way?

209
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,950
What's wrong?

210
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:34,870
Do I look mature?

211
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,270
Do I look reliable?

212
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,159
Yes,

213
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,270
you sure do.

214
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,600
You also look like you've
an interview to attend.

215
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,040
I spent a lot of effort to dress up.

216
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,920
This doesn't work.

217
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,000
Ying Ying.

218
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,360
Mom.

219
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,200
We cannot afford to buy a house.

220
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
You should approach someone else.

221
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,000
No, mom, he is...

222
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,630
Hello, auntie.

223
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,830
I'm Wu Ying's boyfriend.

224
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,950
My name is Liu Yu Cheng.

225
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,680
Auntie, allow me.

226
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,750
You address me as an auntie.

227
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,360
I feel guilty.

228
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,830
It feels like I'm old enough
to be your grandmother.

229
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,160
Young people

230
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,680
shouldn't be caught up with weight.

231
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,950
Eat more.

232
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,560
What happens if you
lose too much weight?

233
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,360
Here, Xiao Liu.

234
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,160
It's your first time visiting us.

235
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,950
Don't feel restrain. Here.

236
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,600
Thank you, uncle.

237
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,360
Wu Ying told me

238
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,310
you're from Malaysia.

239
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,750
[I forgot to mention to mom and dad]

240
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,430
[that Liu Yu Cheng doesn't]

241
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,360
[like greasy food.]

242
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,270
You must be

243
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,680
rather conservative for your age.

244
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,720
Not at all.

245
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,870
I was studying

246
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,750
engineering in Malaysia.

247
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
Afterward, I grew interested
in the Chinese Medicine

248
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,600
of China.

249
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,070
That's why I came to China
to restart my education.

250
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,630
My friends told me

251
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,159
I'm being rebellious.

252
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,560
You sure are opinionated.

253
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,430
Which aspect of the Chinese Medicine

254
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,190
are you mastering in?

255
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,950
I'm particularly interested in

256
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,720
health and diet.

257
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,800
I hope to be able to

258
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,750
combine diet therapy

259
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,310
and modern nutrition

260
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,240
together in the future,

261
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,390
contributing to the field.

262
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,800
Are you studying the eating habits?

263
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,240
Right?

264
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,920
Yes.

265
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,240
Check out the

266
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,120
dishes I made.

267
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,430
Are they healthy enough?

268
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,510
Give me some suggestions.

269
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,870
I'll be honest then, auntie.

270
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:24,750
Sure.

271
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,680
Firstly, red braised pork belly

272
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,510
is extremely high in fat content,

273
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,240
and low in protein.

274
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,750
It's not very suitable
for senior citizens.

275
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,630
It will lead to

276
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,510
an increased risk of
cardiovascular diseases.

277
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,360
These stuffed fried lotus roots.

278
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,309
Actually, lotus roots

279
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,510
are not considered vegetables.

280
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,390
They are carbs.

281
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,720
Consuming mere carbohydrates

282
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,600
or fat

283
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,390
is completely fine.

284
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,150
However,

285
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,000
if mixed together,

286
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,120
they are a combination
of oil and sugar.

287
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,080
Its calories are five times higher

288
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,870
than single carbs or single sugars.

289
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,320
It will cause a spike
in your blood sugar level.

290
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,320
Is that so?

291
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,720
Mom and dad.

292
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,360
Ignore him.

293
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,320
He's dim-witted.

294
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,270
I understand.

295
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,670
Going on about these

296
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,320
the first time we met

297
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,550
might irritate you a little.

298
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,510
However, if I do not

299
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,670
point it out as I notice,

300
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,080
I'm being irresponsible

301
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,200
towards the both of you.

302
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,910
Don't worry.

303
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,390
It's only natural.

304
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,750
I've never heard such

305
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,440
a detailed explanation before.

306
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,440
Give me a second.

307
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,270
I'll grab a notebook.

308
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,550
I'll take notes.

309
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,000
Don't be impatient.

310
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,360
Xiao Liu isn't going anywhere.

311
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,200
Let's just enjoy

312
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,510
our meal for now.

313
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,960
Afterward, let Xiao Liu

314
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,870
explain everything

315
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
in detail to us.

316
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,150
All right.

317
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,320
White rice

318
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,080
should be eaten with mixed grains.

319
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,390
That is the most healthy diet.

320
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,000
Xiao Liu.

321
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,360
It's great that you're here.

322
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,750
Allow me to

323
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,630
add both of you on WeChat.

324
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,720
I collected many

325
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,550
healthy recipes.

326
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,870
I can send them to you.

327
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,870
When Ying Ying has time
during the weekends,

328
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,240
I could come by and
make you some food.

329
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,390
That sounds lovely.

330
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,150
All right.

331
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,200
I don't know to add you on WeChat?

332
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,960
Me too.

333
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll do it.

334
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,840
This one.

335
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,840
Mine too.

336
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,840
This one.

337
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Here.

338
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,750
I got you.

339
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,120
All right.

340
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,550
It's convenient. Look.

341
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,390
Well,

342
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,750
do you enjoy

343
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,360
playing games as well?

344
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,270
I do,

345
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,200
but I'm a

346
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,360
health-based player.

347
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,600
Playing games

348
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,750
aren't beneficial.

349
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,910
According to researchers,

350
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,000
the best way to allow
one's brain to rest,

351
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,360
isn't through sleep,

352
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,150
it is to change one's perspective.

353
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,480
Take Ying Ying for an instance.

354
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,200
She spends all her time
at the Emergency Ward.

355
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,870
She has to deal
with a lot of patients.

356
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,150
Her mind is

357
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,440
constantly in the state of

358
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,840
processing information quickly.

359
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,840
At this point,

360
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,030
switching her thoughts

361
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,960
by playing two rounds of games,

362
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,840
is the best way to relax her mind.

363
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,510
That's for the best.

364
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,790
Look at him.

365
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,390
He even has research

366
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,910
to support his claims.

367
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,670
You're right.

368
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,080
However, uncle, don't worry.

369
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,440
I'll control
Ying Ying's gaming duration

370
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,360
strictly.

371
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,550
I'll not allow her head

372
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,240
to work double time.

373
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,720
Old man, don't worry.

374
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,480
Look at our Ying Ying.

375
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,670
After dating Xiao Liu,

376
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,910
her lifestyle is much
more disciplined.

377
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,600
Her diet would be healthy too.

378
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,030
Yes.

379
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,080
Most importantly,

380
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,510
she chose a great doctor.

381
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,600
Exactly.

382
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,750
That means

383
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,000
the both of them

384
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,960
are indeed better

385
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,000
together.

386
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,120
We're better together.

387
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,240
Mom and dad.

388
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,390
Stop praising him.

389
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,720
He's becoming smug.

390
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,910
You brat.

391
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,390
It's only necessary.

392
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:19,870
That's good enough.

393
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,750
Of course we're great.

394
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,510
Band-aid. Bandage.

395
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,750
I don't have to bring you along

396
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,200
on dates anymore.

397
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,120
[What are you doing?]

398
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,440
Hold on.

399
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,480
I already

400
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,240
texted Mr. Ai three times asking

401
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,510
what is he doing.

402
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,750
Zeng Li, what are you doing?

403
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,870
He's working.

404
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,550
You're being too clingy.

405
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,320
I'm probably infected by Ma Yi Yi.

406
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,860
[Ai Jing Chu]

407
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,510
[What are you doing?]

408
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,030
[I'm reading.]

409
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,240
[Aren't you at work?]

410
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,620
[Zeng Li]

411
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,600
I just handled a patient.

412
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,150
[I wanted to know what you're up to.]

413
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,940
[Ai Jing Chu]

414
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,390
[I'll come to you after work.]

415
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,440
[Sure.]

416
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,220
[Zeng Li]

417
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,860
[Ai Jing Chu]

418
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,200
[See you in two hours.]

419
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,240
It feels great to be in love.

420
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,840
We met the day before yesterday,

421
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,080
we met yesterday,

422
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,360
and we're meeting today.

423
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,510
I no longer have to

424
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,120
wait 28 days for my next appointment.

425
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,670
Who's crying?

426
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,000
The maintenance of the community

427
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,000
is slacking on their job.

428
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,630
The water tank on
the roof has been leaking

429
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,030
for days.

430
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,320
They couldn't care less.

431
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,790
If you did not file a complaint,

432
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,910
they'd leave it unattended
as long as possible.

433
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,270
It should be fine.

434
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,150
I'll talk to maintenance

435
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,440
to have the leak cleaned up

436
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,790
and acquire some cement

437
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,750
to get it mended.

438
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,360
Mended?

439
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,030
Look.

440
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,600
Be careful.

441
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,720
Safety first.

442
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,630
This can't do.

443
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,630
I must reason with maintenance.

444
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
They are bullies.

445
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,910
Are we over exaggerating?

446
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,750
The landlord is right.

447
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,480
It's threatening your well-being.

448
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,870
I should get someone

449
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,910
to get this fixed.

450
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,150
It's not that serious, right?

451
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,270
Imagine yourself

452
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,480
sitting on the couch

453
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,200
while texting me.

454
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,360
All of a sudden, the chandelier...

455
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,000
Repair this.

456
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:04,750
We must get this repaired.

457
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,030
We should stand over here

458
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,120
and keep a safe distance.

459
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,030
Okay.

460
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,440
The ceiling repairs

461
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,510
isn't a minor construction.

462
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,750
Does that mean

463
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,550
I will not be able stay here?

464
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,120
It's going to take at least half a month.

465
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,360
Even if we used eco-friendly paint,

466
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,030
it requires ventilation.

467
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,840
Should I stay over

468
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,790
at Ying Ying's or Yi Yi's

469
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,320
for a few days?

470
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,670
No.

471
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,630
Their quarters are messy.

472
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,000
I've to clean up after
them every time I'm there.

473
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,960
I could barely keep up

474
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,670
with how fast they make a mess.

475
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Forget it. I'll stay at the hotel.

476
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,360
Perhaps,

477
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,910
you could stay at my place.

478
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,910
Not my house,

479
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,600
I mean, my grandfather's place.

480
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,320
My grandfather

481
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,910
has a guest room.

482
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,360
Besides, I'm going
home for dinner tonight.

483
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,000
I can bring you along.

484
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Does that mean I'm
meeting your family already?

485
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,750
Are you reluctant?

486
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,790
That's not it.

487
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,510
I'm inexperienced.

488
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,910
My grandfather and auntie

489
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,960
are easygoing.

490
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,030
Besides, I made this decision

491
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,440
because...

492
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,200
Look.

493
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,840
We haven't been together for long.

494
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,480
You were caught in an accident

495
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,320
and went missing for a few hours.

496
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,840
Leaving you out there alone,

497
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,720
I'm worried.

498
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,750
Besides, in one month,

499
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,790
I'll be heading to
Africa on medical aid.

500
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,720
I hope I'll be able
to see you every day

501
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,000
during this period of time

502
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,320
and take care of my family as well.

503
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,000
However,

504
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,670
it's alright if you're

505
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,870
unwilling to.

506
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,750
I'm not going to force you.

507
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,790
I'll think about it.

508
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,550
Think about it?

509
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,910
Sure. Go ahead and think about it.

510
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,550
I'm leaving.

511
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,790
Wait up. Give me a second.

512
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,320
I'll come with you, alright?

513
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,510
We're home.

514
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,080
Your family must have

515
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
high expectations

516
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,150
for your girlfriend.

517
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,910
I suddenly feel unprepared.

518
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,390
I need to go.

519
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,150
You're here already.

520
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,120
Where are you going?

521
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:22,840
Wait.

522
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,150
I'm visiting your home abruptly.

523
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,360
Would your family be taken aback?

524
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,320
No.

525
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,750
They'd be elated.

526
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,670
They have always anticipated

527
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,320
that I'd

528
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,720
bring my girlfriend home.

529
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,630
This time,

530
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,600
I finally brought home

531
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,000
a chubby and adorable girlfriend.

532
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:35,670
They'd be surprised.

533
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,000
Chubby and adorable?

534
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,440
Wait.

535
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm chubby and adorable?

536
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,550
In what way am I chubby?

537
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,790
I'm not chubby.

538
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,390
Look. Did I gain weight?

539
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,240
No, you see properly.

540
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,960
Stop laughing.
Where did I gain weight?

541
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,030
When did I gain weight?

542
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,240
Look at me properly.

543
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,870
Your house is so posh.

544
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,200
Dr. Chen.

545
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,599
I've always wanted you

546
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,270
to get to know Xiao Chu.

547
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,869
You're finally here.

548
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,270
Here. Enjoy some snacks.

549
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,869
Yes, feel free.

550
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,750
Dr. Chen, treat yourself at home.

551
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,109
Xiao Chu, you're home.

552
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,069
Hurry over.

553
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,550
Come.

554
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,640
Get to know Dr. Chen.

555
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,640
She's from your hospital.

556
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,400
Xiao Chu.

557
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,510
Dr. Chen is participating

558
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,920
in the medical aid to Africa.

559
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,510
Come and get to know her.

560
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,030
Xiao Chu.

561
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,589
Dr. Chen is a lady.

562
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,310
You should take care
of her once you're there.

563
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,270
Hello, Dr. Ai.

564
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,510
I'm Chen Ling of
respiratory medicine.

565
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,200
Hello.

566
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,920
Look at Dr. Chen.

567
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,640
As a doctor, she kept her figure

568
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,240
as well as a model.

569
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,750
You're right.

570
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,000
Not at all.

571
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,070
Normally, I enjoy

572
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,000
working out.

573
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,160
I tend to watch my diet as well.

574
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,640
It's no wonder.

575
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,000
Xiao Chu, quit standing over there.

576
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,400
Come on in. What are you doing?

577
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:49,720
Come on in.

578
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,590
Dr. Chen.

579
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,960
As I recall,

580
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,790
your father was a student of mine.

581
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,880
Yes, he brought it up.

582
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,880
You used to take
great care of him in the past.

583
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:04,880
Xiao Chu.

584
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,270
Who's this?

585
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,240
Allow me to introduce

586
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,440
my girlfriend,

587
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,110
Zeng Li.

588
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,880
Mr. Ai.

589
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:14,960
Let me introduce you.

590
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,550
This is my grandfather.

591
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,680
My auntie and my uncle.

592
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,310
This is Dr. Chen from

593
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,400
the respiratory medicine
of the hospital.

594
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
I just got to know her just now.

595
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,270
Hello, grandfather.
Hello, auntie.

596
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,480
Hello, uncle.

597
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,310
Hello.

598
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,640
Hello, Dr. Chen.

599
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,240
Hello.

600
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,480
It's all Xiao Chu's fault.

601
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,110
He didn't mention
about bringing you here.

602
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,000
I didn't prepare enough food.

603
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,160
There's more than enough.

604
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,400
You prepared

605
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Dr. Chen's share as well.

606
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,880
Save it, mister.

607
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,680
Xiao Chu isn't a fool.

608
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,550
Your intentions

609
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,720
are blatant.

610
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,110
We should be open
and honest about it

611
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,200
so that Xiao Zeng wouldn't mind.

612
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,310
Xiao Zeng.

613
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,640
Dr. Chen is

614
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,790
a distant relative of ours

615
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,640
introduced her to us.

616
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,160
They thought Xiao Chu was single

617
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,110
and wanted to matchmake them.

618
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,400
Your auntie thought

619
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,480
since Dr. Chen is

620
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,590
heading to Africa as well,

621
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,790
she invited her back for a meal

622
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,640
to get to know her.

623
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,350
It wasn't me.

624
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,160
It was grandfather.

625
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,920
He said Dr. Chen's dad

626
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,400
was a student of his.

627
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,920
He said it'd be great to
strengthen old ties.

628
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,680
I did not say that.

629
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,680
I just explained objectively

630
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,030
that I knew her father.

631
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,480
You said

632
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,720
Dr. Chen was

633
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,000
pleasant and elegant
with a good figure.

634
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
She'd be a good match

635
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,070
with Xiao Chu.

636
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,720
Yes, it's my fault.

637
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,400
Not exactly.

638
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,920
It's all Mr. Ai's fault.

639
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,400
He wanted to give
all of you a surprise,

640
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,160
but it became a scare instead.

641
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,480
This isn't a scare.

642
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,110
We mentioned previously,

643
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,270
no matter who Xiao Chu brings home,

644
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,510
as long as she's a girl,

645
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,550
no matter what it is,

646
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,640
we'd be contented.

647
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,310
Yes.

648
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,830
We had no idea

649
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,790
he'd bring such a

650
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,350
pretty girlfriend home.

651
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,400
Xiao Zeng.

652
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,880
We met at Dongshan once.

653
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,550
Do you still remember?

654
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,830
Yes.

655
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,270
Back then,

656
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,160
I thought you were

657
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,000
Mr. Ai's sister.

658
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,440
You're one sweet talker.

659
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,440
That's what people always say.

660
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,960
Hurry up and eat.

661
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,750
In my family,

662
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,720
besides me,

663
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,350
they have large appetites.

664
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,590
Don't be ridiculous.

665
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,790
I'm a small eater.

666
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,440
Really?

667
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,960
That's a good habit. Keep it up.

668
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,590
Here.

669
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,480
Xiao Xiao.

670
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,960
What are you looking at?

671
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,480
Do you find

672
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,750
sister pretty too?

673
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,830
I know who she is.

674
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,070
She's Sister Star

675
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,550
in brother's phone.

676
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,880
Sister Star?

677
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,440
After launching WeChat,

678
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
the one who has a star labeled.

679
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,590
I saw brother has set her picture on it.

680
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,720
None of you got it.

681
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,920
She was the only one.

682
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,640
That's the story.

683
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,200
Xiao Xiao.

684
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,880
You're not allowed to

685
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,680
go through my phone anymore.

686
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,880
Why not?

687
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,510
Because I've

688
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,440
a girlfriend now.

689
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,720
My phone is only

690
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,750
available for my girlfriend.

691
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,750
I hate you.

692
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,160
All right. Don't be mad.

693
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,790
Here.

694
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
Are you sure you don't want to eat?

695
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,270
I'm not hungry.

696
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,510
I'm so hungry.

697
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,720
I barely had a bite.

698
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,400
Auntie looked

699
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,310
like a great cook.

700
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,240
That table of full of dishes.

701
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,240
Zeng Li.

702
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,830
Why did you reserve yourself?

703
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,110
You can't keep this up for life.

704
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,480
Your true colors will
show in a few days.

705
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,550
Hold on.

706
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,200
For life?

707
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,160
Zeng Li.

708
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,750
You sure are reserved.

709
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,830
You have just started
dating him,

710
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,160
yet you're thinking about eternity.

711
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,510
No, that's not the point.

712
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,400
I'm starving.

713
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,720
Hello.

714
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,310
What would you like to eat?

715
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,440
[I'm guessing]

716
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,510
[you must be]

717
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,550
[starving to death right now.]

718
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,550
[You can't sleep.]

719
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,400
Not at all.

720
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
[I'll head to the kitchen]

721
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,720
[to make you some food.]

722
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,400
Zeng Li.

723
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,510
Zeng Li. Hello?

724
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,720
Why aren't you saying a word?

725
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,550
What are you doing in here?

726
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,680
Mr. Ai.

727
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,790
It's already past 11 pm.

728
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,480
Should we do something

729
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,160
we've never done before?

730
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,880
Well,

731
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,640
it's a little late.

732
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,790
We will talk tomorrow.

733
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,720
No.

734
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,920
We can only do this at night.

735
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,270
That's inappropriate.

736
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,510
Mr. Ai, since you were young,

737
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,200
you probably haven't

738
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,590
been to Donghu past 11 pm.

739
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,200
You can't possibly finish all these.

740
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,110
Thank you.

741
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,110
Mr. Ai.

742
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,720
Let me ask you.

743
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Do you know what's

744
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,160
the tastiest food on earth?

745
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,510
It's

746
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,680
supper.

747
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,680
Supper?

748
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,640
Give it a taste.

749
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,510
Forget it.

750
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,920
I'm not used to

751
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,160
eating after dinner.

752
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,640
You're asleep by

753
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,480
11 pm.

754
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,880
You don't even have WeChat.

755
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,240
Accept reality.

756
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,270
You're no longer the

757
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,510
person you were before.

758
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,440
That's why

759
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,480
I mustn't break

760
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,440
my boundaries anymore.

761
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,830
Just have a little.

762
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
I'm not eating.

763
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,270
Come here.

764
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,480
I've something to say.

765
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,360

If you'd try it out with me again,

915

Why are you asking
about Chris for no reason?

948
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,030
[proposal I sent you?]

949
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,270
[Are you interested
in working together?]

950
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,070
I read it.

951
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,030
It does fit the
requirements of the market

952
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,750
and suit my image well.

953
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,960
I'm pretty interested.

954
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:28,960
[That's great.]

955
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,440
[Let's schedule a date]

956
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,590
[to discuss the details
of the cooperation.]

957
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,440
[I'm heading to
Switzerland in a few days.]

958
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,750
[I'm only free at 11 pm]

959
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,680
[the night after tomorrow.]

960
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,270
[You may come by my office then.]

961
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,880
[We can talk personally.]

962
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,440
11 pm on the night
after tomorrow.

963
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,000
The office?

964
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,200
Sure.

965
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,720
I'll see you in two days,

966
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,110
11 pm at your office.

967
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,200
[Okay.]

968
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,920
Who is that?

969
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,270
Chris.

970
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,510
Since when has Chris

971
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,550
started discussing work with you?

972
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,070
It happened last week.

973
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
He said, a romantic
relationship may have failed,

974
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,510
but we may still discuss

975
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,160
the cooperation.

976
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,920
He recently invested in

977
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,830
a livestreaming platform.

978
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,400
The company

979
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,920
is looking for a broadcaster like me.

980
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,550
Meeting at his office at 11 pm?

981
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,510
It doesn't sound like
a business meeting,

982
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,270
or a date,

983
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,110
it sounds more like

984
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,480
he's trying to sleep with you.

985
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,640
That's unnecessary.

986
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,480
A successful businessman like Chris

987
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,960
has an extremely tight schedule.

988
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,160
There's another possibility.

989
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,750
He wants to sleep with you

990
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,160
and discuss work with you.

991
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,350
There is no conflict in interest.

992
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,590
That's enough.

993
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,000
I know you're concerned about me,

994
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,590
but

995
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,400
it doesn't matter what he thinks.

996
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,160
My intentions

997
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
are to discuss work.

998
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,920
Besides, we're all adults.

999
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,240
Occasionally hovering around the

1000
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,270
boundaries

1001
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,270
is a way of survival

1002
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,160
for adults.

1003
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,400
Even if it's true

1004
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,240
that he harbors

1005
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,270
any vile intentions for me,

1006
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,240
I'd never yield.

1007
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,510
There's nothing he can do anyway.

1008
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,640
You're too naive.

1009
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,640
They could be

1010
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,790
forcing themselves on you.

1011
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,070
I really

1012
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,480
don't want to miss this opportunity.

1013
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,240
How about this?

1014
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,240
After you arrive,

1015
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,480
if anything happens,

1016
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,270
give us a call.

1017
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,720
Should we agree on a

1018
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,350
secret code before that?

1019
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,920
♫ What I want ♫

1020
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,510
♫ What I want to give ♫

1021
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,350
♫ You know better than anyone ♫

1022
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,400
♫ What you want to say ♫

1023
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,880
♫ What you want ♫

1024
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,000
♫ I know it all ♫

1025
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,750
This song is so familiar.

1026
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,590
What is it called?

1027
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,900
♫ Missed call ♫

1028
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,880
♫ You didn't leave a text ♫

1029
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,440
♫ You're missing me all alone ♫

1030
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,840
♫ Nobody could have guessed ♫

1031
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,190
♫ This is our secret code ♫

1032
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,070
[This is the wonders of a friendship.]

1033
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,000
[One glance]

1034
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,230
[and we'd know
what each other is thinking.]

1035
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,360
[One song lyric,]

1036
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,070
[and we'd come to an understanding.]

1037
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,150
[We'd dance around without]

1038
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,070
[a care for the world.]

1039
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,760
[The three of us]

1040
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,480
[are each other's support.]

1041
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,440
[Of course I know]

1042
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,800
[that we're not perfect.]

1043
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,670
[We're covered with flaws,]

1044
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,480
[but none of these would stop them]

1045
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,880
[from standing by me,]

1046
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,960
[and I'll always stand by them.]
