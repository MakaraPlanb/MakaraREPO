00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:15,840
Zeng Li!

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,680
Look who's here!

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:21,960
Zeng Li.

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,520
Do you still remember me?

6
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,000
I remember that in high school,

7
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,510
you were the top scorer for
science subjects in our area.

8
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,320
My mother wouldn't stop praising you.

9
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,800
That was two years ago.

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,200
It seems I need to work hard

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,280
to update my results.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,640
Zeng Li,

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,840
your uncle finally

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,640
came home during holiday

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,880
and even agreed to tutor you.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,320
Make sure you learn properly.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,400
Just call me Yu Yi.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,520
I'm only older than Zeng Li by four years.

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,520
I found something

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,640
really exciting.

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,760
In the next monthly exam,

22
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,039
you can score full marks.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,760
You must be joking.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,240
Look at all these wrong answers.

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,760
I can't even do geometry questions well.

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,760
Actually,

27
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,320
between you and a math genius,

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,640
the difference is just an auxiliary line.

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,560
Look here.

30
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,600
Give it a try.

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,160
That's right.

32
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,039
Hey.

33
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,320
How many times have I told you?

34
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,320
Can you wring the mop dry first

35
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,360
before wiping the floor?

36
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,240
Look at how wet the floor has become.

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,039
If you don't like the way I do it,

38
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:55,960
why don't you do it then?

39
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,320
Did I tell you to do it?

40
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,840
Did I tell you to do it?

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,920
Can you lower your voice?

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,040
Don't you think it's embarrassing?

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,240
Who's embarrassing who?

44
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,640
Who's embarrassed?

45
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,800
Every day,

46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,400
other than opening your mouth

47
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
to eat and complain,

48
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,360
you neither earn money

49
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,480
nor help with chores.

50
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,880
All you do is grumble day and night.

51
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,280
What do you want?

52
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,280
What do you think you're saying?

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,920
What am I saying?

54
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,440
You're useless! What are you saying?

55
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,400
It's over between us!

56
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,000
Wreck it!

57
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,440
Sure!

58
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's get a divorce!

59
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
Don't keep bringing

60
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,400
this up!

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,880
Get a divorce!

62
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,680
Do it for real if you want!

63
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,360
Xiao Yu'er.

64
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,120
My name is Xiao Yu.

65
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,600
So your name shall be
Xiao Yu'er from now on.

66
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,280
What do you think?

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,440
Okay.

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,480
Actually, no matter how difficult life is,

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,200
it's still easier than math questions.

70
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,200
What do you think?

71
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,480
I'll help you.

72
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,000
Later, I'll bring you

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,960
to have KFC,

74
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,520
okay?

75
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,960
Don't you have to go home for dinner?

76
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,400
I'm an adult.

77
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,360
An adult can have a meal outside

78
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,279
without his or her parents' permission.

79
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,600
That's great.

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,720
I also want to be an adult.

81
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,440
You will be soon enough.

82
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,920
Just focus

83
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,800
on studying for college entrance exam,

84
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,240
and before you know it,

85
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:27,920
you'll turn into an adult.

86
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,159
Do you think I can enrol

87
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,440
in Donghu University?

88
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,280
Of course.

89
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,000
Trust me,

90
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,000
as well as yourself.

91
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,680
I'm here for you.

92
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,040
If I successfully enrol in the university,

93
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,800
you will have graduated by then.

94
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,680
Then I'll continue with
postgraduate studies.

95
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,360
That way, I can look out for you,

96
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,440
okay?

97
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,240
Okay.

98
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,720
Let me tell you.

99
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,159
Around our university,

100
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,320
there're all kinds of delicious food.

101
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,080
KFC is nothing.

102
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,640
Do you agree?

103
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,640
When the time comes,

104
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,680
I'll bring you to try out
each of the restaurants.

105
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,880
Okay. I'll do my best.

106
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,600
Good girl.

107
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,800
When you grow up and leave home,

108
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,880
you'll be independent.

109
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,000
However, by then you'll realise,

110
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,120
actually, it's good to have
your parents around you.

[Sweet Teeth]
[Episode 13]

112
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,080
Zeng Li,

113
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,440
look, all the followers

114
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
are really curious about Xiao Yu.

115
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,040
Why don't you just

116
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,240
write another book about him?

117
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,800
I'd better finish the tasks at hand first.

118
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,560
I kind of regret

119
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,760
not visiting the aquarium.

120
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,720
I remember the aquarium in Yancheng

121
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,120
is the largest in Asia.

122
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,360
Why do I feel like I've heard

123
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,720
several largest aquariums

124
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,440
in Asia?

125
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:56,640
Have you?

126
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,760
Shouldn't you regret

127
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,600
not washing your hair last night?

128
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,000
No.

129
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,640
When you haven't washed
your hair for two days,

130
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,200
you'll begin to wonder even more

131
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,640
how it will be like on the third day.

132
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,920
Do you mean

133
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,120
tonight you're going to challenge

134
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,800
not washing your hair for four days?

135
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,520
Do you want to sniff it?

136
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,480
Dear!

137
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,800
Why did you come to pick me up?

138
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,680
I'm so happy.

139
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
Didn't you say you're busy?

140
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,920
It was a lie.

141
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,840
We hadn't seen each other for six months.

142
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,960
How could I not come to pick you up?

143
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,800
Dear, the long-distance flight
must be very tiring, right?

144
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,640
Your hair smells as nice as always.

145
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,840
A couple's public display of affection.

146
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,000
Is no one going to do anything about it?

147
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,159
I know it's torturous,

148
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,520
but I couldn't help

149
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,800
staring at them.

150
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,159
[The meeting was dismissed ahead of time.]

00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,080
[I'll pick you up at the airport.]

153
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,920
Your boyfriend is going to
surprise you by showing up?

154
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,600
What? No, this won't do.

155
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,760
No, I can't meet him.

156
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,680
Why?

157
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,560
I didn't wash my hair.

158
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,560
-Zeng Li.
-Come over.

159
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,200
Slow down.

160
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,600
Where is he?

161
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,080
Pick up the call.

162
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,600
Answer it.

163
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,040
Hello, Mr. Ai.

164
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,800
Hello, Zeng Li.

165
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,440
Where are you?

166
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,600
You didn't reply to me on WeChat.

167
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,320
I don't see you here.

168
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,440
I just arrived.

169
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,960
I'm not at the airport.

170
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,680
You aren't?

171
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,520
Where are you then?

172
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,360
I'll look for you.

173
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,160
I boarded the vehicle.

174
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,240
No, I mean, I'm in a train.

175
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,120
He's in the airport.

176
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,560
Mr. Ai, we missed out on each other.

177
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,400
What should we do?

178
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,640
So, the train station is here.

179
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,400
It's awkward.

180
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,080
Mr. Ai.

181
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,240
What a coincidence.

182
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,080
You're something.

183
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,920
Lugging such a huge suitcase around,

184
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,320
you managed to avoid me

185
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,360
and even ran so quickly.

186
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,800
It's because I didn't wash my hair.

187
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,680
I mean

188
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,120
how could I meet you in this state?

189
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Was that why you're avoiding me?

190
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,680
[Yes.]

191
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,800
[Not only that, I also
didn't wash my face.]

192
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,040
What a slob.

193
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,880
You must be Zeng Li's colleague.

194
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,840
Hi, I'm Ai Jing Chu.

195
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,320
Hi.

196
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,040
I'm an editor at Huaxi Publishing Company.

197
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,560
I...

198
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,480
We're doing a book exchange.

199
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,320
Why don't I

200
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,030
give you a ride home?

201
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,200
To be honest,

202
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,320
I've had enough

203
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,200
of public display of
affection for the day.

204
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,880
I need to digest it.

205
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,080
I'll get going. Bye.

206
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,040
Take care.

207
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,960
Let's go.

208
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:43,960
Zeng Li.

209
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,440
How tall are you?

210
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,280
I'm 1.67 metres.

211
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,400
I'm 1.87 metres.

212
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,400
Are you trying to show off your height?

213
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,840
No, what I want to say is

214
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,000
if I stand at this angle

215
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,280
and look at your head,

216
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,000
it's really oily.

217
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,080
Don't follow me.

218
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't follow me.

219
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,520
Slow down.

220
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,000
Stop running

221
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,920
or you're going to fall!

222
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,040
Oh right.

223
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,400
I don't think I've ever

224
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,280
heard you mentioning

225
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,320
your father.

226
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,240
Are you offended?

227
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,400
You don't have to tell

228
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,760
if you don't feel like telling me.

229
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,520
It's nothing.

230
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,520
It's just that my parents

231
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
divorced

232
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,480
when I was in high school.

233
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,560
Since I chose to be with my other,

234
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,600
my father minds that a lot.

235
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,880
Later, he remarried

236
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,800
and they had my brother.

237
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,400
However, he's still the same,

238
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,080
doing nothing at home,

239
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,920
expecting others to do the work instead.

240
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,000
His current wife

241
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,360
is not as fierce as my mother.

242
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,520
So it's still okay.

243
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,040
What's wrong?

244
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,600
Why are you suddenly
asking about my family?

245
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,520
Nothing.

246
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,320
I just wanted

247
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,600
to try to know you better.

248
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,480
Tell me.

249
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,920
If Zeng Li saw

250
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
this message from Yu Yi,

251
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,240
will she be overjoyed?

252
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,880
It's highly possible.

253
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,960
Zeng Li, wake up.

254
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:10,800
Look,

255
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,200
whose message is this from?

256
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,480
He said he's back.

257
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,240
Where is he back?

258
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,280
We saw it

259
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,760
half an hour ago.

260
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,880
Out of respect for the parties involved,

261
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,880
[Yu Yi]

262
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,680
-we waited so long for you.
[Xiao Yu'er,]

263
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,400
[I'm back.]

264
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,320
[Zeng Li,]

265
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,560
[I'm Yu Yi.]

266
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,680
[Long time no see.]

267
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,040
[I'm back]

268
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,960
[and I'm probably not going
back to the U.S.]

269
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,640
So, he came back to China

270
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,880
and plans to stay for good.

271
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,560
How long has it been since
you two met each other?

272
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,320
Four and a half years.

273
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,280
You remember it so clearly.

274
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,480
You haven't met each other for so long.

275
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,600
I wonder if Yu Yi

276
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,840
is still as handsome

277
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,560
as he was

278
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,520
when he was in university.

279
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,520
I think you two shouldn't meet.

280
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,440
Many online relationships end when
two people decide to meet up.

281
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,800
In your memory,

282
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,200
he's still the teenager.

283
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
When you meet each
other, you might realise

284
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,920
he's gone bald for years.

285
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,200
No way.

286
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,360
We've been keeping in touch.

287
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,880
Besides, a few months ago, his parents

288
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,720
visited him in in the U.S.

289
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,920
They sent me photos.

290
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,640
What's interesting is that

291
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,800
a few months ago, Zeng Li

292
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,360
still mentioned Yu Yi often,

293
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,160
yet she suddenly stopped
mentioning him in recent months.

294
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,720
Why?

295
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,320
I wonder why.

296
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,240
Medical Assistance to African Nations

297
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,160
plans announcement.

298
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,880
Check out the details below.

299
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,240
Our dental centre hospital

300
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
will send a doctor

301
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,000
and a nurse.

302
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,240
That means it'll be the both of us.

303
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,120
Why are you asking me along?

304
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,760
Are you thinking about abandoning me?

305
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,200
Why do you

306
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,080
think so highly of yourself?

307
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,000
Why does it have to be you?

308
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,120
Look.

309
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,280
Mr. Ai is

310
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,920
our mainstay.

311
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,440
Professor Wang is old

312
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,480
and had a bypass surgery not long ago.

313
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,160
The only people left are the interns.

314
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,280
We can't send them, right?

315
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,680
If we do the calculation,

316
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,360
we're the only ones left.

317
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,160
You're right.

318
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,760
I know, right?

319
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
In that case, go ahead

320
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,920
and contribute to China-African relations.

321
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,920
No, wait.

322
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,000
Aren't you joining me?

323
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,560
Hi.

324
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,000
Who are you looking for?

325
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,480
I'm looking for Dr. Ai Jing Chu.

326
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,440
His office is in that direction, right?

327
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,320
Wait a second,

328
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,920
why are you barging in?

329
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,720
Wait!

330
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,960
-Will you go with me?
-Wait!

331
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,400
Don't go in!

332
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,200
Dr. Ai,

333
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,960
do you have a moment?

334
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,680
Zeng Li,

335
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,160
be honest.

336
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
You haven't been dating anyone.

337
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Are you waiting for Yu Yi?

338
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,840
Are you?

339
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,520
I tell others that's not the truth.

340
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,840
I tell myself that, too.

341
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,840
Actually, I'm waiting

342
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,960
for a person whom I really like,

343
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,320
instead of a specific person.

344
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,560
A colleague once

345
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,040
introduced someone to me.

346
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,440
When I saw the photo,

347
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,040
I realised he resembled Yu Yi,

348
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,760
especially

349
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,560
when he smiled.

350
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,480
Usually I won't go

351
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,440
on this kind of date.

352
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,920
In the end, I still went.

353
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,600
What happened next?

354
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,200
At the beginning,

355
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,000
the chat went quite well.

356
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,320
His personality also resembled Yu Yi's.

357
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
He's good at chatting

358
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,080
and finding topics of conversation.

359
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,200
Once the conversation got deeper,

360
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,680
he suddenly told me to resign,

361
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,160
saying

362
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,280
young people should engage

363
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,400
in more exciting jobs.

364
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,280
That's when I realised

365
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,840
he wasn't Yu Yi.

366
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,960
Yu Yi is bolder

367
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
and able to consider things from
the other person's perspective.

368
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,680
No matter how mundane it is,

369
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,280
in his eyes

370
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,800
it's always interesting.

371
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,960
Therefore,

372
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,240
I came to my senses at that moment

373
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,560
and realise

374
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,880
I couldn't lie to myself.

375
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,240
The person I'm waiting for

376
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,600
is Yu Yi.

377
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Now you've finally gotten your wish.

378
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,560
He came back from the U.S.

379
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,120
and plans to stay for good.

380
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,440
Dr. Ai,

381
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
this person is unreasonable.

382
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,200
He barged in after asking where you were.

383
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,640
I already told him you're
getting off from work soon,

384
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,400
yet he still insisted on going in.

385
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,720
What's wrong with you?

386
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,240
This... You're even lying down.

387
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,480
Dr. Ai, he...

388
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,520
Open your mouth.

389
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,480
All done.

390
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,200
Fourth-degree caries.

391
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,600
The four teeth inside

392
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,560
are basically rotten.

393
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,440
There's no other way

394
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,560
except extraction.

395
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,920
Seriously?

396
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,680
Don't scare me.

397
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,080
Once you lie on the hospital bed,

398
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,760
you have to listen to me.

399
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,960
You...

400
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,400
I'm sorry.

401
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,440
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

402
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,520
All right, that's enough.

403
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,160
However,

404
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,680
you do have slight caries.

405
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,760
Make an appointment

406
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,520
and I'll sort it out for you.

407
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,080
Sure.

408
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,960
Do you two know each other?

409
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,200
We've been friends

410
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,560
for eight years.

411
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,160
If you two have nothing else to do,

412
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,840
you can get off from work.

413
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,840
Let's go.

414
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,240
Not bad, Dr. Ai.

415
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,760
The entire corridor

416
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,960
is full of your photos.

417
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,840
However,

418
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,120
the photos were badly taken.

419
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,840
You look a decade older in the photos.

420
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,120
That's good.

421
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,800
It's more convincing that way.

422
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,920
Didn't you say

423
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,560
you'd look for me tomorrow?

424
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,200
It's a surprise.

425
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,280
You asked me to bring you

426
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
some books on dentistry.

427
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,200
I brought everything I could.

428
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,560
These will keep you reading
for a few days.

429
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:27,880
This...

430
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,080
There're so many books.

431
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,240
How did you bring these back?

432
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,200
No need to be so touched.

433
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,320
I know you read very quickly.

434
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,000
That's why

435
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,120
I brought you enough this time.

436
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,960
I'm a good friend, right?

437
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,280
In the past, when I
walked by shop windows

438
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,840
and see beautiful clothes,

439
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,880
I'd think,

440
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
once Yu Yi came back,

441
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,280
I'd

442
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,400
wear the beautiful dress

443
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,840
to meet him.

444
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,000
I even fantasised

445
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,720
that when he came back,

446
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,120
how I should

447
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,920
greet him

448
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,840
or casually

449
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,160
switch the topic

450
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,400
to whether he had a girlfriend.

451
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,840
However, for an unknown reason,

452
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,000
when Yu Yi texted me on WeChat,

453
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,280
I realised

454
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,960
that recently,

455
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,120
I hadn't been thinking about this a lot.

456
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,560
That means

457
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,960
you

458
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,440
are in love with Dr. Ai.

459
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,000
Of course you have no time

460
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,200
to think about Yu Yi anymore.

461
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,760
Not necessarily.

462
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,360
In this world,

463
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,760
do you know what is the thing

464
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,400
that people think about the most?

465
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,000
What a person can't get
or what that gets away.

466
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,400
For example, a rabbit

467
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,280
doesn't have a carrot.

468
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,400
All it has is a cabbage.

469
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,160
It'll think cabbage is tasty.

470
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,360
However, if a carrot is hanging

471
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,560
right in front of you

472
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,680
and you can reach it

473
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,520
by taking two steps forward,

474
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,440
of course you'll jump

475
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,360
to reach the carrot.

476
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,360
Can you resist it?

477
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,320
What if you finally

478
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,200
eat the carrot,

479
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,360
and realise the cabbage

480
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,480
is more to your taste?

481
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,160
You have to eat it

482
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,440
before you know how it tastes.

483
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,800
When you two put it this way,

484
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,480
I realise I'm becoming

485
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,080
more pretentious.

486
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,960
Yu Yi and Mr. Ai

487
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,800
are

488
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,720
outstanding people.

489
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,960
What gives me the right

490
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,080
to choose between them
as if they're vegetables,

491
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,520
right?

492
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,480
You two

493
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,560
are my best friends.

494
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,920
That's why you're making it so dramatic.

495
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,160
Look.

496
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,200
[The Story of Xiao Yu and Xiao Yu'er]

497
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,880
If Dr. Ai

498
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,040
sees this novel,

499
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,440
what will he think?

500
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,680
Dr. Ai doesn't know

501
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,280
this novel

502
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,000
is based on a true story.

503
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,960
I'm actually looking forward
to Yu Yi's thoughts

504
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,319
when he sees this novel.

505
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,720
The two of them

506
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,040
will never read this
kind of romance novel.

507
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,400
Don't be so sure.

508
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,400
Isn't it going to be

509
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,160
the book's signing event soon?

510
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,120
What if it becomes a bestseller?

511
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,160
No,

512
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,520
I don't want to be popular.

513
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,200
From now on, this novel

514
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,440
will

515
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,040
disappear

516
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,320
in our cafe.

517
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,320
That's right.

518
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,560
The Story of Xiao Yu and Xiao Yu'er.

519
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,920
Third chapter.

520
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,760
Where's the third chapter?

521
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,920
Let's see

522
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,440
if there's any content

523
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,160
that isn't suitable for kids.

524
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
Let me see.

525
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,800
No, there isn't!

526
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,400
[I didn't expect Yu Yi to come back]

527
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,040
[so suddenly.]

528
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,040
[How should I face him?]

529
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,800
[Also, what does he think of me?]

530
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,880
[My head hurts.]

531
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,000
Eat slowly.

532
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,640
Nobody is going to snatch it from you.

533
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,720
It's so delicious.

534
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,920
Judging by what you just said,

535
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,920
you mean

536
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,240
your return to China

537
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,200
is equal to demotion and
salary reduction in a way?

538
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,240
It's more or less the same.

539
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,160
The remuneration is indeed

540
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,200
not as good as back in the U.S.

541
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,600
However, over here,

542
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,720
I can look after my family,

543
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,360
right?

544
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,440
The boy is all grown up.

545
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:37,960
Come on.

546
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,920
After all, we're going

547
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,800
to turn 30 years old soon.

548
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,000
Don't include me in this case.

549
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,280
I'm two years younger than you.

550
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,200
Not if you round up the numbers.

551
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,320
Don't mind this.

552
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,720
How is it, Mr. Ai?

553
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,080
Do you have a girlfriend?

554
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,760
You know what?

555
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,200
I'm into a girl now.

556
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,960
Really?

557
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,120
Before this, I didn't tell you,

558
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,560
because I was considering

559
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,800
whether I should come
back to China or not.

560
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,200
Therefore, I also didn't dare

561
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,160
to think about that.

562
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,240
I didn't want to waste her time either.

563
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,880
Now that you've come back,

564
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,080
you can focus

565
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,880
on this matter.

566
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,960
I'm not sure whether

567
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,760
she has a boyfriend.

568
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,720
Here's what I'm thinking.

569
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,880
I plan to treat her to a meal,

570
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,280
but I haven't met her for so long.

571
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,600
I'll need someone to
liven up the atmosphere

572
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,600
and that's you.

573
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,240
Me?

574
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
It's strange lately.

575
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,400
People keep asking me to be their wingman.

576
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,160
Dr. Ai,

577
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,160
who taught you

578
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,040
this Internet slang?

579
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,840
Here, have a chicken wing,

580
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,960
your favourite.

581
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,120
Sure.

582
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,480
Back in the U.S.,

583
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,200
when I ate roast chicken
with Zhang and the rest,

584
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,240
they'd fight with me over chicken wings.

585
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,600
It's good to eat with you.

586
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,840
You like to eat drumsticks

587
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
and my favourite is chicken wings.

588
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,520
Oh right.

589
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,840
I have yet to tell you

590
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,480
about something.

591
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,040
Nowadays,

592
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,400
I like to eat chicken wings, too.

593
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
Really?

594
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,720
You can have it.

595
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
I'm joking.

596
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,920
Eat it.

597
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,880
You scared me.

598
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,320
I almost cut ties with you.

599
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,440
Come on.

600
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,800
Come on, it's a bonus for heartbreak.

601
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,240
Happy breakup to us.

602
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,240
Come on, let me see your face.

603
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,400
She even scratched
your face with her nails?

604
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,400
That's not it.

605
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,640
She just slapped me.

606
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,760
Your face bled from a slap?

607
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,400
Yes.

608
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,200
That's the part

609
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,120
I must learn the lesson.

610
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,840
Next time,

611
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,040
I have to see whether the girl

612
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,800
does manicure

613
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,920
and whether her nails

614
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,800
are gem-studded.

615
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,200
Besides,

616
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,360
she's the one who wanted a breakup.

617
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,400
Why was I

618
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:36,960
slapped instead?

619
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,960
I don't believe in you.

620
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,760
If you did nothing wrong,

621
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,640
would she have slapped you?

622
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,600
So, she wanted to break up with you.

623
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,200
What did you tell her?

624
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,080
I said okay.

625
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,120
Come on, let me see your face.

626
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,120
Look.

627
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,000
Poor fellow.

628
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,560
Let me blow it.

629
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,040
I'll slap you, too.

630
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,280
You deserve it.

631
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,680
[Outpatient Building]

632
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,600
200 joules, twice.

633
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,800
Again, 360 joules this time.

634
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,680
Dr. Wu.

635
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,960
Haven't you gotten off from work?

636
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,920
Didn't I tell you not to come anymore?

637
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,840
You seem be unwell recently.

638
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,040
I made you

639
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,080
chrysanthemum and
Japanese honeysuckle tea.

640
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,800
I don't need it.

641
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,120
Go back.

642
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:41,760
What's wrong?

643
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,080
Are you in a bad mood?

644
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,480
Let's play games together.

645
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,680
Level up by two stars will do.

646
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,520
What about three stars?

647
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,440
Just now, when a patient

648
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,440
arrived at the hospital,

649
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,200
he was still breathing,

650
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,480
but he passed away
while I was treating him.

651
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,520
Sorry.

652
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,520
I don't know what I should
do to make you feel better.

653
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,720
You shouldn't apologise to me.

654
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,600
It's just that

655
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,840
we might be in different worlds.

656
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,720
When it comes to true love,

657
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,640
it exists,

658
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,520
but at the same time, it doesn't.

659
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,800
When two people date,

660
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,600
it's fine as long as they're happy.

661
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,320
When two people are dating,

662
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,640
it's fine as long as they're happy!

663
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,880
Deng Hao Ran's latest quote!

664
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
Ma Yi Yi, record it!

665
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,960
Can you keep your voice down?

666
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,840
Look,

667
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,200
Zeng Li and Wu Ying

668
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,200
met the right kind of men.

669
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,480
Why didn't I?

670
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,600
Tell me.

671
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,440
Tell me.

672
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,880
I promise I won't hit you today.

673
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,040
Do you want to hear the truth?

674
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
How many relationships have you
been in for the past the three years?

675
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,680
Sheng Ming.

676
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,120
Zhang Teng.

677
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,600
What does it have to do with you?

678
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,480
There're good and bad people.

679
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,680
They're incompatible with you.

680
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,120
Besides,

681
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,840
each time you're dating,

682
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,160
it's not because you like the person.

683
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,440
You do it because you're lonely.

684
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,480
In other words,

685
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,000
you get into relationships

686
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
just to have a relationship.

687
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,680
It'll either end up like
you and Zhang Teng,

688
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,920
he realised it sooner than you did

689
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,880
that you're not suitable for each other.

690
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,720
So he broke up with you.

691
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,680
It may even end up like
you and Sheng Ming.

692
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,080
You didn't even know him,

693
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,360
yet you thought so highly of him

694
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,760
and leapt right into the relationship.

695
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,040
Don't cry.

696
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,800
Who's crying?

697
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,320
I'm not criticising you.

698
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,400
I just think

699
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,840
you should stay if you're happy together.

700
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,080
If not, you should end it amicably.

701
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
There's no point keeping it going.

702
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,680
Are you

703
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,720
including yourself?

704
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,280
It's different for us.

705
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,560
In recent years,

706
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,760
we've been dating others.

707
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
In fact, you're just looking for one

708
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,880
who can keep you company

709
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,680
and tolerate your ways,

710
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,280
right?

711
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,600
I'm actually really anxious right now.

712
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,200
In my prime,

713
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,160
if I don't get to meet the one

714
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,520
with whom I can spend the rest of my life,

715
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,480
when I become older,

716
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,840
will I end up a spinster?

717
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,160
That's why

718
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,200
before you delve into a relationship,

719
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,840
you have to think

720
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,200
if you like the person

721
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,960
and whether you're
suitable for each other.

722
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,160
Do you just want

723
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,880
a person to keep you company?

724
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,000
I know you're unhappy,

725
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,200
but if you need my company,

726
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,040
I'll be here by your side.

727
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'll be quiet

728
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,280
and not say a single word.

729
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,960
Liu Yu Cheng,

730
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,120
you don't need

731
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,040
to revolve your life around me.

732
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,360
Both of us

733
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,400
have our own things to do.

734
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,600
I'm very happy to be keeping you company.

735
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,960
You're only 21 years old.

736
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,800
You should enjoy

737
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,680
your university life

738
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,320
and the best age

739
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
in your life.

740
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,080
Whether it's taking part
in club activities,

741
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,640
gaming with your friends,

742
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,960
having a meal with someone,

743
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,040
going on a date, watching a movie

744
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,720
or being in a relationship,

745
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
it's still better than spending time

746
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,120
in the emergency department all day.

747
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,400
It'll bring more value than this, right?

748
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,720
You don't have to worry about me.

749
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,240
I do time management every day.

750
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,240
Keeping you company is
what I have to do daily.

751
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,400
It's also what I wish to do.

752
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,480
It's time for me to return

753
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,440
to the lifestyle of my age.

754
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,400
Write papers, get qualifications,
do consultations,

755
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,840
accompany my parents,

756
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,080
as well as

757
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,280
marrying a person.

758
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Do you think

759
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,800
I can't marry you?

760
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,920
Is that why you're ignoring me?

761
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
I may be young,

762
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,080
but I'm really

763
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,880
a responsible person.

764
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,400
If you're willing,

765
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,520
I can marry you anytime.

766
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,320
What you're saying is very childish.

767
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
You haven't even reached

768
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,960
the legal age to marry.

769
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,800
Who knows whether

770
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,440
you'll stay in China

771
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,400
or return to Malaysia?

772
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,160
Since the beginning, the both of us

773
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,320
have nothing in common.

774
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,480
Blending into each other's life forcibly

775
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,240
will only make everything worse.

776
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,920
I've gone back

777
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,000
to my usual pace.

778
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,600
You should go back, too.

779

780
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,680
Please don't say that.

781
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,480
I have no idea

782
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,600
why you're suddenly saying this.

783
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,360
However, I think what you're wrong.

784
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,080
Right now,

785

I don't know how to counter your argument.

786

787
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,400

788
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,000
all these aren't issues.

789
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,520
No,

790
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,840
I'll prove to you with my actions

791
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,920
that we can be together.

00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,320
your mother is here to visit your father.

795
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,960
She's worried it'll interrupt your work.

796
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,160
So she didn't come to you.

797
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,960
If you aren't busy,

798
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,920
do you want to drop by?

799
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,800
I'll go over now.

800
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,560
Your mother is also here.

801
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,520
Go back.

802
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,080
You really don't have to come anymore.

803
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,440
Do you want to go upstairs together?

804
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,280
Maybe later.

805
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,120
Your bottle.

806
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,480
I gave it to Wu Ying.

807
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,000
The nurses from their department say

808
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,280
you bring her lunch every day.

809
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,960
She doesn't want to eat it, I think.

810
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,520
Why are you wasting your time

811
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,480
on her?

812
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,000
What's your relationship with Wu Ying?

813
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,240
We're friends now.

814
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,760
It's been three months since I was
transferred to Donghu University Hospital.

815
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,960
To be frank,

816
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,840
we'll be more than friends.

817
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,600
I can tell

818
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,760
that she has no feelings for you at all.

819
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,720
Only a young man

820
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,480
of your age

821
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,760
will think of feelings

822
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,000
as the only requirement
for a relationship.

823
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,280
What else?

824
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,720
Only when two people have
feelings for each other

825
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,960
that they can be together, right?

826
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,120
In a relationship,

827
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,240
feelings are only a small part of it.

828
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,520
First of all,

829
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,240
you're six years younger than her.

830
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,200
Do you think this is just

831
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,600
a number?

832
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,400
That means you lack

833
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,960
six years' worth of social
experiences, compared to her.

834
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,720
Don't you understand?

835
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,760
Let me put it this way.

836
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,560
A woman her age

837
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,160
is mostly in a stable relationship,

838
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,480
being financially stable

839
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,720
and having

840
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,640
a few branded bags.

841
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,640
Can you give her any of these?

842
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,240
You can't.

843
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,680
You bring her food everyday

844
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,880
and sweet-talk her every day.

845
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,400
That will work for a little girl,

846
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,880
but you aren't able to provide

847
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,600
a sense of security to
a woman who is mature.

848
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,320
Wu Ying and you

849
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,120
aren't suitable for each other.

You want a divorce, right?

[her mother immediately said...]

950
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,160
Our daughter will live with me.

951
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,040
You're divorced. If you
get her a stepfather,

952
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,800
what is she going to do?

953
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
Other than giving his daughter

954
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,880
a surname,

955
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,920
what else has he given her?

956
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,040
What do you mean I didn't raise her?

her feelings,

961
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,160
even if it's just a little?

962
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,160
Let's go.

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,159
[She thought]

970
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,600
[she's very fortunate.]

Are you afraid?

If you're afraid,

978
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:36,880
you can hold my hand

979
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,480
or my sleeve.

980
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,199
[He knows her fear,]
