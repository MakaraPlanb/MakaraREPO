Come on.

202
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,080
You should go home and keep
your girlfriend company.

203
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,400
You guys did your best today.

204
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,080
I'm happy.

205
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm not going.

206
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,720
Once we meet,

207
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,080
she's going to nag me again.

208
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,840
Asking me to

209
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,720
clear my contacts.

210
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,360
I'm not going. It's such a pain.

211
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,720
To be honest,
I understand how she feels.

212
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:07,880
You do

213
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,720
make others feel insecure.

214
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,120
In the past,

215
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,440
I thought there was
nothing wrong with me.

216
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
However, all of you are

217
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,760
saying I'm the problem.

218
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,680
Right now,

219
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm starting to think
I might have a problem.

220
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,480
However,

221
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
a relationship plays a small part

222
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,440
in my life.

223
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,240
It's impossible for me to

224
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
devote my feelings completely.

225
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:23,880
Haven't

226
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
you ever considered

227
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,080
investing more

228
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
in a relationship?

229
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,280
Drink up.

230
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,880
Did you know?

231
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,560
I thought I met

232
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,800
a good man this time.

233
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,600
I can't believe I dated

234
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,400
another cheater.

235
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,520
Honestly,

236
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,560
as a man,

237
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,000
I understand where he's coming from.

238
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,600
What I mean is

239
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,240
you're gorgeous after all.

240
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
You're adorable, cheerful,

241
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,840
fit,

242
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
and feminine.

243
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,720
Go on. Don't stop complimenting me.

244
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,440
Also...

245
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,000
What else?

246
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,840
That's all.

247
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,360
What?

248
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,520
That's all?

249
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,720
I did my best.

250
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,640
If that man

251
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,680
met a

252
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,800
better woman,

253
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,720
he definitely be attracted.

254
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,280
Am I right?

255
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,600
Do you remember Wang Xiao Fei?

256
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,520
The muscular dude

257
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,480
from your basketball club.

258
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,240
Yes.

259
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,760
Some time ago,

260
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,240
he gathered a few of us out

261
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,840
for drinks.

262
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,560
He asked us,

263
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,800
what to do?

264
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,720
I met a better and

265
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,280
prettier girl who's pursuing me.

266
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,480
I like her as well,

267
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,560
but I think

268
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,600
it's unfair for my girlfriend.

269
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,800
He asked us what should he do.

270
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,760
What do you think
he should have done?

271
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,159
Well...

272
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,320
What did you say?

273
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,520
Our captain said this.

274
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,040
I remember it to this moment.

275
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,159
As your brother,

276
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,360
of course I want you to

277
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,560
be with a better woman.

278
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,000
However, as a man,

279
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,200
I think you should

280
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,800
bear responsibility for
your girlfriend's youth.

281
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,080
Your girlfriend also rejected

282
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,800
better men.

283
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,520
If you made your decision then,

284
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,520
you should bear responsibility.

285
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,320
Love

286
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,760
only comes in two forms.

287
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,560
The first

288
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
is the excitement brought upon

289
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,400
by hormones.

290
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,040
The second form

291
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,560
is the feelings accumulated after

292
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,760
two have dated for a long time.

293
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,000
If he could give his current

294
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,240
girlfriend up for you,

295
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,400
when he meets

296
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,440
someone new,

297
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,280
and dumps you,

298
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,960
what are you going to do?

299
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,840
Ma Yi Yi.

300
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,320
You crave

301
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
security.

302
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,160
You won't be able to take it.

303
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,840
Drink up.

304
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,400
That's all you can do.

305
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,880
Drink on your own.

306
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,400
Are you upset?

307
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,680
Let's go on the swing.

308
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,720
We're flying.

309
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,440
I haven't pushed you.

310
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,400
Push me again.

311
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:57,760
One more time.

312
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,680
One more time.

313
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,680
No.

314
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,920
One more time.

315
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,200
Dr. Ai.

316
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,680
Have you

317
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,160
heard from Sister Zeng Li

318
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,520
about Wu Ying's

319
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,800
private account on Weibo?

320
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,240
No. What's the matter?

321
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,240
I was just wondering

322
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,440
what's going on with Wu Ying.

323
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,000
She has been distant lately.

324
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,880
I just found out recently.

325
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,440
It seems like the way
women think about problems

326
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,600
is different from us.

327
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,640
Last night, when I was

328
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,520
sending Zeng Li home,

329
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,160
the radio narrated a
story of a girl who

330
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,840
feels unimportant and upset because

331
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,120
the guy chose to

332
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,840
confess his feelings to her

333
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,640
by the food stall.

334
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:37,919
That's true.

335
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,760
I got in trouble a few times as well.

336
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,360
Last time, we were
enjoying Mala Soup.

337
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,200
I confessed to Wu Ying
for the first time

338
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,400
and was brutally rejected.

339
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,920
After that, I fail each time

340
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,360
I confess.

341
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,320
Dr. Ai.

342
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,560
If you were to

343
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,000
confess your feelings
to Sister Zeng Li,

344
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,000
you should plan it well.

345
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,240
I will.

346
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,000
What's wrong?

347
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,720
Dr. Ai, you...

348
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,200
If I mentioned this in the past,

349
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,920
you'd immediately

350
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,720
explain how you and
Zeng Li are just friends

351
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,840
or you'd change the subject.

352
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,400
You're admitting to your feelings

353
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,320
openly right now.

354
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,000
That means

355
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,720
you're treating me as your brother.

356
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,840
I'm moved, Dr. Ai.

357
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,400
Don't worry.

358
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,440
I'll be the best wingman

359
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,880
and help with the success
of your confession.

360
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
I've you to thank then.

361
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,560
If that's the case,

362
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,040
let's work out for another 15 minutes.

363
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,680
All right.

364
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,240
Dr. Ai.

365
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,640
Do you have a detailed plan?

366
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,040
Not at the moment.

367
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,040
However, I want

368
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,360
an unique

369
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,960
and memorable confession.

370
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,920
Leave it to me.

371
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,480

938
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,480
[The neighbours told her the
oil lamp represents the soul.]

939
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,120
[It cannot be extinguished
for three days.]

940
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,760
[It's a bad sign if
the lamp goes out.]

941
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,920
[In regards to the specifics]

942
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,220
[Libation]

943
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,040
[of what the bad sign means,]

944
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,960
[Xiao Yu'er dared not probe.]

945
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,560
[On the final year of 9th grade,]

946
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,120
[there weren't night
self-learning scheduled.]

947
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,400
[Because her parents were busy,]

948
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,480
[Xiao Yu'er would attend
extra classes on her own]

949
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,240
[and return home alone.]

950
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,560
[Every day after arriving
at her own doorstep,]

951
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,280
[she'd feel uneasy.]

952
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,880
[She'd chant silently in her heart.]

953
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,680
[Please do not argue today.]

954
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,120
[Please do not argue today.]

955
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,560
Hold on. Why do you

956
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,760
always misinterpret

957
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,360
what others mean?

958
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,840
I said,

959
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,480
since we've decided to
spend the money,

960
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,080
we should

961
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,480
recruit a credible teacher

962
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,160
for Li.

963
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,160
Did you know

964
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,040
how much it costs

965
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,280
to hire a tutor per class?

966
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,240
Can you even afford it?

967
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,040
In short,

968
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,400
you're whining that I'm poor.

969
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,960
Go and find someone richer then.

970
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:09,880
Go on.

971
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:10,920
Go ahead and throw it.

972
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,880
[Xiao Yu'er stood before the crowd.]

973
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,159
[Some of the neighbours
were breaking up the fight.]

974
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,239
[Some were judging her.]

975
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,080
[However,]

976
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,159
[some of the stares were sighing.]

977
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,480
[That child is pitiful.]

978
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,280
All you want

979
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:24,920
is a rich husband.

980
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
[Because of this, Xiao Yu'er]

981
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,840
[would have]

982
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,520
[the same dream for countless nights.]

983
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,080
[She'd dream of walking onto the street]

984
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,520
[or among the crowd,...]

985
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
I'm done with life!

986
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,400
[She walked for a long time]

987
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,360
[until many started staring at her,]

988
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,440
[till she realised]

989
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,920
[she forgot to put on clothes.]

990
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,600
[Are these true,]

991
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,440
[Zeng Li?]

992
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,800
[Was this how you grew up?]

993
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,840
[Xiao Yu'er used to think]

994
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,160
[the darkness in her life]

995
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,240
[would go on forever]

996
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,280
[until the day,]

997
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,960
[her mother requested
a relative's son]

998
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,600
[to tutor Xiao Yu'er with her studies.]

999
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,800
[That's how Xiao Yu]

1000
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,280
[entered Xiao Yu'er's world.]
