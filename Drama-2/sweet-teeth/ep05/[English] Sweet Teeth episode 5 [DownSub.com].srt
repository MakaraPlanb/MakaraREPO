00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,050
Please bless me with
a wonderful marriage.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,520
Look after my best friends

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,640
Zeng Li and Wu Ying.

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,760
Please.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,540
Pass it to me.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,300
Thanks.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,980
I apologise.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,140
My colleagues were unctuous.

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,870
You're known to be most
popular around here.

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,290
No, they were fooling around.

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,510
Not many young women

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,920
work at the library anyway.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,200
Initially, Wu Wan Xia and
I were unmarried.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,920
They started promoting us

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,520
and gave us the title.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,920
Last year, unexpectedly,

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,150
Wu Wan Xia got married as well.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,320
Your colleagues told me

20
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,000
you've never dated anyone.

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,880
Would what happened today

22
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,390
hamper your prospects?

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,310
My apologies.

24
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,250
Not at all.

25
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,520
I should be apologising.

26
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,800
They just wanted to

27
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,990
find me a boyfriend.

28
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,070
There were several candidates.

29
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,070
After a few days,

30
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,560
they'd forget all about this.

31
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,470
It seems like

32
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,920
you've many rumoured
boyfriends as well.

33
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,120
You're right.

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,320
I've only met most of them once.

35
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,450
I don't even remember
what they look like.

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,460
Well, I guess I'm the one

37
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,880
that left the deepest impression.

38
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,039
Xiao Chu.

39
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,800
Auntie, you're here.

40
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,150
I heard you spent the night together.

41
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,160
Auntie, don't be ridiculous.

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,710
She's right there. You shouldn't...

43
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,229
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,780
That's not what I meant.

45
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,750
Don't take it personally.

46
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,810
It's alright.

47
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,640
Xiao Chu.

48
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,720
She must be the friend

49
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:41,620
you told me about.

50
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,910
You should introduce us.

51
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,520
This is Zeng Li.

52
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,800
She's a patient of mine.

53
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,840
This is my aunt.

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,620
Hello, auntie.

55
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,140
You look adorably bright.

56
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,590
You look really young too, auntie.

57
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,960
You look like Mr. Ai's sister instead.

58
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,100
Not at all.

59
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,040
Guess how old I am.

60
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,230
[-How do I do that?]
-Auntie.

61
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,260
You can't ask this

62
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,140
each time you meet someone.

63
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,389
I'm just asking.

64
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,840
I was talking to Xiao Zeng.

65
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,180
28.

66
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,680
I'm 35 years old.

67
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,760
You're such a sweet talker.

68
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,040
You're one pretty charmer.

69
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:19,950
That's enough, auntie.

70
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,850
Grandpa is waiting for us.

71
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,730
Let's go.

72
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,700
We're leaving.

73
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,100
-Xiao Zeng.
-Let's go.

74
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,340
Come by to have dinner with us soon.

75
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,880
Xiao Chu will make the arrangements.

76
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,200
Okay. Bye.

77
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,840
That girl was gorgeous.

78
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,550
-Let's hurry up.
-What does she do?

79
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,840
How old is she?

80
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,660
[Sweet Teeth]
[Episode 5]

81
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,540
Hold on.

82
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,680
[Goodness gracious.]

83
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,290
[My prayer worked immediately?]

84
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,090
[Abstinence.]

85
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,230
Did you drop this?

86
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,080
[His voice is so gentle.]

87
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,430
I got it for my dad.

88
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,500
Thanks.

89
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,860
I'm thanking you

90
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,090
for the second time today.

91
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,180
I came to pray for
my grandmother's safety as well.

92
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,430
She underwent a major
surgery recently.

93
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,620
Well,

94
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,130
I hope our prayers were answered.

95
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,960
I shall get going then. Bye.

96
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,780
[He's leaving already?]

97
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,020
[Power off]

98
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,490
Wait up.

99
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,820
My phone ran out of battery.

100
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,800
Can I use your phone

101
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,200
to text a friend?

102
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,420
Sure.

103
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,280
There's no need to thank me again.

104
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,460
[Zeng Li, I'm Ma Yi Yi. My phone ran out
of battery. The road up hill is blocked.]

105
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,900
[I'll meet you at the
hotel a little later.]

106
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,480
Thank...

107
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,050
I shall get going then.

108
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,610
Would you like to watch

109
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,490
the sunset in the evening?

110
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,250
There's nothing much
to do here in Dongshan.

111
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,339
The sunset is mesmerising though.

112
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,850
Perhaps,

113
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,290
you're going on a date with Mr. Ai.

114
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,370
Hold up.

115
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,650
Please take it easy on me.

116
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,650
The entire world has been

117
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,210
pestering me about Ai Jing Chu.

118
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,600
Give me a break.

119
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,920
How pitiful.

120
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,130
I'll let it slide

121
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,800
because I need to
head to the restroom.

122
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,010
I'll wait for you.

123
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:54,620
[Dou Dou]

124
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,110
[Sister Zeng.]

125
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,340
[I heard you went to Dongshan.]

126
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,570
[Can you do me a favour?]

127
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,060
[Last month, my ex-boyfriend and I]

128
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,980
[left a love lock]

129
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,110
[at Yue Lao's temple.]

130
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,940
[It's blue in colour.]

131
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,230
[Can you remove it for me?]

132
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,380
[I came to my senses.]

133
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,390
[I'm going to]

134
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,230
[end it completely before Yue Lao.]

135
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,190
[By the way, the password is 1314.]

136
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
You should go home.

137
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,620
When he ignores me,

138
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,280
I can't sleep nor eat.

139
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,540
No matter what I do,

140
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,770
he's all I think about.

141
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,640
Ai Jing Chu.

142
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,100
What kind of a person are you?

143
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,220
I'm finally here.

144
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:39,180
There are so many.
How am I going to find it?

145
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,810
It's blue.

146
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,780
[Wishing Terrace]

147
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,500
It might be there.

148
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,130
Which one is it?

149
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,909
[Dou Dou.]

150
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,360
[You broke up with Ai Jing Chu.]

151
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,159
[Why are you punishing me?]

152
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,590
Hello.

153
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,040
Mr. Ai, what are you up to?

154
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,150
I'm visiting Dongshan with my family.

155
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,950
The sunset here is mesmerising

156
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,410
so I came by alone.

157
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,290
What's the matter?

158
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,820
I...

159
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,170
I fell in love with a girl.

160
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,900
She's Chinese,

161
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,100
[but she's ignoring me.]

162
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,610
I'm not great with

163
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,560
relationship issues.

164
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,930
I might not be of help.

165
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,409
I'm just feeling dejected.

166
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,800
Just need someone to talk to.

167
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,040
Mr. Ai.

168
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,800
I've never intended to annoy her.

169
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,210
I noticed

170
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,490
she can't seem to
take care of herself

171
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,080
so I wanted to treat her better.

172
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,490
Am I being annoying?

173
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,330
No.

174
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,800
I think you're very sincere

175
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:51,970
and polite.

176
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,090
[Mr. Ai.]

177
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,440
[Are you comforting me?]

178
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,680
I really think these are

179
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,090
some qualities of yours.

180
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,850
Well, I'm not the best

181

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,880
[That's why I admire how initiative]

183
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:08,970
[and warm you are.]

184
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:09,850
Really?

185
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,160
After listening to you,

186
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,040
I feel much better.

187
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,400
I don't know

188
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,600
how to encourage you either.

189
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,810
Well,

00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,840
[all the best.]

191
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,280
All right.

192
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,250
Thanks, Mr. Ai.

193
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,840
Which one is it?

194
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,480
Which one is it?

195
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,250
Look at this one.

196
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,880
This colour is so pretty.

197
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,840
Actually,

198
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,840
I brought one along.

199
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,370
Let me take a look.

200
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,280
It's freezing.

201
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,650
My hip.

202
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,090
Look at the snow.

203
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,240
Let's hang ours here.

204
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,320
Sure.

205
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,080
If only

206
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,570
Ai Jing Chu is here right now.

207
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,210
[That'd save me from this tragedy.]

208
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,840
Zeng Li.

209
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,840
[Am I hallucinating?]

210
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,690
[No, he's real.]

211
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,970
[Why did he show up
just as I thought of him?]

212
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,160
Saviour?

213
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,250
You came.

214
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,920
What are you doing here?

215
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm looking for your love lock.

216
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,890
Hurry up and tell me where it is.

217
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,160
Help me out?

218
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,570
What are you talking about?

219
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,010
The blue lock.

220
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,450
The one you hung it up here
with Dou Dou.

221
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,400
Dou Dou?

222
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Don't you remember her?

223
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,480
Did you hang

224
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,240
more than one lock here?

225
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,570
I think I get it.

226
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,570
Do you recall?

227
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,760
Hurry up and tell me.

228
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,330
I've been looking for a long time.

229
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,040
I finally understood

230
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,850
why you'd behave

231
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,290
so baffling previously.

232
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,130
Honestly,

233
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,680
about what happened
between you and Dou Dou,

234
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,090
I was pretty mad at you.

235
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,090
However, Dou Dou is fine now.

236
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,290
She has decided to
cut all ties with you.

237
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,090
Removing this lock

238
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,040
and everything will be fine.

239
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,570
The blue one?

240
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,800
I'll help you look.

241
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,810
[Help me look?]

242
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,760
Let's get this straight.

243
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,720
It's the other way round.

244
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,520
[You're acting so calm?]

245
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,560
Also,

246
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,690
I searched that area already.

247
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,170
Look for it over there.

248
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,850
Okay.

249
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,050
You'll know once you find it.

250
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,730
He's smiling?

251
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,090
The blue one.

252
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,320
I found it.

253
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,160
Let me take a look.

254
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,520
Let's see what's written on it.

255
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,480
We will always be together.

256
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,640
Dou Dou and Xu...

257
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,090
Xu Heng Heng.

258
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,120
Xu Heng Heng?

259
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,680
Isn't he a...

260
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,560
Yes.

261
00:09:59,050 --> 00:09:59,970
He's a doctor of our faculty.

262
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,970
Like Dou Dou,

263
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,970
he was a student of mine.

264
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,440
What?

265
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,890
That means Dou Dou's ex-boyfriend

266
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,770
wasn't you.

267
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,410
I just found out

268
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,120
I shared such a past
with her today.

269
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:18,850
I'm so sorry.

270
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,760
I didn't know...

271
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,090
I'm so sorry.

272
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,920
I didn't know you weren't

273
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,800
Dou Dou's ex-boyfriend.

274
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,010
I was really mean to you

275
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:28,800
in the past.

276
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,490
What's the password?

277
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,010
Wait.

278
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,000
I was really rude

279
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,280
and offensive in the past.

280
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,090
I'm apologising this instance.

281
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:33,610
I'm sorry.

282
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,490
The password.

283
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,040
1314.

284
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,130
It's done.

285
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,160
I'm sorry.

286
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,040
You're forgiven.

287
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,480
Xu Heng Heng?

288
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,360
He looks nice.

289
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,840
He didn't look like a player.

290
00:10:59,050 --> 00:10:59,970
Do I look like one?

291
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,810
[Do...]

292
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,330
[Think carefully before you answer.]

293
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,520
[I can only]

294
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,720
[fill the grave I dug for myself.]

295
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,090
Mr. Ai, you're understanding
and considerate.

296
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,090
Don't hold a grudge against me.

297
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,130
Fine.

298
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,400
Let's

299
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,090
forget this incident completely.

300
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,730
However, Mr. Ai,

301
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,090
you just recovered not long ago.

302
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,330
Why did you come up the hill

303
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,570
instead of resting in your hotel?

304
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,210
I heard the sunsets at
Dongshan is mesmerising

305
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,690
so I wanted to check it out.

306
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,040
Well...

307
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,360
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

308
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,440
It's fine.

309
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,240
I couldn't make it anyway.

310
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,320
I'm taking a move.

311
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:40,800
I know a shortcut.

312
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,560
If we're fast enough,

313
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
we might be able to
catch the sunset.

314
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,640
Let's go.

315
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,300
[Wishing Terrace]

316
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:48,850
It's over there.

317
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,890
Stop talking.

318
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,770
Your throat is sore.

319
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,810
These are some lozenges.

320
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:01,760
This is

321
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,690
the dinner I made for you.

322
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,120
There's a kitchen at our dorm.

323
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,040
It's really clean.

324
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,730
Don't worry.

325
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,720
I'm worried it'd not suit your taste,

326
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,840
so I made the flavours strong.

327
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,170
Remember to enjoy it.

328
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,920
I'm leaving.

329
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,040
Bye.

330
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,560
By the way,

331
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,770
do not consume

332
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,060
too many lozenges at once.

333
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,340
You should stay hydrated

334
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,460
and drink warm water,

335
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,460
not cold water.

336
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,150
I'm leaving. Goodbye.

337
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,750
This is the sincerest
one I've ever met.

338
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,700
Drink warm water instead.

339
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,660
[To: Wu Ying]

340
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,420
Mr. Ai, wait up.

341
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,790
I can't go on.

342
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,820
You should go ahead.

343
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,280
Watching the sunset alone

344
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,180
is pretty boring.

345
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,220
Let's go together.

346
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,980
I can't. My legs are failing.

347
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,030
Let me take a breather.

348
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,520
Shall I

349
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,390
help you up there?

350
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,070
All right.

351
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,720
We're almost there.

352
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,460
What do you think?

353
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,750
Thankfully I insist
to complete the hike.

354
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,460
It's breath taking.

355
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,560
What's the matter?

356
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,520
I was reminded

357
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,720
of a rumour I read

358
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,640
on the Tieba.

359
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,070
What was it about?

360
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,850
Your side profile was claimed

361
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,410
to have killed many.

362
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,240
It seems like

363
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,000
the rumours were pretty accurate.

364
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,570
What do you mean by my side profile?

365
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,670
Are you implying

366
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,990
that your entire face
is good looking too?

367
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,850
Mr. Ai.

368
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,240
Your skin is probably made of

369
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,240
titanium alloy.

370
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,570
The quality sounds good.

371
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,320
By the way,

372
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,370
do you know how to

373
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,510
determine if one's side profile

374
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,360
is good looking or not?

375
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,480
Are there standards for that?

376
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,090
According to the Asian
beauty standards,

377
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,280
if the tips of the
nose, mouth and chin

378
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,360
could be connected

379
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,210
in a straight line,

380
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,620
that'd create

381
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,820
a perfect silhouette.

382
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,880
The tips of the nose, mouth and chin

383
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,190
connected in a straight line.

384
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,240
Well, you didn't have to
straighten your teeth.

385
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,850
You were already

386
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:18,920
pretty to begin with.

387
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,440
Your cheeks are flushed.

388
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,250
No.

389
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,040
It was the sunset.

390
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,560
Look at yourself if
you don't believe me.

391
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,800
You're flushed too.

392
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,560
Zeng Li.

393
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,370
Since the misunderstanding
was clarified,

394
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:54,930
does that mean

395
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,370
you no longer despise me as much?

396
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,329
You're

397
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,890
looking

398
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,180
more like a kind person.

399
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,079
I am a kind person to begin with.

400
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,890
Yes, you are.

401
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,480
Anyway,

402
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,369
Donghu University is over there.

403
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,520
Really?

404
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,359
My house

405
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,369
is around

406
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,920
that area.

407
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,900
You could see that far away?

408
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,010
Of course.

409
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,890
My house is over there.

410
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,640
Your house is here?

411
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,000
Dear bed.

412
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,690
Who are you?

413
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,630
Ma Yi Yi.

414
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,220
I was scared to death.

415
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,020
When did you come by?

416
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,300
I arrived an hour ago.

417
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:07,700
I texted you.

418
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,580
You didn't read it?

419
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,380
Wait.

420
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,380
Sister.

421
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,260
At this day and age,

422
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,070
besides Taobao shop owners

423
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:13,740
and delivery couriers,

424
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,620
who still texts?

425
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,520
I do.

426
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,590
Wait.

427
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,670
This number doesn't belong to you.

428
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,630
Pass me your phone.

429
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,660
[Search: Sheng Ming]

430
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,010
Sheng Ming.

431
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,440
Does it sound good?

432
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,350
It's a great name.

433
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,050
Who is he?

434
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,520
The man of my fate bestowed upon me

435
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
by the Sansheng Stone.

436
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,410
Sounds interesting.

437
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,460
Explain yourself.

438
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,340
I'm not the one who
should be explaining.

439
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,610
You are.

440
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,650
Didn't your boyfriend
return with you?

441
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,370
What are you talking about?

442
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,250
I don't have a boyfriend.

443
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,050
Stop acting secretive.

444
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,450
When I was checking in,

445
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,420
they told me everything.

446
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,690
About your boyfriend's

447
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,900
glorious deeds this morning.

448
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,140
He saved the world.

449
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,060
Is that so?

450
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,860
Is my boyfriend Superman

451
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,860
or Batman?

452
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,420
The doctor, Ai Jing Chu.

453
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,570
Ai?

454
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,100
You can't possibly believe them.

455
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,250
They'd marry me off

456
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,450
to any man that comes by.

457
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,940
They said,

458
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,380
yesterday, you met up

459
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,450
with someone mysterious uphill.

460
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,770
Were you meeting with him?

461
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,620
I was going to meet you.

462
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,970
They said,

463
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,530
last night, you and him

464
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,140
shared a bed together.

465
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:33,690
No.

466
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,660
Last night, I slept with...

467
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,050
I did not.

468
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,980
They also said,

469
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,450
you were seen

470
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,420
hanging a love lock on
Yuelao Bridge alone.

471
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,210
I was removing the lock for Dou Dou.

472
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,660
Dou Dou? Sure.

473
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:49,770
Look at it yourself.

474
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,900
I'll take a look.

475
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,420
Xu?

476
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,200
This isn't Ai Jing Chu.

477
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,640
This guy is Xu Heng Heng.

478
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,840
He's a colleague of Ai Jing Chu.

479
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,050
He is Dou Dou's ex-boyfriend.

480
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,450
The mole we planted

481
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,130
was easily

482
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,580
brainwashed by Dr. Ai?

483
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,080
Wait. You don't believe me?

484
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,310
Fine.

485
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,690
Take a look yourself.

486
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,180
[Dou Dou:Thanks, Sister Zeng.
Throw the lock away for me.]

487
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,740
[Dou Dou: I do not want anything
to do with Xu Heng Heng anymore.]

488
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,740
We misunderstood him?

489
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,900
Hurry up and pursue him.

490
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,460
What?

491
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,660
Did you realise something?

492
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,060
Whether he is my boyfriend

493
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,370
should be consented by me.

494
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,290
He confessed

495
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,650
to your colleagues.

496
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,050
What did he say?

497
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,530
Dr. Ai.

498
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,010
When you're not around,

499
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,180
we will take care of

500
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,530
Zeng Li on your behalf.

501
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,970
If anyone

502
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,420
tries to lay a finger on Zeng Li,

503
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,290
we will keep watch for you.

504
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:47,770
Do you know what he said?

505
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,000
He probably said,

506
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:51,860
it's a misunderstanding.

507
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,740
You're wrong.

508
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,770
He probably said,
I do not know Zeng Li well.

509
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,650
Wrong again.

510
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,570
What did he say?

511
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,620
He said,

512
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,100
thanks.

513
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:09,850
Thanks?

514
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:10,810
Hence,

515
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,010
admit to your crimes.

516
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,090
No.

517
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:15,970
He must hate

518
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:16,850
explaining himself.

519
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,340
A withdrawn man like him

520
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,170
would speak

521
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,180
as little as he can.

522
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,820
You know him pretty well.

523
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,380
Not at all.

524
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,580
No matter what it is,

525
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,580
Dongshan Temple really works.

526
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,370
The both of us

527
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,690
met our destined men on the same dy.

528
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,620
Don't you agree?

529
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,900
Meet your destined
man on your own.

530
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,970
I'm taking a shower.

531
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,580
You're running away.

532
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,250
I'm going to bloom if you don't.

533
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,690
Sheng Ming.

534
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,690
The duckling is coming.

535
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,260
I'll push the duckling

536
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,140
back to you.

537
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,210
That young lady had
eyes that look like eyes

538
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,090
and a nose that looks like a nose.

539
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,450
She's much prettier than the

540
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,300
plastic girls on tv.

541
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,380
What are you talking about?

542
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,730
Have you ever seen

543
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,930
anyone with features jumbled up?

544
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:01,970
You.

545
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,740
Your face resembles a pizza pie.

546
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,020
It's all jumbled together.

547
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,410
What does the lady do?

548
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,650
I was about to ask.

549
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:08,770
Before I could,

550
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,340
Xiao Chu dragged me out there hastily.

551
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,970
What does she do?
How old is she?

552
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,290
She's just a patient of mine.

553
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,130
Tell us about her.

554
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,300
She's a librarian at
Dongshan University.

555
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,890
She's 26.

556
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,010
Her age is perfect for Xiao Chu.

557
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:30,850
Exactly.

558
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,210
A librarian is great.

559
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,260
Here, Xiao Xiao.

560
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:33,780
Have some Mung bean pastry.

561
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,260
A librarian has a stable career.

562
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,760
She could take care of
the home in the future.

563
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,650
Is it yummy?

564
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,660
Yes.

565
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,020
They'd give birth to

566
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,210
beautiful children.

567
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,020
They'd take after Xiao Chu's

568
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,020
eyes and nose.

569
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,860
The kids may take after
either of their lips.

570
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,370
They must take after Xiao Zeng's skin.

571
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,860
Her complexion is soft,

[Everything is laid out for me.]

763
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,910
Don't you find yourself

764
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,150
rather lucky?

765
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,740
[Yes.]

766
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,630
[The luck of forgetting an
umbrella during rainy days.]

767
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,900
Is that how people

768
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,790
compliment themselves nowadays?

769
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,630
I was just kidding.

770
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,060
Honestly,

771
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,910
what do you feel about me?

772
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,460
[The epitome of unctuous.]

773
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,430
You're great.

774
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,600
That's too general.

775
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,260
Can you be a little more specific?

776
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,830
[You're asking me to be specific?]

777
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,160
[It's going to be awkward
if I call him a chatterbox.]

778
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,300
You're rather affable.

779
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,230
[You're a man.]

780
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,310
[You look great too.]

781
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,590
[What else can I come up with?]

782
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,470
You've great prospects.

783
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,350
All right.

784
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,220
If you find me suitable,

785
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,260
let's sign the
marriage certificate right now.

786
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,240
[Marriage certificate?]

787
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,870
[Brother,
are you in a rush to get married?]

788
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,660
I was just making a spontaneous joke.

789
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,390
[Do you have a
misconception about humour?]

790
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,110
Let's do this.

791
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,910
Let's start of as friends.

792
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,590
If you're not hasty,

793
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,220
I'd be able to keep it in.

794
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,180
I'm fine with being just friends.

795
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,830
However, I don't feel

796
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,120
anything else for you.

797
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,110
Feelings can always be
nurtured through time.

798
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,980
At least you don't hate me, right?

799
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,590
I don't.

800
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,390
Don't be in a haste to reject me.

801
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,390
Give me a chance.

802
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,350
We will start off as friends.

803
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,700
Let's see where this

804
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,910
takes us in the future.

805
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,020
[In the future?]

806
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,390
[If your dad wasn't my
stepdad's superior...]

807
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:48,860
After dinner,

808
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,080
would you like to catch the movie,

809
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,120
Age of Dinosaurs III?

810
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,650
It's just a movie.

811
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,830
[I'm doing this for the sake
of my mother's happiness.]

812
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,740
All right.

813
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,160
Welcome. Come on in.

814
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,460
Let's take this table.

815
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,350
I'm back.

816
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,480
Mr. Ai.

817
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,190
Do you know her?

818
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,110
No.

819
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,150
This restaurant is decent,

820
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,080
but I haven't been here
in a long time.

821
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,220
Is this your first time, Mr. Ai?

822
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,780
Yes.

823
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,060
Take a look.

824
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,310
Call for me when you're ready.

825
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:41,990
Thanks.

826
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,870
Thanks.

827
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,110
Mr. Ai.

828
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,980
Let's catch a movie after dinner.

829
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,250
Age of Dinosaur III.

830
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,920
I wanted to watch it for a long time.

831
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,300
I can't.

832
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,660
I've matters to attend to tonight.

833
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:01,980
What is it?

834
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,160
Before 8pm,

835
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,480
I need to head home to workout.

836
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,540
Then, take a shower.

837
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,900
From 9-10pm, I will read

838
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,000
books of the related field.

839
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,040
10pm to 11pm

840
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,390
is my time of relaxation and leisure.

841
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,210
Mr. Ai, your schedule

842
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,220
is pretty great.

843
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,220
I'll make myself one too.

844
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,630
There are times when you
wouldn't be home though.

845
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:21,950
Just like today.

846
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,070
Normally, I'll arrange a night or two

847
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,400
per week

848
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,660
as a flexible time.

849
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,910
However, I must go to bed before 11pm.

850
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,600
Young people like you

851
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,690
stay up pretty late though.

852
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,110
You should readjust if possible.

853
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,130
I'm not like the others.

854
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,170
I care about health a lot.

855
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,380
Normally, by 11pm,

856
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,610
I would be asleep too.

857
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,260
Are the both of you ready?

858
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:44,670
Chicken breast salad.

859
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,360
Green apple juice with kale.

860
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,350
Also,

861
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,820
a bowl of vegetable soup.

862
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,220
Feel free to make your order.

863
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,150
I'm heading to the washroom.

864
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,040
Okay.

865
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,220
Two sets of chicken breast salad.

866
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,020
Two glasses of green
apple juice with kale.

867
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,660
Two bowls of vegetable soup.

868
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,620
Hello.

869
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,960
[Aren't you having dinner
with Gu Dong Hai right now?]

870
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,360
[You picked up the phone immediately.]

871
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,710
[Did you run away again?]

872
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,600
Mom, are you monitoring
me from a distance?

873
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:19,680
I'm at the washroom.

874
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,620
Come and inspect if
you don't believe me.

875
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,770
[Xiao Gu is really hilarious.]

876
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,620
[You'd never be bored around him.]

877
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,810
[Is there a spark?]

878
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,160
No.

879
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,880
I'm not looking for a talk show host.

880
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,680
[I'm warning you.]

881
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,640
[Do not mistreat Xiao Gu.]

882
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,160
[He's in the finance industry.]

883
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,400
[His father is your
Uncle Peng's superior.]

884
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,960
I get it.

885
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,760
You should get some water, mom.

886
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,680
[Don't be in a rush to
come home after dinner.]

887
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,280
[You enjoy watching movies alone.]

888
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,470
[Finally, you found someone to]

889
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,440
[keep you company.]

890
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,150
Mom.

891
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,360
Do you have any idea
how awkward it is

892
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,600
to watch a movie with
someone I don't like?

893
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,090
[Perhaps, after the movie,]

894
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,680
[you would have developed feelings.]

895
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,740
[Am I hallucinating again?]

896
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,520
Mom, I'll talk to you later.

897
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,960
-I'm hanging up.
[-Hey.]

898
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,440
[In a relationship, adults]

899
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,409
[tend to think that]

900
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:10,530
[the one who takes the
initiative is the loser.]

901
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,639
[It feels like when
a relationship begins,]

902
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,449
[a game begins,]

903
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,400
[a competition begins.]

904
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,639
[Even when one has fallen deep,]

905
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,199
[but would tell oneself stubbornly]

906
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,969
[that he doesn't like you as much.]

907
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,639
[I can always leave any time.]

908
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:28,820
[Sheng Ming: Awaiting approval.]

909
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,199
Sir, here's your apple juice.

910
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,889
Please enjoy.

911
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:31,770
Thank you.

912
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,880
It tastes great.

913
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,780
[Recipient: Wu Ying.
Items in cart: Apple juice with kale.]

914
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,620
[Place order.]

915
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,130
[The meaning of love]

916
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,610
[lies in sincerity.]

917
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,800
[There are no winners nor losers.]

918
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,650
[It doesn't matter who takes
the first step forward.]

919
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,300
[In the world of adults,]

920
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,340
[sincerity]

921
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,740
[is the most priceless thing.]

922
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,810
[The one everyone should
cherish the most.]

923
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,010
[Isn't that so?]
