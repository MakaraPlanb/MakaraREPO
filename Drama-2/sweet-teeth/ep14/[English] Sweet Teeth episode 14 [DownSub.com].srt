[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,920
[You shouldn't apologise to me.]

3
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,210
[It's just that]

4
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,050
[we might be in different worlds.]

5
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,130
[Liu Yu Cheng, your life
really doesn't need to]

6
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,050
[be all about me.]

7
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,970
[You're only 21 this year.]

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,210
[You should enjoy]

9
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,290
[the best age in your life.]

10
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,290
[It's time for me to return]

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,450
[to the lifestyle of my age.]

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,290
[Write papers, get qualifications,]

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:46,930
[accompany my parents,]

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:47,730
[as well as doing consultations.]

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,410
[Also,]

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,210
[marry someone.]

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,330
[If you're willing,]

18
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,370
[I can marry you anytime.]

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,330
[What you're saying is very childish.]

20
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,330
[You haven't even reached]

21
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,610
[the legal age to marry.]

22
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,610
[Who knows whether]

23
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,330
[you'll stay in China]

24
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,290
[or return to Malaysia?]

25
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,250
[Since the beginning, both of us]

26
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,370
[have nothing in common.]

27
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,490
[Blending into each other's life forcibly]

28
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,209
[will only make everything worse.]

29
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,650
[Do you think this is just]

30
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,970
[a number?]

31
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,890
[This means you lack]

32
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,330
[six years' worth of social
experiences, compared to her.]

33
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,010
[A woman her age]

34
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,650
[is mostly in a stable relationship,]

35
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,850
[financially stable,]

36
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,170
[and owns a few branded bags.]

37
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,090
[Can you give her any of these?]

38
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,730
[Wu Ying and you]

39
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,330
[aren't suitable for each other.]

40
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,090
Come on.

41
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:28,890
Long time no see.

42
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:29,650
Long time no see.

43
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,170
What are you busy with?

44
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:31,650
Studies, of course.

45
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,009
Not again.

46
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,370
Which professor is guiding you currently?

47
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,810
The experienced one.

48
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,289
He's so strict.

49
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,090
Really?

50
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:39,450
That's right.

51
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,009
He's very strict,

52
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,090
fierce and cunning.

53
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,410
He's...

54
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,130
Isn't he...

55
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,370
What's gotten into him?

56
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,650
Brother Yu Cheng.

57
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:00,810
Liu Yu Cheng,

58
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:03,810
why are you drinking so much here

59
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,170
all alone?

60
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,170
Are you all right?

61
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,250
Are you Wu Ying?

62
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,850
It's my fault.

63
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,050
It's my fault.

64
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,530
Are you okay?

65
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,050
It's my fault.

66
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,970
[Sweet Teeth]
[Episode 14]

67
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,210
Be careful.

68
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,329
Be careful.

69
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,290
Wu Ying!

70
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,130
Look out for the stairs.

71
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,130
Wu Ying.

72
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:56,690
Wu Ying.

73
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,890
Wu Ying, don't go! Wu Ying.

74
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,170
Wu Ying, don't go!

75
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,090
That isn't Wu Ying.

76
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,450
Wu Ying,

77
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,610
how come you are taller?

78
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,330
Why are you so tall now?

79
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,690
We no longer look good together, Wu Ying.

80
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,690
Get into the car.

81
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,290
Your legs.

82
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,770
You really said that to Jiang Rui?

83
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,250
Yes.

84
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,329
I almost dropped out of university

85
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:29,970
to elope with someone.

86
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,250
It's the truth.

87
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,290
Wait,

88
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,730
even if you didn't like him,

89
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,050
you didn't have to tell him your history.

90
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:36,250
To be fair,

91
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,450
I honestly think Dr. Jiang

92
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,810
suits you more than Liu Yu Cheng.

93
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:40,890
Look,

94
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:41,970
he's mature, composed

95
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,850
and successful.

96
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,290
He comes from a decent family

97
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,530
and is quite good-looking.

98
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,610
With the situation between you two,

99
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,490
you can date for half a year

100
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,170
before getting married.

101
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,410
Take farmers growing melons for example.

102
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,410
Liu Yu Cheng

103
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,850
is like this tiny watermelon.

104
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,930
Through your careful cultivation,

105
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,610
watering and fertilising,

106
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,370
even if it may turn out
well in the future,

107
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,410
one day,

108
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,090
it might be picked by someone else.

109
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,530
Dr. Jiang is different.

110
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,370
Dr. Jiang

111
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,450
is one of those huge watermelons.

112
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,410
Through someone else's
careful cultivation,

113
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,570
it's fully grown

114
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,130
and it falls into your hands on his own.

115
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:08,930
How can it be the same?

116
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,330
It's an entirely different issue.

117
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,570
When you choose a watermelon,

118
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,850
the standard is pick
one that's big and sweet.

119
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,170
There's no such standard
in a relationship.

120
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,370
Whether the shoes fit or not,

121
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,209
only the feet know.

122
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,250
Whether the person is right for you,

123
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,290
being able to hold a conversation matters.

124
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,290
I don't think Jiang Rui and I can do so.

125
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,170
We aren't the same type of people.

126
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,010
So, do you find Liu Yu Cheng

127
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,530
easy to chat with?

128
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,110
Look,

129
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,280
you play games with him every day.

130
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,370
In my life,

131
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,370
are these two the only options I have?

132
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,530
If you prolong it,

133
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,610
you'll have none.

134
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,890
That's fine.

135
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,570
I still have you two.

136
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,370
Don't include me.

137
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,170
I'm aiming to date

138
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,050
and get married.

139
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,370
Don't include Zeng Li either.

140
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,530
She and Dr. Ai

141
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,850
are inexperienced at most.

142
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,690
Sooner or later, one of them

143
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,130
will give in first.

144
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,810
Even if you say so,

145
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,850
all these years, it seems

146
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,250
you never stop dating,

147
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:51,890
but in the end,

148
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,490
you are going nowhere.

149
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,250
You're on the starting line, just like me.

150
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,130
I hereby announce

151
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,490
that starting today,

152
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,730
Zeng Li is my best friend.

153
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,450
Wait a second.

154
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,650
Wasn't I?

155
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,290
Of course not.

156
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,050
Everything you say is right. You're right.

157
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,810
My friendship with Ma Yi Yi

158
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,410
dates back to high school.

159
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,290
You got in between us later.

160
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,290
It's fine.

161
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,690
From today onwards,

162
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,450
I'm going to hand this best friend of mine

163
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,170
to your care.

164
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,290
In the future, if she's heartbroken,

165
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,250
you'll have a meal with her.

166
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,050
You'll listen to her nagging,

167
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,770
and the all-day mission

168
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,490
of being bothered without a break

169
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,730
will be handed to you.

170
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,130
I'm done cleaning.

171
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,410
So, I discovered another issue.

172
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,730
I don't think I need friends.

173
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,330
Zeng Li!

174
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,090
Come back!

175
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:37,650
Dou Dou.

176
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:38,850
Have some watermelon.

177
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:39,610
Thank you.

178
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:43,850
You're holding a knife.

179
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,850
I won't argue with you.

180
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,690
Do you dare to?

181
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,409
Vomit here. This is the toilet bowl.

182
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,130
Here you go.

183
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,290
What are you looking at?

184
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,050
Mr. Ai,

185
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,410
luckily I came in late.

186
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,250
Otherwise,

187
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,610
I would've seen everything.

188
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,850
It seems you're sober.

189
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,530
If that's the case, sleep in your dorm.

190
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,250
I can't, Mr. Ai.

191
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:37,810
My head hurts.

192
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,770
You got so drunk.

193
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,450
Was it because of Wu Ying?

194
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,170
Why?

195
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,890
She told me a lot of things.

196
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,130
She said

197
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,170
we're from different worlds.

198
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:16,890
Also,

199
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,130
she said we weren't compatible.

200
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:26,370
I don't...

201
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,410
I don't know

202
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,170
why she's suddenly acting this way.

203
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,170
It has nothing to do with you.

204
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,890
The problem lies with her.

205
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,610
She's beginning to rationally

206
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,530
consider your relationship with her.

207
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,050
Mr. Ai,

208
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,690
you think we aren't suitable either,

209
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,010
don't you?

210
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,050
No.

211
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,850
Besides, what I think

212
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,130
or what others think

213
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,250
doesn't matter.

214
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,010
How does it not matter?

215
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,650
The world is not a vacuum.

216
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,770
Both my parents

217
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,330
don't care about what others think.

218
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,290
My father is very smart.

219
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,890
He can be considered

220
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,090
a genius in physics.

221
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,130
My grandparents

222
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,370
had high hopes for him.

223
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,250
When he was doing doctoral
studies in Donghu University,

224
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,049
he met my mother.

225
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,890
They loved each other very much,

226
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,450
but my grandmother

227
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,289
disapproved of their relationship,

228
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,850
because my mother

229
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:43,970
came from a village

230
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,410
and a poor family.

231
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,690
She wasn't highly educated.

232
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,650
So, their families

233
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,850
disapproved of their relationship.

234
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,330
They kept persuading them to break up.

235
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,930
My father got tired of it.

236
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,810
So he brought my mother with him

237
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,890
and left this city.

238
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,330
They got married

239
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,090
in another city

240
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,450
and had me.

241
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:09,570
What happened after that?

242
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,210
Later,

243
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,850
an accident occurred in the laboratory

244
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,570
and my father passed away.

245
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,130
If he's still alive,

246
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,650
they should have been

247
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,770
happily together.

248
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,490
I remember when I was a kid,

249
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,490
in my grandmother's drawer,

250
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:46,850
I found a love letter my father

251
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,450
wrote to my mother,

252
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,210
as well as my mother's reply.

253
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,650
They were deeply in love with each other.

254
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,730
So, I'm always thinking.

255
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:00,850
Even if they

256
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,170
weren't together for long,

257
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,970
I'm sure they didn't regret it.

258
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,090
That's why I think

259
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,450
if you like Wu Ying so much,

260
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,250
you must never give up.

261
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,090
As long as Wu Ying has feelings

262
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:14,770
for you, too,

263
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,530
one day, for your sake,

264
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,170
she'll move past that.

265
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,530
[Only on holidays]

266
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,930
[that Xiao Yu'er could
meet up with Xiao Yu.]

267
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,210
[In the two years,]

268
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,730
[the time they spent together]

269
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,770
[was less than a month in total.]

270
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,250
[However, each time they met,]

271
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,450
[each dialogue]

272
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,690
[and the smile]

273
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,770
[remained in her heart.]

274
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,330
[She used the remaining
six months to recall them.]

275
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,730
I'm going back to school tomorrow.

276
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,250
Let me give you a gift,

277
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:01,850
okay?

278
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,530
What is it?

279
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,450
Open my palm.

280
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,330
Liar.

281
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:15,210
This.

282
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,690
Is this for me?

283
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:25,570
That's right.

284
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,290
Give me your keys.

285
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,290
You

286
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,890
always misplace your keys,

287
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:34,850
but now

288
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:35,810
your mother is looking after you alone.

289
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,290
So, you must be more considerate of her.

290
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,730
Don't let her open the door for you

291
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,650
in the middle of her work.

292
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,010
Let me put it on you.

293
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,410
Good luck, Xiao Yu'er.

294
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,650
You'll become an adult soon.

295
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,490
Mr. Ai, you're awake.

296
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,410
Get up and eat.

297
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,130
Mr. Ai,

298
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,250
your kitchen is so well-equipped.

299
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,130
It's much better than our dorm's.

300
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,930
The only thing is this apron is too small.

301
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,450
Why is there a tiny heart on it?

302
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,730
Make a guess.

303
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,610
You actually like girly stuff secretly.

304
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,330
My youngest aunt bought it.

305
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,690
Occasionally,

306
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,690
she comes over and cooks for me.

307
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,290
Your youngest aunt?

308
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,210
So, next time

309
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,130
when she comes over,

310
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,170
can you let me know?

311
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,250
I want to learn from her

312
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,250
and cook for Wu Ying.

313
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,490
It seems you've fully recovered.

314
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,290
Thanks to your encouragement,

315
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,490
I've fully recovered.

316
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,050
Good luck. I'm going to wash up.

317
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,170
I'll wait for you to
have breakfast together.

318
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,730
I made a lot of tasty food.

319
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,770
Thanks for letting me
use your bed last night.

320
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,530
Are you sure

321
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,170
I let you use it?

322
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,490
[Mr. Ai,]

323
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,890
[I have a serious headache.]

324
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,930
[Can I]

325
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,130
[stay here for the night?]

326
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,130
[Don't worry, Mr. Ai.]

327
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,010
[I'm asking you to do me a favour.]

328
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,490
[You'll sleep on the bed]

329
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:34,890
[and I'll take the couch.]

330
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:51,730
Mr. Ai,

331
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,890
with our relationship so far,

332
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,570
I'm sure

333
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,610
you won't mind, right?

334
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,170
So, next time if you get drunk again,

335
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,170
I'll throw you on the couch

336
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,490
and lock the door of my bedroom.

337
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,290
You mean I can do it next time?

338
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,610
Uncle, let me give you a hand.

339
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,490
Okay. Here.

340
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,010
Be careful.

341
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,170
Be careful.

342
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,130
My legs are useless.

343
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:18,290
Okay.

344
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:18,970
If you feel unwell,

345
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:19,810
just let me know anytime.

346
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:20,570
Okay.

347
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,610
Thank you, Xiao Jiang.

348
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:21,970
No problem.

349
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,370
Father and mother, I'm late.

350
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,330
I was a little busy.

351
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:24,890
It's fine.

352
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:25,930
-Dr. Jiang
-Wu Ying,

353
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,290
you're here.

354
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,850
saw we had a lot of stuff to carry today.

355
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,250
He thought it'd be difficult
for us to take a cab.

356
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,370
So he's going to drive us home.

357
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,130
That's right.

358
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,410
Xiao Jiang,

359
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,090
are you sure it won't disrupt your work?

360
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:35,890
It won't.

361
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,810
In fact, I've clocked out.

362
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,250
Uncle,

363
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,050
besides, Wu Ying and I are...

364
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,810
We're colleagues.

365
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,530
We ought to help each other.

366
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,130
So, shall we go now?

367
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,130
Okay.

368
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:47,930
Thank you.

369
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:48,970
Just leave the bag here.

370
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,570
I'll come back for it later.

371
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,090
No need, I'll carry it.

372
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,490
Let me put this away.

373
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,490
Ying Ying,

374
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,850
I am told today

375
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,850
that Dr. Jiang is only 33 years old

376
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,570
and he already has
the title of vice-senior.

377
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,570
He's quite capable.

378
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,610
He's such an outstanding doctor.

379
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,650
Don't you two wish

380
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,090
to be more than just colleagues?

381
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,610
Mother, don't you worry about me,

382
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:09,970
okay?

383
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,250
Let's pack up.

384
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:11,810
Ying Ying,

385
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,010
if it was in the past,

386
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,370
your father and I wouldn't worry.

387
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,250
However, it's different now.

388
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,890
Look, your father's
already in his seventies

389
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,130
and his health is deteriorating.

390
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,130
As for me,

391
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,730
I'm also in my sixties.

392
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,610
If

393
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,850
your father and I pass away,

394
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,690
what will happen to you?

395
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,170
Touch wood.

396
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,090
Mother, what are you talking about?

397
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:26,650
Aren't you

398
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,730
in great health now?

399
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,130
It's not like I'm determined

400
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,010
to be a nun.

401
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:30,730
If I come across a suitable candidate,

402
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,730
I'll have a boyfriend, okay?

403
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,650
However, Dr. Jiang

404
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,650
is quite a good candidate.

405
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,330
Look.

406
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,970
You two are around the same age

407
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,730
and are compatible in terms of looks.

408
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,450
Besides,

409
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,570
you are doctors.

410
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,850
You speak the same language.

411
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,850
In the future, at work,

412
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,890
you can even help each other.

413
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,130
Where else are you going to find

414
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:44,890
such an ideal candidate?

415
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:45,250
Mother,

416
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,730
father is still waiting for us.

417
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,850
Let's bring our stuff outside first,

418
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,290
okay?

419
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:48,770
Come on.

420
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:49,810
Please enjoy.

421
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:50,490
Thank you.

422
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,250
Are you here?

423
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:55,410
That's right.

424
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,730
Walk along

425
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,770
that road

426
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,570
and you'll see a "Carol's" sign.

427
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,850
I'll be waiting at the entrance.

428
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:01,810
Okay.

429
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:02,810
I haven't arrived yet.

430
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:03,810
I'll be there soon.

431
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,970
Make sure you don't take the wrong road.

432
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,170
It's the first junction.

433
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:08,890
Xiao Yu'er,

434
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:10,850
turn around.

435
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:11,970
What?

436
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,450
Turn around.

437
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,410
Hi, Zeng Li.

438
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,210
What's the matter?

439
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:58,930
We hadn't seen each other for a few years.

440
00:16:59,050 --> 00:16:59,930
Don't you recognise me?

441
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,130
Xiao Yu'er has grown taller.

442
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,450
I remember that we last met

443
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,569
when I just graduated from university.

444
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,849
I'm in my twenties now.

445
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,730
How can I grow taller?

446
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,810
Why are you wearing braces?

447
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,930
My mother told me to do so.

448
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,410
She keeps saying my teeth are misaligned.

449
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,210
That's why I'm wearing them now.

450
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,050
Let's go, I'll buy you a meal.

451
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,650
You're a grown-up now,

452
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,210
but I still think

453
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,250
you're still the same

454
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,490
little girl in high school.

455
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,810
When you couldn't solve a problem,

456
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,490
you'd cry while asking me how to solve it.

457
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,290
You even said things like,

458
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,330
"What to do?

459
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,890
What if I can't enrol in a university?"

460
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:54,050
[Carol's]

461
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,170
At that time,

462
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,210
I didn't have the ability
to cope with a crisis.

463
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,450
If I came across

464
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,250
the present me,

465
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,410
I'd definitely say to myself,

466
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,050
"You're actually doing quite well.

467
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,450
In ten years,

468
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,690
you might not even
understand the questions."

469
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,650
Get into the car.

470
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:58,890
So, uncle,

471
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,370
where are you bringing me for dinner?

472
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,730
What's gotten into you?

473
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,010
In the past, when I told
you to call me "Uncle",

474
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,450
you refused to do so.

475
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,770
Now you're doing it so naturally.

476
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,130
I used to think

477
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,170
you're about the same age as me.

478
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:10,890
So I found it awkward to do so.

479
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,850
Now I'd like to pretend I'm younger.

480
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,090
That won't do.

481
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,650
I don't want to appear old either.

482
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,410
I have a friend

483
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,330
that I'd like to introduce to you.

484
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:20,930
Okay.

485
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,650
It's really beautiful.

486
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,450
No, wait. You're capable.

487
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,450
How did you manage to make reservation?

488
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,930
Wu Ying, Yi Yi and I

489
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,490
can never do this.

490
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,810
The tip is

491
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,090
book it three months ahead.

492
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,010
Do you mean

493
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,170
you made a reservation

494
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:52,930
when you're in the U.S.?

495
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,330
After all, I'm having a meal with you,

496
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:56,770
as well as my best friend

497
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,290
in university

498
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,010
back in the U.S.

499
00:18:59,170 --> 00:18:59,810
Is he handsome?

500
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,530
Of course my buddy is handsome.

501
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,450
He's

502
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,450
a sought-after bachelor.

503
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,730
If you have

504
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,570
any single friend,

505
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,450
you can be the matchmaker.

506
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,090
Then I'll have to see if
he's handsome or not.

507
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,930
This place is so beautiful.

508
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:18,810
We're here!

509
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:19,850
He's here.

510
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,290
[So you're the relative
Zeng Li was talking about?]

511
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,490
[You're Yu Yi's friend?]

512
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,090
What's that expression?

513
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,010
Mr. Ai.

514
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,170
Zeng Li,

515
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:54,730
what are you doing here?

516
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,850
Do you two know each other?

517
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,170
I'm her dentist.

518
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,050
So, you're the one

519
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:06,930
who does her braces?

520
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,930
Were you two classmates
during postgraduate studies?

521
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,450
That's right.

522
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,810
Not only we were classmates,

523
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,410
we'd lived together for a few years.

524
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,770
So, at that time,

525
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,890
your Chinese housemate in the U.S.

526
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,010
was him?

527
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,650
Yes, that's right. It's him.

528
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,730
After that,

529
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,930
he abandoned me to come back to China.

530
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,370
So, I could only

531
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,450
rent a place near my office.

532
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,530
[What a coincidence.]

533
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,010
Goodness.

534
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,650
I really didn't expect it.

535
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,130
[Could it be that eight years ago...]

536
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,490
What a coincidence.

537
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,210
It's indeed a coincidence.

538
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:41,650
Come on.

539
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,370
Hi, here's the menu.

540
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,410
See if there's

541
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,250
anything you would like to eat.

542
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:47,570
Come on.

543
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:49,330
Look,

544
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,130
fresh oysters must be ordered.

545
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,010
It's Xiao Yu'er's favourite.

546
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:56,810
Let me tell you.

547
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,370
When she first attended a university,

548
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,930
I brought her to a seafood buffet.

549
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:00,890
She alone

550
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,210
ate 50 fresh oysters.

551
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,770
It was 50, right?

552
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:08,690
What's wrong?

553
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,010
Are you embarrassed?

554
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,290
No.

555
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,530
At that time,

556
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,450
you must've gotten it wrong.

557
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,130
There were so many people at the stall.

558
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,730
How could I have eaten 50?

559
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,010
How could I get it wrong?

560
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,410
You were sitting right
beside the fresh oysters.

561
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,130
No one could fight with you.

562
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:25,810
Let's order.

563
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,930
What would you like to eat
other than fresh oysters?

564
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,210
[Yu Yi, Xiao Yu.]

565
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,570
Fresh oysters will do.

566
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,330
[Zeng Li, Xiao Yu'er.]

567
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,690
[So, Zeng Li was writing]

568
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,130
[about their story?]

569
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,010
[You know what?]

570
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,010
[I'm into a girl now.]

571
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,890
[Before this, I didn't tell you,]

572
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,570
[because I was also considering]

573
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,810
[whether I'd come back to China.]

574
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,930
[I didn't want to waste her time.]

575
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:49,930
[I plan to treat her to a meal,]

576
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,490
[but we haven't seen
each other for so long.]

577
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,610
[I'll need someone to
liven up the atmosphere]

578
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,650
[and that's you.]

579
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,450
[That means...]

580
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:58,410
Dr. Ai,

581
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,130
Zeng Li is asking you what
you would like to eat.

582
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,090
Well,

583
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,210
fresh oysters

584
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,330
is also my favourite.

585
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,010
You can order the rest.

586
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,370
Come on, let's have a drink.

587
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,210
Do you remember? When you were a kid,

588
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,170
you were really afraid
to go to the dentist?

589
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,410
Let me tell you.

590
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,850
In the past, whenever she passed by

591
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,330
a dental hospital, she'd walk around it.

592
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,770
She even told me that in this world,

593
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,410
she hated dentists the most.

594
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,330
She still finds dental visits scary.

595
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,730
Last time when I extracted her teeth,

596
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:34,410
she was crying

597
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,570
even harder than

598
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:35,930
the three-year-old child next door.

599
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,650
Wait a second. Can the two of you

600
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,970
forget about such things?

601
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:41,610
Excuse me.

602
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,250
Why are there still dishes to be served?

603
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:49,970
I purposely prepared this for you.

604
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,210
I haven't even finished

605
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:53,970
the food on my plate yet.

606
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,570
I'm not sure if you like it or not.

607
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,650
Open it first.

608
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,650
Why are you giving me
a gift all of a sudden?

609
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,650
How is this sudden?

610
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:15,890
I promised you.

611
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:21,530
Open it.

612
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,090
This is...

613
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:37,730
I don't know

614
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,290
if you still misplace your keys,

615
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:40,730
but as for this,

616
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,130
make sure you don't misplace it again.

617
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:45,410
[Xiao Yu'er,]

618
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,410
[let me give you a gift.]

619
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,290
[What is it?]

620
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:54,890
[It's pretty.]

621
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,130
[Good luck, Xiao Yu'er.]

622
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,290
[You'll be an adult soon.]

623
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,570
[When you've become one,]

624
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,410
[I'll be earning money.]

625
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,370
[When that happens,]

626
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,050
[I'll buy you a nicer necklace.]

627
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,490
[I'll never misplace it.]

628
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,170
It's pretty.

629
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,130
What do you think?

630
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:34,290
Well,

631
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,050
it's mediocre.

632
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,250
Buddy,

633
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,890
it's been many years.

634
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,850
You haven't changed the slightest.

635
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:40,890
Even if it's not pretty,

636
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,330
you should still say it is.

637
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,850
Is it wrong to tell the truth?

638
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:44,650
Fine.

639
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,570
I'll drink as a punishment.

640
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,690
Come on, I'll drink with you.

641
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:00,690
Are you jealous?

642
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,290
Didn't I

643
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,410
give you a gift, too?

644
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,410
Though it's not as expensive,

645
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:07,970
but don't you dare to
say you don't like it.

646
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:10,930
I like it.

647
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,490
Come on, let's continue drinking.

648
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:14,650
When I'm not around,

649
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,450
don't you have anyone to drink with you?

650
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:17,810
When you were in the U.S.,

651
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,210
you also couldn't find anyone

652
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,170
to drink to your heart's content, right?

653
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,330
Yes, that's true. Come on.

654
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,330
Don't forget about me.

655
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:26,730
I...

656
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,010
I'm going to drink, too.

657
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,210
A female shouldn't be drinking.

658
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,330
You've removed the braces long enough.

659
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,130
Time to put them back on.

660
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,010
I'll just drink one glass.

661
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,610
You shouldn't. The two of us will drink.

662
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:37,690
Don't drink. Give it to me.

663
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:39,810
Both of us will drink.

664
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:41,370
Come on.

665
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,970
Your mother complained to me,

666
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,170
saying you're an alcoholic now.

667
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,250
She told me to keep an eye on you.

668
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,610
Hello.

669
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,250
What's with you?

670
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,370
You poured so little for yourself

671
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,250
and so much for me.

672
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,410
Come on, I'll pour more for you.

673
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,610
No, you...

674
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,330
My hands are trembling.

675
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:02,450
Fine.

676
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,450
You know what?

677
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:14,930
it's pretty no matter how I look at it.

678
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:16,690
Which part is pretty?

679
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:17,650
To be honest,

680
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,570
I think it's just normal.

681
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:19,490
Which part of it isn't pretty?

682
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,250
It's just a key.

683
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,090
What's so pretty about it?

684
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:22,890
You're questioning my taste,

685
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,290
aren't you?

686
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,090
You think I made a poor choice,

687
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:24,450
don't you?

688
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,010
Then, tell me

689
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:25,610
what's so special about it.

690
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,050
It's really pretty.

691
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:27,850
What's pretty?

692
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:28,890
How beautiful.

693
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,650
Indeed,

694
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:33,610
beautiful.

695
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,690
What are you looking at?

696
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,090
Let's carry on.

697
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,050
Come on.

698
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,570
Here's a bonus!

699
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,090
A friend of mine

700
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,050
opened a ski resort.

701
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,290
He told me to bring a few friends

702
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:02,890
to go and try it out.

703
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,050
What do you think, sisters?

704
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,290
Are you interested?

705
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,210
You mean just the three of us and you?

706
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,130
You can also ask some male friends along.

707
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,650
Maybe I'll ask my buddies to come.

708
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,210
No.

709
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:14,730
We don't want to play with
people we're not familiar with.

710
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,090
We'd better ask some people ourselves.

711
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,370
Zeng Li,

712
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,090
I heard Yu Yi is back.

713
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,130
When are you going to introduce him

714
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:20,890
to us?

715
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:23,850
What's wrong?

716
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:24,690
Did anything happen?

717
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,650
In the weekend before Chinese New Year,

718
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,130
my brother and two close friends of mine

719
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,850
are going to the ski resort.

720
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,050
I'm just asking whether you

721
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,210
two

722
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,250
will be available or not.

723
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:33,970
Sure.

724
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:34,930
I'm available.

725
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:35,810
Are you going?

726
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:39,930
Yes.

727
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,210
Okay.

728
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,610
[The Story of Xiao Yu and Xiao Yu'er]

729
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,090
[Chapter Seven.]

730
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,410
[The Love Letter Which
Was Never Delivered.]

731
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,930
[Xiao Yu'er sat in front
of the desk alone]

732
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:14,010
[Chapter Seven, The Love Letter
which Was Never Delivered]

733
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,730
[to write Xiao Yu a letter.]

734
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,170
[It was a very long letter.]

735
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,290
[It captured a young girl's]

736
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,610
[feelings of longing and love,]

737
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,850
[each moment
in her life and the emotions.]

738
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,050
[Everything formed]

739
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,290
[the words in the letter.]

740
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,970
[The letter]

741
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,010
[didn't have the sender's address.]

742
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,530
[It only had the name of
the recipient, Xiao Yu,]

743
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,970
[and a line of blurry English text,]

744
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,290
[the recipient's address.]

745
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,290
[So, the letter which I opened by mistake]

746
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,810
[was written by you?]

747
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,730
[So we'd crossed path]

748
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,650
[such a long time ago.]

749
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:55,850
[Elliot.]

750
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,850
[There's a letter for you.]

751
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,490
[I'm so sorry. It got all wet.]

752
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,170
