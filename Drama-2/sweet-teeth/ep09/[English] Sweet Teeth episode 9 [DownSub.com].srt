He's been ignoring me.

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,680
I must've ordered too many dishes.

He's just a salaryman.

18
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,360
That restaurant's quite expensive.

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,880
He must've been surprised since
I ordered so many dishes.

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,440
He hasn't spoken to me on WeChat since.

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,920
I didn't dare to talk to him either.

00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,000
He sounds like a strange fellow.

I might be overthinking.

65
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,800
Probably not.

00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,840
Sorry.

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,280
Hello.

359
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,480
Are you all right?
I'm watching your livestream.

360
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,640
You seem to be a little unwell.

361
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,650
Do you want to go to the hospital?

362
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm fine.

363
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,960
I just have stomachache, that's all.

364
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,800
Send me your location.
I'll go look for you.

365
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,000
OK.

366
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,960

What are you doing here?

368
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,120
I'm here to see if you're still alive.

369
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,400
I'm dying.

370
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,000

00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,640
I'm taking you to the hospital.

You want to get yourself killed?

I just sent my location to

00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,480
I came across a mermaid.

00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,640
She told me a secret.

strikes at midnight,

shout the name of the
person you like out loud

Don't forget.

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,200
Don't forget.

-Really?

Go away, you dramatist.

00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,520
Does it still hurt?

436
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,080
I feel much better now.
It no longer hurts as much.

437
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,100
If you ask me,

438
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,710
you might as well remove the appendix.

439
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,600
It'll save you a lot of trouble.

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,840
Even if we keep the
inflammation under control now,

441
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,880
there'll be relapses in future.

442
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,970
No, that won't do.

443
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,320
I haven't had any surgeries in my life.

444
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,920
It's all right. No need to be afraid.

445
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,660
Appendicitis could be serious.

446
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,840
Besides, your boyfriend
will be worrying too.

447
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,500
Just now, I saw him

448
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,160
carrying you here on his back,

449
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,360
he was sweating all over.

450
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,520
I was thinking

451
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,560
he's such a considerate boyfriend.

452
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,460
If he's indeed my boyfriend,

453
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,160
then he's the cause for my illness.

454
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,480
Right. We don't know about that.

455
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,880
I have to handle this.

456
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,040
You should consider it.

457
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,480
Press this button for nurses
if something happens.

458
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,520
No need to consider.
We'll go for the surgery.

459
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,200
-Let's go. We'll pay the bill.
-I don't want to.

460
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,320
Sure, Ma Yi Yi. You're the one who say so.

461
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,120
I don't care if you fall ill again.

462
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,560
-Yi Yi.
-Sheng Ming.

463
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,640
See? Someone does care about me.

464
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,120
You can leave now since your job is done.

465
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,880
He's finally here.

466
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,120
I'm leaving.

467
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,160
Does your tummy still hurt?

468
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,280
I feel much better now.

469
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
That's good. Come on, you
shouldn't be in sitting position.

470
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,920
Lie down, quick. Slowly.

471
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,880
Slowly.

472
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,920
The traffic was slow on my way
here since it's New Year's Eve.

473
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,320
I was stuck in a traffic jam,

474
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,160
so I told the taxi driver
to pull over and ran here.

475
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,040
You're so worried about me?

476
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,240
Sleep for a while. I'll keep watch.

477
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,720
This bottle of medicine will
last for another three hours.

478
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,840
I've set an alarm just in case.

479
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,080
You're so meticulous.

480
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,120
You're a patient.

481
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,640
I'm just doing my part.

482
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,120
You suddenly left when we
were having a meal last time,

483
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,800
and never contacted me since.

484
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,400
I thought you dislike me.

485
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,250
Why would I dislike you?

486
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,160
So why did you suddenly disappear?

487
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,720
I didn't have an answer.

488
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,320
Actually, my last relationship

489
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,040
taught me a lesson.

490
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,800
If I keep taking initiative,

491
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,680
others tend to not cherish me.

492
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,080
Sometimes, I feel you
have feelings for me,

493
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,080
but you become distant very quickly.

494
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,320
What about this?

495
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,400
Just give me an answer.

496
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,160
Do you like me or not?

497
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,080
If you don't,

498
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,360
you can stop being nice to me.
It doesn't matter.

499
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,480
The truth is,

500
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,120
I'm afraid to fall in love with you.

501
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,560
Why?

502
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,160
I'm not good enough for you.

503
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,760
I'm just a programmer at a small company.

504
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,480
In this city,

505
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,080
I have no car or property,

506
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,760
nor reputable family background.

507
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,880
I might return to my
hometown two years later.

508
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,400
I couldn't give you anything.

509
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,920
What you mean is,

510
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,880
you've fallen for me, right?

511
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,280
-I...
-I'm not a materialistic person.

512
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,920
All I care about is whether the person
I like has the same feeling as me.

513
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,440
Cars and real estate property,
things like this, if we work hard,

514
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
we'll own them in the future.

515
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,370
Actually, I have many weaknesses.

516
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,640
I'm a spendthrift,

517
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,840
but don't you worry.

518
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,080
I only spend my own money.

519
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,720
I never cause trouble for my boyfriend.

520
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,640
Besides, everything I said until now,

521
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,320
what I mean is, if you like...

522
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,640
Why are you still here?

523
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,080
Ma Yi Yi, what's with you?

524
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,100
Why are you speaking in that tone?

525
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,760
What's your relationship with
him to let him kiss you?

526
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,250
Haven't you been taken
advantage enough?

527
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,440
I didn't take advantage of her.

528
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,400
I like Yi Yi. If she's willing,

529
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,520
today will be the first day
since we start dating.

530
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,040
I'm willing.

531
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,280
I'm willing.

532
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,000
[Out of so many people,
his shout was the loudest.]

533
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,480
[Mr. Ai, what were you saying just now?]

534
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,840
[-I said...]
[-Wu Ying, I like you so much.]

535
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,560
[Out of so many people,
his shout was the loudest.]

536
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,920
[Mr. Ai, what were you saying just now?

537
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,120
[-I said...]
[-Wu Ying, I like you so much.]

538
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,480
He said,

539
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,960
"I'm in love with you?"

540
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,040
No, no. It can't be. Impossible.

541
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,680
He probably said something like,

542
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,480
"I want to go down."

543
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,160
"That caught me off guard."

544
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,800
"I don't want to play anymore."

545
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,720
You must've heard it wrong, Zeng Li.

546
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,640
If he's in love with you,

547
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,920
he would've told you directly.

548
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,120
You don't have to waste time
to play guessing game here.

549
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,000
I should sleep.

550
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,240
I couldn't sleep.

551
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,120
You really think you're a hamster?

552
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,560
Zhou Wen posted on the official
account, which goes like

553
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840
the best way to avoid braces face shape

554
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,440
is to chew on chewies often.

555
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,720
You won't get braces face shape,

556
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,520
but look out for square face.

557
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,880
Really? It isn't that serious, right?

558
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,360
"To go beyond is as
wrong as to fall short."

559
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,290
Actually, what she means by that is,

560
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,870
each time when you wear braces,

561
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,080
you only have to chew
on it for five minutes.

562
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,440
Oh, right.

563
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,400
Are strawberries and grapes your favorite?

564
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,300
That's right.

565
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,720
This is for you.

566
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,200
What's this? QQ candy?

567
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,160
Didn't you say this kind
of chewies is ugly?

568
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,440
That's why I got you a nicer-looking one.

569
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,720
It's so cute.

570
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,920
Mr. Ai, did you buy this?

571
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,240
No.

572
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,160
I...

573
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,080
It was given by a manufacturer's sales
representative during their visit.

574
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,560
Oh, right.

575
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,560
Yesterday, at the emergency department,

576
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,120
your friend was on IV injection.
Is she all right?

577
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,960
She's fine for now.

578
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,040
Luckily Wu Ying wasn't in yesterday.

579
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,080
Or else, she would've removed
her appendix for sure.

580
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,720
Let's go.

581
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,280
Where are we going?

582
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,480
I'm going off work too.

583
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,520
I'll drive you home.

584
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,480
I'll go and pack up. See you in the foyer.

585
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,840
OK.

586
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,140
[Consultation Room 4]

587
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,080
Zeng Li,

588
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,790
Xiao Fan said you came to take chewies.

589
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,060
I went out just now because
something happened.

590
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,280
Here, this is for you.

591
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,800
But I met Mr. Ai just now,
and he gave me this.

592
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,960
Mr. Ai, that chewie was a
gift by manufacturer, right?

593
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,960
[Why do you ask?]

594
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,250
Yes.

595
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,080
Our hospital has this type of chewies?

596
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
Mr. Ai said it's a gift
by the manufacturer.

597
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,720
Has any chewie manufacturer visited our
hospital to promote their product lately?

598
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,520
No, there was none.

599
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,560
Our hospital has always used
this kind of transparent tube.

600
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,520
So where did Mr. Ai get this chewie from?

601
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,960
He must've bought it for his wife to use.

602
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,040
I... I'll get going.

603
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,760
[If what Zhou Wen said
is true, that means...]

604
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,040
[She didn't realize I purposely
bought it for her, right?]

605
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,160
Mr. Ai,

606
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,000
I watched the anime you told me about.

607
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,680
What did you think about it?

608
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,600
The storyline is great,

609
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,600
but how come I didn't see the
ending you were speaking of?

610
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,560
In the end, Xiao Sheng didn't hear

611
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,560
the love confession from Mikako.

612
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,360
I think every story should have an ending.

613
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,840
Think about it as the ending
I came up for the characters.

614
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,200
That seems to be a good ending.

615
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,320
So, Mr. Ai, I'll get going.

616
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,120
Look for me anytime if there's an issue.

617
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,240
If the chewie broke,

618
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,320
you can come to me too.

619
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,200
Mother.

620
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,360
Mother, wait.

621
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,840
Mother, go ahead if you
have something to tell me.

622
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,680
That man downstairs is the dentist, right?

623
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,480
What's wrong?

624
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,680
He's the reason why you
neglected Gu Dong Hai, right?

625
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,840
Gu Dong Hai told you that?

626
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,320
Do you know what he said to his father?

627
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,730
He said you already have
a dentist boyfriend,

628
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,960
yet you go on a blind date with him.

629
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,960
He doesn't know what we're thinking about.

630
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,240
Mr. Ai isn't my boyfriend.

631
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,240
I've told you that many times.

632
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,080
Besides, I have no feelings
toward Gu Dong Hai.

633
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,040
He's the one who insisted to go with
me to the hospital for follow-up.

634
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,240
Even if he didn't misunderstand
my relationship with Dr. Ai,

635
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
I'll also make things clear with him.

636
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,600
I told you so many times

637
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,200
to wait another two weeks.

638
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,360
You can make things clear with him when
Uncle Peng becomes a formal employee.

639
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,120
Why won't you listen to me?

640
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,660
Wait, don't you think
that's just using people?

641
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,080
How is that using people?

642
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,580
You'll have more time to
confirm your feelings.

643
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,820
How is that using people?

644
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,460
Your Uncle Peng will turn 60 soon.

645
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,760
It's still a side line job for him.

646
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,810
Now, finally,

647
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,360
an opportunity came by for him
to become a formal employee.

648
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,320
And now,

649
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,520
it's hopeless.

650
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,660
That's it for his career life.

651
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,400
Why won't you consider his situation,

652
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,000
and ous as well?

653
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,560
Does that mean you're going to
divorce again shortly after?

654
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,400
How can you curse your parents?

655
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,640
My parents?

656
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,880
I have a mother,

657
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,400
and three fathers.

658
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,040
Which one do you mean?

659
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,360
Zeng Li,

660
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,480
all these years,

661
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,240
no matter how difficult it
was for me or how I suffered,

662
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,640
I never thought of you
as a burden even once.

663
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,760
And now, you're giving me this attitude?

664
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,800
Mother, that's not what I meant.

665
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,280
Mother!

666
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
Mother!

667
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,680
Mother!

668
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,160
Mother!

669
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,240
Mother!

670
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,320
-Mother!
-Zeng Li!

671
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,560
Mr. Ai, what are you doing here?

672
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,590
What happened to your mouth?

673
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,680
It's nothing.

674
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,800
Did your mother hit you?

675
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,800
No.

676
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,880
Let me take a look.

677
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,280
Your lip's scraped by the braces.
It's a minor wound.

678
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,920
Wait here. I'm going to buy some medicine.

679
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,080
It's all right.

680
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,240
Mr. Ai, do you want some water or a drink?

681
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,240
Do you have an popsicle?

682
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,520
Popsicle?

683
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,160
It's for ice compression.

684
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,480
I... I'll do it myself.

685
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,840
To keep you from eating it,

686
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,840
I'd better do it.

687
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,720
Was it because of me?

688
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,920
No.

689
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,320
Really?

690
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,520
Yes.

691
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,120
It's because I had an
argument with my mother.

692
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,000
I also said some hurtful words.

693
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,040
Let me disinfect your wound.

694
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,160
You can give it to me.

695
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,920
I'm the doctor.

696
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,840
It'll hurt a little. Bear with me.

697
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,240
So, it's done.

698
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,320
Thank you.

699
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,480
I'll bring you to eat any food you like.

700
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,080
Or,

701
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,040
if there's something you'd like to do,

702
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,200
I'll also keep you company.

703
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,960
Drink slowly.

704
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,760
Actually, I know

705
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,200
my mother gets married several times

706
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,520
to provide me with better
family conditions.

707
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,320
My mother once told me,

708
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,880
she's not highly educated

709
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,160
and doesn't have any skill in particular,

710
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,320
so she could only do what she can

711
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
to provide better living
conditions for me.

712
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,920
She intervened with my studies,

713
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,920
work

714
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,240
and even dating.

715
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,560
It's better now, but I used to get
beaten by her when I was a kid.

716
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,120
Why am I being so long-winded,

717
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,840
telling this kind of things to a man?

718
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,280
I'm sure you don't like to hear it either.

719
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:16,880
No.

720
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,320
I know how you feel.

721
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,920
You don't have to comfort me.

722
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,880
I'm not bragging about how
unfortunate I am either.

723
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:24,800
In fact,

724
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,280
I think I'm living a life of happiness.

725
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,280
It's just that,

726
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,600
I don't know why I'm telling you all this.

727
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,800
It's also the first time
I'm telling others about it.

728
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,239
Then, let me tell you

729
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,560
about myself.

730
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,880
Actually, I'm a posthumous child.

731
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,520
When my parents were dating,

732
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,600
my grandmother was strongly against it.

733
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,320
Some time later,
they left this place together.

734
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,120
But no long after,

735
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,920
my father passed away in an accident.

736
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,800
My mother

737
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,920
was pregnant with me then.

738
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,760
When my grandfather found out,

739
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,440
he pleaded with her to keep the baby.

740
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,720
What about your mother?

741
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
My mother?

742
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,080
Soon after I was born,

743
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,760
she passed away.

744
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,840
So, when you talked about how
you were beaten by your mother,

745
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,960
I was envious.

746
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,680
Here you go.

747
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,720
Though I'm not exactly
good at comforting people,

748
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,080
I can hand you tissues.

749
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,560
I'm not crying.

750
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,680
The reason I told you all these

751
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,840
isn't to get your sympathy,

752
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,520
nor is it to tell you
about my life experience

753
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,600
to comfort you.

754
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,080
Throughout a person's lifetime,

755
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,960
we might have to go through a lot.

756
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,680
Pain,

757
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,040
feeling upset,

758
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,400
crying.

759
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,960
But maybe

760
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,080
after some years, you'll realize

761
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,280
the things that you thought

762
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,320
you couldn't get over with, the fixations,

763
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,160
are in fact so insignificant.

764
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,640
I suddenly feel

765
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,680
so regretful about the things
I said to my mother this afternoon.

766
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,640
Come on.

767
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,920
Let's not talk about those unhappy stuff.

768
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,380
Let's drink.

769
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,520
Cheers. As for you, suit yourself.

770
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,480
Why drink so little?

771
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,600
Didn't you tell me to "suit yourself"?

772
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,600
Come here.

773
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,560
What's wrong?

774
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,560
Stand up.

775
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,600
Stand up.

776
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,560
Actually, I've never been
in a relationship before.

777
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,280
OK.

778
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,080
This is a secret between us.

779
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,440
Don't let others hear it.

780
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,760
If that's the case,
I'll go over to your side.

781
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,600
Why don't you go back to your seat?

782
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
Why?

783
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,840
It's a little cramped.

784
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,920
What's... What's wrong?

785
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,400
Let me rest for awhile.

786
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,840
Take a seat. Come on.

787
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,000
Careful.

788
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,400
Come on.

789
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,840
It's kinda late. I'll drive you home.

790
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,920
Mr. Ai,

791
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,880
actually, one more thing
that's been bothering me.

792
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,080
Go ahead.

793
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,440
What will happen on my wedding?

794
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,800
My biological father has to come, right?

795
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,360
Uncle Deng is so good to me.

796
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,000
He also has to come, right?

797
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,120
My mother and Uncle Peng got married.

798
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,120
He has to be there, right?

799
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,480
Yes.

800
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:46,080
Three fathers sitting on
the family members' table,

801
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,880
it'll be so awkward.

802
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,120
It's indeed a problem.

803
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,760
Besides, who will

804
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,280
give me away to the groom?

805
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,360
Also, another problem
which is very serious.

806
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,400
Where's my groom?

807
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,400
I'm almost 30 years old.

808
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,440
I haven't been in a
relationship until now.

809
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,360
Even...

810
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,000
I've never...

811
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,280
Even... Kissed before.

812
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,800
I'm such a failure.

813
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,920
Actually, I feel

814
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,640
the first issue is indeed a problem.

815
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,520
But the second one is not.

816
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,800
Why?

817
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,720
Because...

818
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,240
Because...

819
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,840
Actually...

820
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,600
Hi, bringing Huggie out
on a playdate again?

821
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,680
Yes.

822
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,760
Bring one more plate of
beef to Brother Chen.

823
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,000
-Sure.
-Thank you, Boss.

824
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,200
Alaskan husky?

825
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,720
Come here.

826
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,240
Isn't this the Alaskan Husky

827
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,960
me and Wu Ying won as a gift?

828
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,000
Huggie, this sister would
like to give you a hug.

829
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,320
Huggie.

830
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,440
Come here.

831
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:06,920
Let me give you a hug.

832
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,960
Why did you put on weight?

833
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,400
And you're so furry too.

834
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,280
Hi, I'll settle my bill.

835
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,360
Sure.

836
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,320
You can't kiss me.

837
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,640
My...

838
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,180
My first kiss is still intact.

839
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,720
-Pay via WeChat.
-OK.

840
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,600
Let's go.

841
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,960
Let's go for a walk.

842
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,080
No.

843
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,520
Huggie.

844
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,400
-Zeng Li, give it back to the owner.
-Come on.

845
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,160
-She left with the dog.
-Huggie!

846
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,400
Huggie, how could you
leave with someone else?

847
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,320
Zeng Li, slow down.

848
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,320
Let's go home. I'll drive you home.

849
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,160
No, I don't want to go home.

850
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,200
I want to drink some more.

851
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,850
Don't. Next time, OK?

852
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,050
All the restaurants nearby have closed.

853
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,120
Where are you going to drink?

854
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,480
There's one more place.

855
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,720
I know that place

856
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,280
is still open.

857
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,560
Let's go.

858
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,840
Slow down.

859
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,360
Doggie,

860
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,680
why are you taller now?

861
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,140
[CAROL'S]

862
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,720
Carl's?

863
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,120
Carol.

864
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,120
That's my name,

865
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,160
but the heart is supposed
to be the letter O.

866
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,800
The heart's gone haywire.

867
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,960
It's gone.

868
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,000
So is my heart.

869
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,440
Come on.

870
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,240
Sit down!

871
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,320
It won't take long.

872
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,330
Zeng Li, stop making coffee.

873
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,720
This is the sixth cup already.

874
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,280
Zeng Li,

875
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,800
let me drive you home.

876
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,040
Look, it's already 3am.

877
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,160
I'm doing latte art.

878
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,840
It'll be ready soon.

879
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,560
Done.

880
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,520
I made you this myself.

881
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,160
A caramel macchiato.

882
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,760
It's on the house.

883
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,120
I don't drink coffee.

884
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,760
You don't drink coffee?

885
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,280
But I made this for you myself.

886
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,520
If you aren't going to drink,

887
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,120
-I will.
-You can't.

888
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,200
You just changed your braces,

889
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:01,680
you'll have to redo the
braces once you drink it.

890
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,440
You won't let me drink,

891
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,080
yet you won't drink either.

892
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,800
One mouthful, that's all.

893
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,040
I'm not drinking, really.

894
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,040
I'm a dentist. I don't drink coffee.

895
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,480
Besides, it's so late.

896
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,480
I'll have trouble sleeping
once I drink it, right?

897
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,800
