you asked me out for a meal

45
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,020
because of conscience.

Clearly, you're still the same.

You're distracted.

48

You agreed to come out for a meal

49
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,220
because you want me

50
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,170

You even approached me
to ask about him.

Do not misunderstand.

57
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,500
The reason why I'm asking

58
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,250
is because we're in the same organization.

59
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,940
It's not a big deal.

60
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,100
The employees of the welfare centre

61
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,100
mentioned how competent he is.

62
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,300
Perhaps, we may get
a chance to work together.

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:20,730
Isn't it?

64
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,579

worked with my brother

lie in the company.

Okay.

192
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:12,940
Hello, Mr. Ai.

193
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:13,890
[We're at the karaoke.]

194
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,410
[Yes, Sister Zeng Li
forgot to bring her phone.]

195
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,500
[She asked if you'd
like to join us.]

196
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,210
Let's order liquor.

197
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,740
I shall get him

198
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,770
[drunk today.]

199
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,060
[He shouldn't have mistreated Zeng Li.]

200
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,970
What did he do?

201
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,140
What happened?

202
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:24,890
[It's none of your concern.]

203
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,210
[All you have to do is make him drunk.]

204
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,940
Pass me the phone.

205
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,620
Let me.

206
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,650
Hello, Mr. Ai.

207
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,580
Hello, Zeng Li.

208
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,620
Are you alright?

209
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,940
I'm fine.

210
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,380
You're busy?

211
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,770
It's fine.

212
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,020
[Don't worry.]

213
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,650
Mr. Ai said

214
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,450
he's occupied right now.

215
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,580
He won't be able to make it.

216
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,770
He's going to treat you
guys to a meal some time.

217
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,409
Hello.

218
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,770
Nayuki next to

219
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,450
the karaoke?

220
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,210
[Sure.]

221
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,580
[I'll meet you there.]

222
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,260
All right.

223
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,140
I'm leaving.

224
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,060
Hold up.

225
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,140
You haven't explained.

226
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,020
What did he do to you?

227
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,090
This...

228
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,060
Deng Hao Ran.

229
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,580
Deng Hao Ran.

230
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,740
You should go.

231
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,140
You don't have a phone with you.

232
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,970
Don't go too far.

233
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,460
[CAROL'S]

234
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,020
Is this the one?

235
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,500
Go away.

236
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,140
-Come on.
-No.

237
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,740
No.

238
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,380
No.

239
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,530
I want someone good looking.

240
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,210
What are you doing?

241
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,020
Since when have you kept in touch

242
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,700
with Lily?

243
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,500
What's the matter?

244
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,620
It's not

245
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,700
illegal in our country

246
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,140
to keep in touch with
an ex after breaking up.

247
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,740
Or am I only

248
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,700
allowed to keep in touch with

249
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,260
you?

250
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,210
Sure, you can.

251
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,500
Of course you can.

252
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,820
The next time this happens,

253
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,740
I'm going to give you a slap.

254
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,380
Look.

255
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,820
I don't feel like talking to her.

256
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,060
Look at her.

257
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,409
Every time

258
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:48,409
she texts me,

259
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,700
all I do is reply with a meme.

260
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,380
Take a look.

261
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:50,740
I don't want to.

262
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,500
Take a look.

263
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:51,940
I don't want to.

264
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:52,530
Take a look.

265
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,020
No.

266
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,620
[If you'd like to find out
more about Chris,]

267
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,420
[Li Li]

268
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,290
[let me know.]

269
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,140
[Do not forget to]

270
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,060
[recommend profitable shares to me too.]

271
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,260
Why are you asking
about Chris for no reason?

272
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,740
What's wrong?

273
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,620
I'm building a network

274
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,090
and making connections.
What do you know?

275
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,290
I don't believe you.

276
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:08,770
Tell me.

277
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,290
I'm worried you'd be deceived again.

278
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:14,740
Stop.

279
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,290
Cut the crap.

280
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,380
I do not believe

281
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,260
the nonsense you say.

282
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,290
He came from a wealthy family.

283
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,890
He's pretty capable too.

284
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,650
He's not philanderous.

285
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,530
He doesn't have a girlfriend

286
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,290
nor a wife.

287
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,890
Are you serious?

288
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,650
Forget about it.

289
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,380
He may be great,

290
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,940
but the both of you aren't
suitable for each other.

291
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,700
In what way?

292
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,059
Hurry up.

293
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,700
Grab a mike.

294
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,140
This is a song I selected for us.

295
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,620
It's really good.

296
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,340
Isn't this

297
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,140
Wu Ying and her Brother Lu's

298
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,860
song?

299
00:08:59,260 --> 00:08:59,860
What's the matter?

300
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:00,770
It's nothing.

301
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:08,690
It's nothing.

302
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,380
This isn't far from the karaoke.

303
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,140
Why hasn't she arrive?

304
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,930
[Hey, Mr. Ai.]

305
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,380
Hello.

306
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,140
[Sorry.]

307
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,100
[It's too loud in here.]

308
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:17,810
[What's the matter?]

309
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,170
Zeng Li hasn't

310
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:19,570
arrive yet.

311
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,810
Did she return?

312
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,770
She left for a long time.

313
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,860
The both of you
haven't met up?

314
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,930
She mentioned

315
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,740
Nayuki just now.

316
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,980
Did I get it right?

317
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,860
[Yes.]

318
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,100
The brand has branches everywhere.

319
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,100
[Are you guys at the wrong location?]

320
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,100
It's already 7pm.

321
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,650
It's been an hour.

322
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,980
Why hasn't Mr. Ai show up?

323
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,530
You're late.

324
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,690
Did you know

325
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,570
how long have I waited for you?

326
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,410
Look at the

327
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,290
location you sent me.

328
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,530
Down west of the street,

329
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,220
there's another Nayuki.

330
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,220
Excuse me.

331
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,690
Is there another branch

332
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,460
of Nayuki around here?

333
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,100
Yes.

334
00:09:59,260 --> 00:09:59,770
Where is it?

335
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,500
Follow along this street.

336
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,260
Pass through two junctions.

337
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,930

489
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,330
I just got accepted to
Donghu University.

490
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,570
I got to know him online.

491
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,180
Afterwards, he came
to Donghu for me.

492
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,130
My dad found out.

493
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,370
He learned that he was
in the sports industry

494
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,940
and didn't have
much qualifications.

495
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,130
He didn't come from a
great background either.

496
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,370
My father objected

497
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,130

498
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,420
Out of impulsiveness,

499
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,180
I went to Binhai with him.

500
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,940
I almost dropped out of school.

501
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,330
You gave up on studies for him?

502
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,020
You guys eloped?

503
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,220
It's unlike me to do so, right?

504
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,610
It's totally unlike you.

505
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,050
I was really rebellious in the past.

506
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,370
Actually,

507
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,660
I've an older brother.

508
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,500
My parents

509
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,020
gave birth to me in their forties.

510
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:29,980
Because

511
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,330
everyone in the family spoils me,

512
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,130
I was a daredevil
when I was young.

513
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,850
I was fearless.

514
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,810
However, when I was at Binhai,

515
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,220
my brother was caught
in a car accident

516
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,570
and passed away.

517
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,770
He loved me the most.

518
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,740
He'd always leave the best

519
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,700
to me.

520
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,420
However, I wasn't able to see him

521
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,130
for the last time.

522
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,570
I returned to Donghu after that

523
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,850
to attend my brother's funeral.

524
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,810
My parents

525
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,180
looked so much older all of a sudden.

526
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,090
Honestly,

527
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:16,740
whenever I recall the past,

528
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,460
it feels like

529
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,810
everything happened
not long ago.

530
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,290
From then on,

531
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,810
I realised

532
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,530
I can no longer
afford to act arbitrarily.

533
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,370
I can't fool along anymore.

534
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,570
My parents are old.

535
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,090
I'm their

536
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,810
only hope.

537
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,180
After attending

538
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,260
to the matters at home,

539
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,180
I submitted a plead
to the university.

540
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,090
It wasn't easy for me

541
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,810
to return to school.

542
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,290
Subsequently, I stopped contacting

543
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,610
that boyfriend of mine.

544
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:43,570
What's wrong?

545
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,330
After learning how much I've done

546
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,660
for someone else,

547
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,610
are you upset?

548
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,090
In my opinion,

549
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,850
you and him shared a song.

550
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,220
We must share a song too.

551
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,770
Let's go.

552
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,020
What are you doing?

553
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,220
Follow me and find out.

554
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,130
Where are we going?

555
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,980
Dance with the aunties.

556
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,370
Learn to dance

557
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,020
just like me. Come on.

558
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,260
It's fun.

559
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,020

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,700

561

00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,050
Yes.

563
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,370
I'd never forget this
song for the rest of my life.

564
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,260
This shall be our song from now on.

565
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,460
♫ I feel alone ♫

566
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,180
Okay.

567
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,540
♫ I never knew ♫

568
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,020
♫ If it doesn't matter ♫

569
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,660
♫ You never know how much I love you ♫

570
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,500
♫ No matter you're with me ♫

571
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,260
♫ Stars beneath your eyes ♫

572
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,420
♫ Waiting for you on the other side ♫

573
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:22,770
Let me take a look.

574
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,660
It's a huge wound.

575
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,940
Is it going to scar you?

576
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,130
Wu Ying said

577
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,530
she used the thinnest
surgical suture

578
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,500
and the stitches were detailed.

579
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,260
It will not leave a scar.

580
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,050
That's good.

581
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,810
Otherwise, I'll be made
the library's only attraction.

582
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,050
I'd be lonely.

583
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,660
You should

584
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,980
enjoy that sense of loneliness.

585
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:42,980
Anyway,

586
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:43,850
how did you find out

587
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:44,370
I was injured?

588
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,660
I wanted to give all of you a surprise

589
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,610
when I return to work.

590
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,020
Dr. Ai called the department yesterday

591
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,850
to request a leave on your behalf.

592
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,050
Mr. Li told me

593
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:50,850
to remind you

594
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,290
to focus on recuperating.

595
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,740
Do not even think about work.

596
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,740
Leave it all to us.

597
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:55,500
What?

598
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,740
Mr. Ai requested a
leave on my behalf?

599
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,180
You didn't know?

600
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,220
I was wondering

601
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,260
why did he request
for a leave instead.

602
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,740
Could it be

603
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,180
that the both of you
are finally together?

604
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,260
No.

605
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,330
Let me explain.

606
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:14,980
This is the case.

607
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:16,850
I need to answer the door.

608
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:17,740
Stay seated.

609
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,570
You're a patient.

610
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,660
Don't move.

611
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,290
I'll be back

612
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:20,940
to interrogate you.

613
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,050
I'm coming.

614
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,770
I'm coming.

615
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,660
Mr. Ai?

616
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,330
How considerate, Mr. Ai.

617
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,220
Come on in.

618
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,130
What are you doing here?

619
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,740
I wanted to come by in the afternoon,

620
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,740
but I was worried you'd be asleep.

621
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:43,530
By the way,

622
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,740
why are these still
out there by the door?

623
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,740
I thought they belonged
to one of the neighbours

624
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,740
and were delivered wrongly.

625
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,050
I was waiting for the courier

626
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:49,810
to pick them up.

627
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,770
Silly girl.

628
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,420
Silly girl.

629
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,420
I sent them over yesterday.

630
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,810
I should be hiding in my car.

631
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,130
I'll cook something up.

632
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,570
You guys should catch up.

633
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,130
Zeng Li.

634
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,220
All right. Come over here.

635
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,500
Long legs.

636
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,940
Prominent nose bridge.

637
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,940
Double eyelids.

638
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:31,090
He's gorgeous.

639
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,370
Zeng Li.

640
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,260
This accident is totally worth it.

641
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,810
Can you keep it down?

642
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,810
The food will be ready

643
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,370
in another 30 minutes.

644
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,290
Would you like to stay for dinner?

645
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,330
It's fine.

646
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,460
I suddenly recall there are

647
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,420
things to tend to at home.

648
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,260
I shall get going.

649
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,290
I'll see you off.

650
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:48,810
It's fine.

651
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,940
When you recover,

652
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:50,810
I'll see you at work.

653
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,180
Dr. Ai.

654
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:54,370
Bye.

655
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:55,900
See you.

656
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,770
Get back to what you were doing.

657
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:04,980
Don't worry about me.

658
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,020
Did I do something wrong?

659
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,610
Why did she leave all of a sudden?

660
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,370
Nothing.

661
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,850
People always complain

662
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,020
I'm being too

663
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,980
aloof to others

664
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,900
at work or in school.

665
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,740
Wan Xia probably just wants

666
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,530
to leave us alone.

667
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,500
I understand.

668
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,660
-Zeng Li.
-Mr. Ai.

669
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,570
Go ahead.

670
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,130
You go.

671
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,090
I just wanted to ask

672
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,900
if I could help you cook.

673
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,370
I wanted to ask

674
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,020
if you'd like to help me cook.

675
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,610
Yes.

676
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,180
Must we hold hands
at home as well?

677
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:51,810
Yes.

678
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,180
What do you

679
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,980
need me to do?

680
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,810
Let me see.

681
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,740
I'll think about it.

682
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,020
Can you chop the vegetables?

683
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,850
Yes.

684
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:09,740
Here you go.

685
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,180
What do you think?

686
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,460
It seems like

687
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
you really enjoy eating tofu.

688
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,700
I meant it literally.

689
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,610
We had tofu two days ago

690
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,770
and we're having tofu today as well.

691
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,370
Your chin is injured.

692
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,180
I wanted to make

693
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,500
something you could chew.

694
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,090
You sure are considerate, Mr. Ai.

695
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,090
Would you like to give it a taste?

696
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,370
It's hot.

697
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:35,260
Open up.

698
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,260
What do you think?

699
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,940
Mr. Ai's tofu tastes great.

700
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,530
By the way,

701
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,570
why did you request a leave

702
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,330
from the library on my behalf?

703
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,420
I couldn't contact you yesterday.

704
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,420
I tried reaching Ma Yi Yi and

705
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,180
Wu Ying,

706
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,810
but they did not pick up.

707
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,460
Deng Hao Ran answered my call,

708
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,660
but it seems like

709
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,940
he didn't want to talk.

710
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,940
Afterwards,

711
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,900
I went to the cafe to meet Dou Dou.

712
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,500
She said you weren't
around for the entire day.

713
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,330
I went through my list of contacts.

714
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,130
I realised among the

715
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,290
people around you I could contact,

716
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,530
the only person was Mr. Li.

717
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:14,810
I gave him

718
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,530
a call

719
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,290
and requested a leave on your behalf.

720
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:18,980
Here.

721
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:25,740
What's wrong?

722
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,180
Nothing.

723
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,850
I didn't know my girlfriend

724
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,020
was a cry baby.

725
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,610
Are you teasing me, Mr. Ai?

726
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,570
No.

727
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:42,850
By the way,

728
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:43,980
from now on,

729
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,980
can you stop
calling me Mr. Ai?

730
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,460
What should I call you then?

731
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,570
Dr. Ai?

732
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,420
Professor Ai?

733
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,260
Mr. Ai?

734
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,900
What does your mom usually

735
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,660
call your dad?

736
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,420
You mean, my biological dad?

737
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,220
Yes.

738
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,460
Scoundrel.

739
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,130
I remember

740
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,460
that's what she calls him when

741
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,090
the relationship was rocky.

742
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,700
When their relationship
was fine, she calls him

743
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,220
scoundrel in this tone.

744
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:18,770
Forget it.

745
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,610
Stick to Mr. Ai then.

746
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,770
What's wrong?

747
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,290
Scoundrel sounds pretty good.

748
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,610
Scoundrel.

749
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,370
All right.

750
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,500
Scoundrel.

751
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,130
Let's eat.

752
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,260
Scoundrel.

753
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,220
Hurry up and eat.

754
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:33,610
Don't move.

755
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,260
Scoundrel.

756
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,050
Boss, two bottles of water.

757
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,180
Room temperature or iced?

758
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:46,810
Iced.

759
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:47,980
Room temperature, please.

760
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,260
Reduce consuming cold drinks.
It's bad for the body.

761
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,330
Sister, it's you.

762
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,180
Don't you recognise me?

763
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,460
I used to play games
here all the time.

764
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,810
You even ordered me around.

765
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,770
We got into a fight.

766
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,570
Are you the son of the owner?

767
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,980
You're all grown up.

768
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:05,570
In the past,

769
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,850
you were only this tall.

770
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:07,940
That was years ago.

771
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,290
I'm already 20 this year.

772
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,290
Sister.

773
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,330
Did you graduate earlier?

774
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,420
I haven't seen you in a long time.

775
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,180
Is this your boyfriend?

776
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:26,940
How much is this?

777
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,770
4 bucks.

778
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,260
There you go. I shall get going.

779
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,660
Sure.

780
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,660
Liu Yu Cheng, slow down.

781
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,740
You stormed off.

782
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:46,850
Are you upset?

783
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,050
No.

784
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,850
That was just a natural reaction.

785
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,770
Don't overthink.

786
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,420
Get over here.

787
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,130
You're just ashamed of

788
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,370
dating me.

789
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,050
No.

790
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,180
You're only a year older

791
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,290
than that brat.

792
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,090
What's wrong with that?

793
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,500
When I entered university,

794
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,130
he was 11.

795
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:12,850
You were only 12.

796
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:13,740
You were all

797
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,180
kids who were 150cm tall.

798
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,180
It feels like

799
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,980
I extended my claws to you.

800
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,420
Don't be ridiculous.

801
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,290
On the contrary, I feel like
I'm not good enough for you.

802
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,130
Look at you.

803
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,420
You're beautiful, smart,

804
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,050
career driven,

805
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,050
decisive,

806
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,290
and kind-hearted.

807
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,570
If I were to name some
of your weaknesses,

808
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,980
you're bad at games.

809
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,940
I've always worried

810
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,330
that once it starts to get boring

811
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,220
after two years,

812
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,290
you'd break up with me.

813
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,570
What is

814
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,220
going through that
silly head of yours?

815
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,370
That has never crossed my mind.

816
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,530
Really?

817
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,660
Can I come home

818
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,530
with you this week?

819
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,420
This week?

820
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:18,050
That's a bit of a rush.

821
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,940
You're right.

822
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,570
Next week, then.

823
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,020
Think about it.

824
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,940
My parents are already

825
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,940
in their sixties and seventies.

826
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,570
What happens

827
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,500
if their blood pressure
spike when they see you?

828
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,020
What about the week later?

829
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,260
No, what I mean is,

830
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,290
we should plan this properly.

831
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:35,980
I got it.

832
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,370
I'm still not good enough for you.

833
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:40,660
If only

834
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,980
time travelling exists.

835
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,570
If only I could go back in time

836
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,530
at my current age

837
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,050
to meet you in the past,

838
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,090
I'm willing to do anything.

839
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,220
You're really impatient.

840
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,090
Yes.

841
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,090
You're still young.

842
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:57,810
You've plenty of time.

843
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,050
I should be the one who's concerned.

844
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,370
I don't want you to feel that way.

845
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,700
If your parents agree
to our relationship,

846
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,610
we'd be able to see each other

847
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,370
freely, without any pressure.

848
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:08,740
Isn't that great?

849
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,460
You asked for this.

850
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,610
I've made up my mind.

851
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,090
There's no better day than today.

852
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,770
You shall come home with me this week.

853
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,420
-Really?
-Hurry up.

854
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,180
Dr. Ai.

855
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,260
What's wrong?

856
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,660
You're slower today.

857
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,610
I'm not

858
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:30,850
in my best form today.

859
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,220
Xiao Chu.

860
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,180
Do you notice

861
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,700
how fast time passes?

862
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,180
It's gone in the blink of an eye.

863
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,610
Do you remember

864
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,570
how the both of us

865
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,220
ended up as friends?

866
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,530
Of course.

867
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,220
We were roommates then.

868
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,330
You'd always bring

869
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,220
guests over.

870
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,130
The parties would go on late.

871
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,740
The garbage were
left till the next day.

872
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:55,850
One day,

873
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,130
you ended the party early,

874
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,770
came to my room and asked,

875
00:31:59,130 --> 00:31:59,660
do you

876
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,940
sleep around 11pm every night?

877
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,570
You said, not around 11pm,

878
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,420
at 11pm sharp.

879
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,500
Back then, I thought

880
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,530
you're pretty weird.

881
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,020
You were young.

882
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,770
You didn't have many friends.

883
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:13,940
Honestly,

884
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,050
those weren't the problem.

885
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,460
The problem is

886
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,610
no matter how upset or

887
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:18,700
frustrated you are,

888
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,420
you refused to express yourself.

889
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:21,610
Back then,

890
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,740
if I did not approach you to ask,

891
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,290
by the time you move out,

892
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,850
we'd probably remain as

893
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,980
acquaintances who
shared a place together.

894
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,020
Yes.

895
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,260
Fortunately,

896
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,180
you took the initiative.

897
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,420
We became best friends after.

898
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,130
The distance between people

899
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,370
is fascinating.

900
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,260
A single step further,
or a single step back

901
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,420
will make a difference.

902
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,770
In life,

903
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,420
it isn't easy to find someone

904
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,330
just nice.

905
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,180
Yu Yi.

906
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,700
I've been trying to
find an opportunity

907
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,660
to talk to you about Zeng Li.

908
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,330
There's no need to explain.

909
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:55,460
I know the both of you

910
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,330
well enough.

911
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,220
You're both an enigma.

912
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,900
You keep everything inside,

913
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,770
but it's also written on your face.

914
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,050
In the past,

915
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,130
all I did was focus on myself.

916
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,050
I ran forward

917
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,460
without looking back.

918
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,810
I did not realise

919
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,610
there was once

920
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,740
a great girl

921
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,500
right behind me.

922
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,610
I did not cherish her.

923
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,220
You should know

924
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,660
that Zeng Li is different from I am.

925
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,460
Although she looks cheerful,

926
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,290
she's always overthinking.

927
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,940
She keeps everything to herself.

928
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,370
If you'd like to date her,

929
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,260
you should take the initiative.

930
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,530
Honestly,

931
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,530
precisely because the
both of you are alike,

932
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,700
you would

933
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,610
understand her better than I do.

934
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,530
Thus, I talked to her.

935
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,570
The both of your
magnetic forces are similar.

936
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,180
She will be happy

937
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,370
with you.

938
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,810
Don't worry.

939
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,420
I'll protect her.

940
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,610
I'll take care of her.

941
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:48,900
I would rather

942
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,610
you not.

943
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,460
That way,

944
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,460
I can steal her for myself.

945
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,500
Don't forget.

946
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,180
One's first love

947
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,460
is flawless.

948
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,290
Don't worry.

949
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,090
I'm pretty confident about this.

950
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,090
That's impossible.

951
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:00,700
I'm leaving.

952
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,180
Youngest uncle.

953
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,739
Are the both of you here

954
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:10,500
to provoke me on purpose?

955
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,130
How inconsiderate.

956
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,090
Get used to it.

957
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:15,810
I'll leave you to talk.

958
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,020
I'm going to help him
with the luggage.

959
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,500
Okay.

960
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,090
I was told that you're
returning to The States

961
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,130
to discuss about the
branch at Yancheng.

962
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,250
You mentioned

963
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,530
being assigned to the
branch at Donghu.

964
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,460
Why are you transferring
to Yancheng abruptly?

965
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,900
Was it because of us?

966
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,900
What are you talking about?

967
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,530
Am I that weak?

968
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,650
The Yancheng branch

969
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,900
offered a better position

970
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,050
coincidentally.

971
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:48,860
Don't worry.

972
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,130
No matter where I end up at,

973
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,650
it's merely

974
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,340
due to better and
more suitable

975
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,090
job opportunities.

976
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:56,940
I know.

977
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,460
You've always been

978
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,420
exceptional.

979
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,090
Since Xiao Chu isn't here,

980
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,610
I would like to

981
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,380
express my feelings.

982
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,130
How mysterious.

983
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,020
Go ahead.

984
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,690
Xiao Chu is exceptional

985
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,860
and smart.

986
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,170
On the path of becoming a doctor,

987
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,090
he was completely focused.

988
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,860
Being with him,

989
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,420
you will not be

990
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,610
troubled by trivialities.

991
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,250
Besides,

992
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,090
he's one

993
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,340
to live in his ideals.

994
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,340
When he falls in love with someone,

995
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,690
he will treat her right
with everything he owns.

996
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,250
Thus, the both of you

997
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,340
are meant for each other.

998
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,650
Good girl.

999
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,980
Good girl.

1000
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,860
When you grow up,

1001
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:55,860
and leave home,

1002
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,090
you'd be independent.

1003
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,050
Do not cry.

1004
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,340
I told you once.

1005
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:07,570
You're ugly when you cry.

1006
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:08,980
I...

1007
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,460
Don't look at me if
I'm too ugly for you.

1008
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,610
No matter where I go,

1009
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,690
I'd wish both of you the best.

1010
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:21,570
Here you go.

1011
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:22,900
Thanks.

1012
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,500
It's running late.

1013
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,530
I should get going.

1014
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,570
I'm heading in.

1015
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,090
Have a safe journey.

1016
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,300
Yu Yi.

1017
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,610
Youngest uncle.

1018
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:50,300
I'm leaving.

1019
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:00,650
Goodbye.
