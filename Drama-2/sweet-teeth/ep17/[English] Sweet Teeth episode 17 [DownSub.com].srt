00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,930
can you stop giving

00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:23,900
such a small amount of money?

00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,820
[Zeng Li, calm down.]

135
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,180
I won't advise you

136
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,180
to undergo teeth whitening

137
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,140
because it is not permanent.

138
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,740
After undergoing the treatment,

139
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,740
you might get sensitive teeth.

140
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,620
Sister Zeng,

141
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:53,450
you're gorgeous today!

142
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,770
Tell me your lipstick colour.

143
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,409
Can you see my lipstick?

144
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,210
Nude makeup

145
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,410
is just a lie.

146
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,620
No worries.

147
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,060
Mr. Ai

148
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,620
won't notice at all.

149
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,770
You look so gorgeous today.

150
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,020
Are you going for a date

151
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,020
after the appointment?

152
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,620
I can't blame you.

153
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,970
Mr. Ai is leaving to

154
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,020
Africa soon.

155
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,290
You should cherish every moment

156
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,770
to date with him.

157
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,180
I beg your pardon.

158
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:21,500
Africa?

159
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,330
Mr. Ai is assigned to

160
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,020
the medical aid project
in Africa.

161
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,500
Aren't you aware of it?

162
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,210
It's your turn, Sister Zeng.

163
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:45,930
You're here.

164
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,220
How was your new year celebration?

165
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,930
What's wrong?

166
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,890
Nothing.

167
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,380
I heard that

168
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,220
you're going to Africa for
the medical aid project.

169
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,980
I'm not aware of it.

170
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,460
Is it a joke?

171
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,380
No.

172
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,290
I've passed your case

173
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,620
to Professor Wang.

174
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,100
He's my mentor

175
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,980
in Orthodontics.

176
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,220
You don't have to worry about it.

177
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,100
I've confirmed your appointments

178
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:29,860
with him too.

179
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,570
Am I only a patient

180
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,770
to you?

181
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,620
It's such a serious matter.

182
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,460
You didn't even bother
to inform me.

183
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,410
I'm sorry, Zeng Li.

184
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,290
I wanted to tell you

185
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,020
but I just couldn't

186
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,340
get a suitable chance.

187
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:43,770
Therefore...

188
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,770
Can you not go?

189
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,930
Each department must send
a representative.

190
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,100
It has been set.

191
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,570
However, Africa is dangerous.

192
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,980
There are Ebola Virus and

193
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,980
and Lhasa Virus.

194
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:57,890
You might get infected and

195
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,050
lose your life!

196
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,460
Stop cursing me.

197
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,410
The medical aid project

198
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,220
has been carried out for years.

199
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,460
The precaution is perfect.

200
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,460
You don't have to worry about it.

201
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,140
No,

202
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,290
but I read that

203
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,770
Malaria is spreading there.

204
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,620
For instance,

205
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,890
you were bitten by a mosquito

206
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,340
and got infected.

207
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,810
Your immune system would be
destroyed

208
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,290
and...

209
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,290
That's just an exception.

210
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,690
The worse the condition,

211
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,690
the more a doctor is needed.

212
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,570
We're not only

213
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,860
treating the patients there.

214
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,100
We're saving their lives.

215
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,260
No worries.

216
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,340
Since I've volunteered to join,

217
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,050
I'm confident to protect myself.

218
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,930
Did you volunteer to join?

219
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,220
Are you avoiding me?

220
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,460
No.

221
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,890
I've volunteered myself

222
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,500
in this project for years.

223
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,500
It's only a coincidence.

224
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,380
If I didn't come for
the appointment,

225
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,770
I wouldn't be informed

226
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,380
even after you've left, right?

227
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,340
Zeng Li...

228
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,220
Mr. Ai,

229
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,980
the previous patient

230
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,620
has been anaesthetized.

231
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,770
I got it.

232
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:00,930
Give me a moment.

233
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,890
Zeng Li,

234
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,740
let's have lunch

235
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,500
in the afternoon.

236
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,620
We shall talk about this later.

237
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,050
Is it okay?

238
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,690
Professor Wang wants to meet you

239
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,650
in the afternoon.

240
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,500
Let's have dinner then.

241
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,260
I'll meet you

242
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,380
after the class.

243
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,140
Is it okay?

244
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,100
You've made up your mind.

245
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,690
What's the point for me
to wait for you?

246
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,690
Zeng Li.

247
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,140
Yi Yi,

248
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:30,930
I'm

249
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,050
a fool.

250
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,100
I thought he ignored me

251
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,260
because there was
some misunderstanding

252
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,410
about my relationship with Yu Yi.

253
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,690
I could explain to him.

254
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,260
He didn't care about me at all.

255
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,410
I was the last one
to be informed of

256
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,740
this matter.

257
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,570
Did you tell Mr. Ai that

258
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,810
you had rejected Yu Yi?

259
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,380
Mr. Ai might stay

260
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,500
after knowing about it.

261
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,170
No,

262
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,740
he volunteered himself
to go to Africa.

263
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,260
Maybe he is afraid

264
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:52,890
to affect his friendship
with Yu Yi

265
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,770
because of me.

266
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,410
If I told him

267
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,140
about it,

268
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,100
it would be more awkward for us.

269
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,860
He's going to Africa

270
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,500
for six months.

271
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,340
[He's too much.]

272
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,220
Ma Xiao Bing!

273
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:06,980
I saw Ma Xiao Bing.

274
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,650
I'll talk to you later.

275
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,020
Don't you agree?

276
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,050
Miss!

277
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,500

278
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,140
Let me get you up.

She's badly injured.

280
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,770
What shall we do?

281
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,410
Hello, is it 120?

282
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,380
Someone is injured here.

283
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,620
Shall we

284
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,170
inform

285
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,100

[Hello!]

289
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,460
[She had an accident!]

290
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,260
Stop moving.

291
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,340
Why hasn't the ambulance arrived?

Let's go.

296
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,290
I'll send you to the hospital.

297
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,980
Don't worry. I'm here.

Don't worry.

301
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,140
We're reaching the hospital.

302
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,380
Stop talking and moving.

Hello, Wu Ying.

00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,290
Are you at the hospital?

307
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,460
[Zeng Li had an accident.]

308
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,380

[Is she badly injured?]

311
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,860
She hurt her chin.

312
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,020
It's bleeding extensively.

313
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,220
She lost her consciousness.

314
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,740
Did she hurt her bones and joints?

315
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,740
[Her body and joints]

[However, her chin needs
to be stitched.]

318
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:20,340
Okay!

319
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,290
I'll get ready.

320
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,740

but she didn't hurt
her jaw joint.

328
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,220
The wound needs to be stitched.

Do I need stitches?

330
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,500
It's a small surgery.

331
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,290
We don't have to do it
in the operation theatre.

332
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,380
We can do it here.

333
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,020

It might be infected.

385
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,610
Do you still feel pain?

386
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,130
A little bit.

387
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,900
You're not allowed to ride
a bicycle in the future.

388
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,370
It's safer to walk.

389
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:41,900
Mr. Ai,

390
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,330
Yu Yi and I...

391
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,020
We'll talk about it next time.

392
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,740
It should be Ma Xiao Bing

393
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,420
that your sister saw.

394
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,220
He's missing.

395
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:56,940
I think

396
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,850
he's going to take a bus
to his hometown.

397
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,020
What can he do there?

398
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,770
He's alone.

399
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,220
Ma Xiao Bing's parents

400
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,530
have passed away a long time ago.

401
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,420
He lived with his grandfather.

402
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,940
A few years ago, his grandfather

403
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,660
was diagnosed with Emphysema.

404
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,900
Therefore, the village council

405
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,770
sent him

406
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,020
to the orphanage.

407
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,020
I heard that his condition

408
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,900
is getting worse.

409
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,700
He couldn't even make it
to Donghu

410
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,020
for the surgery
for cleft lip and palate.

411
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,700
I'm sorry.

412
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,900
I need to pick up a call.

413
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,700
Hao Ran,

414
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:26,610
don't worry.

415
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,130
I'll contact

416
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,420
his hometown immediately.

417
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,290
I'll get a car

418
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,460
to fetch Ma Xiao Bing

419
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,020
in two days.

420
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,330
I saw it too.

421
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,740
I just don't get it.

422
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,130
Why are they so free

423
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,290
to spread rumours?

424
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,130
I know.

425
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,220
However, we've tried

426
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,370
all the stuffs and

427
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,460
think it is good

428
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,180
before introducing them
to others.

429
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,660
This is very important.

430
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,420
If the condition worsened,

431
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,020
you must hire a lawyer.

432
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,610
Did you get it?

433
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,700
Why can't you get it?

434
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:51,700
I...

435
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,370
Let me tell you.

436
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,050
We are

437
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:56,900
in the same boat.

438
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,290
You must settle it

439
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,530
by this afternoon.

440
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,090
Did you get it?

441
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,660
It's difficult for bloggers

442
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,020
to uphold our rights now!

443
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,330
-If I say it, I feel uncomfortable.
-Hello.

444
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:03,810
If you don't say it,

445
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,260
I feel uncomfortable too.

446
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,260
-I don't know how to explain it to you.
-Miss.

447
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,810
Anyway,

448
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,570
that's what I mean.

449
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,260
Did you get it?

450
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,420
I'm hanging up, bye.

451
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,130
Miss.

452
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,180
What's wrong?

453
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,050
Please look down.

454
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,570
Is there anything on the floor?

455
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,610
Didn't you see that
I was mopping the floor?

456
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,130
[Does he have OCD?]

457
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,570
I'm sorry.

458
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,530
Since you are the culprit,

459
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:39,740
you should clean it.

460
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,220
It's okay.

461
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,370
Lift your arms.

462
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,610
Don't cry.

463
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,980
Don't cry.

464
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,370
It's okay.

465
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,700
It doesn't matter.

466
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,330
It doesn't matter.

467
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,940
It doesn't matter.

468
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,570
Don't be scared.

469
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,770
You

470
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,770
still look nice

471
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,090
in the pink dress.

472
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:44,900
Am I right?

473
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,180
It's okay.

474
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,370
Let's go.

475
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,530
What's wrong with her?

476
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,900
I'll bring her to the teacher.

477
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,940
I'll come back later
to mop the floor.

478
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,290
Let's go.

479
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,900
Let's go.

480
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,420
Don't go there.

481
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,220
You'll dirty it again.

482
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:27,940
Come.

483
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:29,980
Where did you get it?

484
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,090
I took it from
the principal's office.

485
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,420
It was the donation.

486
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,500
Brother,

487
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,850
this is for the children.

488
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,660
We shouldn't take it.

489
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,020
It's for the children

490
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:37,810
but

491
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,940
I was the one who bought it.

492
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,700
Are you a volunteer?

493
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,220
Let's add a WeChat.

494
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,180
Keep in touch.

495
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,810
No need.

496
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:53,900
Don't get me wrong.

497
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,530
I mean

498
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,850
since we are in
the same organization.

499
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,460
Okay.

500
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,020
Great! Come.

501
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,530
Are you done?

502
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,460
Let's go.

503
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,050
See you next time.

504
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:07,980
Bye.

505
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,500
Ma Yi Yi,

506
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:20,770
I'm

507
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,610
speechless.

508
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,980
You don't have to say anything.

509
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,050
Shut up and drive.

510
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,810
If you break up,

511
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,980
don't ever ask for my comfort.

512
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,570
Let me tell you.

513
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,500
Based on

514
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,370
your speed to fall in love

515
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,260
with a stranger,

516
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,810
serve you right

517
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,980
to date all the bad guys!

518
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,530
No worries.

519
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,180
With

520
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,940
your advice,

521
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,660
I won't be cheated easily.

522
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,180
Why did you peep at my phone?

523
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,370
Let me warn you for the last time.

524
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,090
Let me tell you.

525
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,770
Not all the volunteers

526
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,500
at the orphanage are nice.

527
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,940
Of course I know about it.

528
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,850
Didn't you always
volunteer yourself

529
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,700
at the orphanage?

530
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,330
Walk slowly.

531
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,740
I only hurt my chin,

532
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,660
not my legs.

533
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,700
How can you still be talkative
after hurting your chin?

534
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,130
How do you feel?

535
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,260
Are you still feeling pain?

536
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,740
I'm a bit drowsy.

537
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,330
It's because of the anesthetic.

538
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,090
It's normal.

539
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,570
Why don't you take a nap?

540
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,700
I'll leave after preparing
the medicine.

541
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,050
Thank you, Mr. Ai.

542
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,980
My body is aching.

543
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,180
[Oh my god!]

544
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,290
[When did I take off my pants?]

545
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,420
[He must have seen everything.]

546
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,740
[Will Mr. Ai think]

547
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,260
[I'm too liberal?]

548
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,290
[What's going on?]

549
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,740
It's warm!

550
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,140
[You might not from New York,
let me tell you the story.]

551
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,660
[Why am I still reading]

552
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,740
[the same line?]

553
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,020
[Ai Jing Chu,]

554
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,900
[what's wrong with you?]

555
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,290
[Stop thinking.]

556
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,740
[Zeng Li shouldn't]

557
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,530
[get me wrong.]

558
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,740
I thought you had left.

559
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,850
I'm afraid you'll be hungry
when you wake up,

560
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,500
so I've fixed something for you.

561
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,980
The soup is ready.
I'll turn off the stove.

562
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,460
Here you go.

563
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,370
Enjoy the soup.

564
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,020
I'll go back to the hospital.

565
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:22,940
Mr. Ai,

566
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,940
I have something to tell you.

567
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,020
It's

568
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,020
about Yu Yi and I.

569
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,700
I know you read

570
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,940
my letter to Yu Yi.

571
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,570
I must admit that

572
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,180
I used to like him.

573
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,770
I thought

574
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,260
I would never fall in love

575
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,420
with anyone else, except him.

576
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,700
However, I realized that

577
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,090
I've changed

578
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,130
after graduating from
the high school.

579
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,500
I wanted to tell you

580
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,980
during the appointment

581
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,810
this morning.

582
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,530
I've made it clear to Yu Yi.

583
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,260
He is not the person that I like

584
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:09,850
but..

585
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,330
I thought

586
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,290
I had turned off the stove.

587
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,290
Maybe you had turned the fire

588
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:27,980
to the maximum.

589
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:31,570
It's possible.

590
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,260
Let me do it.

591
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:33,770
Are you okay?

592
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,460
Let me have a look.

593
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,420
Don't move.

594
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,220
Luckily

595
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,090
it's fine.

596
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,260
However,

597
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,020
you must walk carefully recently.

598
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,130
You must be careful
when you eat too.

599
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,220
Zeng Li,

600
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,180
I asked you

601
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,660
whether your heart
is still with you

602
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,020
in the Chinese New Year
phone call.

603
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,850
If it is still with you,

604
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,900
I'll take it away.

605
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,420
♫ Have you ever dreamed
about me before? ♫

606
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:36,300
♫ Two hearts that are close together
hiding under the stars ♫

607
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:42,900
♫ Gradually getting used with
the courage you send in whispers ♫

608
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:49,300
♫ Every single time
I find it hard to breath ♫

609
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:56,420
♫ You are the star of mine
I see you in the dark ♫

610
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,260
Did he kiss you?

611
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:05,940
He's inhuman.

612
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,700
How could he kiss you

613
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,050
knowing you're injured?

614
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,050
No.

615
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,220
He only

616
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:12,940
gave me a gentle kiss.

617
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,530
The effect of anesthetic

618
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,850
is not over.

619
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,420
My chin and lips

620
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,370
are still numb.

621
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,610
I can't feel much.

622
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,220
Hold on.

623
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,460
Did he confess to you?

624
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,420
His phone rang

625
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,700
when we were kissing.

626
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,220
There was a patient

627
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,130
waiting for him at the clinic,

628
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:33,900
so he left.

629
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,460
What is the relationship

630
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,260
between both of you now?

631
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,530
He kissed you

632
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,090
before he confessed.

633
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,530
How could he do that?

634
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,700
Shouldn't he confess

635
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,290
before he kisses you?

636
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,700
What kind of behaviour is this?

637
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:46,900
He's taking her advantage.

638
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,180
He's taking your advantage.

639
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,370
He's taking your advantage!

640
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,660
The tofu is tender.

641
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,330
It tastes good!

642
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,810
Take more then.

643
00:32:59,260 --> 00:32:59,700
Aunt,

644
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,420
how did you make the tofu?

645
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,290
Why do you want to learn
how to cook

646
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,330
suddenly?

647
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,050
Nothing.

648
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,220
The tofu

649
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,020
tastes good,

650
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,090
so I want to learn
how to cook it.

651
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,740
This is not the first time

652
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,570
that I cook the tofu.

653
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,090
Why did you want
to learn it suddenly?

654
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,810
You just teach him.

655
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,050
Why do you have to talk so much?

656
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,330
I only said a few words.

657
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,330
Since when I talked much?

658
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,090
Let me tell you.

659
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,130
It's simple.

660
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,220
Cut the tofu into pieces.

661
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,420
Boil them in water
for three minutes.

662
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,060
[Bean curd with crab roe]

663
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,610
Remove the water and let them dry.

664
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,220
Then, fry the crab roe.

665
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,090
Use a small fire first

666
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,810
and use high heat when
it is almost ready.

667
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:32,850
Did you get it?

668
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,180
I'll try it out tomorrow.

669
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,810
Am I blessed enough
to enjoy your cooking?

670
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,420
You should learn
to cook more dishes.

671
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,130
I can stop cooking

672
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,330
after that.

673
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,460
That's great!

674
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,420
I'll be able to enjoy

675
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,700
brother's cooking!

676
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,940
Your brother's cooking

677
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,130
definitely tastes better

678
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,050
than your mum's cooking.

679
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,180
Xiao Chu, don't only eat the tofu.

680
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,090
Take some prawns.

681
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:57,810
Yes, help yourself.

682
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,810
[I'm wondering whether]

683
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:16,420
[she has finished the chicken soup.]

684
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,820
[It won't be fresh
to leave it overnight.]

685
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,940
[Don't eat snacks for dinner.]

686
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,860
[Ai Jing Chu]

687
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,219
[Ai Jing Chu]

688
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,380
[Wait for me at home.]
