[I think my period is one week late.]

194
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,840
Is this accurate?

195
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,570
I read this online.

196
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,360
They make mistakes sometimes.

197
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,480
I brought the remaining
nine kits I tested on.

198
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:35,970
Would you like to take a look?

199
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,570
No. It's fine.

200
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,400
I was just kidding.

201
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,240
I threw the other nine that

202
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,040
showed two stripes away.

203
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,530
What are you and Liu Yu Cheng

204
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,450
planning to do?

205
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,720
Are you holding a wedding ceremony?

206
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,280
For safety purposes,

207
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,130
it's better to host the wedding

208
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:50,690
after giving birth to the child.

209
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:51,570
No.

210
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,130
Think about it.

211
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,159
Once your tummy grows,

212
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,970
you wouldn't look good in a wedding dress.

213
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,480
No.

214
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,280
Eating too much

215
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,720
would give the same effect too.

216
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,650
Guys.

217
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,090
Are you eating or not?

218
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,330
-Of course.
-Of course.

219
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,450
She has a large appetite

220
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,240
since she's eating for two.

221
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,240
I need to prep my body well

222
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,720
for the surgery.

223
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,330
What do you mean?

224
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,800
It's not the right time

225
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:28,770
to have a baby.

226
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,890
It's too abrupt for

227
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,570
Liu Yu Cheng.

228
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,039
I support you.

229
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,600
Realistically speaking,

230
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,970
I cannot imagine

231
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,210
Liu Yu Cheng as a father.

232
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,799
He's pretty young after all.

233
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,360
He

234
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,450
probably has nothing figured out.

235
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,810
Think about it properly.

236
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,240
You may discuss this matter with

237
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,090
Liu Yu Cheng as well.

238
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,360
I've made my decision.

239
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,930
That's it.

240
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,240
We're settling this matter on this table.

241
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,880
I only told the both of you.

242
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,240
Do not tell anyone else.

243
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,480
Okay.

244
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,050
I promise.

245
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:11,970
This is the part.

246
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,000
It's really funny.

247
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,690
What's the matter?

248
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,360
Nothing.

249
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,600
Is something troubling you?

250
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,520
Nothing much.

251
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,050
Clearly, something is up.

252
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:31,840
Tell me.

253
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,050
Mr. Ai.

254
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,970
I need to tell you something,

255
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,170
but you're not

256
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,170
allowed to tell anyone,

257
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,330
especially Liu Yu Cheng.

258
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,690
I need to hear about it first

259
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,240
before making a decision.

260
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,780
[Mr. Ai]

261
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:57,480
Who is it?

262
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:58,570
Mr. Ai.

263
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,330
Hello, Mr. Ai.

264
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,290
I need to tell you something.

265
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,930
No, you can't.

266
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,330
-Go on. I'm listening.
-Wait.

267
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,330
You can't tell him.

268
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,840
If you do,

269
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,720
I'm breaking up with you.

270
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,880
-I'm begging you.
-Wu Ying...

271
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,840
You can't tell him.

272
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:11,640
She's pregnant.

273
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,930
I can't believe you told him.

274
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,450
You...

275
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,360
You found out?

276
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,450
Zeng Li, that traitor.

277
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,810
Don't worry.

278
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll resolve the matter.

279
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,520
What do you mean?

280
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,210
I'm undergoing the surgery next week.

281
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,120
What kind of surgery?

282
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:02,970
An abortion.

283
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,410
Why would you abort it?

284
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,050
Have you decided to do this

285
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,760
without telling me?

286
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:08,930
Besides,

287
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,240
it's a life.

288
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,570
Calm down.

289
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,930
Listen to me.

290
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,690
Come here. Take a seat.

291
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:16,410
Come over here.

292
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,120
Sit.

293
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,410
Think about it logically.

294
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,810
You're only 21 this year.

295
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,840
Are you going to be a father?

296
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,090
Let's talk after you think it through.

297
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:34,930
I'm going to take a shower.

298
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,810
Wu Ying.

299
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,480
Let's give birth to the baby.

300
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,090
I don't mind complying
with you for other matters,

301
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,290
but this isn't a joke.

302
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,520
Wu Ying is pregnant with the child.

303
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,210
She has the rights to make the decision.

304
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,520
The child belongs to Liu Yu Cheng too.

305
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,930
He has the rights to know.

306
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:00,570
No.

307
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,520
Wu Ying made up her mind.

308
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,760
If you told Liu Yu Cheng about this,

309
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,000
it'd only cause more troubles.

310
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,210
Think from another perspective, Zeng Li.

311
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,760
If I was in

312
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,840
Liu Yu Cheng's shoes,

313
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,330
if you made

314
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
such a decision on your own,

315
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,050
I'd be enraged.

316
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,840
Fine.

317
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:14,930
Think about it from another perspective.

318
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,000
If you're mad

319
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,240
over this matter,

320
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,760
I think you do not understand me at all.

321
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,810
You're being selfish.

322
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,840
Do you hate kids?

323
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,360
No.

324
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,050
It's not a problem then.

325
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,050
You like kids,

326
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,330
so do I.

327
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,570
You love me,

328
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,480
and I love you too.

329
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,290
Once the child is born,

330
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,000
the three of us

331
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,930
would love each other.

332
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,210
Isn't that great?

333
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,240
I like children,

334
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,480
but that doesn't mean

335
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,410
I'm giving birth now.

336
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,690
Having a child is not

337
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,410
within my plan right now.

338
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,290
Do you understand?

339
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,330
But...

340
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,600
There will always be

341
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,840
changes in your life's plan.

342
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,760
Forget it.

343
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,090
We're not discussing

344
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,880
this matter anymore.

345
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,600
I'm the child's father.

346
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:16,840
You can't ignore my view

347
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,410
completely.

348
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,520
Fine.

349
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,050
Your view

350
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,760
is to keep the child.

351
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,450
Yes.

352
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,690
However, my view

353
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,720
is to undergo abortion.

354
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,640
It's decided.

355
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,480
Go to bed.

356
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,600
You said,

357
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,210
this is a matter between the both of them.

358
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,170
Why would we interfere?

359
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,760
This is bad.

360
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,840
Wu Ying would kill me.

361
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,720
I didn't want to get involved,

362
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,640
but since I found out,

363
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,570
I must deal with the

364
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,930
situation the way I deem right.

365
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,120
Hold on.

366
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,570
Right now, I feel like

367
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,240
I've betrayed my best friend.

368
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,810
Since we were kids,

369
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,690
I betrayed her for the first time.

370
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,520
You already told me.

371
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,090
You...

372
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,120
Since you've decided

373
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,050
to tell me about this,

374
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:05,810
it shows that

375
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,840
subconsciously, you agree

376
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,090
it is inappropriate to keep this
from Liu Yu Cheng.

377
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,720
No.

378
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,330
That's because

379
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,000
you're my boyfriend.

380
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,760
The both of us should

381
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,090
keep this secret together.

382
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:13,720
It feels like

383
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,290
the person I trust the most

384
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,120
just betrayed me.

385
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,240
The core of this issue

386
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,210
lies in the respect

387
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,840
two must give each other
when they are together.

388
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,050
Fine.

389
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,000
Teacher.

390
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,570
You're the best at reasoning, alright?

391
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,120
Whatever the reasons are,

392
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,640
none of it matter.

393
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,600
I can't convince you anyway.

394
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm done talking, okay?

395
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,210
Zeng Li.

396

00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,540

398
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,860

[WeChat: Currently]
[Are you mad at me?]

400
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,000
[Are you mad at me?]

401
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,810
[Congratulations. This is very dangerous.]

402
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,690
-That means you care about me.
-What?

403
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,410
Mr. Ai, I told you

404
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,600
not to tell anyone.

405
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,810
Especially Liu Yu Cheng.

406
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,930
How could you tell him?

407
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,450
Since when

408
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,410
have you become so nosy?

409
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,000
Grandpa, I want this one.

410
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:04,760
Sure, go ahead.

411
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,640
Hold on.

412
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,170
Come here.

413
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,170
Grandpa. Auntie.

414
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,290
Uncle, Xiao Xiao.

415
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:13,760
Good morning.

416
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,369
Good morning.

417
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,760
Good morning, sister.

418
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:17,410
Good morning.

419
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,369
Xiao Zeng, time for breakfast.

420
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,450
Xiao Chu isn't wake yet.

421
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,450
Go and wake him up.

422
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,480
I'm running late.

423
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm skipping breakfast.

424
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,369
I shall get going.

425
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,520
You're in a hurry to leave?
It's only 8 in the morning.

426
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,410
Bye.

427
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,800
Xiao Zeng is running late for work.

428
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:40,850
Hurry up and send her off.

429
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,130
Stop standing around.
Hurry over.

430
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:43,720
Hurry up.

431
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,560
Go on.

432
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,760
Yes, I'm moving in as soon as possible.

433
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,000
Stop the construction if possible.

434
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,240
It's fine, sir.

435
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,080
There's no need to get into the details.

436
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,280
Zeng Li, I...

437
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,370
If possible, please finish up by tomorrow.

438
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Okay. Thanks, sir.

439
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,040
[Hello.]

440
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:07,690
Sir.

441
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,560
Previously, I mentioned

442
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,800
besides the living hall,

443
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:11,650
the other rooms

444
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,800
require complete waterproofing as well.

445
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,800
The construction cannot be
finished by tomorrow, right?

446
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,280
[If I were to complete it all,]

447
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,240
[I wouldn't make it anyhow.]

448
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,970
There's no need to rush the construction.

449
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:21,930
We're not in a haste.

450
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,320
[The female tenant just]

451
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:23,930
[called me,]

452
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
[asking me to wrap it up.]

453
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,970
It's fine. I'm paying anyway.

454
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,720
Just listen to me.

455
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,610
Make sure everything is safe.

456
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,850
[All right. Sure.]

457
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,760
Please enjoy.

458
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,210
Thank you.

459
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,040
You're welcome.

460
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,720
Boss.

461
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,040
You can't ignore your customers.

462
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,970
I've been waiting forever.

463
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,240
Why aren't you taking my order?

464
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,080
Customers are always right.

465
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
How could you ignore customers?

466
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,170
What else are you trying to say?

467
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:54,970
Go on.

468
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,040
I was wrong last night.

469
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,720
Is this considered

470
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,890
an argument?

471
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:06,560
Yes.

472
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,480
Arguments

473
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,650
are something

474
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,850
all couples experience.

475
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,610
We need to resolve the matter proactively.

476
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,520
We shouldn't avoid them.

477
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,410
Sure.

478
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,690
Tell me. How should we resolve this?

479
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,520
I thought about it.

480
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,170
Since we've disagreements

481
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,040
about the child,

482
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,210
let's list out the pros and cons of

483
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,240
keeping the child.

484
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,850
Let's determine what are the
things we can overcome,

485
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,850
and what are the underlying issues.

486
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,320
That way,

487
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,210
we can make a better decision together.

488
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,690
I don't see a single benefit

489
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,720
this situation would bring us.

490
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,520
You may list the cons first.

491
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,650
Firstly,

492
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,760
I do not have plans

493
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,690
to have children right now.

494
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,170
It's impractical to have a child.

495
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,720
We're completely unprepared.

496
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,280
Besides,

497
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,370
taking care of a child is not

498
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,370
part of my three-year-plan.

499
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,000
I've a job to attend to.

500
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,760
This would greatly affect your job,

501
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,210
but I'll do my best to assist you

502
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,130
and minimise the concerns

503
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,130
you have.

504
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,320
Taking care of a child

505
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,080
is not as simple as you imagine.

506
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,210
You have not

507
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,000
graduated university.

508
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,280
It's too much pressure to raise a child.

509
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,560
That's the easiest thing to deal with.

510
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,210
My family

511
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,610
back in Malaysia is pretty well-off.

512
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,410
My family

513
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,170
would support us completely.

514
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,000
I can study while

515
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,280
make a living.

516
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,410
If worse comes to worst,
I'll drop out.

517
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,320
I've a degree

518
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,610
in engineering anyway.

519
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,890
Finding a job wouldn't be an issue.

520
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,370
Once things settle down,

521
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,850
I'll proceed with my studies.

522
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,690
Are you implying that,

523
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,560
in order to give birth

524
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,280
to this child,

525
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,520
I should give my job up

526
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,410
while you drop out?

527
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,370
Do you think this is worth it?

528
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,170
Why not?

529
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,650
In order to resolve a problem,

530
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,480
we're creating

531
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,370
countless of troubles.

532
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,890
In my opinion, it is not worth it at all.

533
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,130
Wu Ying.

534
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,890
You're seeing

535
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,480
the child as a problem right now.

536
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,450
Thus, everything

537
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,650
related to the child would be a hassle.

538
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,850
However, if

539
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,690
you think of the child as a gift,

540
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,080
everything related to the child

541
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,850
would be a surprise.

542
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,970
Liu Yu Cheng,

543
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,520
you're a child yourself.

544
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,370
You're only thinking about the present

545
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,320
when considering a problem.

546
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,610
You've no plans for the consequences.

547
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,650
If we rush into getting married

548
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,040
and giving birth,

549
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,170
forming a family,

550
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,410
it's no different than

551
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,370
playing house.

552
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,930
I'm not playing house,

553
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,930
I'm being serious.

554
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,610
I thought about this

555
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,480
all night long.

556
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,520
I listed all the possibilities

557
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,450
and impossibilities.

558
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,020
[What to do/What not to do]

559
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,410
[We should keep the child.]

560
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,280
[We shouldn't abort the child.]

561
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,720
[We should believe that the child]

562
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,480
[would bring happiness.]

563
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,890
[We shouldn't see the child]

564
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,850
[as something unfortunate.]

565
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,450
Yes.

566
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,480
I may only be 21 this year,

567
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,370
but over the past 21 years,

568
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,000
no matter what I place my mind to,

569
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,040
I'll do my best to achieve it.

570
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,480
I'll bear responsibility to the end.

571
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,480
Be it studying Traditional
Chinese Medicine,

572
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,170
or falling in love with you,

573
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,800
wanting to take care of you
for the rest of my life,

574
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,650
they are all the same.

575
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:18,760
Go back to class.

576
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,850
I need to work.

577
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,560
The problem

578
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,650
doesn't lie in the child,

579
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,000
you do not have faith in me.

580
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,800
You do not want to build a family

581
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:43,560
with the child and I

582
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,720
for the rest of your life, right?

583
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:45,480
I don't want to

584
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,170
talk about this anymore.

585
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,370
Answer me.

586
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:48,930
You've never thought of me

587
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,000
as someone capable to be a father.

588
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,320
Right?

589
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,040
Yes.

590
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Hence, in your heart,

591
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
this relationship

592
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,210
is only temporary.

593
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,370
That's not what I mean.

594
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,170
I get you now.

595
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,560
I'll think about it on my own.

596
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,370
I was wrong.

597
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,080
I didn't know

598
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,130
this would happen.

599
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,410
I shouldn't have told Mr. Ai.

600
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,890
I was wrong, Wu Ying.

601
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,520
That's enough.

602
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,080
I'm satisfied.

603
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,320
I was wrong.

604
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,170
Forget it.

605
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,320
Honestly, I knew

606
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,080
it is disrespectful to keep this

607
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,720
from Liu Yu Cheng.

608
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,930
Therefore,

609
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,170
do not ever say this

610
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:11,760
to your best friends.

611
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,130
Let me tell you something.

612
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,450
You mustn't tell anyone.

613
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,480
Because to your friends,

614
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,130
boyfriends aren't just anyone.

615
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,720
Someone without

616
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
a boyfriend like me

617
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,170
is more reliable,

618
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,210
right?

619
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,080
I caught the child's father

620
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,040
crying by the streets.

621
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,130
What's going on?

622
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,130
It wasn't me.

623
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,970
I swear.

624
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,000
It wasn't me.

625
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
I told you not to tell anyone.

626
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,320
I warned you.

627
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,760
You told me

628
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,480
not to tell anyone,

629
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,240
but you did not mention

630
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,800
about bringing this up
to the people involved.

631
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,450
How amazing.

632
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:54,850
One pregnancy

633
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,930
and it's made known to half of Donghu.

634
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,210
That's enough.

635
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,560
It's all my fault, alright?

636
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:04,560
Give me a chance

637
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,410
to make it up to all of you.

638
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,850
I'll take you guys some place fun.

639
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,060
[Ai Jing Chu]

640
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,930
[Darn that Mr. Ai.]

641
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,760
[He wouldn't reply my texts.]

642
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,690
Forget it then.

643
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,370
What's wrong, sister?

644
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:23,720
Is something wrong?

645
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,210
Did you argue with Dr. Ai

646
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,410
because of me?

647
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,410
Forget it.

648
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,450
Let's drink up.

649
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,650
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

650
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:37,850
Let me summarise

651
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:38,890
the root of your problem.

652
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,280
Let's hear this

653
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,410
nonsense you come up with this time.

654
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,720
Listen to me.

655
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,450
The problem with you guys

656
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,040
is that you often drag your partners

657
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,450
into your circle of friends.

658
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,000
What is the point of your friends?

659
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,320
For you to vent.

660
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,320
Once you're done venting,
you return to where you belong.

661
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,690
After all that,

662
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,320
you return to the sweet
embrace of your partners.

663
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,450
On the contrary,

664
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,800
not only are you guys
in a relationship,

665
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,970
you even strengthened the friendship

666
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,320
between your boyfriends.

667
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,720
That's why issues would arise.

668
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,000
That actually makes sense.

669
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,240
Not exactly.

670
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,650
They were mentor and
apprentices to begin with.

671
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,040
They were already close without us.

672
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,040
That means you chose to date

673
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,610
the wrong people.

674
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,240
Stop looking for

675
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
men from the same circle.

676
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,210
If you do so,

677
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,850
it's easier for them to
form an alliance.

678
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,650
Do you understand?

679
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,000
Perhaps, this time,

680
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,650
Liu Yu Cheng and I

681
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,480
would break up for real.

682
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,690
It's not that serious.

683
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,320
Listen to me.

684
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,410
I rushed into

685
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,520
registering for marriage.

686
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,560
It shouldn't go to the extent

687
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,800
of breaking up.

688
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,000
That's unnecessary.

689
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,850
He insists to keep the child,

690
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,850
I refused.

691
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,370
Over a disagreement
as significant as this,

692
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,760
breaking up is the only
way to resolve this.

693
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,690
Hold on.

694
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,480
How dare you criticise us?

695
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:44,690
What's wrong with me?

696
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:45,930
Look at the relationships I had.

697
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:46,850
I've never introduced anyone

698
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,320
to the circle.

699
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,320
Yes, you haven't,

700
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,800
but you did not
explain yourself after

701
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,130
taking away one of us either.

702
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,410
Let's drink up.

703
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,370
Let's drink.

704
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:55,720
Come on.

705
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,280
Not so much.

706
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,170
♫ My old home ♫

707
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,560
♫ Is in this village ♫

708
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,000
♫ I grew up in ♫

709
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,800
♫ This village ♫

710
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,040
I thought Mr. Ai and I

711
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,210
would never argue.

712
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,320
Just a little over half a month,

713
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,170
we had our first argument.

714
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:20,650
Do you think

715
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,760
we're not meant for each other?

716
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,760
You're acting spoiled.

717
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,320
You're influenced by Ma Yi Yi.

718
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,450
I thought

719
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,970
the relationship we shared this time

720
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,170
would finally be the one,

721
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,520
but it was all futile.

722
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,240
The both of you rushed into a relationship

723
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:37,850
and marriage.

724
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:38,610
Things aren't worked out yet.

725
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,650
It's just an argument.

726
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,080
It gives flavour to your relationship.

727
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:41,610
You're right.

728
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,280
Yes, it destroys a relationship.

729
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,480
Are you deaf?

730
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,170
I don't want it
to destroy my relationship.

731
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,170
There, there.

732
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,370
If I make him look for me,

733
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,720
he'd get mad.

734
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,370
We're trying to get him mad.

735
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,180
[Ai Jing Chu]

736
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,370
Mr. Ai, I was wrong.

737
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,850
Please come to me right now.

738
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,170
I'll not

739
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,850
make you mad again.

740
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,170
Don't ignore my texts.

741
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,170
Don't worry, sister.

742
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,080
There's no need to apologise to family.

743
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,800
Bones may be broken, but
you're still connected.

744
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:17,370
Isn't that right?

745
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,560
Your voice changed.

746
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,520
You changed.

747
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,850
You changed after one day.

748
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,080
You can't do this.

749
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,410
This is...

750
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,410
Shut up.

751
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,520
Zeng Li, I'm here to pick you up.

752
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,560
Mr. Ai, is that you?

753
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,170
You're not allowed to leave.

754
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,080
I'm not leaving.

755
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,210
Do you have any idea
how much I like you?

756
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:44,970
All right.

757
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,410
No, I'm clinging onto you.

758
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,930
I'm clinging onto you.

759
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,650
You can't leave.

760
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,650
We shall make a move.

761
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,850
We should leave as well.

762
00:28:58,930 --> 00:28:59,320
Let's go.

763
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,170
Get the bill.

764
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,080
We're going home.

765
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,240
The bill, please.

766
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,410
How much is it?

767
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:09,970
Watch out.

768
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:11,970
Hurry up and...

769
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,520
Watch your head.

770
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,170
I'm getting the bill.

771
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,080
-We can't go.
-Alright, sir.

772
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,210
Get him out of here.

773
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,610
Come on.

774
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,130
Mr. Ai.

775
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,000
Let's stop arguing, alright?

776
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,000
Okay.

777
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,040
I really like you.

778
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,690
I can't watch.

779
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,650
Dr. Ai.

780
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,040
Zeng Li's purse.

781
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:31,970
Okay, thanks.

782
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:32,970
Hurry up and go home.

783
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,480
Don't go.

784
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,760
I'll send you guys home first.

785
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,370
It's fine.

786
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,450
Once I send her off,

787
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,170
I'll leave on my own.

788
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,850
Go on.

789
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,520
Let's go.

790
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,130
This village...

791
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,520
-My old home...
-Yi Yi, get up.

792
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,450
Move it.

793
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,240
I live in this village.

794
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,760
-If you wouldn't budge,
-Don't sing anymore.

795
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,610
I'll leave you in this pit.

796
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,610
Watch out.

797
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,690
I'm driving.

798
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,850
Your head.

799
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:55,850
Your legs.

800
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:56,690
Next.

801
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,130
-My old home...
-Shut up.

802
00:29:59,170 --> 00:29:59,850
Stay safe.

803
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:00,560
Bye.

804
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,610
I live in this village.

805
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,410
After learning how much I've done

806
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,280
for someone else,

807
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:26,890
are

808
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:27,970
you upset?

809
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,410
You and him shared a song.

810
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,690
We must share a song too.

811
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:32,930
Where are we going?

812
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,970
Let's have some fun and

813
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:35,890
do something crazy. Come on.

814
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,480
Do you remember this song?

815
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,520
Yes.

816
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,320
I'd never forget this
song for the rest of my life.

817
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,130
This shall be

818
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,280
our song from now on.

819
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,040
Okay.

820
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,240
Sister.

821
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,040
I remember you.

822
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,480
I don't want to waste her time.

823
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,320
Why would you waste

824
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:18,930
my time?

825
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:19,720
Because I like you.

826
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:20,970
I like who you are.

827
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,000
You're all I see.

828
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,560
Wu Ying.

829
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,080
I love you.

830
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,800
I want to be with you.

831
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,320
Can you stop calling my name?

832
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,890
What am I to you?

833
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,610
My boyfriend.

834
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,720
Well,

835
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,560
am I your boyfriend now?

836
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,280
You pervert. Stop it.

837
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,720
Wait, what are you doing?

838
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,970
The baby is a life.

839
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,000
Let's give birth to the baby.

840
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,760
I want to take care of you
for the rest of my life.

841
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,040
Taking care of a child

842
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,650
is not as simple as you imagine.

843
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,170
You're a child yourself.

844
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,080
You do not have faith in me.

845
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:09,930
You've never considered

846
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,890
building a family

847
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:11,930
with a child like me.

848
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,130
Hence, in your heart,

849
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:13,690
this relationship

850
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,690
is only temporary.

851
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,320
Right?

852
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,450
[Brat.]

853
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,450
[What's wrong with being a child?]

854
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,560
[If I force you to grow up
before you're ready,]

855
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,520
[you'd only resent me in the future.]

856
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,130
I don't know what

857
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,480
this child is up to.

858
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,320
She wouldn't answer my calls.

859
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,520
What does she need a phone for?

860
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,040
Seriously.

861
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,130
Good gracious.

862
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,560
Zeng Li.

863
00:32:58,930 --> 00:32:59,560
Zeng Li.

864
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,650
Where is she?

865
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:01,520
Goodness.

866
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,720
How could this happen?

867
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,280
Excuse me.

868
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,240
Where is the tenant here?

869
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,130
Are you referring to this unit?

870
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:07,890
Yes.

871
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Where did she move to?

872
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:09,890
Who are you?

873
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,760
I'm her mother.

874
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,320
Her deliveries were redelivered to

875
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,610
Yunxi Villas.

876
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
She probably moved there.

877
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,210
Yunxi Villas?

878
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,370
That isn't where Ma Yi Yi stays.

879
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,240
It's not where Wu Ying stays either.

880
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,480
What is she doing over there?

881
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,970
This child

882
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,370
wouldn't pick up my calls.

883
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:27,280
She didn't even inform me

884
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,690
over such a huge matter.

885
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,320
I'm so mad.

886
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,620
[Deng Hao Ran]

887
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,080
I just dropped him home

888
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,320
and he's calling me already.

889
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:39,560
What is it?

890
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:41,610
[What's the matter?]

891
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,800
Why are you laughing?

892
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:45,650
Speak.

893
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,410
Why are you poking at me?

894
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,410
Stop it.

895
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,760
Speak.

896
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,280
I'm hanging up if you won't.

897
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,890
How annoying. I'm hanging up.

898
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,760
One.

899
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,720
- [You chubby thing.]
-Two.

900
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,280
Three.

901
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,780
[Switch to voice call.
End call. Flip camera.]

902
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,000
She wouldn't pick up.

903
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,409
Over here.

904
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,850
Mr. Ai, where are we going?

905
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,560
Our house is over there.

906
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,560
A bug.

907
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,639
Let's go home.

908
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,080
A bug.

909
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:49,889
Zeng Li?

910
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,409
Auntie.

911
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:55,929
Zeng Li.

912
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,640
Zeng Li, where have you been?

913
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,730
I called you many times.

914
00:34:58,810 --> 00:34:59,450
You didn't pick up.

915
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,850
Mum.

916
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,330
Mum, why didn't you come earlier?

917
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,080
Don't be afraid.

918
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,770
I'll protect you.

919
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,160
Mum.
