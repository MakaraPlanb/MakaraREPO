00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,260
Wait, beautiful.

3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,400
Our shop is having a promotion.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,640

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,600
-I have no money.

00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,120
Join swimming club with gym

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,120
I don't have time.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,680
Don't find excuses for
your laziness, little sister.

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,120
Hi, want to know more?

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,280
Hi, want to know more about
swimming club with gym?

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,480
-I...
-Excuse me...

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,760
I'm... I'm sorry.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,400
I'm really sorry. I was playing game.

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,320
-It's fine.
-No, I take this road everyday,

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,780
and I'm asked countless times a day
to do hairstyles or join membership.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,030
I'm tired of it.

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,040
Can you all remember my face

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,440
and stop asking in future?

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,080
I'll remember.

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,240
Stop following me.

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,879
I'm getting late. Sorry.

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,480
I just want to ask directions.

23
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,520
It's OK. I'll ask someone else.

24
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,680
Where do you want to go?

25
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,760
Donghu University.

26
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,680
Do this.

27
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,570
First, walk straight.

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,760
After this junction,
turn left at the next junction.

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,390
Then, you'll see a bell tower.

30
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,600
Next, turn left again, and walk for 500
metres before you make a right turn.

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,720
And you'll arrive at Donghu University.

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,880
First, you walk straight.

33
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:30,520
Next...

34
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,759
Walk straight, and after this junction,

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,400
turn left at the next junction.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,920
You can use your GPS. Are you an alien?

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,800
I'm not an alien.
I'm from another country.

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,600
I don't know why, but my Map won't launch.

39
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,479
Your Mandarin is so fluent. Are
you a returned overseas Chinese?

40
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,800
I'm a Malaysian Chinese.
I've spoken Mandarin since young.

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,030
OK. Follow me. We're headed
to the same direction anyway.

42
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,720
Sure. Thank you so much.

[Sweet Teeth]
[Episode 3]

44
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,320
Sister,

45
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,800
are you a student at Donghu University?

46
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,960
No.

47
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,780
So, you're

48
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,000
a professor?

49
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,560
No.

50
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,280
Then, what is your occupation?

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,000
Are all foreigners so curious?

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,240
I just think when two
persons walk together,

53
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,640
it'll be a little odd if
I don't say something.

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,240
Department of medicine building
is right in front. Go ahead.

55
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,520
I'm leaving.

56
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,480
Sister.

57
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,760
Sister.

58
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,480
I remember your face now.

59
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,720
Thank you.

60
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,000
My dear Xiao Chu Chu.

61
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,160
Aunt, when are you going to change

62
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,800
that habit of touching
people when you speak?

63
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,880
What's wrong? My nephew's a grown-up
now. Am I not allowed to touch him?

64
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,100
No, but we're in the university.

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,120
The students are watching.
It's not a good idea.

66
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,480
Anyway, you're right.

67
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,200
Beautiful and
young looking lady like myself

68
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
should keep a certain distance with Mr. Ai

69
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,760
so the females won't
misunderstand that you're taken.

70
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,920
Don't talk nonsense.

71
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,280
This is an university.
There're only students here.

72
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,370
Students will eventually graduate one day.

73
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,840
Besides, there're professors and staff

74
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,440
who you could consider as well.

75
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,240
Of course, I'm not giving you pressure.

76
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,680
Your grandfather said,

77
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,880
if Xiao Chu doesn't want
to find a girlfriend,

78
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,960
we can't force him to either.

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,520
It's just Ai family's
lineage will end here.

80
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,560
It isn't a serious issue.

81
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,560
You came here today just to tell me this?

82
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,079
Didn't you say you had
something to discuss with me?

83
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Oh, right. Let me introduce you.

84
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,000
Greetings, Aunt Ai. Greetings, Mr. Ai.

85
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,720
His name is Liu Yu Cheng.

86
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,829
He's the son of my friend from Malaysia.

87
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,000
He happens to attend your
university's medical department.

88
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,480
I'll leave him to your care.

89
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,730
Look after him well.

90
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,720
OK.

91
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,450
Oh, right. What's your major?
Are you a postgraduate student?

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,440
Chinese Medicine. I'm a freshman.
It's my first day of school.

93
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,120
Is freshman orientation this late?

94
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,720
Actually, I'm 21 years old.

95
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,720
I studied engineering back in Malaysia

96
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,920
and I just graduated last month.

97
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,640
That's why, I could only start midterm.

98
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,120
Since I don't have any
basic medical knowledge,

99
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,079
so I couldn't enrol in
postgraduate studies directly.

100
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,800
You're going to start from
freshman year again?

101
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,360
You like Chinese medicine so much?

102
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,880
Yes, I'm really like it,

103
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,990
because whenever my
family members get sick,

104
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,280
we'd go to this Chinese
medicine practitioner.

105
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
I really admire him.

106
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,920
I want to be a Chinese
medicine practitioner as well.

107
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,280
So, I'll entrust him to you.

108
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,159
From now on, whether it's
studies or in general,

109
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,640
you can look for Mr. Ai if
you come across any problem.

110
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,120
-OK.
-Sure.

111
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,640
Give him your phone number.

112
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,640
Sure.

113
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,720
Are you all right?

114
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,460
You keep on laughing. All you do is laugh.

115
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,520
I shouldn't have come here with you.

116
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,350
Sister, you told me to come here,

117
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,320
saying to de-stress with you.

118
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,520
Do you think I'm able
to de-stress this way?

119
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,560
Look at the state I'm in.

120
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,760
It is for me, to see you in this state.

121
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,880
You'll de-stress?

122
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,000
Deng Hao Ran,

123
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,640
I want to eat ice-cream.

124
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,000
Approved.

125
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,560
You have to let me kick you once as well.

126
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,640
Sure.

127
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Come on.

128
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,680
Defeated now, aren't you?

129
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,440
Defeated now, aren't you?

130
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,800
Hi, two ice-cream, please.

131
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,080
Here are your ice-cream.

132
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,240
Thank you.

133
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,280
You're welcome.

134
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,960
You can have this.

135
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,280
Wait.

136
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,800
Kowtow first.

137
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,320
As if. Give me that.

138
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,600
Wait.

139
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,720
What is it this time?

140
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,580
The weather's fine. Let's take a photo.

141
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,520
Sister,

142
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,800
we're indoors.

143
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm telling you we should take pictures.

144
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,230
The weather's good when
we're in a good mood.

145
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,320
And the photos will look nice
when the weather's nice. Come on.

146
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,480
One...

147
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,960
Smile.

148
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,080
One, two, three.

149
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,480
Ice-cream. Ice-cream.

150
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,400
One, two, three.

151
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,640
You look so handsome.

152
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,720
All right, let's eat.

153
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,840
You can have this as well.

154
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,560
You're quite photogenic. Look.

155
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,080
Why are you so childish still?

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,720
You asked me to come here today just
to take these photos, didn't you?

157
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,280
You think after Zhang Teng saw it,

158
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,640
he'll get jealous, regretful, sad,

159
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,240
and even come back to you?

160
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,600
I'm not so childish.

161
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,159
I just thought

162
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,200
at least he'll feel bad when he sees it.

163
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,880
No, you're that childish.

164
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,320
Come on, look at this.

165
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,200
Your ex-girlfriend?

166
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,980
[Exercise to lose weight, but... Weather
is hot. I'll turn on AC. As for diet...]

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,840
Why does everyone else think the same way?

168
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,680
Two months ago,

169
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,440
he even brought me on a trip to Japan,

170
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,160
and took the trouble to book
the best hotel in Japan,

171
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,120
so that when I open the windows,

172
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,710
I'll see the most beautiful
coastline in Japan.

173
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,400
These memories are still fresh in my mind.

174
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,560
How did it disappear so quickly to him?

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,159
Tell me, is it because I didn't
give him space some time ago,

176
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,440
and after a while,

177
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,400
he'll come back to my side
when he feels better?

178
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Ma Yi Yi,

179
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,080
men are really simple creatures.

180
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,840

he'll never avoid you

00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,680
I recently discovered shared
bikes are really convenient,

357
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,880
but not parking at designated
locations is a problem.

358
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,240
I signed up to a charity
club in the university

359
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,560
which promotes parking shared
bikes at designated spots.

360
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,890
Can you help me to promote it
to students in lectures?

361
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,960
Sure, no problem.

362
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,400
[I'm hanging up if there's nothing else.]

363
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,720
Bye, Mr. Ai.

364
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,720
Where are we?

365
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,840
Dongshan Ancient Town.

366
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,280
That means we should be there soon.

367
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,720
He's so happy to be on this trip.

368
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,200
Where's Ma Yi Yi?

369
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,120
Hello, Zeng Li.

370
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,800
Hello. Where are you now?

371
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,880
I'm stuck in the line at the toll station.

372
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,200
It'll probably take another
hour before I arrive.

373
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,960
There seems to be an accident in front.

374
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,600
I'll take a walk near

375
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,000
the ancient town while waiting.

376
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,000
You'd better don't.

377
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,040
They sell products which can be found
on Taobao at few times the price.

378
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,570
Don't underestimate me.

379
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,360
Am I that type of people to
fall into tourist traps?

380
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,680
All right, let's not talk anymore.

381
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,760
I'll wait for you here.

382
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,200
See you.

383
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,560
Where are you going?

384
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,830
I'm going to pick up a friend.

385
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,640
So cute.

386
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Young lady,

387
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,400
you look so pretty in this hat.

388
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,240
Promotion price at RMB180.
Why don't you buy one?

389
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,240
RMB180?

390
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,440
That's so expensive.

391
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,430
What about this? RMB150,

392
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,160
buy 1 get 1 free. How's that?

393
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,320
I'm just browsing, sorry.

394
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,370
Young lady,

395
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,640
you've been browsing in
my shop since just now,

396
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,280
and you're not buying anything.

397
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,160
Aren't you being such a bully?

398
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,680
I...

399
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:41,960
All right.

400
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,120
You finally picked up
your phone. Where are you?

401
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,040
Something happened. My father fainted.

402
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,200
What's wrong with uncle?

403
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,160
No idea. My mother called me just now,

404
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,560
saying he's hospitalized.

405
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,840
I'm just worried if it's a relapse
of his cerebral thrombosis.

406
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,710
In that case, you shouldn't come over.

407
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,230
You have to visit uncle
at the hospital quickly.

408
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,200
What about you?

409
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,200
There're many buses here which
I can take to go to the hotel.

410
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,640
Don't mind me. Go to the hospital quickly.

411
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,480
Then, let me know right away
when you reach the hotel.

412
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,760
I will. Don't worry.

413
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,460
[Ginger tea with molasses]

414
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,839
[It's late. I wonder if there're
buses headed to the mountaintop.]

415
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,880
Miss,

416
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,560
where are you heading?

417
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,920
I'm heading to the mountaintop.
Is there any buses still running?

418
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,720
The hotel's shuttle bus
left a long while ago.

419
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,960
Is there any other way to
travel up the mountain?

420
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,040
There's none.

421
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,880
Look, it's going to snow soon.

422
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,720
The ground will be slippery and dangerous.

423
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,220
[No taxi available nearby]

424
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,820
[Zeng Li]

425
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,320
[Are you at the hotel?]

426
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,520
[I'm trapped on the way to the
mountaintop. There's no more buses.]

427
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,620
[Sunset]
[Waiting for confirmation]

428
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,220
[Cancelled]

429
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,040
Miss, there's a vehicle!

430
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,400
Really? Is it a bus?

431
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,780
[Dongshan Ancient Town Interchange,
bus schedule]

432
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,800
It's not a bus.

433
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,120
Someone drove a car down
from the mountain just now.

434
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,440
He has to head back later.

435
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,520
I told him to give you a ride.

436
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,920
Great. Thank you.

437
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,320
It's a black-color vehicle,

438
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,200
and the last two digits of
the number plate is 78.

439
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,320
78. OK, I understand. Thank you.

440
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,800
-OK. Take care.
-I will.

441
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,360
Last two digits is 78.

442
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,640
78.

443
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,080
Wait!

444
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,800
Wait up! Wait!

445
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,880
No way, how could I miss that?

446
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,920
What luck.

447
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,460
[Ai Jing Chu?]

448
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,460
You're the one who's
headed to the mountaintop?

449
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,260
I was waiting for my friend to
go to Dongshan Hot Spring Hotel.

450
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,140
But she couldn't come
because something happened.

451
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,700
I didn't manage to catch
the last bus either.

452
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,380
I almost missed you just now.

453
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,860
Luckily I turned around to check.

454
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,180
Let's go.

455
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,220
[Lucky!]

456
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,140
[So awkward.
Should I start a conversation?]

457
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,340
[But what should I say?]

458
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,940
Mr. Ai, you're also on
a staff bonding event?

459
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,620
No,

460
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,700
I came with my family.

461
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,860
OK, your family.

462
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,300
You didn't buckle your seatbelt.

463
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,700
[Seatbelt.]

464
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,140
I'm sorry.

465
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,340
What's this?

466
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,660
[Why is there a woman's hairpin?]

467
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,420
[The style. Is it his girlfriend's?]

468
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,780
Mr. Ai, this is yours.

469
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,580
Give it to me will do.

470
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,220
[What a calm reaction.]
Does it belong to your girlfriend?

471
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,220
I don't have a girlfriend.

472
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,300
[But he flirts with so many females.]

473
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,970
[True. He can't admit to it.]

474
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,420
Do you want to listen to radio?

475
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,540
There's a knob on the panel.

476
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,380
You can adjust once you press it.

477
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,380
[The mountain road is covered with snow.]

478
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,340
[Everywhere I see is a vast
expanse of whiteness.]

479
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,020
[The cold wind roared, such that]

480
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,260
[I could barely keep my eyes open.]

481
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,740
[At a distance,]

482
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,020
[within the mountain, I saw a]

483
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,220
[something black moving.]

484
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,980
[It seems to be a human.]

485
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,500
[I thought,]

486
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,980
[could it be he's the same as me?]

487
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,540
This story seems...

488
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,820
Seems to be a horror story.

489
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,540
[That silhouette suddenly spoke.]

[Isn't that my name?]

497
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,220
[Suddenly, that shadow
figure ran towards me.]

498

[This woman with disheveled hair...]

503
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,260

mistake that for something else?]

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,820
[-Believe in science.]

[that woman...]

518

That's my phone.

519

[-Hello, Dr. Ai.]
-Hi.

520
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,660

would like to consult you first,]

[because it's inconvenient
for us to come to Donghu.]

529

530

-Go ahead.
[-Liu Bao Chang.]

535
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,460
I've seen his X-ray,

536
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,900
but it's a little blurry
so I can't be sure yet.

537
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,260
[Did he go outside because
he didn't want to disturb me,]

538
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,980
[or is it to keep patient's
information confidential?]

539
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,780
[He returned
his patient's call so quickly.]

540
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,460
[Seems like he's indeed a good doctor.]

541
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,580
It's fine. Carry on.

542
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,020
[He's been standing in
the snow for so long.]

543
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,020
[Isn't he cold?]

544
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,380
[Why is he walking towards me?]

545
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,020
[He should get inside
the car from his side.]

546
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,260
That's right,

547
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,540
under normal circumstances,

548
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,940
if he has a cleft lip and palate,

549
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,900
within the two months since
his birth, we have to

550
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,500
perform pre-surgery procedures.

551
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,620
It usually consists of impression taking

552
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,140
for shaping of pressure groove

553
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,860
and wearing aligners after that.

554
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,740
After three months,

555
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,540
we'll perform the orthognathic surgery

556
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,020
and palatoplasty after six months.

557
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,420
Close the window quickly. It's cold.

558
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,500
Since the child is still
in his growing stage,

559
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,220
malformation might occur even
if the surgery is a success.

560
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,300
That's right.

561
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,020
If continuous variation
occur in other aspects,

562
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,860
he might need another surgery.

563
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,980
Yes.

564
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,220
[The child is so pitiful.]

565
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,700
[He has to go through so much
suffering when he's born.]

566
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,620
Carry on.

567
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,580
Go back.

568
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,140
I understand.

569
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,000
[How's Uncle?]

570
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,400
[Zeng Li]

571
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,500
[How's Uncle?]

572
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,400
[Ma Yi Yi]

573
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,300
[He's in the hospital next to our house.]

574
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,820
[We're waiting for diagnostic results.]

575
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,700
[It must be tough for you
to look after him alone.]

576
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,780
[Ask Deng Hao Ran to come and help you.]

577
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,940
[I just gave him a call.]

578
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,300
[He should be on the way here.]

579
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,100
[That's good.]

580
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,260
Sorry to keep you waiting.

581
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,860
Is that child all right?

582
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,140
The child's not born yet,

583
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,420
but from the X-ray,

584
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,140
seems like he has congenital
cleft lip and palate.

585
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,300
So, will it be cured after he's born?

586
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,540
That depends how you define being cured.

587
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,580
For those of you who come
to straighten your teeth,

588
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,420
some people might have come with
80 to 90 percent expectation.

589
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,460
The final result which is delivered

590
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,820
might be 100 percent.

591
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,740
But vice versa,

592
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,460
they'll think it's imperfect.

593
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,250
Let's go.

594
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,220
-Hello.
[-Hello, Mr. Ai.]

595
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,260
[Am I disturbing you?]

596
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,780
It's fine. What is it?

597
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,620
[Can I ask you a question?]

598
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,990
Go ahead.

599
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,580
[I was shifting the shared bikes
parked anyhow at the school entrance]

600
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,260
[and injured my leg. It left a gash.]

601
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,340
[So, it's been bleeding for half an hour
now, and there's no sign of stopping.]

602
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,420
[The infirmary's now closed as well.]

603
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,380
[Could this be serious?]

604
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,740
Is the bleeding serious?

605
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,940
This...

606
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,140
How can you tell?

607
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:23,340
Check if you can see yellow
adipose tissue beneath the skin.

608
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,820
I can't, Mr. Ai.

609
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,660
There's too much blood. I'm scared.

610
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,740
I don't dare to look at it.

611
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,340
Go quickly to Donghu University
Hospital's emergency department.

612
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,140
The wound needs to be cleaned.

613
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,860
It probably needs to be stitched as well.

614
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,460
-It needs to be stitched?
[-Go quickly.]

615
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,340
If the wound gets infected and ulcerated,

616
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,700
you'll need amputation
instead of stitches.

617
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,700
OK. I understand, Mr. Ai.

618
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:48,820
Thank you, Mr. Ai. See you.

619
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,540
What are you staring at?

620
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,740
What?

621
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,340
Keep on staring at me.

622
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,500
What is it?

623
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,060
I'm going to chop off your head
if you keep on saying that.

624
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,540
This is the hospital. Go outside
if you're going to argue.

625
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,380
Whose head are you going
to chop off? Is it me?

626
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,140
Here, I'll place my head here. Let's
see if you dare to chop it off.

627
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,540
He stared at me first.

628
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,880
What? What is it?

629
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,780
Am I counting sheep to fall asleep?
To hear you baaing at me since just now.

630
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,980
Fighting at the supper stall wasn't
enough. You're going to continue here?

631
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,420
All of you don't have to seek treatment.

632
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,050
Either way, all of you'll
be killed by tetanus.

633
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,820
No, Sister. Of course
we'll seek treatment.

634
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,830
We have to.

635
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,540
-In that case, sit down.
-OK, OK.

636
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,860
Qi Qi was so brave today.

637
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,220
As a reward, here's a lollipop for you.

638
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,500
Look, isn't it cute?

639
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,300
See? An injection doesn't hurt, right?

640
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,660
-Yes.
-Say "thank you, Doctor", quick.

641
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,780
-Thank you, Doctor.
-You're welcome.

642
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,140
We'll get going, doctor.

643
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,980
-Say goodbye to Sister.
-Goodbye.

644
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,140
-Let's go.
-Take care.

645
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,020
OK.

646
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,300
Next.

647
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,660
Sister, it's you.

648
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,700
Do you remember me?

649
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,820
You showed me directions
at the train station.

650
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,140
You even led me to the university.

651
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,500
Donghu University. Do you remember?

652
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,020
What happened to you?

653
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,020
I got a gash on my leg from a shared bike.

654
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,940
Lie on the bed.

655
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,500
Slowly.

656
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,900
Lift up your legs.

657
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,580
Sister,

658
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,100
you looked so cool just now.

659
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,700
You must be what they call
a fierce maiden, right?

660
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,700
Looks like you didn't learn your Chinese
properly before coming to China.

661
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,300
-You remember me?
-I'm going to check your wound first.

662
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,820
You can't use band-aids over it.

663
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,900
It'll get infected.

664
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,260
Bear with it.

665
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,820
The wound is big in size,
though it isn't deep.

666
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,980
It's fine. It'll be OK with
some cleaning and bandage.

667
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,060
But,

668
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,060
a professor from medical department said,

669
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,220
I'll need stitches.

670
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,620
It might even get amputated.

671
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,580
Who told you so?

672
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,900
It's a dentist.

673
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,980
If you're gong to listen to him,

674
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,460
go look for him to get your leg amputated.

675
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,700
I'll listen to you.

676
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,380
It'll begin now.

677
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,460
Bear with me.

678
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,140
Carrot and strawberry,
which one do you prefer?

679
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,940
Carrot and strawberry,
which one do you prefer?

680
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,900
From what I know,

681
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,460
these two are from different categories.

682
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,500
Choose one.

683
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,510
Carrots.

684
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,380
Hold this.

685
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,220
Squeeze it if you feel pain later.

686
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,820
This is so cute.

687
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,380
It'll start now.

688
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,540
Sister,

689
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,540
give me the strawberry as well.

690
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,290
Is it that bad?

691
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,980
Even elementary school kids
are braver than you.

692
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,980
I'm just curious what it's like.

693
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,060
This strawberry looks nicer.

694
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,179
Sister,

695
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,260
you look beautiful when you smile.

696
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,380
Stay still.

697
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,180
The car couldn't go any further.

698
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,900
What should we do?

699
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,620
It can't be helped. I guess we could
only walk for the rest of the journey.

700
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,580
It's not too bad. We shouldn't
be far away from the hotel.

701
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,340
[Turn left to Dongshan Hot Spring Hotel]

702
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,100
I think we just have to walk a little.

703
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,220
Let's go.

704
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,780
Do you want to button up your coat first?

705
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,820
Let's go.

706
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,300
Don't you have this

707
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,700
bunnies' ears hat?

708
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,820
Why don't you wear it?

709
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,180
This?

710
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,020
Wear it. It's better
than being in the cold.

711
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,300
It looks cute on you.

712
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,660
Let's go.

713
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,340
[Liu Bao Chang.]

714
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,820
[Liu Bao Chang.]

715
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,300
Mr. Ai, I'll walk in the front.

716
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,620
OK.

717
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,380
What's wrong?

718
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
It's nothing.

719
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,020
Keep the wound dry for three days.
Come on Thursday to change dressing.

720
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,820
Keep the wound dry for three days?

721
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,940
Does it mean I can't shower?

722
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,420
You can, if you can guarantee
to keep the wound dry.

723
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,580
How do you guarantee that?

724
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,860
Lift it up when I shower?

725
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,180
Otherwise, just don't do it.

726
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,740
Does it mean I can't exercise either?

727
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,180
You still want to exercise
with wound of this size?

728
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,100
What if there's an infection?

729
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,300
But I exercise everyday.

730
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,100
What happens if there's an infection?

731
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,060
If there's an infection,

732
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,500
you'll get amputated.

733
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,180
Sister, you're scaring me again.

734
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,740
Don't shower or exercise.

735
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,420
Symptoms of inflammation are
redness, swelling, heat, and pain.

736
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,460
Come to the hospital quickly
if you have these symptoms.

737
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,020
So, out of these four
symptoms, if I only have one,

738
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:45,960
should I come?

739
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,900
Yes.

740
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,860
You're quite afraid of dying.

741
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,060
I cherish my life.

742
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,160
Any other questions?

743
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,420
If not, I'm going off work.

744
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,460
Yes. It has nothing to do with my legs,

745
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,540
but it's been bothering
me for awhile. Can I ask?

746
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,220
Go ahead.

747
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,620
That is, recently, when I sleep,

748
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,220
if I lie on my back,

749
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,340
my chest would feel stuffy.

750
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,520
But if I turn over, it's fine.

751
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,780
In that case, just turn over.

752
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,700
Also, I bought new glasses.

753
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,340
I'm wearing contacts now,

754
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,780
but if I change to the new glasses,

755
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,060
I'd feel very dizzy.

756
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,340
In that case, don't wear it.

757
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,180
Another thing.

758
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,030
That is, last time, after you hit my head,

759
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,280
I felt the left side of my head

760
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,820
swelled this much compared to
the right side of my head.

761
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,660
It became this much bigger.

762
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,100
It swelled. It became this much bigger.

763
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,340
Come here. Move your head over.

764
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,660
What about I hit the right side
of your head so it becomes equal?

765
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,060
It's fine, thank you.

766
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,540
Anymore questions? No, right?

767
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:48,020
Sister, so, next Thursday when
I come here to change dressing,

768
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,140
will you be here?

769
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,180
I don't know.

770
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,380
See you.

771
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,100
Hang in there.

772
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,580
We're just few hundred metres
away from our destination.

773
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,500
Look.

774
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,300
It's so beautiful.

775
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,820
[I suddenly feel like trying]

776
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,980
[how it tastes.]

777
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,660
Wait.

778
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,500
Are you all right?

779
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,700
Blood.

780
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,140
The wire breaks easily from
sudden change in temperature.

781
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,460
Here, let me have a look.

782
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,340
What do I do now?

783
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,380
Give me a minute.

784
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,660
This way,

785
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,820
the wire won't scrap the
inside of your mouth.

786
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,540
All done.

787
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,860
[Why are his hands burning hot?]

788
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,900
Mr. Ai, did you realize your
hands are unusually warm?

789
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,300
Let's go.

790
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,460
Wait.

791
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,900
Mr. Ai, you have a fever.

792
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,500
So, you went to the town
just now, it's to buy medicine?

793
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,780
But I'm fine now.

794
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,860
Let's go.

795
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,140
Wait.

796
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,460
In fact, I have one more here.
Why don't you wear it too?

797
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,940
It's fine, I don't need it.

798
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,060
Wear it.

799
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,860
Insert this in.

800
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,180
Done.

801
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,780
It's better than nothing.

802
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,900
It looks cute on you.

803
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,580
Let's go.

804
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,620
[Many years later,]

805
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,940
[I could still remember this scene.]

806
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,300
[I thought I had to spend a
long, dark night on my own.]

807
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,620
[But because of him,]

808
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,700
[the piercing cold winds were
erased from my memories.]

809
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,420
[What's left was the moonlight
reflected on the ground,]

810
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,060
[and the silhouettes of two persons]

811
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,570
[wearing bunnies' ears in the snow.]

812
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,820
[Friend marked as favorite, Zhang Teng]
[Delete]

813
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,260
[How many people can remain
with each other forever?]

814
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,740
[Delete friend?]
[Yes.]

815
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,070
[In a sea of people,]

816
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,980
[what's the probability
for two persons to meet?]

817
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,460
Thursday.

818
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,140
It really is me.

819
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,340
[If we could walk to the end together,]

820
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,420
[it'd be such a happy feeling.]
