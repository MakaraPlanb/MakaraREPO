because it's not that I don't want
to give you the number,

187
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,780
it's because my name is on the number

188
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,780
and my ID...

189
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,240
You can come with us to meet Dr. Ai.

190
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,180
By then,

191
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,720
you can just give me the number
in front of him, right?

192
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,290
Why are you shouting?

193
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,960
How can you be so rough
when you're asking for her help?

194
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040

195

196

197
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,600
I...

198
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,200
I heard from your mother that
you'll be checking your teeth today.

199
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,120
I happened to be free,

200
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,600
so I came to keep you accompany.

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,220
Why not we go in together?

202
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,280
Dr. Ai is kind.

203
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,280
Maybe he's free to check on
another patient.

204
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,940
-That'd be great.
-Come on.

205

Dr. Ai treats you really well.

206
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,480
You asked him to add another number
and he just did.

207
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,920
He's doing it for the child's sake.

208
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,120
It has nothing to do with me.

209
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,800
We watched a movie together.

210
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,320
I can tell that he's into you.

211

Women understand women well.

212
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,890
But, it works for the same.

213

Men understand men well.

214
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,160
I'm always right.

and he's honest.

I don't want you to be cheated.

224

We're just acquaintances.

Dr. Ai asked me to look for Dr. Tang
in the Otorhinolaryngology Department.

232

Can you find him?

233

Yes, he has contacted them for me.

What's the relationship
between Dr. Ai and Zeng Li?

-Is it obvious?
-It's obvious.

To be honest,

Looking at my previous temper,

300
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,360
I might've rejected him
on the first day.

301
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,280
What about this time?

302
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,320
It's a little different this time.

303
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,720
He's my stepfather's superior's son.

304
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,200
My stepfather wishes to become
the commissioner before he retires,

305
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,360
so my mother asked me

306
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,520
to go out with him for some time.

307
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,400
That's why I didn't really reject him.

00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,600
Did I put you in a difficult situation?

Don't use cold water.

Use warm water to brush your teeth.

336
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,680
It can help reduce

your toothbrush has to be dry
before brushing your teeth.

The effect will reduce once it's wet.

342
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,240
Brushing teeth is to clean the teeth
using friction after all.

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,040
The bristles on the toothbrush

349
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,640
should be 45 degree corresponding
to your teeth.

00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Brush two to three teeth at one go.

Brush softly up and down.

352
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,440
Don't brush horizontally.

00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,320
-talking like that?
-What?

552
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,640
Zeng Li, roll up the window.

553
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,680
Listen.

554
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,710
I won't move my car.

555
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,680
Don't be bothered by him.

556
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,800
Just drive pass his car.

557
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
You can do it.

558
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,480
But, the road is too narrow.

559
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,560
-My driving is terrible.
-Don't worry.

560
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,280
-You can do it.
-Roll down the window. Can you hear me?

561
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,320
-Get down.
-Don't be nervous. I'm here.

562
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,520
Ready? Three, two, one, go.

563
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,480
She's great. My car is fine.

564
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,520
Mr. Ai, how did I do?

565
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,040
You can go to Mount Haruna now.

566
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,680
But, your car was scratched.

567
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,640
No worries.

568
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,000
It could've been recorded by the CCTV.

569
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,160
-You might be fined.
-No worries.

570
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,080
You might lose your driving license.

571
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,720
No worries.

572
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,800
Mr. Ai, when you're drunk,

573
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,080
how come you're different?

574
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,120
Were you happy driving like that?

575
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,280
Yes.

576
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,240
Why not we go back and do it again?

577
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,680
You can perform well this time.

578
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,120
It looks like he's drunk.

579
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,480
Three of them are attacking me.

580
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,370
Quickly save me!

581
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,440
Coming!

582
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,080
I'm dead.

583
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,480
I'm sorry.
I didn't manage to protect you.

584
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,000
Don't be angry.

585
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,640
I'll help you to win the next game.

586
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,760
Won't you change
the broken screen protector?

587
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,280
Didn't you realise you're hurt?

588
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,640
We'll play again

589
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,920
when your finger is recovered.

590
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,440
Does what we spoke just now

591
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,880
still count?

592
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,360
Go ahead.

593
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,520
Let's spend New Year's Eve

594
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,880
together two days later.

595
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,200
In the Valley?

596
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,160
Can your finger recover in two days?

597
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,130
You're great.

598
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,360
Are you addicted to games?

599
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,160
Zeng Li and Ma Yi Yi

600
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,360
said I should get the electrotherapy.

601
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,640
We won't be playing games
on New Year's Eve.

602
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,040
We'll go to a place.

603
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,160
Where is it?

604
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,400
You'll know by coming with me.

605
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,680
The taxi will be here in five minutes.

606
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,180
[Xiao Xi Jia]

607
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,400
[Dr. Ai, why won't you reply?]

608
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,040
Why not you reply her?

609
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,080
She's waiting.

610
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,080
No.

611
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,560
Why?

612
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,080
Because I think you're a little unhappy.

613
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,360
I'm not.

614
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,300
[Delete]

615
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,480
You're deleting her? No.

616
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,400
I won't talk to her even if I keep it.

617
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,040
No. What should I tell Sister Chen
if you deleted her?

618
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,840
Tell Sister Chen that

619
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,560
she can come to the hospital

620
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,800
if she wants to get the braces.

621
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,280
Don't do that.

622
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,940
[Confirmed deleting the contact?]
[Confirmed]

623
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,480
No.

624
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,880
Don't delete her. Don't do that.

625
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,120
It's been deleted.

626
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,240
Why did you show me after deleting it?

627
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,960
Mr. Ai, you're drunk.

628
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,720
No, I'm sober now.

629
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,920
Mr. Ai, you should go back now.

630
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,970
I'm leaving.

631
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,680
Zeng Li.

632
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,120
I think I made a mistake.

633
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,440
What mistake?

634
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,680
I always think

635
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,080
all the teeth should be at
where they are supposed to be

636
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,560
to be considered healthy.

637
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,080
I didn't know that flaws

638
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,480
can actually make a person unique.

639
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,960
Are you getting in the car, miss?

640
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,560
Got it. Just a minute, sir.

641
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,480
I'm leaving.

642
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,960
Come back to the hospital
every six to eight weeks.

643
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,640
Don't forget that.

644
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,600
Bye bye.

645
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,440
[At this moment, I regret]

646
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,960
[changing to clear aligners.]

647
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,360
[At this moment, I regret]

648
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,320
[changing her braces to clear aligners.]

649
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,520
[The distance between the island
and the city]

650
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,200
[is neither too far nor too near.]

651
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,800
[Six to eight weeks.]

652
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,640
[I started to miss
the previous 28 days.]

653
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,120
[The ancient people believed there
were Twenty-Eight Mansions]

654
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,719
[Man's metabolic pathway takes 28 days.]

655
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:18,520
[Sometimes, the advertisement slogan for
the skincare is]

656
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,600
[a total change after 28 days.]

657
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,679
[And 28 days]

658
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,480
[were once the period of us
meeting each other,]

659
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,320
[but now,]

660
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:31,560
[we're back to
our own small world again.]

661
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:34,159
[I need to wait for six to eight weeks]

662
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,719
[to meet him again.]

663
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,520
Choosing the right night cream and mask

664
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,239
is important to you.

665
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,980
[Li Li]

666
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,440
[Are you sleeping?]

667
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,040
[Come on. Be mature.]

668
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,280
[Just reply when you
see the WeChat message.]

I haven't. Let's take dinner after work.]

[Only after we got drunk,]

[and being alone,]

677

[we'd put our guards down]

[before the one we love]
