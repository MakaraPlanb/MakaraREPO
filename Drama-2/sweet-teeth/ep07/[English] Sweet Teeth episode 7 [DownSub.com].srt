[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,000
Do you know Mr. Ai got his WeChat?

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,390
I knew about it yesterday,

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,540
but Mr. Ai didn't inform me.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,410
Really?

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,980
Mr. Ai, I just added you on WeChat.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,690
Approve me.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,770
Why it has to be you first?

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,800
Know your place.

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,820
Mr. Ai, approve me first.

11
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,070
Mr. Ai, I want it, too.

12
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,870
One by one.

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,640
This one, Xiao Fan.

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,630
What about me?

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,640
Let me search for you.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,870
Mr. Ai,

17
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,430
you went to

18
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,960
50 parties last night.

19
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:38,720
Let me have a look.

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,600
They are my patients.

21
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,280
Oh my god.

22
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,200
So many of them.

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,080
Let me search.

24
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,560
Mr. Ai,

25
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,710
why not you create a group
for the patients?

26
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,680
Add me in there.

27
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,430
I mean,

28
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,600
your profile picture is
a little too coquettish.

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,880
It was a random picture.

30
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,430
The problem is,

31
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,920
Who took it for Mr. Ai?

32
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,750
Isn't this Hualong Alley?

33
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,040
The supper street.

34
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,600
Does Mr. Ai

35
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,000
even eat supper?

36
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,500
Mr. Ai didn't have WeChat.

37
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,100
It means

38
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,740
someone made Mr. Ai

39
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,930
register his WeChat,

40
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,860
took his profile picture

41
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,890
and took him for supper.

42
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,420
Who could it be?

43
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,340
Have you compiled yesterday's information?

44
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:26,970
Right away.

45
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,010
You took three days to
make two dental impressions.

46
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,009
Can you give it to me by today?

47
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,979
We'll open the clinic in ten minutes.

48
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:38,450
Are you that free?

49
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,340
[Sweet Teeth]
[Episode 7]

50
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,010
Okay.

51
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,250
Thank you.

52
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,890
Please help me

53
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,570
to monitor this place.

54
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,450
Okay.

55
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,370
Chen Chen!

56
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,810
Are you waiting for your mother?

57
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,180
Is your mother having a meeting?

58
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,130
What's troubling you?

59
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,060
Oh, yes. Let me take a look.

60
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:44,890
There's a wound in your mouth.

61
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,940
Has it recovered?

62
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,410
My tooth is gone.

63
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:49,860
Here.

64
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,300
Open your mouth and show me.

65
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,500
Just a bottom tooth. It's okay.

66
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,290
It doesn't

67
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,650
affect your pretty face, Chen Chen.

68
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,780
Lisa doesn't even talk to me anymore.

69
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,100
Lisa? Who is Lisa?

70
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,180
She sits next to me in school.

71
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,060
My teacher gave each of us

72
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,300
an English name.

73
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,570
She's Lisa and I'm Mike.

74
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,850
She used to talk to me only.

75
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,130
Now, if she needs an eraser,

76
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,180
she'd talk to Jack behind us.

77
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,910
She said I spit when I talk.

78
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,610
Tell Lisa that

79
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,329
your tooth

80
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,530
can be planted.

81
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,220
Just like planting a tree?

82
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,490
Aunt Zeng Li,

83
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,300
your lies are worse than my mom's.

84
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,530
Aunt Zeng Li is right.

85
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,770
Mr. Ai.

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,280
Dr. Ai.

87
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,530
When you're 18,

88
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,370
I'll plant your tooth back.

89
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,090
I need to wait for another ten years then.

90
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,650
Chen Chen,

91
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,140
your look is not important.

92
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:52,730
Listen.

93
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,650
Girls like

94
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,940
smart boys.

95
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,650
So, do well in your exams.

96
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,540
Next time,

97
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,600
Lisa will surely only

98
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,640
talk to you.

99
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,220
If look is not important,

100
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,250
you won't be the only one in the library

101
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,500
who can't get married.

102
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,410
Who told you I can' get married?

103
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,090
My mother.

104
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,450
Sister Chen.

105
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,420
Are you

106
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,970
really that into Lisa?

107
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,400
Lisa is a top student.

108
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,990
Many students like her.

109
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,910
There are stars in their eyes

110
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,590
when they see her.

111
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,030
Aunt Zeng Li is
the prettiest librarian here.

112
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,350
Even when she's wearing braces,

113
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,990
many are into her.

114
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,820
It's not that she can't get married.

115
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,270
She's just waiting for

116
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,420
someone she likes.

117
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,540
That's right.

118
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,110
Moreover, I'm selective.

119
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,620
Dr. Ai,

120
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,150
when you look at Aunt Zeng Li,

121
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,990
there are stars in your eyes, too.

122
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,710
Dr. Ai,

123
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,790
you're here again.

124
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,390
I'm here to borrow two books.

125
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,740
Why are you standing here?

126
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,550
Help out.

127
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,180
Help out.

128
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,510
Do your homework.

129
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,710
[I heard that the most
adorable height difference]

130
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,860
[is 20 cm.]

131
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,659
[The girl happens to be as tall as]

132
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,260
[the boy's jaw.]

133
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,380
[Looking at that,]

134
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,990
[Mr. Ai is 1.87 m.]

135
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,030
[No, why am I thinking about this?]

136
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,960
Do you need help to
look for something else?

137
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,420
No, I can do it on my own.

138
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,300
Oh, yes.

139
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,260
After looking at the scanning
of your mouth,

140
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,300
I've designed a clear aligners' plan

141
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,620
for you.

142
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,710
A weekly set.

143
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,710
A total of 50 sets.

144
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,420
A year of orthodontic treatment.

145
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,540
That means

146
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,300
I'll soon say goodbye

147
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,350
to the metal braces.

148
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,750
I've asked Zhou Wen to contact
the manufacturer

149
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,960
to get the braces done for you.

150
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,110
It takes half a month

151
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,790
before you can wear

152
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,160
your first clear aligners.

153
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
That's great!

154
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,760
I can finally eat something nice

155
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,110
with Chen Chen!

156
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,720
[Zeng Li!]

157
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,840
Zeng Li!

158
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,640
Zeng Li!

159
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,640
Sheng Ming is not replying me again.

160
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,750
What should I do?

161
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,030
Wu Ying, don't talk.

162
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,520
I don't want to hear your opinion.

163
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,570
I mean,

164
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,920
delete him.

165
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,990
Wu Ying, don't you understand Chinese?

166
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,310
What?

167
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,720
Is it that funny?

168
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
My two best friends

169
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,890
are silly.

170
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:08,890
[Ma Yi Yi is serious

171
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,970
[about her relationship.]

172
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,570
[She won't just wait for her chance.]

I'm sorry.

207
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,570
It's you.

208
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,490
What a coincidence.

209
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,890
[He's finally here.]

210
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,210
I even meet you here.

211
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,970
I'm working in this building.

University Street?

It's far away from here.

216
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:29,890
Is it useful to

217
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,920
distribute the brochure here?

218
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,360
We're mainly focusing on coffee delivery.

219
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,039
We just opened it and we're thinking

220
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,570
of gaining the market share.

221
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,250
Give me a few more.

222
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,280
I'll share them with my colleagues.

223
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,840
Thank you.

224
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:44,970
Oh, yes.

225
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,290
Take this card with you.

[CAROL'S RMB 200 Member Reload Card]

227
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,640
Bring in more sales for us.

228
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,930
I can't take this.

229
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,520
You'll lose some money. I can't do that.

230
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,050
I'm trying to canvas more sales
for long term.

231
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,280
Introduce more colleagues

232
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,160
to buy coffee from us

233
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,210
and earn me back

234
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,090
the RMB 200.

235
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,570
I really can't take this.

236
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,120
Just take it.

237
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,370
Since you said so,

238
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,760
I'll just have to go.

239
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,210
Then I've achieved my goal.

240
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,570
I'm going home now.

241
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,120
Get off work early.

242
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,000
See you.

243
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,360
The car was good. Buy it.

244
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,400
No.

245
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,290
-Buy it.
-Stop thinking about it.

246
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,720
I have money. I'll buy it for you.

247
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:38,970
There he is.

248
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,210
Uncle Deng.

249
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,090
I'm here.

250
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,090
I miss you.

251
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,890
Sure you do.

252
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,120
It has been a while.

253
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,800
Why are you wearing the braces?

254
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,640
It looks ugly now.

255
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,130
But after this,

256
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,050
I'll be wearing a clear one.

257
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,240
It's not ugly.

258
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,360
It looks cute.

259
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,780
Dad,

260
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,050
you do know the trend.

261
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,900
Now, cute is another word

262
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,260
for ugly.

263
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,450
-Take a seat.
-Come and take a seat.

264
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,290
Take a seat.

265
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,290
Uncle Deng,

266
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,620
didn't you eat?

267
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,540
I feel like you've lost weight.

268
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,210
-Really?
-Yes.

269
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,610
It's good to lose weight.

270
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,690
I look young this way.

271
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,620
Money can't make me slim when I'm old.

272
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,380
He's having a bad stomach.

273
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,740
He keeps saying he has no appetite.

274
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,620
Did you do a checkup in the hospital?

275
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,610
He did.

276
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,090
The doctor said

277
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,850
he has a bad digestive system
and prescribed some medicine,

278
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,210
but he won't take it. Advise him.

279
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,020
Listen, medicine

280
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,410
is drug.

281
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,450
I can't take it always.

282
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,210
Moreover,

283
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,500
I'm not young anymore.

284
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,650
I can't avoid

285
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,530
certain illnesses,

286
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,810
especially my stomach.

287
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:43,930
It doesn't know its place,

288
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,380
but I'll be fine.

289
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,330
I don't need the medicine.

290
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,340
No way.

291
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,650
The doctor said you need
to take your medicine on time.

292
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,660
Okay.

293
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,490
After this meal,

294
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,740
I'll take the medicine when I go home.

295
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,740
-Please serve the hot pot.
-The shirt.

296
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,640
Uncle Deng, happy birthday.

297
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,060
Look at my daughter.

298
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,170
I bought you a jacket.

299
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,450
Thank you.

300
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,260
You buy me a present every year.

301
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,380
You're such a good daughter.

302
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,370
Come on.

303
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,530
It's not nice if it's overcooked.

304
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,420
Okay.

305
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,620
Eat more of this.

306
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,450
Father, stop taking food for her.

307
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,820
She can't finish it.

308
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,170
It'll be stuck in her teeth.

309
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,740
How's your mother lately?

310
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,410
She's okay.

311
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,740
Does that Uncle Peng

312
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,500
treat her well?

313
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,620
They'd have a fight sometimes.

314
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,370
You know

315
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,500
my mom's temper.

316
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:50,850
Here.

317
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:51,730
Actually,

318
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,980
it's good for the married couples

319
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,290
to have a fight.

320
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,100
It's said,

321
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,860
being lovey-dovey won't
keep a relationship,

322
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,260
some arguments will.

323
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,140
For married couples at my age,

324
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,490
if they just stare at each other

325
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,530
and have nothing to say,

326
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,410
they can't spend their lives together.

327
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,540
How's your mother's health?

328
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,300
Didn't she say

329
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,380
her heart was not feeling well?

330
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,170
[Zeng Li, come here.]

331
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,140
[Come in quickly.]

332
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,860
[This is your room.]

333
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,060
[Look.]

334
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,260
[I designed it for you.]

335
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,170
[See if you like it.]

336
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,570
[How's it?]

337
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,930
[The design is old-fashioned.]

338
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,940
[How's it old-fashioned?]

339
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,420
[Rascal, you know nothing.]

340
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,680
[She's a little girl.]

341
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,300
[I designed this]

342
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
[pink series.]

343
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,140
[You know nothing.]

344
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,020
[That's how your brother is.]

345
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,540
[He's nice but he runs his mouth,]

346
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,410
[just ignore him.]

347
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:35,970
[When you live here]

348
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:36,900
[long enough, you'll understand.]

349
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,260
[Come in and check it out.]

350
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,740
[I'll buy some more
if you need anything else.]

351
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,090
[You even bought the wallpaper for her.]

352
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,920
[You won't even brush my wall]

353
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,810
[even if I asked you to.]

354
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:47,890
[Give me a break.]

355
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,770
[Go away.]

356
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,120
[This is my second home.]

357
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,280
[Learning desk.]

358
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,090
[Compared with the home]

359
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,120
[where arguments are regular,]

360
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,610
[this place]

361
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,170
[is warm.]

362
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,130
[Not bad.]

363
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,730
[Little girl, don't go just yet.]

364
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,280
[Just finished your class?]

365
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,610
[Don't go just yet.]

366
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,050
[Why are you not talking?]

367
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,280
[Which class are you in?]

368
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,160
[You looked familiar.]

369
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:18,970
[That's right.]

370
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,000
[Which class are you in?]

371
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,160
[Let's go.]

372
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,280
[Just wait.]

373
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:33,890
[Just wait.]

374
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,760
[Scram!]

375
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,560
[Just wait.]

376
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,160
[Scram!]

377
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,760
[Stay here!]

378
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,640
[I'll beat you each time I see you.]

379
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,090
[My brother]

380
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,360
[may look like he hates me]

381
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,120
[and he seldom talks to me.]

382
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,160
[Are you okay?]

383
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,970
[But, he's actually kind and gentle.]

384
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,920
[Let's go.]

385
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,010
[Tell me next time
if you come home late.]

386
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:50,890
[I'll pick you up.]

387
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,760
[He always protects me quietly.]

388
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,090
[He runs his mouth]

389
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,520
[to cover who he really is]

390
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,600
[and take care of others quietly.]

391
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,370
Remind your mother

392
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,640
to take care of her health.

393
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:06,970
Enough.

394
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,690
She loves herself.

395
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,560
She goes to the hospital

396
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,400
whenever she's sick.

397
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,410
You don't have to worry.

398
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,250
Dig in.

399
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,130
I'm...

400
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,280
Dig in.

401
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,280
Here.

402
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,250
Uncle Deng,

403
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,480
your longevity noodles are here.

404
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,490
Oh, yes.

405
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,290
Don't break the noodles.

406
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
Eat them whole.

407
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,210
I just realised

408
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,200
my father

409
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,400
wanted a daughter.

410
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,040
Maybe he divorced my mom

411
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,040
because she gave birth to a son.

412
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,850
What are you talking about?

413
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:43,980
But, Uncle Deng

414
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,970
treats me really well.

415
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,980
I remembered I was living

416
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,860
in the high school.

417
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,150
Every time Uncle Deng

418
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,200
passed by the school,

419
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,700
he'd buy me some nice food.

420
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,750
He'd say,

421
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,070
"My daughter,

422
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,190
eat more.
No need to save the money for me."

423
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,910
My own father never treated me
that nice before.

424
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,070
Actually,

425
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,260
when you first came to my house,

426
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,270
I was jealous.

427
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,800
Father treated you better.

428
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,210
That's why I always bullied you.

429
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,760
What happened that changed your mind?

430
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,280
Well,

431
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,850
I thought you were righteous.

432
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,280
No matter how I bullied you,

433
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,280
you never reported on me.

434
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,130
You even said

435
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,210
I'm a good brother.

436
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,560
Then I stopped.

437
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,690
Also,

438
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,800
father told me

439
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,120
that you and your mother
left the hometown

440
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,440
after living there for years

441
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,410
and came to East Lake.

442
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,960
If we treat you badly,

443
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,200
you're done for.

444
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,680
But, to be honest,

445
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,570
living with you

446
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,360
for the few years,

447
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,560
I was really happy.

448
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,650
I was happier compared to the days

449
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,570
in my hometown.

450
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,010
But, it's a shame that

451
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,760
when I was about to accept you

452
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,050
and Uncle Deng,

453
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,720
my mom...

454
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,480
I won't judge

455
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,360
your mother.

456
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,440
Anyhow, father and I

457
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,290
will always be your family.

458
00:15:59,010 --> 00:15:59,760
What?

459
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,640
Don't look at me

460
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,520
like that,

461
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,560
braces girl.

462
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,650
Turn your head around.

463
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,250
How can you talk like that?

464
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,080
You always run your mouth.

465
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,530
Just drive.

466
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,130
Come in.

467
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,210
Father bought so much for you.

468
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,170
You can't finish it.

469
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,800
Why not you share it

470
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,010
with Ma Yi Yi and Wu Ying?

471
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,810
It makes sense.

472
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,170
Why not you take some home?

473
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,210
I need to carry it down again?

474
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,530
What are you thinking?

475
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,650
Hello, Mr. Lu.

476
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,010
[Hello, Xiao Deng.]

477
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,800
[Let me tell you something.]

478
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,400
[The Dr. Wu from
the hospital of stomatology]

479
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,440
[that you contacted]

480
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,000
[is unable to come this weekend.]

481
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,960
Why is he so unreliable?

482
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,260
Today's Thursday

483
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,550
and he said he's not coming.

484
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,730
[He earns nothing as
it's volunteer consultation.]

485
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,730
[Are you able to contact
another dentist?]

486
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:53,560
[A few children]

487
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,680
[are having a bad toothache.]

488
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,250
It's tough.

489
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,440
I've asked

490
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,770
Dr. Wu for so long

491
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,410
before he could make time

492
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,730
to come on this weekend.

493
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,490
Let me ask around.

494
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,770
[Okay.]

495
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:04,880
[Just try your best.]

496
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:05,890
Okay.

497
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,130
I'll let you know tomorrow.

498
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,010
[Is he looking for a dentist?]

499
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,130
What's wrong?

500
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,599
You need a dentist for
the volunteer event this weekend?

501
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,359
Some children in the orphanage

502
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,359
are having a toothache.

503
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,490
Some are quite serious.

504
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,329
I hardly got a dentist

505
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,210
who could come

506
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
and yet he stood me up.

507
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,210
Why not I find someone for you?

508
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,880
No.

509
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,250
Is your grievance more important than

510
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,890
the children's teeth?

511
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,810
Ai Jing Chu

512
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,250
is selfish and cold.

513
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,890
You hold prejudice against him.

514
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,330
He's quite patient in

515
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,280
treating the children's teeth.

516
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,320
Fine.

517
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,730
Just ask him.

518
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,410
Don't say it's me.

519
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,690
Okay.

520
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,520
[Why am I so sure that]

521
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,170
[Mr. Ai will agree to this?]

522
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,080
[But, I've told my brother.]

523
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,730
[I should just ask him.]

524
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,760
Mr. Ai is so busy.

525
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:07,840
Will he think that

526
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,600
I'm troubling him?

527
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,600
No.

528
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,600
Mr. Ai is loving.

529
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,720
He didn't ask for the fee

530
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,410
when he did the surgery

531
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,490
for Chen Chen.

532
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,060
Hello, mom.

533
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,350
[Let me tell you this good news.]

534
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,660
Gu Gong Hai's father

535
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,660
praised Uncle Peng

536
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,910
in today's meeting.

537
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,420
The Commissioner of General Department

538
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,300
[is vacant.]

539
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,220
[Uncle Peng might stand a chance.]

540
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,140
Great.

541
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,100
I feel like I'll soon become

542
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,900
the tool for you to get

543
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,870
your third husband.

544
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,990
What are you talking about?

545
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,790
Xiao Gu has a good family background.

546
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,870
He's great.

547
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,100
Even if his father is not

548
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,390
Uncle Peng's acquaintance,

549
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,990
you lose nothing for knowing

550
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,630
a guy with his quality.

551
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,420
I said it.

552
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,830
I have no feelings for him.

553
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,180
[Nurture it.]

554
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,390
Xiao Gu told me that

555
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,420
he'd like to send you to work
and pick you up after that.

556
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,180
[What do you think?]

557
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,990
Mom, I have something on.

558
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,870
I'll hang up first.

559
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,780
[Hello.]

560
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,670
[Hello.]

561
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:12,940
[Mr. Ai,]

562
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,900
[Zeng Li]

563
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,550
[I need a favour from you.]

564
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,310
[Well,]

565
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,660
[my brother takes part
in a volunteer event]

566
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,980
[in the orphanage this weekend.]

567
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,620
[He got this dentist]

568
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,860
[to consult the children,]

569
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,660
[but he couldn't make it last minute.]

570
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,630
[I wonder]

572
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,790
[No problem. I'm available.]

573
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,220
[Really? That's great.]

574
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,150
[I'll tell you the exact time tomorrow.]

575
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,840
[This is...]

576
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,300
[Oh, no.]

577
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,790
[I slipped my finger and
clicked it accidentally.]

578
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,220
[I wanted to send this.]

579
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,980
[Zeng Li: I get!]

580
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,110
[Where did you get this emoji?]

581
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,790
[I don't see it here.]

582
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,830
[You need to collect them slowly.]

583
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,630
[Just like the ones I sent.]

584
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,310
[You can click on them
and add them to your list]

585
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,790
[to steal them away.]

586
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
[Send me a few more.]

587
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,300
[Zeng Li: So cute!]

588
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,740

[on its busy track.]

[It's finally time for me
to change my braces.]

602
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,590
Masterpiece.

603
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,350
Indeed it's Mr. Ai

604
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,310
who did it himself.

605
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,150
Perfect.

606
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,860
It has been a while since

607
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,500
Mr. Ai did the full denture treatment.

608
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,070
I'll take a photo.

609
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,150
Okay, get back to work.

610
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,670
Okay.

611
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,110
Why are you so silly?

612
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,480
You just opened your mouth

613
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:30,870
for them to look at you.

614
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,350
Well, they wanted to see.

615
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,400
But after what they said,

616
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,270
I don't feel like

617
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,310
taking off my metal braces.

618
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,520
Keep it then.

619
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:40,970
No way.

620
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,130
I've paid for

621
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,130
my clear aligners

622
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,560
Do it, Mr. Ai.

623
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,000
Okay. Open your mouth.

624
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,210
It'll be quick and not painful.

627
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,000
Check this out for me.

628
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,970
Which one is the best photo?

629
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,690
Are these

630
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,610
different?

631
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,170
Are you silly?

632
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,200
The facial expressions

633
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,320
are all different, okay?

634
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,770
Look.

635
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,690
Smart.

636
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,850
Generous.

637
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,720
Cute and pouting.

638
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:20,330
Also...

639
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,210
Choose the cute one.

640
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
The cute one, right?

641
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,800
Take out your phone and like my Moment.

642
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,560
Fine.

643
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,890
Perhaps, humans on earth

644
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,410
are waiting for an encounter.

645
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,800
An encounter that's in time.

646
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,280
When the timing is right,

647
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,170
you'll meet each other.

648
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,850
I'll be waiting for you in CAROL'S.

649
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,760
How great if Sister Wu was here.

650
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,120
Why?

651
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,080
She'd say,

652
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,650
"Beat it."

653
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,290
I'm promoting

654
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,050

655
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,080
Do you understand?

656
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,970
I'm just promoting myself together.

657
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,200
Nowadays,

658
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,480
the youngsters like to

659
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,130
post two things in their Moments,

660
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,240
selfie

661
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,000
and the songs from NetEase.

662
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,280
To cover this,

663
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,040
they'll set the visibility

664
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,210
to three days only.

665
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,170
Tao Tao, you're going to get a beating.

666
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,130
That's not what I said.

667
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,080
It's the netizens who said that.

668
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,560
I'll post like that

669
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,480
whether I'm seeing someone or not.

670
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,280
Sister Ma,

671
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,250
you're quite free.

672
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,320
You always come when you're free.

673
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,040
I've been here for three days.

674
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,800
Welcome.

675
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,210
Coming.

676
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,530
This shop is a little far,

677
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,570
but it's not bad, right?

678
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,440
Yes.

679
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,320
Look at the environment.

680
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,040
I'll buy the drinks today.

681
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:56,850
Hello. How many of you?

682
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:57,640
You'll have to pay today.

683
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,520
Three of us.

684
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,610
I brought my colleagues here

685
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,850
to try your coffee.

686
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,680
Come on in.

687
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,890
The lighting there is better.

688
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,520
Let's go.

689
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,770
Thank you.

690
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,170
The environment here is good.

691
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,170
Yes. It's sunny.

692
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,810
Look.

693
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,330
Look.

694
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,210
We can see some ships.

695
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,560
Not bad.

696
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,610
What would you like to drink?

697
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,450
As usual, okay?

698
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,080
Two cups of iced latte.

699
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,080
One iced Americano.

700
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,170
One moment, please.

701
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,360
Thank you.

702
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,330
She's pretty.

703
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,130
Her body figure is good, too.

704
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,010
Keep your voice down, okay?

705
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,090
Two cups of iced latte.

706
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,170
One iced Americano.

707
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,120
Hurry up!

708
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,680
Will she like some programmers

709
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,810
from a small company

710
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,800
like us?

711
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,560
Give it a try.

712
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,480
A master told me early this year.

713
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:43,920
What?

714
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,570
I'll have bad romance this year.

715
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,560
Seriously?

716
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:47,810
Yes.

717
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,210
Can romance be categorised?

718
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,090
You're cursing me again?

719
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,760
Hurry up.

720
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
He said that himself, right?

721
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,810
Yes.

722
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,440
Both of you

723
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,080
like to bully me together.

724
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,480
I use the computer every day.

725
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,200
I feel like I'm going

726
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,080
bald soon.

727
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,850
Look at mine.

728
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:04,760
Yours are nothing.

729
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,810
What's this?

730
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,040
Being bald as a young man.

731
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,200
Sister,

732
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,690
can I add you on WeChat?

733
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,400
Our cafe's WeChat is here.

734
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,560
Just scan it will do.

735
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,210
I'd like to add your WeChat.

736
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,130
I'm sorry.

737
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,450
It's not convenient.

738
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:30,770
How do you know

739
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,000
I ordered the iced Americano?

740
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:33,920
[I can't be telling you]

741
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,970
[I read your Moments.]

742
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:37,770
I just simply put them here.

743
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,090
If I got them wrong,

744
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,130
you can switch them up.

745
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,690
No.

746
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,680
It happens that

747
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,560
I want this.

748
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,130
What a coincidence.

749
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,280
Look at this.

750
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,410
What's it?

751
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,920
Your shoes

752
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,450
are couple shoes.

753
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,920
[It's not a coincidence.]

754
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,610
[I bought these
because you're wearing them.]

755
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,200
It's nice for girls to wear them.

756
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,800
Then I...

757
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,130
Thank you.

758
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,480
All the girls are falling for

759
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,600
the handsome Brother Sheng.

760
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,560
What are you talking about?

761
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,570
Drink your coffee.

762
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,500
[Outpatient Department]

763
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,280
Look at

764
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,370
your teeth.

765
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,690
Mr. Ai,

766
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,890
do you think my teeth are

767
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,160
getting more aligned?

768
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,810
If it's otherwise,

769
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,090
I'll be a terrible dentist.

770
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,440
Come on. Let me see. Open your mouth.

771
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,670
The left two and left three
are still not in place.

772
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,500
You're used to the metal braces.

773
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,710
Maybe you're not used to it now.

774
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:39,820
Try and bite it.

775
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,380
Why

776
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,950
are you biting me?

777
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,470
Didn't you ask me to bite you?

778
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,700
I mean,

779
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,300
after I take off my hand.

780
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,190
I'm sorry.

781
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,990
Did I hurt you?

782
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,980
Level one work-related injury.

783
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,780
It's work-related injury.

784
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,260
I don't need to compensate you.

785
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,420
Do you remember

786
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,300
the video that I sent to you?

787
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,300
I got this.

788
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,390
U is upper and L is lower.

789
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,260
Put in the middle and then the side.

790
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,360
You got the wrong tooth.

791
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:20,750
Why not I do it for you?

792
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,580
Open your mouth.

793
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,470
Mirror.

794
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,860
Mr. Ai,

795
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,660
do you think

796
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,780
I'm getting prettier?

797
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,880
The braces

798
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,230
were done according to your teeth.

799
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,430
It won't align anything,

800
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,710
Get used to it for a week.

801
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,140
When I add on the adhesive,

802
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,540
then you can change to

803
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,330
the aligners.

804
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,620
Oh, yes. Also,

805
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,950
this is yours.

806
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,740
This is the plastic straw

807
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,990
in the video, right?

808
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,380
It's called chewies.

809
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,500
When you wear the aligners,

810
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,420
bite it.

811
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,550
It helps to tighten

812
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,190
your teeth with the aligners.

813
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,780
Why can't the chewies

814
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,280
be designed in a nicer way?

815
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,240
Mr. Ai,

816
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:11,960
do you think

817
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,990
I look like a hamster now?

818
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,600
All right, hamster.

819
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:18,760
It's time.

820
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,800
We should go to the orphanage now.

821
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,320
What?

822
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,320
I'm getting in the car.

823
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,640
You have so many things in the car.

824
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,980
Why didn't you put them in the trunk?

825
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,010
It can't fit in anymore.

826
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,010
I keep my football attire

827
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,140
in the trunk.

828
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,370
We're getting in the car.

829
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,290
Why didn't you orgainse them?

830
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,340
I'll sit at the back.

831
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,660
No way.

832
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,690
There are many stuffs back there.

833
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,370
You're tall. You won't feel comfortable.

834
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,250
No worries.

835
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,940
Get in the car.

836
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:06,650
Thank you.

837
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,530
So pretentious.

838
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,140
I remembered that you liked to talk

839
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,620
back in school.

840
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,820
Now, you remembered me.

841
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,180
I'm sorry, class representative.

842
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,740
Zeng Li said

843
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,380
I might have prosopagnosia.

844
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,860
The class representative
was Zhang Hao Miao.

845
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,050
Come on.

846
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,210
Can you hold me?

847
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,490
I can't hold you now.

848
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,820
There's another one.

849
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,450
Can you hold me?

850
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,810
Come on.

851
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,620
Be careful.

852
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,900
Let's go.

853
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,380
I'm holding two of them.

854
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,770
You're great.

855
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,690
I want to go down.

856
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,210
No, I won't let you go down.

857
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,930
I want to go down.

858
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:21,650
I won't let you go down.

859
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,210
I won't let you go down.

860
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,140
I want to go down.

861
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,250
I won't let you go down.

862
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:25,610
I won't let you go down.

863
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,690
Where are we going?

864
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,730
You have to tell Dr. Bai

865
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,650
about your symptoms

866
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:35,620
in detail later.

867
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,180
Is my symptom

868
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,660
not obvious?

869
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,290
I'm talking about other symptoms.

870
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,970
The pimple is just the surface.

871
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,140
For example,

872
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,450
how's your appetite?

873
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:46,770
How's your sleep?

874
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,100
How's your bowel movement?

875
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,450
Is it hard or is it soft?

876
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,300
Is it smelly?

877
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,420
Faeces are all smelly.

878
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,970
All right.

879
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,450
Why do I feel like you're bringing a dog

880
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,340
to a vet?

881
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,610
I'm a doctor.

882
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,730
I know how to describe.

883
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,910
I know you don't believe much in
traditional Chinese medicine,

884
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,840
but Dr. Bai is really good.

885
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,480
I've queued up for so long

886
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,360
before I could meet him.

887
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,680
You must be cooperative.

888
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,320
I got it.

889
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,670
The result will be the same after all.

890
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,000
Tonnes of Chinese medicines
will be prescribed

891
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,990
to be boiled.

892
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,390
Number 16, Wu Ying.

893
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,320
It's our turn.

894
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:33,950
Go back now.

895
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,150
Is she fine?

896
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,430
No, she's sick.

897
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,080
She's sick all around.

898
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,870
Doesn't she need some medicine?

899
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,910
She's sick

900
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,520
because she doesn't sleep early.

901
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,670
Plus, her diet is a mess.

902
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,190
She eats all the rubbish.

903
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,670
Also, she's short-tempered.

904
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,000
It's all messy

905
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,400
from inside out.

906
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,880
So, you won't save me?

907
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,050
You need to save yourself first.

908
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,320
Don't stay up late at night.
Sleep early and get up early.

909
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,970
Eat your three meals on time.

910
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,930
Reduce the oily and spicy food.

911
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,360
Change your temper.

912
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,690
Do as I said first.

913
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,210
Come back in half a month.

914
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,560
I'll prescribe you then.

915
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,840
The herbs won't be wasted that way.

916
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,010
Okay, that's it. Go now.

917
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,240
Thank you, Dr. Bai.

918
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,120
Thank you.

919
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,760
I'm here to see the doctor,

920
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,250
but why are you pulling a long face?

921
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,800
Sister,

922
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,050
you don't love yourself.

923
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,490
I'm an ER doctor.

924
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,210
How can I not stay up late?

925
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,170
When you're not working,

926
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,000
I don't see you sleep early.

927
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,560
You got off work yesterday at 7 p.m.

928
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,250
You were still posting on your Moment
at 2.30 a.m.

929
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,120
I should block you.

930
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,890
I don't believe that

931
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:47,970
all the ER doctors

932
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:48,930
live a messy life

933
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:49,840
like you.

934
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,640
Sister,

935
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,160
what do you do

936
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,360
when you're not working?

937
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,080
I don't really do anything.

938
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,400
I play games.

939
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,800
Games?

940
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,520
What?

941
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,800
My work is stressful.

942
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,250
This is my only entertainment.

943
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,400
Can't I play games?

944
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,530
Here. Open your mouth.

945
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,010
Yes, open it wider.

946
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,160
Don't move.

947
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,560
Okay. Go and play.

948
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,080
Stop it.

949
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,280
She has some cavities.

950
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,710
Maybe she doesn't

951
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,080
brush her teeth properly,

952
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,240
but luckily

953
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,640
it's all deciduous teeth.

954
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,010
We don't have to do anything.

955
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,010
But, make sure

956
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,450
she reduces her sweet food intake

957
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,740
and brushes her teeth properly
every day and night.

958
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,110
Who is the next one?

959
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,360
Next, Ma Xiao Bing.

960
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,260
-Ma Xiao Bing is out there.
-There.

961
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,400
Ma Xiao Bing.

962
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:09,260
Let me take a look.

963
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,570
Xiao Bing.

964
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,760
Why are you not going in?

965
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,020
Other children have done their checkups.

966
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,290
Come in with me.

967
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,730
Xiao Bing, don't be afraid.

968
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,210
Mr. Lu and I are here with you.

969
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,820
It'll be quick.

970
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,900
Come on. Don't be afraid.

971
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,290
Xiao Bing is brave,

972
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,770
right?

973
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,130
Boy,

974
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:43,900
can you

975
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,820
take off your mask

976
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,820
and show me?

977
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,610
I'm a dentist. Don't be afraid.

978
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,540
I'll just take a look, okay?

979
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,290
I'll just take a look.

980
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,160
Come on. I'll just take a look.

981
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,060
It'll be quick.

982
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,220
It's done.

983
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,720
Don't worry. It can be treated.

984
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,740
Really?

985
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,540
Trust me.

986
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,610
Okay.

987
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,810
Go and play with them.

988
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,490
Please bring Ma Xiao Bing

989
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,000
and the children that I mentioned

990
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,700
to the hospital

991
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:41,770
for another checkup.

992
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,570
Thank you, Dr. Ai.

993
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,050
Dr. Ai,

994
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,370
we know about

995
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,740
Ma Xiao Bing's situation.

996
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,050
He'll need a few surgeries.

997
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,300
The fees are expensive.

998
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,010
Our orphanage's

999
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,570
funds are...

1000
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,620
I understand.

1001
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,260
Our hospital offers some

1002
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,550
free medical treatments every year.

1003
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,070
I'll try to get it for you.

1004
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,100
That'd be great.

1005
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,230
Thank you, Dr. Ai.

1006
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,260
Most welcome.

1007
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,590
I feel much relieved.

1008
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:06,790
Children,

1009
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,030
we have some tasty food here.

1010
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,600
-Come and take a look.
-You're here.

1011
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,740
There are milk and sweets.

1012
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,140
All sorts of sweets.

1013
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,400
-Take this sweet.
-I want them all.

1014
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,810
-She has some cavities.
-I want this.

1015
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:16,970
She can't take sweet.

1016
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,040
Just talk.

1017
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,290
You don't have to touch her.

1018
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,000
What are you talking about?

1019
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,890
The children are here.

1020
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,210
Drinking milk helps you to grow taller.

1021
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,680
Be as tall as me.

1022
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,000
This brother here is

1023
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,200
also my dentist.

1024
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,650
The things that
he doesn't allow me to eat

1025
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,560
are much more than yours.

1026
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,480
Let's get the milk, okay?

1027
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,480
I want to play hide-and-seek.

1028
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,330
We want to play hide-and-seek, too.

1029
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,440
Okay.

1030
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,160
Let's drink all the milk

1031
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,160
and we'll play hide-and-seek,

1032
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,400
okay?

1033
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,890
Okay!

1034
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,450
Don't stop!

1035
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,890
You have the penta kill already.

1036
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,690
Didn't Dharma

1037
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,210
push you to the tower?

1038
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,370
How did you kill him with
so little HP left?

1039
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:55,520
I have the sword, Destiny.

1040
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,290
I used my second skill

1041
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,330
and tricked him to
use his ultimate skill.

1042
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,600
Then I stunned him.

1043
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,930
I still have my ultimate skill.

1044
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,560
It's easy to kill him.

1045
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,690
You're great.

1046
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,960
What's your ranking in Q area?

1047
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,480
Tens of stars.

1048
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,170
The new season has just started

1049
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,520
and you have tens of stars?

1050
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,000
Are you playing games every day

1051
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,880
and not studying?

1052
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,760
No.

1053
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,810
Let me show you.

1054
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,240
My battle results.

1055
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:21,690
31 games,

1056
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,810
12 stars,

1057
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,210
and 83% win rate.

1058
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,210
Are you the god of gaming?

1059
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,570
Kind of.

1060
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,480
Many girls

1061
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,550
added me as friends,

1062
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,880
but I didn't approve them.

1063
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,400
Look.

1064
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,920
Create a group in WeChat

1065
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,730
and help me up my stars.

1066
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,610
Please.

1067
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,050
You...

1068
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,090
Beg me one more time.

1069
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,560
Please! Please! Please!

1070
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,210
Okay, but with a condition.

1071
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,650
If you're not on

1072
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:47,440
night shift,

1073
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,650
you have to sleep before 12 a.m.

1074
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,290
If you help me

1075
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,210
to get three stars every night,

1076
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,560
I'll go to bed on time.

1077
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,370
Three stars?

1078
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,040
No.

1079
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,250
My job is tiring.

1080
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,960
I need to win a few rounds

1081
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,690
to relieve myself.

1082
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,170
Three stars are too easy for me.

1083
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,000
Sister, you can sleep
at 10 p.m. from now on.

1084
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,520
Really?

1085
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,080
So easy?

1086
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,440
Come on.

1087
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,320
Let's start.

1088
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,120
Four,

1089
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,480
three,

1090
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,130
two,

1091
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,170
one.

1092
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,690
Where are you?

1093
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,190
I can see you.

1094
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,000
It seems like no one is here.

1095
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,770
Where are you hiding?

1096
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,550
I don't see anyone.

1097
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,650
Where are you hiding?

1098
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,440
Up there?

1099
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,480
Sister, we're about to be found.

1100
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,040
Got you.

1101
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,480
Come out!

1102
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,360
-Brother.
-Let's go.

1103
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,370
Got you.

1104
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,400
Run.

1105
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,840
Sister, what should we do?

1106
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,190
Is there nowhere to hide?

1107
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,440
Today, the devil will eat up
all the children.

1108
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,710
Where are the children?

1109
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,260
The devil is here.

1110
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,390
I saw you.

1111
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,500
Come out now.

1112
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,500
Don't think that I can't find you

1113
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,430
just because you're hiding here.

1114
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,100
It doesn't matter you're young

1115
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,390
or old,

1116
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,350
I'll get you one by one.

1117
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,660
[Dr. Ai,]

1118
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,260
[when you look at Aunt Zeng Li,]

1119
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,180
[there are stars in your eyes, too.]

1120
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,700
You're smart.

1121
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,620
I didn't get you to come out.

1122
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,740
Where are you?

1123
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,390
Are they not here?

1124
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,660
[System error]

1125
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,620
I can't upload my video again this week.

1126
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,430
Shut down.

1127
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,350
No, restart.

1128
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,470
Shut down.

1129
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,310
Sister Ma, this is

1130
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,350
the automatic system update.

1131
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,580
The software has yet to updated.

1132
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,620
It's not compatible.

1133
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,430
You just need to update it.

1134
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,310
Let me help you.

1135
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,390
You... Wait.

1136
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,150
Tell me.

1137
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,660
Does a programmer know how to do this?

1138
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:50,950
Of course.

1139
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,990
It's the easiest.

1140
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,380
But you don't have to look for them.

1141
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,940
I majored in computers,

1142
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,050
so I can help you fix it.

1143
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:56,820
Let me help you.

1144
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,700
Hold it right there.

1145
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,740
What?

1146
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,330
The laptop is down

1147
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,340
at the right time.

1148
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,050
Goodbye.

1149
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:14,780
Go back now.

1150
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,860
Listen to the teachers.

1151
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,620
Okay!

1152
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,500
Goodbye.

1153
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,580
Come often.

1154
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,090
Goodbye.

1155
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,780
Goodbye.

1156
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:24,860
Sit next to me

1157
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,530
when I drive
so that I won't fall asleep.

1158
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,410
Why?

1159
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:28,700
Won't I have become the driver

1160
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,910
if both of you sit at the back?

1161
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,260
Aren't you the driver?

1162
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:33,490
Fine.

1163
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,010
I'm tired.

1164
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:34,970
So, when I get to the car,

1165
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,010
I'll be sleeping.

1166
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,170
Are you even my sister?
