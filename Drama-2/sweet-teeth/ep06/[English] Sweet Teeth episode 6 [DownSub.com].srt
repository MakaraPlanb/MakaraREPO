00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,060
Mr. Ai.

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,120
Are you here for a meal?

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,080
Why didn't I

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,020
see you just now?

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,270
I was in a private room.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,260
Are you here for a date?

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,300
No.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,430
It's a blind date.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,730
Isn't blind date a date, too?

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,880
No.

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,810
Dating means going out with someone
I have feelings for.

13
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,810
Otherwise, it's just a free meal.

14
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,670
I shall get going then.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,920
Oh, yes.

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,440
What movie are you going to watch?

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,370
Age of Dinosaurs 3.

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,930
Tell me

19
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,230
which theatre it is.

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,970
I don't know what to do

21
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,020
after the meal with my friend.

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,000
Well,

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,590
if we watch it together,

24
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,520
it won't be embarrassing.

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,600
Okay.

26
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,410
Will I be disturbing you?

27
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,160
No.

28
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,350
I'll take it as my rest.

29
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,790
A movie?

30
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,680
Mr. Ai,

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,910
don't you have something on tonight?

32
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,790
I just think that

33
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:05,910
Age of Dinosaurs 3

34
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,070
is going off the screen soon.

35
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,390
It's a pity not watching it.

36
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,789
Mr. Ai,

37
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,990
you spend your flexible time

38
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,760
with me.

39
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,720
I'm moved.

40
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,200
I'll pay for our tickets.

41
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,870
Which seats should we get?

42
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,360
[Hall 3 (big screen hall) screen]

43
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,560
These two

44
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,480
at the side will do.

45
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,070
Mr. Ai,

46
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:31,789
do you remember

47
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,150
the clone lady
in the previous installment?

48
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:33,910
I'm sure she has

49
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,979
the gene of the dinosaur.

50
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,630
Otherwise, the dinosaurs
would've attacked her.

51
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,780
I think it'll be revealed
in this installment.

52
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,039
Right, Mr. Ai?

53
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,630
Actually, I haven't watched the first
and the second installments.

54
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,350
You haven't?

55
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,110
Then, what's so bad

56
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,710
about missing the third?

57
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
I think

58
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,680
if the third is good,

59
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,560
I'll watch the first two installments.

[Sweet Teeth]

61
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,230
Which set meal would you like?

62
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,990
Water will do.

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,480
We can't watch a movie

64
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,360
without popcorn.

65
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,320
Would you like to

66
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,320
have the dinosaur set meal?

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,710

69
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:21,920
You can bring it home as a memento.

70
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,990
No need.

71
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,040
That's it. It's cute.

72
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,160
Okay.

Mr. Ai.

79
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,760
This is my friend, Gu Dong Hai.

Hello.

Hello.

Hello, sister.

Let's me pay for it.

87

Well, do you like this tumbler bottle?

88
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,240
Yes.

89
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,520
I have one Triceratops tumbler bottle
at home,

90
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,000
but I don't drink soda.

91
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,360
Can I change it to fruit juice?

92
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,880
-Sure.
-Thank you.

93
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,500
Do you want it, too?

94
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,550
No, we've ordered one.

95
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,430
Also, we don't need you

96
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,640

Waitress, hold on.

99
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,190
We want four drinks

100
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,060
and two buckets of popcorn.

101
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,470
Thank you.

102
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,420

00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,390
One Coke and one fruit juice.

104

Sorry, but scanning is much easier.

108

109
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,220
carrying cash around.

110

Here you go.

114
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,790
No problem.

115

I've got a problem.

116
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,670
I don't like to owe anyone anything.

117
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,700
But I appreciate it, thank you.

118
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,980
-Here.
-Thank you.

119
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,310
Here.

120
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,030
Thank you.

121
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,580
Won't you eat it?

122
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,140
No worries, sister. Take it.

Thank you.

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:18,870

It's really nice.

132
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,740
It's really popular in Malaysia.

133
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,820
You haven't watched it,

134
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,900
but I can understand.

135
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,150
This dinosaur...

136
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,230
Well, you might not know,

137
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,950
and you don't really understand,

138
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,830
right?

139
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,710
It's my first time

140
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,100
seeing a male teacher

00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,150
You can ask me

144
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,710
if you don't understand.

145
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,100
I'll tell you.

146
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,350
It's somehow abnormal.

Does it mean a female student

148
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,790

155
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,070
Brother, good luck.

156
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,840

Don't catch a cold.

am I great?

178
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,250
Why is the person in front of me so tall?

Okay.

182
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,610
Okay.

Wasn't Ceratosaurus

from the Jurassic?

185
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,570
What?

186
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,520
Since it's a man-made park,

187
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,690
it makes sense with

188
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,530
the Jurassic dinosaurs.

189
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,530
Why must

00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,370
instead of Dinosaur Park?

193
00:07:59,130 --> 00:07:59,930
You have a point,

194
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,610
but

195
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,930
you even know Ceratosaurus?

196
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,720
I know many other dinosaurs.

197
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,050
Look at that above.

198
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,200
Pachycephalosaurus.

199
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,960
Mosasaurus in the water.

200
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,010
The flying

201
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,050
Pteranodon.

202
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,570
Dimorphodon.

203
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,450
Parasaurolophus.

204
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,320
Apatosaurus.

205
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,120
Look at that.

206
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,640
Ankylosaurus.

207
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,520
This is...

208
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,960
Diplodocus.

209
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,250
That's Brachiosaurus.

210
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,640
Brachiosaurus?

211
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:25,850
Brachiosaurus?

212
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,640
Bruce Lee.

213
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
Let's go. Let me send you home.

214
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,440
Let me send her.

215
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,490
It's on the way.

216
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,250
Me, too.

217
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,160
Do you know where she stays?

218
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,490
Her mother has told me.

219
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,930
I think I'm not staying near you.

220
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,050
I'm leaving then.

221
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:53,810
Sister,

222
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,040
I'll look for you in the library next.

223
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,840
-Okay.
-I'm leaving.

224
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,360
Bye.

225
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,400
Mr. Ai, goodbye.

226
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,490
Both of you don't have to send me.

227
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,760
I'll look for my friend.

228
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:05,770
Goodbye.

229
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:06,680
Wait.

230
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,010
Where's your friend?

231
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,440
Just a short distance.

232
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,320
Goodbye.

233
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,730
Let's keep in touch on WeChat.

234
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:31,890
Zeng Li.

235
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,210
Mr. Ai, why are you here?

236
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,360
Didn't you say

237
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,040
your friend is waiting for you
somewhere nearby?

238
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,050
It's already at this hour.

239
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,370
No way I'm meeting my friend.

240
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,680
I didn't want you to feel awkward.

241
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,010
It was awkward for me, too.

242
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,330
Come on. Get in the car.

243
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,370
Let me send you home.

244
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,080
Okay.

245
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,080
Oh, right.

246
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,610
Where do you stay actually?

247
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,770
Mercury Residence.

248
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,520
[Outpatient exit]

249
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,560
Sister!

250
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,560
Sister!

251
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,330
Sister, here!

252
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,800
Wait for me! Right away!

253
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,320
[Outpatient]

254
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,210
Sister, what a coincidence.

255
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,730
What? Are you stalking me?

256
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:48,930
No.

257
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,010
I went for a movie just now.

258
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,040
Then I passed by your hospital.

259
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,520
I was wondering if I could meet you.

260
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,850
Then you came out.

261
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,040
We're meant to meet each other.

262
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,770
Be good.

263
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,520
I got it. Go home now.

264
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,600
Sister,

265
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,320
I bought you

266
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,210
dinner.

267
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,250
Did you eat that?

268
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:04,890
And the fruit juice.

269
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,530
It's really nice.

270
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,360
Did you drink that?

271
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,250
I was too busy and I forgot.

272
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,680
My colleagues finished it

273
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,440
when I got back to the office.

274
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,010
So, you didn't take your dinner?

275
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,320
I'm about to.

276
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,200
Let me come with you.

277
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,730
You won't like what I like to eat.

278
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,850
Try me.

279
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,960
I told you that you won't like it,

280
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,250
but you insisted.

281
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,640
It's great to just be with you,

282
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,840
but you need to

283
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,280
avoid salty and spicy food like this.

284
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,650
You're even drinking iced Coke.

285
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,890
You have pimples on your face.

286
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,440
Look.

287
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,640
One, two,

288
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:43,850
three...

289
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,200
You're young.

290
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,560
Can you relax?

291
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,840
Relax?

292
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,160
I'd rather live longer.

293
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,490
Brother Yu Cheng.

294
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,330
You're here for Malatang?

295
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,360
Hello.

296
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,400
You should go and order first.

297
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,250
Okay.

298
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,560
Is she your sister?

299
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,680
You can call me madam.

300
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,440
Don't be ridiculous.

301
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,530
You're just slightly older than me.

302
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,850
Can I sit here and eat with you?

303
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,210
Aren't your friends here?

304
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,240
It's okay.

305
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,440
We stay in the same hostel.

306
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,170
We're close.

307
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,160
We're chatting.

308
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,130
Maybe next time.

309
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,160
She likes you.

310
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,840
You're here.

311
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,090
Why did you reject her?

312
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,440
I don't like her.

313
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,560
I don't want to waste her time.

314
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,200
Why are you

315
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,010
wasting my time?

316
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,040
Because I like you.

317
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,920
That's too direct.

318
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,400
Why should I be keeping it from you?

319
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,010
I'm six years older than you.

320
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,440
When I was 18,

321
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,400
you were only 12.

322
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,290
Don't you think

323
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:52,960
it's scary?

324
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,280
When you're 68,

325
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,360
I'll be 62.

326
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,720
Isn't it much better

327
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,600
if you think like that?

328
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,560
We're not meant for each other.

329
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,970
Why?

330
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,250
We don't even like to eat the same food.

331
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,850
Our taste is different.

332
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,760
This is totally not a problem.

333
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,970
You're just like my mother.

334
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,250
She likes to eat meat,

335
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,160
but my father is a Buddhist
and a vegetarian.

336
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,400
They live in harmony.

337
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,850
They won't fight for food.

338
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,130
Our lifestyles

339
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:16,680
are different.

340
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,090
Look, you're health-conscious.

341
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,440
Look at me. I live

342
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,560
a messy life.

343
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,800
That's why I'm here.

344
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,130
I don't want to go out with anyone now.

345
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,110
That's my advantage.

346
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,160
I'm young.

347
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:34,970
I can wait.

348
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,890
You're young?

349
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:43,850
Watch your mouth.

350
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:49,890
Eat lesser.

351
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,290
Is it tasty?

352
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,680
I heard that.

353
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,480
What did you hear?

354
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,530
Your stomach was growling.

355
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,720
What?

356
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,610
Didn't you eat for free just now?

357
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,760
It's all because of you.

358
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,210
You told me

359
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:32,930
not to eat this

360
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:33,810
and not to eat that.

361
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,330
You made me dream

362
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,640
of delicious food every time.

363
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,730
I have to face the mean truth

364
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,680
whenever I wake up.

365
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,560
What delicious food did you dream of?

366
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,760
I dreamed of

367
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,760
Mala crayfish

368
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,490
and

369
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,160
chicken feet with pickled peppers.

370
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,130
Also, Latiao,

371
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,090
roasted sweet potatoes,

372
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,850
and grilled cold noodles

373
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,130
Indeed

374
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,520
you can't eat those.

375
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,970
Except for grilled cold noodles
and roasted sweet potatoes.

376
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,280
Really?

377
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,370
I'm craving for them now.

378
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,610
Where can we get these?

379
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,440
Let me lead you there, okay?

380
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,720
Mr. Ai,

381
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,760
welcome to my happy world.

382
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,130
This street was

383
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,090
my hangout place in university.

384
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:34,600
All the restaurants

385
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,890

Mr. Ai, you don't use WeChat

00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,480
[like Ma Yi Yi]

957
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,970
[is actually]

958
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,640
[a blessing.]

[exploring everything about him,]

961
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,830
[and trying hard to get into his world,]

962
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,160

967
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,870
[the monotonous life]

968
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,020
