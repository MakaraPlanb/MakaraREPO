2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,680
Dr. Wu.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,600
Happy Birthday.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,560
You're 27 years old now.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,760
I've spent 27 birthdays

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,560
with a heavy heart.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,360
Think about it this way.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,120
This will still be better than

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,520
your 30th birthday.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,440
Thank you.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,040
The person to celebrate
your birthday is here.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,720
Dr. Wu,

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,040
Happy Birthday.

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,080
Thank you.

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,680
I'll treat you to steak tonight.

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,880
Let's celebrate your birthday.

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,760
I'm celebrating with
my best friends tonight.

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:39,800
What about this weekend?

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,840
I'm celebrating with my
parents this weekend.

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,440
It's fine.

21
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,920
It's your birthday.

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,200
Is there anything you
want as a birthday gift?

23
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,560
There's really no need for this.

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,520
Wang,

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,560
you've finished your meal, right?

26
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,280
I'm done.

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,240
You two, enjoy.

28
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,080
Enjoy your food.

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,760
Dr. Wang

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,920
is quite observant.

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,280
Dr. Jiang,

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,200
I have something to ask you.

33
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,680
Go ahead. What is it?

34
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,280
I heard from Wang Xiao Ya that

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
a few days ago, in the corridor,

36
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,600
you were talking to Liu Yu Cheng.

37
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,440
Liu Yu Cheng?

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,720
Is he that young man

39
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,920
who brings you lunch everyday?

40
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,960
What did you say to him?

41
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,960
Nothing.

42
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,400
I just said you two weren't
suitable for each other

43
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,039
and he should stop
wasting his time on you.

44
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:23,600
Who gave you the right

45
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,480
to say those things to him?

46
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
I thought that's what you think.

47
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,240
So I was helping you

48
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,880
to solve this trouble.

49
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
You don't even know me well.

50
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,039
In the future, please don't

51
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,120
decide on your own.

52
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,400
Don't tell me you honestly like him.

53
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,800
He's so much younger than you

54
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,039
and he's still studying.

55
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,080
You two are really not
suitable for each other.

56
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,680
Suitable or not,

57
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,039
I don't need you to tell me.

58
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:39,920
We're just friends.

59
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,880
You've overstepped your boundaries.

60
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,840
You promised me to go for archery session

61
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,759
and dine at a restaurant.

62
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,360
Within my understanding,

63
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,520
These are already dates.

64
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Now you're telling me

65
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,840
we're just friends?

66
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,440
That's right.

67
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,600
At the beginning, I also considered

68
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,200
to look for someone

69
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,400
who's about the same age
as me to be my boyfriend.

70
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,840
However, after interactions,

71
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,400
I realised

72
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,520
you're the type of person
who's the least suitable for me.

73
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,680
The dates, as you understand them to be,

74
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,120
won't happen again in the future.

75
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,280
Wu Ying, you should consider it.

76
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
I'm really sorry!

77
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,680
[Sweet Teeth Episode 15]
[Outpatient]

78
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,079
Dr. Wu, are you clocking out?

79
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,440
Who gave this to you?

80
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,240
Who else could it be?

81
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,920
Jiang Rui, of course.

82
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,360
Do me a favour.

83
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,040
Return this to him

84
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,960
and tell him to stop doing

85
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,040
this kind of meaningless
thing in the future.

86
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,320
Look.

87
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
This is the classic design.

88
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,560
Besides, the price has gone up this year.

89
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,960
Wait a minute.

90
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,720
This seems

91
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,520
to be a gift from someone else.

92
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,720
[Dr. Wu, happy birthday.]

93
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,500
[Liu Yu Cheng]

94
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,920
[You're going to be cute this year, too.]

95
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,320
[Dr. Wu, happy birthday. You're going
to be cute this year, too. Liu Yu Cheng]

96
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
That guy

97
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,480
must've done it on purpose.

98
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,200
Last time, he grabbed your knee.

99
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,400
This time, it's your face.

100
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:30,960
It's fine.

101
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,720
He's just an aggressive player.

102
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,480
It's my fault

103
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,680
for not focusing on the game.

104
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,120
Apply it on your face.

105
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you.

106
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,320
You are not in a good condition.

107
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,120
You're in the clouds.

108
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,680
Today is her birthday.

109
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,400
I was going to celebrate
her birthday with her,

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,280
but I was afraid she'd find me annoying.

111
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,520
Let me have a look.

112
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,600
Are you okay?

113
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,840
What are you doing here?

114
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,800
Apply it first.

115
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,400
The swelling will subside in a while.

116
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,360
Why did you bring it here?

117
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,839
Don't you like it?

118
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,920
You're a student.

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,000
Why did you buy for me
such an expensive bag?

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,360
What were you thinking?

121
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,560
Return it to the shop.

122
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,720
I threw away the receipt.

123
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,560
Yes, I'm still studying.

124
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
I probably can't give you

125
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,280
what the men in their thirties

126
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,400
can give you

127
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,080
at the moment.

128
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,960
However, I remember it.

129
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,360
I'll work even harder

130
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,200
and dream big.

131
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,560
As for the things that other women own,

132
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,240
I'll do my best to make
sure you own them as well.

133
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,080
Anyway, don't worry.

134
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
I bought this using scholarship.

135
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,640
I didn't ask money from my family.

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,640
Why do you have to

137
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,440
make life so tiring for yourself?

138
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,640
Great!

139
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,840
Go! Good job!

140
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,280
Look at those girls.

141
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,920
They're pretty and lively.

142
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,800
Awesome!

143
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,150
At their age,

144
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,280
they don't have to worry

145
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,640
so much about realistic issues.

146
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,480
Neither do they face pressure in life.

147
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,840
Isn't being with them

148
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,720
easier for you?

149
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,670
You're the person I like.

150
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,280
I can see and think of
no one else but you.

151
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,040
What are they like

152
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,080
has nothing to do with me.

153
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
You said

154
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,720
I was not at the legal age to get married.

155
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,400
However, in Malaysia,

156
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,920
one can get married at 18 years old.

157
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,520
You also said that

158
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,320
we were originally

159
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,520
not meant to cross paths,

160
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,520
but we

161
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,400
still met each other.

162
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,760
The moment

163
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,240
we met each other,

164
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,360
we crossed path with
each other, didn't we?

165
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,800
The only thing is that

166
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,400
currently,

167
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
my financial ability is indeed limited.

168
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,320
Perhaps temporarily,

169
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,400
it's going to be a little hard for you.

170
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,360
However, that's also my
motivation to work hard.

171
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
I'll work even harder

172
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,360
to study my major.

173
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
In the future, I'll definitely

174
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,200
be better than that

175
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,680
Dr. Jiang.

176
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,600
Are you still holding a grudge?

177
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,120
Is Dr. Jiang blacklisted by you?

178
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,720
From the rational perspective,

179
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,600
he's right.

180
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,760
However, in terms of feelings,

181
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,640
it's true that I

182
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,760
dislike him

183
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,640
just a little bit.

184
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,600
We're quite similar in that aspect.

185
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,440
I know, right?

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,120
I knew you wouldn't like him.

187
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,520
I can tell by the way you look at him.

188
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,920
Ski resort, we're here!

189
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,000
It's so cold outside!

190
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Let's take a photograph.

191
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,520
One, two, three.

192
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,040
Come and get your luggage.

193
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,560
I'll take it, thank you.

194
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
Zeng Li, give me your suitcase.

195
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,600
I'll carry it myself.

196
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's go.

197
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,840
It's so heavy.

198
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,840
Is there any kind person
to help me out with it?

199
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,840
You're a grown up now.

200
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,120
It's time for you to face

201
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,800
this world on your own.

202
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,120
Deng Hao Ran,

203
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
you deserve to be hit.

204
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,159
Hello, sir.

205
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,680
Here are your room cards.

206
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,240
Thank you.

207
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,240
Come on, let's decide
the room distribution.

208
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,520
Act quickly if you want to
share the room with me.

209
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,000
Otherwise,

210
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
you'll lose the chance.

211
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,840
I'll share one with Mr. Ai.

212
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,040
Thank you.

213
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,520
The three of us will decide on our own.

214
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,280
So that leaves us with one another.

215
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,920
I've long heard about you.

216
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
Although we're meeting for the first time,

217
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,560
my instincts tell me

218
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,680
you're a born socialiser like me.

219
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,640
Your instincts are very accurate.

220
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,960
I'll be in your care tonight.

221
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,640
I am told that

222
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,000
if three girls go on a trip,

223
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,040
two of them will become

224
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,800
closer than before.

225
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,440
One of them is just there to
be with the rest of the group.

226
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,680
Who do you think

227
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,320
will be the one being left out?

228
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,600
The three of us are very close.

229
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,360
Don't sabotage our friendship.

230
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,680
I'm going to ditch you guys tonight.

231
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,600
I finally

232
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,320
have a free weekend.

233
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,680
I'm going to play games tonight.

234
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,960
You're on a skiing trip.

235
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,360
Why are you still thinking about gaming?

236
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,960
No matter where she is,

237
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,840
she'll only hear one voice.

238
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,720
It's been so long since we had hotpot.

239
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,799
It seems delicious.

240
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,120
Mr. Ai, try this

241
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,679
sour plum drink.

242
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,480
It's very nourishing.

243
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:36,960
Do you want some orange juice?

244
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:38,919
Thank you.

245
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,280
This is yours.

246
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,400
You're quite particular

247
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,880
to be drinking from a straw.

248
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,560
Without a straw,

249
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,120
her lipstick

250
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,080
is going to smear later.

251
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,680
I just experienced a breakup.

252
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,000
Do you have to treat me this way?

253
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,240
How did you know I was wearing lipstick?

254
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,040
It's obvious.

255
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,320
Peach colour.

256
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,240
Ma Yi Yi,

257
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,400
didn't you say

258
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,480
it's a nude colour of the no-makeup trend?

259
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,040
Wrong.

260
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,000
One more time.

261
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,200
Why are you so beautiful
even without makeup?

262
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,640
Yi Yi,

263
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,560
I suggest you to switch seats.

264
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,120
Otherwise,

265
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,760
you might get diabetes.

266
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,800
You, get up.

267
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,280
I don't think anyone among us

268
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,200
likes to eat spicy hotpot

269
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,880
more than Zeng Li.

270
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:24,880
Come on.

271
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,080
Her gums are having problems.

272
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,760
She shouldn't eat spicy food for now.

273
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,040
I've almost recovered.

274
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,640
It'll hurt tomorrow if
you eat a little now.

275
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,240
It should be fine to eat occasionally.

276
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,520
As a dentist,

277
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,400
I won't allow

278
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,080
this kind of thing to happen.

279
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,720
Just let her eat.

280
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,680
What's with you?

281
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,280
Aren't you two tired of it?

282
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,120
This guy

283
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,400
is telling me off just
because he's a dentist.

284
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,960
You can only eat the non-spicy version.

285
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
It's fine. Eat this.

286
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,000
I'll get it for you if there's
anything you want to eat.

287
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,320
Let's raise our glasses

288
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,440
to wish Dr. Wu

289
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,120
happy 27th birthday.

290
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,200
It's just a birthday.

291
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,120
Do you have to be so specific?

292
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,840
-It's the 18th.
-Okay.

293
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,720
All right.

294
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,280
In that case, let's wish Dr. Wu

295
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,960
a happy birthday.

296
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,840
Also,

297
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,800
here's

298
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,840
to this unusual group

299
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,800
being together again.

300
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,440
Indeed.

301
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,640
Come on, cheers.

302
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,600
Happy birthday. Cheers.

303
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,520
Between your uncle and Dr. Ai,

304
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,200
who will you choose?

305
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,280
Can I apply for membership

306
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,240
and choose both?

307
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,720
Happy birthday.

308
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,480
Have you finished eating?

309
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,000
We can finally go skiing.

310
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,720
I can't for now.

311
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,560
I'm going to stay in
the hotel for a while.

312
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,720
It seems the hotel's
Internet speed is not bad.

313
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
It's my favourite green colour.

314
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,320
I'll keep you company.

315
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:11,760
It's okay.

316
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,800
Ski with them.

317
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,600
You don't visit here often.

318
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,960
I'm a Malaysian.

319
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,360
I don't have that much interest in skiing.

320
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,000
It's exactly because you're a Malaysian,

321
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,800
all the more you should

322
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,600
cherish this chance.

323
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,440
Dr. Wu,

324
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,240
this Malaysian here

325
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
is only interested in you.

326
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,360
Of course he'll cherish even more

327
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,520
the chance to be alone with you.

328
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,480
Can't you just take the hint?

329
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,520
It think after the hotpot meal,

330
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,680
I've figured out

331
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,520
your relationship.

332
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,520
However, I feel

333
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,480
the uncle

334
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,160
doesn't know what's going on.

335
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,360
Not pointing out something you understand

336
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,800
is one of the most basic
moral standards in life.

337
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,280
Are you an immoral person?

338
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:42,680
Scram.

339
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,680
What?

340
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,080
Did I

341
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,600
miss anything?

342
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,280
Wait.

343
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,480
Your reactions are unusual.

344
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,440
Is something

345
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,680
going on between them?

346
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,480
-How is that possible?
-I'm not blind.

347
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,880
She doesn't have good taste in guys.

348
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,200
Something is happening.

349
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,440
Let's go.

350
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,840
How much is it?

351
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:01,800
It's fine.

352
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,720
Okay.

353
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,280
Come on, let's go.

354
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,920
Let's go.

355
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,040
We should pay our own expenses.

356
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,120
Set up a group to receive payment.

357
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,200
Why are all of you leaving?

358
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,120
It's fine.

359
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,640
Come on.

360
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,600
Pay up. Wait.

361
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,400
Xiao Chu,

362
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,560
did you bring GoPro?

363
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,960
That's great.

364
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,080
Later,

365
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,160
when Zeng Li and I have a match,

366
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,600
we'll trouble you

367
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,520
to take more pictures of her

368
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,000
and a few videos.

369
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,920
She's a show-off.

370
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,280
I'm not.

371
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,200
Really?

372
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,640
Come on.

373
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,880
Tell me.

374
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,800
Back when I taught you how to ski,

375
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,720
didn't you tell me

376
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,000
to take more pictures of you

377
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,640
as well as videos?

378
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,200
You didn't learn it properly.

379
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
[So, her skiing skills]

380
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,520
[were also taught by Yu Yi.]

381
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,200
How can you say that?

382
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,480
You agreed to bring me

383
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,160
to the advanced ski trails.

384
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,080
In the end, shortly after you brought me

385
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,800
to learn at intermediate ski trails,

386
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,680
you left for the U.S.

387
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,840
Luckily I taught myself how to ski.

388
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,760
I came back now

389
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,520
to make it up to you.

390
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,360
Do you want have a match with me?

391
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,760
Sure. Bring it on.

392
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,000
Mr. Ai,

393
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,240
this person is so arrogant.

394
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,600
Both of us should teach him a lesson.

395
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,120
You two will go ahead and have a match.

396
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,880
I'll be the cameraman.

397
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,080
Then, let's go.

398
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,160
Go, go, go!

399
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,760
I finally got to ski this year.

400
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,600
Go!

401
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,360
Forget it. I'm not going.

402
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,000
You can't. Come on.

403
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,200
Stop wasting time.

404
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
It's all your fault.

405
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,960
When I first skied two years ago,

406
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,440
you brought me to intermediate ski trails.

407
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,400
I ended up falling so many times.

408
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,680
I am still traumatised.

409
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,800
How was it my fault?

410
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,080
I suggested to go to
the advanced ski trails.

411
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,120
You said something about
making a compromise

412
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,640
and going to intermediate ski trails.

413
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,160
Did you say those words?

414
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,600
It was my first time skiing.

415
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,680
How could you let me ski alone?

416
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,720
Woman,

417
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,680
you'll just affect my sword-drawing speed.

418
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,080
You know what?

419
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
I must go to the advanced
ski trails today.

420
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,240
Don't worry.

421
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,440
I'll go with you to the
beginners' ski trails.

422
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:28,920
Forget it.

423
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,200
I'll be a burden wherever I go.

424
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:30,880
I...

425
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,840
I'll swim.

426
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,080
When did you learn to swim?

427
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,600
That's not the point.

428
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,480
The point is

429
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,800
I bought a really beautiful

430
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,520
bikini.

431
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,640
What's wrong with you?

432
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,400
What kind of person wears a bikini

433
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,640
to swim in a hotel?

434
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,840
It's up to me.

435
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,080

436
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,200

♫ Waiting for you ♫

466
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,120
Why are you skiing at such a high speed?

Here I come!

468
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,320

00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,000

Yu Yi!

474
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,840
Yu Yi!

475
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:32,960
Don't touch him.

476
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,360
Moving him will make his injuries

477
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,040
even more serious.

478
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,280
What should we do?

479
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
Yu Yi, can you hear me?

480
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,560
What should we do, Mr. Ai?

481
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,280
Yu Yi!

482
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,000
He's awake.

483
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,480
Mr. Ai, Yu Yi is awake.

484
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,160
How are you feeling?

485
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,280
My back hurts.

486
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,880
Your back hurts?

487
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,720
My legs feel a little numb.

488
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,240
His back and legs are a little numb.

489
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,600
He might've hurt his spine.

490
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,600
Will I become paralysed?

491
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,240
Paralysed?

492
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,360
No way.

493
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,080
Wait here.

494
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,320
I'll make a call.

495
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,000
What do I do?

496
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,760
There's no signal.

497
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,520
Yu Yi,

498
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,360
Which part hurts? Tell me.

499
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,160
Yu Yi!

500
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,680
Yu Yi!

501
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,720
Yu Yi!

502
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,480
Wake up, Yu Yi!

503
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Yu Yi, can you hear me?

504
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,760
Why is there no signal?

505
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,880
Yu Yi, answer me.

506
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,560
Yu Yi!

507
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,960
I was playing with you.

508
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,920
Look, I'm fine.

509
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
You're fine?

510
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:26,880
Yes.

511
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,720
You almost scared me to death.

512
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
It was a joke.

513
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,880
Come on, don't be angry.

514
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,480
Look.

515
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,480
I'm fine.

516
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Xiao Chu told me

517
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,880
there're some problems with my spine.

518
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,040
I just want to use it

519
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,080
to play a joke on you.

520
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:37,800
All right.

521
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,000
Don't cry.

522
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,720
Don't be angry if you're not crying,

523
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,280
okay?

524
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,640
Don't be angry.

525
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,360
I'm sorry.

526
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,520
I'm glad you're fine.

527
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,920
Go for another check up when we go back.

528
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,360
It's not too bad.

529
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,360
I'm fine.

530
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,800
She's really too adorable.

531
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,600
Before that, when I took
her on a rowing trip,

532
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,720
I fell into the water.

533
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,800
It was also a lie,

534
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,760
but she wouldn't stop crying.

535
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,000
It was really funny,

536
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,800
just like what's happening now.

537
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,840
I didn't cry.

538
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,640
How dare you say that.

539
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,760
It's filled with water.

540
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,680
You purposely threw those pails

541
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,320
into the water.

542
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,240
I really thought you fell into the water.

543
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,240
Look, isn't she really silly

544
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,280
and cute that way?

545
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,280
You're always saying you're 30 years old.

546
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,520
Why haven't you changed at all?

547
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Don't be angry.

548
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,440
Be careful.

549
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,440
Come in.

550
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,760
Why don't we play downstairs?

551
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,920
We'd better not.

552
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,640
If the two of them come back

553
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,440
and see me playing games,

554
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,640
they'll say a middle-aged lady like me

555
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,440
is always playing video games.

556
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,320
You are not a middle-aged lady.

557
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,480
You're like a younger sister.

558
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,800
Come on in.

559
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,920
It's not like I'm going to bite.

560
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,440
Come in.

561
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,160
Close the door.

562
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,720
You look

563
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,520
like an elementary school student

564
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,560
being scolded by your
disciplinary teacher.

565
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,320
This is my first time
entering a girl's room,

566
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,080
other than my sister's.

567
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,360
Then treat me as your sister.

568
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,400
Well,

569
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,240
that won't do.

570
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,840
You're different from my sister.

571
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:21,960
You're...

572
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,120
You're...

573
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,080
What am I?

574
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,520
You're one whom I'll marry in the future.

575
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,160
Come over.

576
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,320
What do you mean?

577
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,600
I bought you a new phone.

578
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,120
Also, you can have this bank card.

579
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,230
Two months ago,

580
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,200
you were grumbling about
switching mobile phones.

581
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,960
You still haven't bought one.

582
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,560
All the money was spent
on buying the bag, right?

583
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,840
There's a balance of over RMB1,000.

584
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,080
The password is your birthday.

585
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,200
Didn't I throw away the receipt?

586
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,440
How did you return it?

587
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,440
There're only two Chanel
boutiques in Donghu.

588
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
One of them is near Donghu University

589
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,960
and the other is over 20 kilometres away.

590
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,800
It wasn't difficult to check

591
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,440
the purchase record.

592
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
I finally

593
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,360
bought you a gift.

594
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,440
How could you return it?

595
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,080
That's how I'm

596
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,920
different from others.

597
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,960
Other girls

598
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,760
like branded bags.

599
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,440
As for me,

600
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,760
I like stars.

601
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,240
It's the new gaming season.

602
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,600
I want you to use your mobile phone

603
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,960
to play Honour of Kings with me.

604
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,920
I don't need a new mobile phone.

605
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,040
Even with my old mobile phone, I can still

606
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,960
guide you in Honour of Kings.

607
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,560
Later, we'll return it

608
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,800
and buy the bag for you again.

609
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,600
I threw away the receipt.

610
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,120
Then I'll go to the store to check

611
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,160
the purchase record.

612
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,640
Sorry.

613
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,160
I bought it online.

614
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,600
It can't be returned
if it's bought online.

615
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,800
Deng Hao Ran, what are you doing?

616
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,120
What do you mean?

617
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,000
Shouldn't you be skiing?

618
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
Why are you sitting here?

619
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,000
Look what's going on over there.

620
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,720
My sister,

621
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,480
Yu Yi

622
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,520
and Ai Jing Chu

623
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,400
is a classic love triangle.

624
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,560
If I go over,

625
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
won't I feel embarrassed?

626
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,560
What's wrong?

627
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,600
Do you think

628
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,520
you're welcomed here?

629
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,440
I don't care.

630
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,960
I wonder who said this.

631
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,560
"This week, I'm your debtor

632
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,280
and so on and so forth."

633
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,160
Didn't you say that?

634
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,320
Fine.

635
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,320
Lie down.

636
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,040
Get up. Let's swim.

637
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,200
I don't know how to swim.

638
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,040
I don't know how to.

639
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,040
One more round.

640
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,320
Stop splashing water.

641
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,960
Let's go.

642
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,240
Keep going.

643
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,160
Come on, one more round.

644
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,600
No more.

645
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,440
The last round.

646
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,680
Well,

647
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,520
did they

648
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,680
sense anything?

649
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,680
It doesn't matter.

650
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,040
We broke up so long ago.

651
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,880
It's fine.

652
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,320
Of course it's fine with you.

653
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm so beautiful.

654
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,080
If they find out,

655
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,560
they're going to say,

656
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,040
"You must've been blind.

657
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,600
What did you see in him?"

658
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,880
I was the one who was blind.

659
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,600
Besides,

660
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,520
my sister is definitely on my side.

661
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,400
She'll definitely feel that

662
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,240
her brother is too good for you.

663
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,040
Luckily I was blind for a while

664
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,960
instead of forever.

665
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,840
I came to my senses just in time.

666
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,040
I came to my sense

667
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,120
very quickly, okay?

668
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,800
I broke up with you.

669
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,560
I broke up with you.

670
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,760
Deng Hao Ran,

671
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,640
do you still have feelings for me?

672
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Why do

673
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
all your girlfriends after that

674
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,160
resemble me?

675
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,680
Ma Yi Yi,

676
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,680
why do I feel that

677
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,880
you're still thinking about me?

678
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,320
After all,

679
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,680
none of your boyfriends after that

680
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,520
is as good as me.

681
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,120
One is worse than the other.

682
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,030
I...

683
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,200
There's no way I'm still thinking of you.

684
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,960
There's no way I'm still thinking of you.

685
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,920
No way.

686
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,960
You're thinking of me.

687
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:40,960
You're so annoying!

688
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,680
You're so annoying!

689
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,840
Yi Yi,

690
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,720
where's your mysterious boyfriend?

691
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,960
You've been keeping him
as a secret for so long.

692
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,560
Oh, right.

693
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,360
We'll also be exchanging gifts,

694
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,160
right?

695
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:58,960
Ma Yi Yi,

696
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,840
yours is cooked.

697
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,080
Come on, hurry.

698
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,960
It'll be overcooked later.

699
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,920
Let's take a photo.

700
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,320
I'm going to take a group selfie.

701
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,600
Three, two, one!

702
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,840
Stop taking. Eat.

703
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,880
I'm not good with my chopsticks.

704
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,720
What are you doing?

705
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,840
No.

706
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,320
We finally secured a series A round.

707
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,080
Didn't we agree to drink
to our hearts' content?

708
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,840
Yes.

709
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,640
Isn't this...

710
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,880
I can't drink anymore.

711
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,200
I'm going to be drunk if I keep drinking.

712
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,560
My girlfriend's class will be over soon.

713
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,320
I have to pick her up.

714
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,440
Come on.

715
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,800
Didn't you and Ma Yi Yi

716
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,200
already break up?

717
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,600
We broke up.

718
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,520
[Ma Yi Yi, I'm so happy tonight.]

719
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,000
[Deng Hao Ran, you're bad.]

720
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,080
[We broke up]

721
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,560
[and you really stopped talking to me.]

722
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:13,960
[Ma Yi Yi, I'm so happy tonight.]

723
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,640
[Ma Yi Yi,]

724
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,480
[when you broke up]

725
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,040
[with someone unreliable like me,]

726
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,560
[you'll finally be happy.]

727
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,920
[Do you honestly]

728
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,320
[not care about me anymore?]

729
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,400
Should I save you or not?

730
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,040
You're really charming!

731
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,000
Deng Hao Ran,

732
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,160
why do I feel so happy
when I play with you?

733
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,760
I won again.

734
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,440
Deng Hao Ran,

735
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,400
you're really useless!

736
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,240
Look, this is not bad.

737
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,560
Seems great.

738
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,480
Zeng Li!

739
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,880
Come on, let's give it a try.

740
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:09,640
Coming.

741
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,840
Let's play a game.

742
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,760
Sure.

743
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,640
Wait a second.

744
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,120
Have you played this game before?

745
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,480
I ever.

746
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,840
When I was abroad,

747
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,400
I heard it's Never Have I Ever.

748
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,160
It's improvised in China.

749
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,720
Let me tell you the game's rules.

750
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,600
Sure.

751
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,960
For example, I'll suggest an action.

752
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,400
If you've done it before,

753
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,640
you'll raise your hand with me.

754
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,760
The rest who have never done it

755
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,360
will have to drink

756
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,800
and the two of us won't have to.

757
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,960
If I'm the only one

758
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,840
who raise my hand

759
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,480
and all of you have never done it,

760
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,400
I'll need to drink.

761
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,000
The rules are very simple, right?

762
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,000
Let's begin.

763
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:41,720
You two,

764
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,800
we're playing a game.

765
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay.

766
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
We're not playing anymore. We'll stop.

767
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm leaving the game.

768
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,800
I'll start.

769
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,080
I read a book,

770
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,280
The Commuter Pig Keeper.

771
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,160
Girl, are you going to keep pigs?

772
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,200
That's not it.

773
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,480
Sister,

774
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,320
you'll end up drinking.

775
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,720
Who will read this kind of book?

776
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,280
Don't be so sure about that.

777
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,560
You've read it before?

778
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,800
I have.

779
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,200
Are you still reading

780
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,320
two hours a day?

781
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:13,880
Of course.

782
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,800
Has Mr. Ai been this disciplined

783
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,640
since his university days?

784
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,400
I have to learn from you.

785
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,040
Come on, drink.

786
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,640
Drink.

787
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,400
Let's raise our glasses

788
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,640
to the future pig farm owner!

789
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,200
Come on, cheers.

790
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,760
To the future pig farm owner.

791
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,320
My turn.

792
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
I stayed up until 3am

793
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,120
to play games.

794
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,120
You're so admirable.

795
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,840
What game did you play?

796
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,600
Monopoly.

797
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,280
You go to bed on time.

798
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
Why did you raise your hand?

799
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,360
Which day was it?

800
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,840
Why do you always play on your own

801
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,960
and never ask me to join?

802
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,000
Take a look

803
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,760
at this fake friendship.

804
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,520
It's none of your business.

805
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,200
It's none of your business.

806
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:52,800
All right, that's enough.

807
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,320
I lost. I'll drink.

808
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,200
Okay. That's enough.

809
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,480
Stop drinking.

810
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,200
Come on, wipe your mouth.

811
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,960
So it's my turn, right?

812
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,840
Let me think.

813
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,840
The person I like is here with us today.

814
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,560
Can you say something

815
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,360
we don't know?

816
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,160
That's really lame, you know?

817
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,360
We're playing

818
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,360
I ever.

819
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,880
You can say something like

820
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,360
the person you once liked
is here with us today.

821
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,040
Let me think.

822
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,920
So, be it in the past,

823
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:25,840
now

824
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,280
and future,

825
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,040
I'm in love with this person.

826
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm going to vomit.

827
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,720
I'm going to vomit.

828
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,880
I'm going to vomit.

829
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,120
Why am I the only one raising my hand?

830
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,200
Is no one else going
to raise his or her hand?

831
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,240
I raised mine.

832
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,480
The love rival has taken actions.

833
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,600
You can't lose to him.

834
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,160
Zeng Li,

835
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,240
if you once liked this person,

836
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,240
it also counts.

837
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:09,880
You...

838
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,240
Deng Hao Ran,

839
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,560
aren't you going to raise your hand?

840
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,120
I...

841
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,560
Why should I?

842
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
This afternoon,

843
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,680
when we were having hotpot,

844
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,800
didn't you say

845
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,280
I was your debtor for a week,

846
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,880
and you'd be in love with me for a week,

847
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,000
right?

848
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,840
Fine.

849
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,840
You'll have to raise yours as well.

850
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,880
I have to be in love with you.

851
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,720
Can't you just

852
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,680
be in love with me
even if it's pretending?

853
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,880
That's not convincing at all.

854
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,400
You...

855
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,840
You finally admit that
you're in love with me?

856
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,560
No.

857
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,040
I like Deng Hao Ran.

858
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,600
What?

859
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,040
Impossible. You...

860
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,280
You...

861
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,720
He's not the type of man you like.

862
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,920
What's wrong with my type?

863
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,270
I...

864
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,520
I'm rich.

865
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,030
What time is it now?

866
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:06,920
Talent.

867
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,350
Dr. Ai,

868
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,720
everyone else has raised his or her hand.

869
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,560
You have to drink.

870
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,080
Drink.

871
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,080
He's drunk.

872
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,840
Mobile phone.

873
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,280
Take a photo.

874
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:02,600
Take his photo.

875
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,280
Take his photo.

876
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,920
Take a video.

877
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,720
From here. Take it from below.

878
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,000
Where?

879
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,080
Take it from below.

880
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,320
That's a good angle.

881
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,840
That's right.

882
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,400
Should we be taking a video
of him when he's drunk?

883
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,160
Yu Yi,

884
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,840
flick his double chin.

885
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
You have to film this from below.

886
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,720
Goodness.

887
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,920
Why did he have so many drinks
if he had low alcohol tolerance?

888
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,240
I'll get going.

889
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:27,960
Don't worry.

890
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,280
Mr. Ai.

891
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,240
Wake up.

892
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,520
Mr. Ai.

893
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,800
Stop pretending. He's gone.

894
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,040
Who did you raise your hand for?

895
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,440
Mr. Ai.

896
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,280
You finally figured it out.

897
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,760
No.

898
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,280
My mind was a mess just now.

899
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,640
So I raised my hand with everyone else.

900
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,040
I really wanted to see

901
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,840
Mr. Ai's reaction

902
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,480
and whether he'd overthink

903
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,520
or get jealous.

904
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,680
I only realised then

905
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,800
that the person I liked

906
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,120
was Mr. Ai.

907
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,080
That's right.

908
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,440
Just now, Mr. Ai

909
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,560
also raised his hand for you.

910
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,880
He was probably drunk.

911
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,520
Look.

912
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,000
He passed out right after
he raised his hand.

913
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,560
I think he was pretending.

914
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,680
Think about it.

915
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,120
Just now, Yu Yi was also present.

916
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,600
It'll be awkward between the two of them.

917
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,280
No way.

918
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,800
Mr. Ai doesn't seem

919
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,640
to be that type of person.

920
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,880
Do you think

921
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,520
he's capable of doing the stuff

922
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,800
he did for you in the past?

923
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,320
Do you mean he also likes me?

924
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,200
Of course.

925
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,640
The way Mr. Ai looks at you

926
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,800
is a man who's hopelessly in love.

927
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,440
That's how he looks like.

928
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,560
Are you going to keep laughing now?

929
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,360
Laugh all you want.

930
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,360
I'm going to take a bath.

931
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,320
I'm going to take a bath.

932
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,360
It seems you're not going to
stop laughing anytime soon.

933
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:09,840
Unexpectedly, Mr. Ai,

934
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,240
you're quite cunning

935
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
during critical moments.

936
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
I'm really a little drunk.

937
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,080
Really?

938
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
You should have raised your hand earlier.

939
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Look at Sister Zeng Li.

940
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,920
She's a female,

941
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,440
yet she raised her hand
earlier than you did.

942
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,640
Well,

943
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,000
what if she raised her hand

944
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,720
because of Yu Yi?

945
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,520
Are you jealous?

946
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:35,680
No.

947
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,080
You're still denying.

948
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,160
You refused to raise your hand

949
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,680
because you thought

950
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,560
Sister Zeng Li did so

951
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,640
because of Yu Yi, right?

952
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,160
No.

953
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,920
Yu Yi is a good friend of mine.

954
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,600
Zeng Li got to know him earlier.

955
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,000
There's no reason for me to be jealous.

956
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,760
Nor should I be jealous.

957
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,400
Mr. Ai,

958
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,840
just face your own feelings

959
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
with honesty.

960
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:02,520
Yes,

961
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,360
you're close to Yu Yi.

962
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,480
However,

963
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,400
if Sister Zeng Li likes

964
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,640
you,

965
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,800
it will be meaningless

966
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,000
for you to give in.

967
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,760
What if

968
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,360
Zeng Li likes him?

969
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,160
It's just a speculation.

970
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,400
If my best friends

971
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,680
and I

972
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,080
fell in love with the same woman,

973
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,080
I'd tell him honestly

974
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,600
instead of keeping it myself.

975
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,760
Let the girl choose.

976
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,200
This way, no matter what the outcome is,

977
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,360
at least it's fair

978
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,080
for everyone.

979
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,840
Wu Ying, are you asleep?

980
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,640
Wait!

981
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,480
[It's the easiest to get her to
confess her feelings in this state.]

982
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,200
[I must help Mr. Ai]

983
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:54,840
[to get an answer.]

984
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,480
[Who does Sister Zeng Li like?]

985
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,000
I'd been waiting for you.

986
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,080
You're finally here.

987
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,040
Were you waiting for me?

988
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,040
You've had so many drinks.

989
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,240
Why are you still playing games?

990
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,320
They scolded me.

991
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,120
Who scolded you?

992
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,280
My teammates.

993
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,640
They said I kept taking
others' heads in the game.

994
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,760
Look.

995
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,240
You're drunk.

996
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,520
Come on, go to bed.

997
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,680
I'm not drunk.

998
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,360
Why is the door of Mr. Ai's room

999
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,680
opened?

1000
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,080
Mr. Ai. Liu Yu Cheng.

1001
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,920
Are you asleep?

1002
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,159
Liu Yu Cheng,

1003
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,199
are you asleep?

1004
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,400
Why didn't these two close
their door before they sleep?

1005
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,320
Did they leave their room?

1006
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,080
They're really drunk

1007
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,080
to have left their door open.

1008
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,159
Liu Yu Cheng

1009
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,560
only thinks about Wu Ying.

1010
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,840
He doesn't even have the time

1011
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,400
to tuck you in.

1012
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,960
You only know how to
criticise me everyday.

1013
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,040
You're also the same,

1014
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,160
going to sleep without
brushing your teeth.

1015
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,080
Let me turn off the lights for you.

1016
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,120
I just wanted to

1017
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,080
turn off the lights for you.
