00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,120
[that love]

191
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,220
[Zeng Li: Sunset]

192
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,560
[isn't so trivial after all.]

193
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,100
[Ai Jing Chu: Sunrise]

194
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,520
[All the gentleness in the world]

195
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,240
[makes me think of him.]

196
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,560
[Each of us]

197
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,000
[is trying to live well in this world,]

198
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,440
[just like]

199
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,800
[the insignificant dust.]

200
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
[I'm no different.]

201
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,400
[It's just]

202
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,320
[that because of his existence]

203
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,760
[there's another universe]

204
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,320
[in my life.]

205
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,520
[I'm just a speck of dust in this world.]

206
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,480
[I'm just so fortunate]

207
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,200
[to have met you.]

208
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,060
[Half a year later]

209
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,840
Do you still remember

210
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
that we promise each other

211
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,800
that if

212
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,840
we're still not married

213
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,080
when we're 60,

214
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,880
we'll spend the rest of our lives

215
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,040
in a nursing home.

216
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,600
We didn't expect Ma Yi Yi

217
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,080
would end up with Deng Hao Ran.

218
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,520
Ma Yi Yi

219
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,200
is with Deng Hao Ran.

220
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,720
You're the most awesome among us.

221
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,880
You're the oldest yet your
husband is the youngest.

222
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,680
Do you envy me?

223
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,760
Do you want swap?

224
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,720
Are you interested?

225
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Count me out.

226
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,880
Even if Mr. Ai is hot,

227
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,560
he only

228
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,840
has eyes for me.

229
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,480
You can consider her suggestion.

230
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:31,960
No, thanks.

231
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,920
Deng Hao Ran and I

232
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,480
are a perfect match.

233
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,120
I heard someone talking behind my back.

234
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,720
Was that you?

235
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,120
No.

236
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,440
No?

237
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,200
You're ruining my makeup.

238
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
That's what I want.

239
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,200
I want you

240
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,080
to go through this
major event in your life

241
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,760
without a beautiful face.

242
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,680
Can we swap our partners?

243
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,520
-I regret it now.
-Too late.

244
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,760
No.

245
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,160
No one can win my love

246
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,040
except Wu Ying.

247
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,800
The wedding is going to start.

248
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,680
Please have your seats.

249
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,760
Do you get what he means?

250
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,840
From now on,

251
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,120
your best friends

252
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
will hand you to me.

253
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,360
Let's go.

254
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,440
Am I pretty?

255
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,440
Not too bad.

256
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,920
What do you mean?

257
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,360
Why are you standing there?

258
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,560
You're not the bride.

259
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,400
Come on.

260
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,360
Let me fix your fringes.

261
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,800
I got it.

262
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,400
Coming.

263
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,680
It's better this way.

264
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,280
-Just leave it at that.
-Fine.

265
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,480
You're stepping on my dress.

266
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,280
Watch your stomach.

267
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,680
[Wu Ying told me]

268
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,320
[that Liu Yu Cheng is fine with anything]

269
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,760
[about kids,]

270
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,680
[so long as]

271
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,320
So long as

272
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,080
[it's her decision.]

273
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,720
it's your decision.

274
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,280
So,

275
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,360
when you find someone

276
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,760
who loves you unconditionally,

277
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,840
you'll be willing

278
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,120
to do anything for him

279
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,960
[Be happy]

280
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,840
[and blessed forever,]

281
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,280
[our girl.]

282
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,560
All guests are here.

283
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,960
Please be seated.

284
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Bride and groom, if you have anything

285
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,320
to tell each other,

286
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
you may do so now.

287
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,320
I'm so excited today,

288
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,480
more so than the time

289
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,680
we were at the hot spring resort.

290
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,680
That day,

291
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,440
you agreed to be with me.

292
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,720
Today,

293
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,960
you acknowledge that you can trust me.

294
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,280
Wu Ying,

295
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,120
I know

296
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,640
you've wanting to protect me.

297
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
You haven't been giving me trouble

298
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,680
and forcing me

299
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,160
to grow up through reality.

300
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
I'm truly

301
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,200
grateful to you.

302
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,160
I appreciate it for allowing me

303
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,240
to be a naive person always.

304
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,960
I also appreciate

305
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,320
your boldness

306
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,240
and willingness

307
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,360
to let me

308
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,720
take care

309
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,760
of you and the kid.

310
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:17,960
Wu Ying.

311
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,120
I'll never let you down.

312
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,640
I love you.

313
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:32,800
What?

314
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,200
I love you, Liu Yu Cheng!

315
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,920
What's wrong with you?

316
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,240
Why can't you stop crying?

317
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,640
Are you getting older?

318
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,560
Do you feel like getting married?

319
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,760
Why don't we

320
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,720
tie the knot, too?

321
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,440
No.

322
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,720
Why?

323
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,080
When I was 22 years old,

324
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,400
I planned to get married at 26.

325
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,120
Now I'm 27.

326
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,960
I just think...

327
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,160
What do you think?

328
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,280
A marriage may bring

329
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,840
love to another level.

330
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,480
However, not every relationship

331
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,320
should lead to a marriage.

332
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,720
Back then, I didn't have
a sense of security.

333
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,400
So I wanted to use marriage

334
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,280
as a bargaining chip

335
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,920
to bind my other half to me.

336
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,240
However, I'm different now.

337
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,680
So,

338
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,680
the current Ms. Ma

339
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,680
is independent

340
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,200
and not relying on anyone.

341
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,240
I'm sure about my feelings for you

342
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,960
and I trust you're the same, too.

343
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Sometimes,

344
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,760
there's nothing to prove.

345
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,880
We just have to live in the moment.

346
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,040
Perhaps we may

347
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,960
last longer that way.

348
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,120
I think we should just seize the moment.

349
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,280
-You've put on makeup, right?
-Yes, I do.

350
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,160
No.

351
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,520
I've put on makeup.

352
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,119
You're dead.

353
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,680
Are you upset?

354
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,440
Where's Mr. Ai?

355
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,040
You're dead.

356
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,720
Nothing

357
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,640
can cheer her up today.

358
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,160
Stop bothering me.

359
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Hello, Mr. Ai.

360
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,560
Are you all right?

361
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,760
Why are you looking a little sad?

362
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,960
When will you be back?

363
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,280
I'm sorry.

364
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,160
Just look at them.

365
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,400
They're all in pairs.

366
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,120
I'm lonely.

367
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,040
I was even bullied.

368
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,480
Deng Hao Ran!

369
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,480
How dare you do that to my girlfriend.

370
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
You'll be dead when I return.

371
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,040
My job over here

372
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,920
is going to be over soon.

373
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,400
I'll be here

374
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,440
for a week or two

375
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,120
before I return.

376
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:28,720
Okay.

377
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,120
I'll wait for you.

378
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,560
I'll take my annual leave

379
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,760
once I return.

380
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,600

should be valued...

573
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,320
and cherished the most.

When I took her shopping,

600
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,840
we straightaway

601
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,080
bought a pair of rings at a mall.

602
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,440
Back then, I wasn't sure

603
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,920
if she would put on the ring.

604
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,600
I was worried

605
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,680
she might

606
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,600
refuse.

607
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,880
I just went ahead and bought them.

608
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,800
Anyway, I put it on first.

609
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,920
She didn't turn me down.

639
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,720
However, he has double eyelids.

640

like you had face blinder
or whatever. There's a term.
