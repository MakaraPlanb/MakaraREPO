00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,440
Over here.

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,680
She isn't picking up my call.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,000
You're reaching home.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,280
Mr. Ai, where are we going?

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
Our house is over there.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,120
A bug.

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,120
We're going home.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,040
We're home.

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,080
Zeng Li?

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's go in.

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,840
Zeng Li!

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,000
Aunt.

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,840
Zeng Li, where have you been?

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,840
I called you so many times.

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,520
You didn't pick up.

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,200
You...

21
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,360
Have you been drinking?

22
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,160
Mother.

23
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,520
Mother, why didn't you come earlier?

24
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,050
Don't be afraid.

25
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,120
I am here.

26
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,280
Aunt, let me explain.

27
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,160
Just now...

28
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,880
Has Dr. Ai been

29
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,440
getting you drunk?

30
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,160
No, I did not.

31
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,160
How dare you take her home.

32
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,050
Don't be afraid.

33
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,730
I'll protect you.

34
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,880
An argument is so upsetting.

35
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,690
Keeping it in is so upsetting, too.

36
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,410
Mother.

37
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,680
Who did you argue with?

38
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,440
Someone I love.

39
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,039
Who is it?

40
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,680
I haven't

41
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,320
told you yet.

42
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,600
I fell in love with somebody.

43
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,090
Who is it?

44
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,800
It's him.

45
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,090
I have a boyfriend.

46
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,009
Him?

47
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,039
You said he was...

[Sweet Teeth]
[Episode 21]

49
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,090
A relationship is like

50
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,130
boiling a frog.

51
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,570
It's boiled slowly

52
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,800
and gradually.

53
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,370
How do animals

54
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,320
express love?

55
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,520
Let's take lions for instance.

56
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:19,720
Lions...

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,680
Shut it off.

58
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,490
I want silence.

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,050
All right.

60
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,240
I hadn't been to Donghu in half a month.

61
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,610
My daughter got injured,

62
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,650
fell in love

63
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,520
and moved out.

64
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,120
It's temporary.

65
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,520
I had no idea.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,680
Aunt.

67
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,240
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
I should have informed you.

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,560
Since you're now

70
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,770
my daughter's boyfriend,

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,210
there are some things

72
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,890
I must figure out.

73
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,720
Please go ahead.

74
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,400
The first time I brought

75
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,370
Zeng Li to get her teeth fixed,

76
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,400
I saw you fooling around

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,120
with a lady at the entrance.

78
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,450
What was going on?

79
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,720
Aunt, who are you referring to?

80
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,050
There's more than one girl?

81
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,120
No.

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
One of the girls

83
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,650
is working part-time at Zeng Li's

84
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,400
coffee house.

85
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,680
She's dating one of my colleagues.

86
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,000
She tends to ask me to deliver a message

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,960
when they are not on good terms.

88
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,720
Some of them are my patients.

89
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,890
They probably

90
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,370
wanted to get to know me

91
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,000
because I was single then.

92
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,329
It seems

93
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,450
you have a habit of making your patients

94
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,240
your girlfriends.

95
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:26,890
No.

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,930
Zeng Li is the first.

97
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,800
Before this,

98
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,890
how many girlfriends have you had?

99
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,840
Zeng Li is my first girlfriend.

100
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,000
Aunt.

101
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,050
Zeng Li and I are very similar.

102
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,120
We were waiting for someone special.

103
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,170
After meeting her,

104
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,210
I came to realise

105
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,170
she's the one I'd been waiting for.

106
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,000
By the way, aunt,

107
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,490
may I

108
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,450
ask you a question?

109
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,280
Go ahead.

110
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,050
Where would you like to go?

111
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,650
When we got into the car,

112
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,770
I asked you, but you didn't answer me.

113
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,120
I'm driving around aimlessly right now.

114
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,240
Herui Hotel.

115
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,930
I just reserved a room.

116
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,770
Stupid guy.

117
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,770
What does your mother usually

118
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,040
call your father?

119
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,040
Stupid guy.

120
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,570
Stupid guy.

121
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,090
Hurry up and eat.

122
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,770
Laugh if you want.

123
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,920
Why are you holding it in?

124
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,890
It seems you had

125
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,010
a disagreement with uncle.

126
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,250
No matter how old a woman gets,

127
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,650
she would like her other-half to coax her.

128
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,520
In an argument,

129
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,250
it's never about what's right or wrong.

130
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,570
It is to learn

131
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,480
how important I am

132
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,090
to him.

133
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,159
I understand.

134
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,450
I promise you

135
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,690
that no matter right or wrong,

136
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,130
I'll always be the one

137
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,480
to apologise first.

138
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,210
She can't even sleep properly.

139
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,250
Watch your head.

140
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,520
Sleep properly.

141
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,770
Good night.

142
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,890
Ma Yi Yi.

143
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,330
Do not take my phone.

144
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,450
Mr. Ai is replying to me soon.

145
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,770
Are you afraid that I'll ignore you?

146
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,210
From now on,

147
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,010
if we ever get into a fight again,

148
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
I'll be the first to apologise,

149
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,520
all right?

150
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,570
I was awesome.

151
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,159
I was able to get home on
my own even I was drunk.

152
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,690
Where's my phone?

153
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,650
Watch out.

154
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:15,650
Be careful.

155
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,480

It'll sound like I'm concerned.

I just finished 20 pages
and there are another 20.

Huge companies sure are different.

175
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,010
A simple term like "force majeure"

176
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,840

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
[Did she go or not?]

196
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:58,300
[Chris]

197
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,810
Moments.

198
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,360
Ten public posts.

199
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,210
What an attention seeker.

200
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,450
Whose hand is this?

201
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,720
It's so tanned.

202
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,900
[Ma Yi Yi: Gosh, my tummy.]

203
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,760
Ma Yi Yi.

204
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,760
How dare she told me she went home.

205
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,120
It's wrong.

206
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,720
I'm infected

207
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,000
by Ma Yi Yi's insanity.

208
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,530
No way.

209
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,240
I can't do this.

210
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,810
What's going on?

211
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,100
[Li Li]

212
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:37,960
Hello.

213
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,090
What are you up to?

214
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,760
Nothing.

215
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,690
What do you mean nothing?

216
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,290
Nothing means nothing.

217
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,530
I have two tickets

218
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,720
to Lover-in-Waiting premier tonight.

219
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,640
Would you like to come?

220
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,410
Sure. What time is it?

221
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,000
That's fast.

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,290
We're just meeting casually

223
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:55,880
over dinner

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,810
and red wine.

225
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,960
What's the big deal?

226
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,570
Nobody is drinking red wine with you.

227
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,600
Mr. Ai.

228
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,290
What are you doing here?

229
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,050
What's wrong?

230
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,530
Have you lost your memory
after taking advantage of me?

231
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,640
I did not take advantage of you.

232
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,090
I did not take advantage of anyone.

233
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,570
Who else are you trying to take advantage of?

234
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:44,600
Wait.

235
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,530
You're messing with me.

236
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,640
We're

237
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,720
fully dressed.

238
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,050
I did not take advantage of you.

239
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:51,480
Hold on.

240
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,640
I haven't forgiven you.

241
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,690
Who are you trying to fool?

242
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,760
I don't want to talk to you right now.

243
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,450
Get out.

244
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,090
This is my room.

245
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,450
I'll leave then.

246
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,570
Do you know what you said

247
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,360
last night?

248
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,690
What did I say?

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You said

250
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,600
if we ever argued again,

251
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,480
you'd apologise first.

252
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:14,760
I...

253
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,840
That's impossible.

254
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,760
I'd never comply easily.

255
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,290
I

256
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,840
was drunk.

257
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,570
It's not valid.

258
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,570
Look.

259
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Our relationship

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,600
began from

261
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,720
6.21pm yesterday.

262
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,900
[Ai Jing Chu: I'm working overtime today.
I can't pick you up. Get home safely.]

263
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,780
[Zeng Li: It's fine. I'm not going
back to your home ever again.]

264
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,480
The things one say when he or she is drunk

265
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,410
aren't valid.

266
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,170
Last night when you were drunk,

267
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,170
you told me

268
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,330
you liked me.

269
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,360
You liked me very much.

270
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,170
Is it not true?

271
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,530
Mr. Ai.

272
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,120
Do you have any idea how much I like you?

273
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,530
All right.

274
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,880
No, I'm clinging onto you.

275
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,210
I want to have babies with you.

276
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,210
Let's have four kids.

277
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,210
The first one

278
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,240
will become a doctor.

279
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,240
You said you wanted

280
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,360
to have four kids with me.

281
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,360
One of them shall be a scientist.

282
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Another will be a doctor.

283
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,690
The other one...

284
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,050
I did not say that.

285
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,050
Stop talking.

286
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,000
I did not.

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,840
I was drunk.

288
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,640
Stop talking.

289
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,640
However, you have your principles.

290
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,050
No matter how drunk you were,

291
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,360
you did not apologise.

292
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,410
Come on.

293
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:20,880
Zeng Li.

294
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,170
If we ever argue again,

295
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,640
no matter who is right or wrong,

296
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,930
I'll be the first to yield.

297
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,480
I'll be the first to apologise.

298
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,810
I will not make you wait

299
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,600
nor make you sad.

300
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,170
Really?

301
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,000
Of course.

302
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,570
I made a promise to
your mother last night.

303
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,450
What would you like to eat?

304
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,810
Wait a second.

305
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,170
My mother?

306
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:55,880
My mother came last night?

307
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,640
Did you

308
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:58,690
forget about that as well?

309
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,720
Hello, mother.

310
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,120
Mr. Ai told me

311
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,170
you came looking for me last night.

312
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,600
You're back at Henggang already?

313
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:06,880
Okay.

314
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,690
Aren't you guys hungry?

315
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,240
We don't have an appetite.

316
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,930
We're aggravated.

317
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,410
Your mother-in-law came by last night

318
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,330
and you did not invite her in.

319
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,930
You even sent her off in
the middle of the night.

320
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,600
If I was Zeng Li's mother,

321
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,690
I would never allow my daughter

322
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,330
to marry you.

323
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,880
Your aunt is right.

324
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,210
Grandfather, you're responsible, too.

325
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,600
You should have reminded him

326
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,960
to invite her mother in

327
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,810
and greet her.

328
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,690
The child may be ignorant,

329
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,760
but you're worse.

330
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,690
Why are you criticising me?

331
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,090
Zeng Li, join us.

332
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:35,840
Take a seat.

333
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,090
Okay.

334
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:36,760
What's the matter?

335
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,450
Zeng Li.

336
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,120
Is your mother mad?

337
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,450
Not at all.

338
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,240
Don't worry.

339
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,330
After breakfast,

340
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,120
his grandfather and I
will visit your mother

341
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,410
to apologise to her.

342
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,880
It's fine.

343
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,120
No, it's necessary.

344
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,170
Stop eating.

345
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,840
Head out

346
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,640
to buy some gifts.

347
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,930
It's unnecessary.

348
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,480
My mother returned to Henggang

349
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,290
with her colleague.

350
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,720
Mr. Ai,

351
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,450
what did you say to my mother?

352
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,690
She's not mad at all.

353
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,000
It probably has nothing
to do with what I said.

354
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,720
What could it possibly be?

355
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,530
Maybe it's because

356
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,570
I'm good-looking.

357
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,720
Good-looking?

358
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,530
Let me take a good look.

359
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:24,930
I'm here.

360
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,050
Look.

361
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,000
His head

362
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,240
is made of titanium alloy.

363
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,120
His head

364
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,720
is made of titanium alloy.

365
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,330
Eat your food.

366
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,360
Here.

367
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,450
Let's eat.

368
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,840
Zeng Li, you should eat more.

369
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,090
Mr. Ai.

370
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,120
If we ever argue again,

371
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,290
if I'm in the wrong,

372
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,570
I'll apologise first.

373
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,640
Even if you're in the wrong,

374
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,290
I'll pamper you.

375
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,090
That's not right.

376
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,290
Look.

377
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,930
When we're in a relationship,

378
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,720
there aren't

379
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:59,810
only happy moments.

380
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,210
There are times when we'll disagree

381
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,000
and clash.

382
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,120
No matter what,

383
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,170
I just want to spoil you.

384
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,000
She clearly went on a date

385
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,720
with Chris.

386
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,720
Why would she lie to me?

387
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:33,690
Yes.

388
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,640
Why would Ma Yi Yi lie?

389
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,810
Does she

390
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,330
still like me?

391
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,810
If she has feelings for me,

392
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,450
why would she go on a date

393
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,090
with Chris?

394
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,720
Deng Hao Ran.

395
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,120
Be normal.

396
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,480
Who cares if she went on a date?

397
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,530
You're going on a date

398
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,120
and catching a movie as well.

399
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:51,760
Nobody cares.

400
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,600
How dare she go on a date

401
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,760
with Chris when she has feelings for me?

402
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,120
Ma Yi Yi.

403
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,690
You sure are impressive.

404
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,410
I am told that after Wu Ying

405
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,330
called you a child,

406
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,000
you threw a tantrum and
stopped talking to her.

407
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:19,810
I wasn't throwing a tantrum.

408
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,570
No matter how hard I try to prove

409
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,640
that I'm all grown up,

410
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,530
she still finds me childish.

411
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:26,930
I'm immature.

412
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,170
She doesn't believe that our relationship

413
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:28,810
will last.

414
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,120
If that's the case,

415
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,360
Wu Ying's type would be

416
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,810
someone that's mature, reliable,

417
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,120
in his thirties,

418
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,760
with a stable income.

419
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,480
I can't change my age.

420
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:43,960
However, I've been working hard

421
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,880
in other aspects.

422
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,050
No matter what I do,

423
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,290
she still finds me childish

424
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,480
and unreliable.

425
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,290
Once, Zeng Li told me

426
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,480
a Dr. Jiang

427
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,360
was pursuing Wu Ying.

428
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,360
She rejected him

429
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,640
and chose you instead.

430
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,090
If things were really as you thought,

431
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,760
why would she reject him

432
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,569
and try to turn you

433
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
into someone else?

434
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,760
Mr. Ai.

435
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,810
What do you mean?

436
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,160
Acting like a child

437
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,530
is not necessarily your weakness.

438
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,050
Wu Ying fell in love

439
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,089
with your innocence and frankness.

440
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,730
Being young isn't a bad thing.

441
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,160
Being childish might not
necessarily be bad.

442
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:27,880
Perhaps

443
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,770
Wu Ying never despises
the fact that you're childish.

444
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,160
Maybe she just doesn't want to grow up.

445
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,360
Why didn't Liu

446
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,360
visit us

447
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,050
with you today?

448
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,680
I haven't seen him in a while.

449
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,880
I kind of miss that kid.

450
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:44,400
That's right.

451
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,400
I miss him, too.

452
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,640
Why didn't he come by today?

453
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,840
I went to get groceries today

454
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,570
and met the mother

455
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,770
of the accountant, Mr. Zhao.

456
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,680
Her grandchild

457
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,920
is attending elementary school next year.

458
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,090
They can't decide

459
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,770
which school

460
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,640
is suitable for the child.

461
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,250
The friends I play chess with

462
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,810
are around my age.

463
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,440
Look at their grandchildren.

464
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,090
The oldest one is attending a university.

465
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:12,880
Father and mother.

466
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,360
Did you rehearse this

467
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,160
to tell me how much you want a grandchild?

468
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,840
Your father and I

469
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,880
have no such thoughts.

470
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,770
-Am I right?
-Right.

471
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,010
Our daughter

472
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,880
is still young.

473
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,010
There's no rush.

474
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,160
Yes.

475
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,920
It's completely normal to
take another seven or years

476
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,250
for you to get ready for a child.

477
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,160
Yes, it is.

478
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,920
We're not rushing you.

479
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,840
Not at all.

480
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:29,360
Not at all.

481
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:29,880
Not at all.

482
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm already 27 this year.

483
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,160
In another seven or eight years,

484
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,600
that's considered advanced maternal age.

485
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,050
Aren't you worried that

486
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,360
I might not be able to get pregnant

487
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,770
or that the child

488
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,600
might have abnormalities?

489
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,920
Not at all.

490
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:41,810
Look.

491
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,680
When I was pregnant with you,

492
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,050
I was already 40.

493
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,810
I gave birth to you

494
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,120
healthily all the same.

495
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,920
Mother.

496
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:51,880
You're amazing.

497
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,440
In the medical conditions back in the day,

498
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:56,810
you still

499
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,090
gave birth to me at the age of 40.

500
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,360
She wasn't afraid at all.

501
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,920
I was so concerned.

502
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,680
I advised her many times

503
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,490
to give up.

504
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,920
She refused.

505
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:08,970
I couldn't possibly

506
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,530
give up just like that.

507
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,440
If we really

508
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,770
aborted the child back then,

509
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,880
we'd never

510
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:16,600
have

511
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,090
our precious daughter today.

512
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,490
We would have regretted
the decision our whole lives.

513
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,900
[Ma Yi Yi]

514
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,120
This lipstick is probably

515
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,090
my favourite.

516
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,400
It's essential for
the upcoming fall season.

517
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,770
It's a really

518
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,120
elegant shade of red.

519
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,200
Let's test the colour.

520
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:37,840
It glides smoothly...

521
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:40,920
Hello!

522
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,090
Just leave the parcels by the door!

523
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,360
Thanks!

524
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,400
This...

525
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,250
Excuse me.

526
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,250
I'm going to answer the door.

527
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:51,600
I'm coming.

528
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,200
Stop knocking.

529
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,440
Just leave it by the door.

530
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,120
I'm livestreaming.
What are you doing here?

531
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,120
Ma Yi Yi.

532
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,730
I have a question for you.

533
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:04,840
Were you

534
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,920
with Chris last night?

535
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,880
I didn't mean to lie.

536
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,640
We were discussing work.

537
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,120
Chris and I met up

538
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,770
for work.

539
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,200
He...

540
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,570
He recently invested

541
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,010
in a new livestreaming platform.

542
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,730
I was recruited as one
of their broadcasters.

543
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,600
I thought it's rather unsafe

544
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,680
to meet up late at night,

545
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,840
but after I got there,

546
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,120
there were around seven to eight

547
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,770
people there.

548
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,880
The employees from the livestreaming
platform were there, too.

549
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,120
We even created a group chat

550
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,920
to ease communication.

551
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:31,810
I brought the contract back, too.

552
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,250
Let me show you.

553
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,400
I must be out of my mind.

554
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,570
Why should I show you the contract?

555
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,970
Why should I explain everything to you?

556
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:41,530
I...

557
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:43,640
Yes, I was

558
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,810
with Chris last night.

559
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,400
What's wrong?

560
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,010
I must be the crazy one.

561
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,200
I even checked

562
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,200
Chris' Moments.

563
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,330
I was wondering

564
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,250
if you still had feelings for me.

565
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,360
If you still had feelings for me,

566
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,010
why would you meet

567
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:54,880
another man late at night?

568
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,970
Fine, there's no need to explain yourself.

569
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:58,970
You're free to be

570
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,640
with anyone you want.

571
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,160
It has nothing to do with me.

572
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,120
Is there anything else?

573
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,640
Do you get it now?

574
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,090
In the first three months
after breaking up with you,

575
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,050
that's what

576
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,160
I went through every single day.

577
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,290
All I did was wondering

578
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,570
if you still had feelings for me.

579
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,360
I wondered if you were lying

580
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,250
when you said you're at work.

581
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,090
Were you mingling

582
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,120
with other women?

583
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,730
I was wondering why you'd ignore me.

584
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,200
I'd go through your Moments

585
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,530
and Weibo.

586
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,290
I stalked the girls

587
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,600
you followed

588
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,640
on your social media platforms.

589
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,010
I just wanted to prove

590
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,330
myself right.

591
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,770
You're now

592
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,120
questioning me directly.

593
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:04,770
Do you know

594
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,730
I didn't even have the courage

595
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,440
to question you back then?

596
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,400
It's because I was afraid.

597
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,160
I was afraid once I knew something,

598
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,730
we'd be completely over.

599
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,050
I'm sorry.

600
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:06,580
[A Long Engagement]

601
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,640
What's wrong?

602
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,880
Why are you so sad over a novel?

603
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,360
The story is moving.

604
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,330
What's the story about?

605
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,090
The story goes like this.

606
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,090
Right after the female protagonist

607
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,360
got engaged with her fiancé,

608
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,770
a war broke out.

609
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,290
As a result,

610
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,400
she heard her fiancé's death.

611
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,120
However, the protagonist believed

612
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,090
that if her fiancé was truly dead,

613
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,680
she'd be able to sense it.

614
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,090
Thus, she decided to leave her hometown

615
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,360
to search for her fiancé.

616
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,400
Right now,

617
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,570
I totally understand how she felt.

618
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,970
If you truly love

619
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,640
someone,

620
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,290
no matter how far apart,

621
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,570
you'll be able

622
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,810
to sense his presence.

623
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,050
If her fiancé was truly dead,

624
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:53,920
she would be able

625
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,730
to sense it, too.

626
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,640
Mr. Ai,

627
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,090
once you get to Africa,

628
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,330
you must take care of yourself

629
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,120
and protect yourself.

630
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,530
I do not want to receive

631
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,400
any bad news when you're away.

632
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,250
What's going through

633
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,730
your mind?

634
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,920
Can't you be a little more optimistic?

635
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,090
Honestly though,

636
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:13,970
will you be able

637
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,010
to text me in Africa?

638
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,010
Yes.

639
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,050
The colleagues who have been there

640
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:18,730
say

641
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,680
WiFi is available.

642
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,530
However, the connection may be lost

643
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,010
at the garrisons.

644
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,600
I don't care.

645
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
You need to

646
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,440
text me to confirm your safety everyday.

647
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,600
If I do not receive

648
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,490
a text from you one day,

649
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,010
I'll head to Africa immediately.

650
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,120
I should

651
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,050
keep you in my pocket

652
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,330
and bring you along with me to Africa.

653
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:35,770
Can you do that?

654
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,680
In your dreams.

655
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
I'm willing to take you

656
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,490
anywhere,

657
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,680
except places where you'll suffer.

658
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,920
Zeng Li.

659
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,330
You're still awake.

660
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,250
I can't sleep.

661
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,160
If I fell asleep on the last night

662
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,840
before your departure,

663
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,360
it's like you'd be gone

664
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,920
the next second.

665
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,880
Go to sleep. I will stay awake.

666
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,050
That way,

667
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,250
time will not pass by.

668
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,290
Mr. Ai.

669
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
I want to listen to you sing.

670
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,600
You've never sung.

671
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,010
I don't know how to.

672
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,120
I have faith in you.

673
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,970
I'm sure you can sing.

674
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,330
Go on.

675
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,840
♫ When I was a kid ♫

676
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,880
♫ Back when I was a kid ♫

677
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,080
♫ Whenever I throw a tantrum ♫

678
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,120
♫ Whenever I throw a tantrum ♫

679
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,280
♫ My grandmother would
sing to comfort me ♫

680
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:14,330
♫ My grandmother would
sing to comfort me ♫

681
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,880
I love this song.

682
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:48,770
You probably haven't eaten.

683
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,330
I cooked you something while
you're on a night shift.

684
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,360
It's still warm.

685
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:06,840
Take a seat.

686
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,050
I have something to say.

687
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,090
Can we

688
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,810
talk after dinner?

689
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:14,440
No.

690
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,120
I must speak my mind right now.

691
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,330
Are you going to break...

692
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:21,880
I missed you.

693
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,330
Did you know?

694
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:35,920
I missed you, too.

695
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,290
Why didn't you contact me?

696
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,490
Why haven't you

697
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,200
contacted me for the past few days?

698
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,600
I went to the hospital looking for you.

699
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,120
I saw how busy you were.

700
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,400
I did not want to bother you.

701
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,010
I was afraid of irritating you.

702
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,290
You'd get mad and break up with me.

703
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,010
You know what?

704
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,160
Every day I returned home,

705
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,360
hoping

706
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,490
you'd be waiting for me,

707
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,200
just like you did today.

708
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:09,880
If I knew

709
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,770
that's what you thought,

710
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,490
I would have come

711
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,200
for you immediately.

712
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,730
I'm sorry.

713
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:23,880
Let's never argue again,

714
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,360
all right?

715
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,010
About the child,

716
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,360
I'll support

717
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,640
any decision you make.

718
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,440
I'll always be by your side.

719
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,680
I will not say a single word of objection.

720
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:44,730
Wu Ying.

721
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,440
I cannot

722
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,680
live without you anymore.

723
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,440
Let's not be apart anymore,

724
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:53,920
okay?

725
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,700
♫ I want to be with you forever ♫

726
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,460
♫ I'll be there for you
whenever you need me ♫

727
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:10,300
♫ Come to me. I'm going
to know all about you ♫

728
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:16,780
♫ Every moment, every decade ♫

729
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:22,020
♫ Hold my hand. Just be with you ♫

730
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:29,620
♫ Tomorrow and always, I'll be there ♫

731
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,120
There's nothing to see on your Moments

732
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,050
for the past three days.

733
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,330
I went through it in 30 seconds.

734
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,360
Aren't you curious

735
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,840
about what I posted three days ago?

736
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,880
What is there to be curious about?

737
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,810
One day,

738
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,680
you took a girl to Wutong Bar for drinks.

739
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,840
On the next day, you went
kart-racing with a girl.

740
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,970
On the day after that, you brought a girl

741
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:33,770
to the hot spring.

742
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,090
I posted photos

743
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,570
of cocktails, kart-racing,

744
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,490
and the hot spring,

745
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,810
yet you're imagining me

746
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,770
with girls.

747
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,970
I know you well enough.

748
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,250
I'll explain each photo

749
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,010
to you properly.

750
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:51,840
This one.

751
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:52,810
There indeed

752
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,640
was a girl opposite me.

753
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,250
However, she's  new girlfriend of Fatty.

754
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,090
In this one,

755
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,010
there was only one girl present.

756
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,160
Hu's niece

757
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,330
is only eight years old.

758
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,250
This photo.

759
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,490
Look.

760
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,290
Check out those long and slender legs.

761
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,010
We went to the hot spring.

762
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:08,920
However,

763
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,640
men and women were separated.

764
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,770
You'd know if you asked them.

765
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,490
Do you know whose legs are these?

766
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,360
They are Hu's.

767
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:17,970
All right.

768
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,050
Why are you telling me that?

769
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,490
You hated explaining

770
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,290
yourself in the past.

771
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,680
I used to think you
were seeking attention.

772
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:28,920
I did not do anything wrong.

773
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,200
I didn't see the need to explain myself.

774
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:31,770
However, over the years,

775
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,570
as you grew,

776
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,160
I reflected on my actions as well.

777
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,250
Security is given mutually.

778
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,090
When you care about someone,

779
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,250
you need to make her feel safe.

780
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,570
Ma Yi Yi.

781
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:42,290
I really

782
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,400
want to be with you.

783
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,730
I'm still

784
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,840
an incompetent boyfriend.

785
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,600
However,

786
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
I will improve little by little.

787
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,490
I'll start with making you feeling secure.

788
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,120
Check this out.

789
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,250
What are you doing?

790
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,920
I'm setting up your face ID.

791
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,680
If you want to show our relationship off,

792
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,770
use my phone.

793
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:00,970
Let the whole world know.

794
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
However, you need to put on makeup.

795
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,730
I'm afraid people won't recognise you

796
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,640
without makeup.

797
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:11,840
Deng Hao Ran.

798
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:13,840
Are you saying this

799
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,920
on a whim?

800
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,200
No.

801
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,570
What I mean is

802
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,570
from now on,

803
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,250
I'll report

804
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,640
everything I do, every day to you.

805
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:25,880
Well,

806
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,400
that's unnecessary.

807
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,400
Honestly,

808
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,200
it's a little annoying.

809
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,600
You're annoying,

810
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,640
yet you're complaining about me.

811
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,330
You said so.

812
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,490
I'm growing up, too.

813
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,400
Besides,

814
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,010
I need to learn

815
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,360
to trust you.

816
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,010
Does that mean

817
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,840
you'll

818
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,250
date me again?

819
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,490
However,

820
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,200
you need to register my face ID.

821
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:19,850
Go home.
