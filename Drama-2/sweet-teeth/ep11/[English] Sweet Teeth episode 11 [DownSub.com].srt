[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,320
This Li Qian

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,680
is so sarcastic when she speaks.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,840
No one knows what she's thinking.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:14,840
She even caused

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,920
such burden to us in work.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,080
That's a different matter.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,920
She donated the books with good intention.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,720
If you ask me,

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,080
donating book is secondary.

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,200
Her aim is to show off to us.

12
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,000
I remember, today,

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,040
you didn't do a lot of work either.

14
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,640
The few remaining big boxes

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,120
were carried by me and Mr. Ai,

16
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,280
right?

17
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,400
True.

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, right, Mr. Ai.

19
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,960
You're the hero of the day.

20
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,040
Wan Xia,

21
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,520
so,

22
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,000
my husband is here to pick me up.

23
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,000
I'll get going.

24
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,840
You two,

25
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
good luck.

26
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,600
Goodbye.

27
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,040
Let's go.

28
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,400
Zeng Li,

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,120
today, it seems

30
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,000
you've been avoiding me.

31
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,160
[Why didn't I realize before]

32
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,440
[that his mouth shape is so nice?]

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,680
[-They seem soft.]
-Zeng Li,

34
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,400
[It's more than that.]

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,760
[They're indeed quite soft.]

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,600
Zeng Li!

37
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,560
Zeng Li!

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,440
Must be my imagination.

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,320
We had an appointment this afternoon

40
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,520
to clean braces.

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,520
You also stood me up at the last minute.

42
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,160
[Zeng Li, what are you trying to do?]

43
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,840
[Don't tell me you're thinking
to force your lips on him?]

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,880
[You hooligan.]

45
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,640
Don't you have to work today?

46
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,720
I forgot to tell you

47
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,160
when I made the appointment.

48
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,479
Is there something on my mouth?

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,240
No.

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,240
I just feel that they're nice.

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,960
You can work as a lipstick model.

52
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,000
[I really admire myself.]

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,600
[Why am I saying
all these sensible stuff?]

54
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,840
The weather's quite nice.

55
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,000
Why don't we take a walk?

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,680
So, what did Aunt say?

57
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,240
My mother said,

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,680
lazy people like me

59
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,920
will never amount to anything.

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,800
Working as a librarian,

61
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,040
probably few more years later,
I'll be too embarrassed

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,400
to attend high school reunion party.

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,680
But,

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,840
that's how I am

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,640
as a person.

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,160
I dislike complicated
interpersonal relationships

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,600
and reading books is my hobby.

68
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,520
When I have time to spare,

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,240
I'll eat and drink with my good friends.

70
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,240
It makes us happy.

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,160
Could Mr. Ai look down on me

72
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,440
because I'm lazy?

73
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,120
Liu Yu Cheng once mentioned

74
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,440
you follow your daily routine strictly.

75
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,040
Work, studies, gym,

76
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,960
reading books,

77
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,720
everyday without fail.

78
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,000
He exaggerated.

79
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,560
I also often use my time

80
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,640
to go to gym and study

81
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,640
to take a walk

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,600
and chat with you.

83
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,680
I feel guilty.

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,920
I seem to have influenced the

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,200
respectable Mr. Ai in a negative manner.

86
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,360
Well, I don't think

87
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,320
it's a bad thing.

88
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,560
On the contrary, I think
you're quite amazing.

89
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,040
Are you trying to make me feel better?

90
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,200
Really.

91
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,480
You

92
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,480
aren't influenced by how others view you,

93
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,200
nor

94
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,480
let your family decide what you'll do.

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,960
You chose a job that you like

96
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,160
as well as lifestyle,

97
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,720
that in itself is a

98
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,200
terrific achievement.

99
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,800
I'm not as good as you say.

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
If I really

101
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,520
have no self-doubt,

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
just now,

103
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,040
I wouldn't be so upset.

104
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,840
It's normal.

105
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,040
I also often

106
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,079
have moments of self-doubt,

107
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,720
but making choices usually represent

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,520
your own attitude.

109
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,520
Take me for example,

110
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,040
I seem to have chosen

111
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,920
a path which others regard
of as relatively successful,

112
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,040
but in fact I've given up

113
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,120
what I wanted to do a long time ago.

114
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,040
Mr. Ai, what is it

115
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,720
you wanted to do the most?

116
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,480
Have a guess.

117
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,240
Scientist?

118
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,800
Entrepreneur?

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,640
No,

120
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,600
these are

121
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,880
what's defined as really
successful people.

122
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,200
If it has to be an ambition that's unique

123
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,240
and niche...

124
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,520
A rockstar?

125
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,560
More or less.

126
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,360
I wanted to be a manga artist.

127
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,960
Mr. Ai,

128
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:49,840
that's a stark contrast

129
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,000
with your current profession.

130
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,000
When I was younger, I saw

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,200
the male classmates in my class

132
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,520
read manga often.

133
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
I also enjoyed reading it.

134
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,000
I wanted to join them,

135
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,640
but they thought

136
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,520
I was strange.

137
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,520
How can the first place in our grade

138
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,640
like to

139
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,520
read manga?

140
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,000
When my grandmother heard of it,

141
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,400
she also prohibited me from doing so,

142
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,600
saying it'll affect my studies.

143
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,040
Since then,

144
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
I'd wait until they fell asleep

145
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,400
to read in secret.

146
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,560
Although when I become older,

147
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,720
I'm free to do what I want,

148
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,640
but I've always kept this habit.

149
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,840
Following a strict routine

150
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,240
is also my habit since young.

151
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,440
It's all for the 60 minutes
with most freedom

152
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,200
before sleep.

153
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,520
Seems like Mr. Ai

154

also grew up

155
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,360
like any other usual male.

156
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,640
If I think of it this way, you seem

157
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,200
much more approachable.

158
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,040
Which is why,

159
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,920
you have to stick to

160
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,120
what you want to do.

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,120

193
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,560
and fell out of love with her.

194
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
Your profile picture is Xia Xia?

195
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,120
You just realized?

196
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
I didn't notice.

197
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,440
I thought it's just an
image you found online.

198
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,200
I've been using for a long time.

199
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,600
Ever since I changed my profile picture

200
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,800
and switched the gender to female,

201
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,960
it became so much easier
to find someone to lead.

202
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,440
Where are you going?

203
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
I'm going to explain to her.

204
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,400
No.

205
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,240
There's no rush.

206
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,520
Let's play another round.

207
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,920
Come on.

208
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,000
Father will be fine.

209
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,000
The door is open.

210
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,640
They're here.

211
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,840
Father!

212
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,840
Dr. Jiang, how's my father?

213
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,920
The surgery is a success.

214
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,800
Don't worry.

215
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,520
It's just that, your father

216
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,680
had an old injury on his leg.

217
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,880
This time, he fell

218
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,000
on the same spot as well.

219
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,560
When he moves,

220
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,840
it'll affect him more or less.

221
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,000
Doctor,

222
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
so from now on, is my husband

223
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,720
going to sit on

224
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,520
a wheelchair?

225
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,520
Aunt, it's not to that extent.

226
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,360
Don't worry.

227
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,760
His movements will be a bit slow.

228
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,520
It's best to have someone look after him.

229
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,000
OK, sure. Thank you, Doctor.

230
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,640
No problem.

231
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,560
Slowly.

232
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,320
Come on.

233
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,720
Mother, you all go ahead.

234
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,280
I'll catch up with you.

235
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,000
OK.

236
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,720
-Careful.
-Careful.

237
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,640
Thank you, Dr. Jiang.

238
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,919
I'm just doing my part.

239
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
To me, in each surgery,

240
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,400
I'll do my best,

241
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,679
but this time,

242
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,120
I really hope

243
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,520
I'll perform better than usual.

244
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,520
Don't you remember me?

245
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,160
You're my father's surgeon.

246
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,760
Didn't we already

247
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,960
meet few times before this?

248
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,920
The first time we met,

249
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,680
was at the first meeting

250
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,800
since my transfer to
Donghu University Hospital.

251
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,440
You were sitting right next to me.

252
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,040
At that time, the principal
and vice principal

253
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,160
took turns to speak.

254
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,240
You were holding a tablet

255
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,200
without lifting your head once.

256
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,480
I guess you were writing a thesis.

257
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,080
And I thought

258
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,240
this female's quite bold,

259
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,800
but she looks cool.

260
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,440
The weekly hospital meetings

261
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,320
is the time I'm most efficient

262
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,440
at writing theses.

263
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,800
I understand.

264
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Six shifts a week,

265
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,440
at least nine hours each.

266
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,520
Patients' monthly medical records

267
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,760
have to be compiled into a report as well.

268
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,560
Each year, you also need to

269
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
publish at least four theses

270
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,800
on academic journals.

271
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,800
The path to become attending physician

272
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,440
sure isn't easy.

273
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,640
Good luck.

274
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,280
I already passed my tests

275
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,360
and the interview.

276
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,760
As for when a spot

277
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,640
is available,

278
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,440
I can only wait

279
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,840
for instructions from
hospital's management.

280
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,440
You can do it.

281
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,200
Thank you.

282
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,800
The lift is here.

283
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,840
Let's go.

284
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,020
[and Liu Yu Cheng, two players mode]

285
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,720
[This rascal]

286
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,000
[is still playing with Xia Xia.]

287
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,360
Dr. Wu, are you available this weekend?

288
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,680
Dr. Wu.

289
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,240
What were you saying?

290
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,280
I said,

291
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,640
do you want to spend the weekend with me?

292
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,720
We don't know each other that well.

293
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,600
Isn't spending the weekend together

294
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,800
kinda strange?

295
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,040
There's always a start to everything.

296
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,560
We'll get to know each other more.

297
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,520
Who knows,

298
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,200
you might find that I'm a nice guy.

299
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,600
Let me think about it.

300
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,280
Xiao Wang,

301
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,360
what a coincidence.

302
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,280
It sure is.

303
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,760
Come on.

304
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,520
Is Dr. Jiang

305
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,240
courting you lately?

306
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,040
You've seen him

307
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,080
for less than five seconds,

308
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,800
and you've come to

309
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,560
such a nonsensical conclusion?

310
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,000
The nurses from department

311
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,800
told me,

312
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,160
recently, Dr. Jiang

313
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,920
has been asking around about your

314
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,120
hobbies, interests, and so on.

315
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,480
He sure acts quickly.

316
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,160
Are you coming or not?

317
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,880
I'm going to take a look at my father.

318
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,080
Wait, I haven't finished talking.

319
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,160
You should consider him.

320
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,080
Dr. Jiang is mature, handsome

321
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,320
and has a successful career.

322
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,240
You two are a match made in heaven.

323
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Compared to that younger boy,

324
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,160
he's much more suitable for you.

325
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,400
Say what you want.

326
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,480
I'm going to take a look at my father.

327
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,960
Just tell me

328
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,200
a little about it.

329
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,920
What's there to tell?

330
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,720
Just a little.

331
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,320
Hopefully this meal

332
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,800
won't be absorbed by our system.

333
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,360
Please.

334
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,160
It'll be eliminated from our
system right after we finish.

335
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,040
Let's eat.

336
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,600
I don't eat vegetables.

337
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,680
I have

338
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,440
an announcement to make.

339
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,240
I've decided

340
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,520
I'm going to attend the signing event.

341
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,400
Didn't you say you're not going?

342
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,560
But it's indeed a good thing.

343
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,040
Who knows, you might become a sensation.

344
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,640
How did you suddenly come to your senses?

345
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,440
I used to think

346
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,640
I'm just using my own experience

347
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,320
as a prototype

348
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,600
to write a story.

349
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,160
If I'm to keep on

350
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,080
doing this,

351
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,480
in fact, I don't know what
I'm going to do from here.

352
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,680
I can't even be considered

353
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,320
as a writer.

354
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,600
I disagree.

355
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,000
I've been dating so many times,

356
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,440
and I couldn't write a single word.

357
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,560
Zeng Li is different.

358
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,320
She wrote 100,000 words just
from having a crush on someone.

359
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,560
You're really something.

360
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,320
But I can't write about my own stories

361
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,680
my entire life.

362
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
After all, it isn't a personal memoir.

363
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,880
Agree?

364
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,240
So, do you have a new source

365
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,920
of inspiration?

366
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,440
Not really.

367
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,800
It's just, yesterday,

368
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,200
Mr. Ai said to me,

369
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,920
to do the things

370
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,000
I like to do,

371
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,120
and choosing the lifestyle I want,

372
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,000
is something really admirable

373
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,400
and lucky.

374
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,000
That's why,

375
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,400
I gave it some thought.

376
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,920
In fact, I enjoy writing.

377
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,440
Aside from

378
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,520
whether I'll become successful,

379
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,880
or if I could accomplish

380
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,480
this task,

381
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,640
or if I'll successfully become

382
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,720
a professional writer,

383
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,200
as long as I can do

384
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,080
what I like to do,

385
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,040
with no other motives

386
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,040
or regrets,

387
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,960
it'll be OK.

388
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,360
I understand now.

389
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,440
Mr. Ai is the source of your inspiration.

390
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,600
You wrote 100,000 words for Yu Yi.

391
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,920
For Mr. Ai, at least,

392
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,120
you'll need to write an
entire collection of books.

393
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,480
Right?

394
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,920
You two. Everything
I've said just now,

395
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,480
seems like you just don't get it.

396
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,040
Eat your food.

397
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,520
Of course not.

398
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,720
Zeng Li,

399
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,320
what you're doing is called entrapment.

400
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,880
Do you know how far I have to jog

401
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,960
for this small dollop of sauce?

402
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,840
I'm going to eat your food
and take it from you.

403
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,640
The grass is always greener on
the other side, didn't you know?

404
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,920
Who did you learn it from?

405
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,200
Feeding my girlfriend french fries

406
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,400
is nothing to be embarrassed about.

407
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,000
Come on, let me feed you.

408
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,200
Dip it in two types of sauces.

409
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,400
Come on.

410
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,520
It's so tasty.

411
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,160
Stinky.

412
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,760
I'm telling you,

413
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,800
even though she's wearing pink,

414
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
but you can still tell her age.

415
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,480
He's younger than she is.

416
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,920
I thought you want to eat my french fries?

417
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,440
Here, eat it.

418
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,320
Eat more. Eat.

419
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,520
What are you two doing?

420
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,320
Who's dating someone younger?

421
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,400
Who's dating someone younger?

422
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,320
Who?

423
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,320
Not me.

424
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,520
Don't cue me.

425
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,320
Actually, there's nothing wrong with it.

426
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,280
It's very popular nowadays,

427
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,240
agree?

428
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,840
Dating someone younger isn't the issue.

429
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,560
Wu Ying,

430
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,440
love is about

431
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,800
whether the two persons are
suitable for each other.

432
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,280
I think you and Liu Yu Cheng

433
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,160
are really compatible.

434
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,560
Why mention him all of a sudden?

435
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,400
We're just friends.

436
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:05,920
Friends?

437
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,200
The truth is,

438
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,640
even if you fooled us,

439
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,040
you can't fool your own heart.

440
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,960
There's no way I like him.

441
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,240
Only you yourself would believe that.

442
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,320
So what if I like him?

443
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,680
You finally admitted?

444
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,080
It seems Liu Yu Cheng's

445
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,040
female online game partner

446
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,240
showed up at the right moment.

447
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,800
It makes Dr. Wu realize

448
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,040
her own feelings deeply.

449
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,600
Since you already

450
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,800
admit that you like Liu Yu Cheng,

451
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,200
so why did you ignore him?

452
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,040
I just don't want to,

453
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,240
because of someone I like,

454
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,600
I can only buy those

455
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
colourful clothes to wear

456
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,160
and don't even dare to wear make-up,

457
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,320
worrying about when we go out,

458
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,600
others will say I'm
pretending to be young.

459
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Also, I'll be concerned about

460
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,720
each wrinkle on my face,

461
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,240
and on my birthday,

462
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,520
I wouldn't dare to tell my family

463
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,400
that we're dating.

464
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,320
Or one day, when we broke up,

465
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,600
he's only in his 20s,

466
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,400
as for me,

467
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,840
I'll be in my 30s.

468
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,360
Forget it.

469
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,280
If he's really

470
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,560
going out with the female in the picture,

471
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,080
it's a good thing.

472
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
They're about the same age

473
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,600
and compatible in terms of looks.

474
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,440
Attending university together, gaming,

475
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,480
have breakfast and supper with each other,

476
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,800
at least it's better

477
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,320
than being with me, an older woman.

478
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,720
Goodness.

479
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,400
Is this the Wu Ying we know?

480
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,160
In the past, if Wu Ying likes someone,

481
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,360
she's always so fearless.

482
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,440
What's wrong?

483
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,680
I was young then.

484
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,920
What are you talking about?

485
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
You're only 27 this year.

486
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,720
It's true that Liu Yu Cheng is young,

487
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,960
but you're quite young yourself.

488
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,280
I'm not young anymore.

489
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,120
Think about it.

490
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,840
In the past,

491
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,680
we could eat three burgers in one go

492
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,120
and it'll be digested the next day.

493
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,120
Now, if I eat one of these burgers,

494
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,680
I'll gain a kilogram.

495
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,200
No amount of exercise
or diet can change it.

496
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,160
I also had excellent sleep quality.

497
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,040
Really.

498
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,800
Not even three or four
alarms will wake me.

499
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,720
And now?

500
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,760
I couldn't fall asleep at night.

501
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,960
This morning when I woke up,

502
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,840
I looked at my watch,

503
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,040
and it's only 5.30am.

504
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,280
It's too early.

505
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,480
Also, when we go clubbing in the past.

506
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,120
In three hours,

507
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,160
we've never

508
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,120
sat once on the bench.

509
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,120
And now?

510
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Don't even bother asking me to club.

511
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,920
I feel tired at the mention of it.

512
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,840
I don't want to go.

513
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,360
Did you know?

514
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,960
I'm beginning to experience hair loss.

515
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,960
Each hair of mine

516
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
has its own name.

517
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
There're so many.

518
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,080
I know each and everyone of them.

519
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,760
I'm old.

520
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,160
Me too.

521
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,800
See this patch?

522
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,000
-Me too.
-This entire patch is gone.

523
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,720
Why is it happening to us?

524
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,880
Look at my nasolabial folds.

525
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,600
I have those too.

526
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,240
I have those too.

527
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,560
My nasolabial folds are so obvious.

528
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,320
It won't go away when I smile.

529
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,600
-There's none.
-I don't even know what to do.

530
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,400
There's none.

531
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,160
Friends,

532
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,040
let's not forget

533
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,840
our theme today.

534
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,520
Zeng Li, congratulations

535
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
for taking one more step towards

536
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,160
being a writer.

537
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,840
Cheers to you.

538
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,120
Let's wish Zeng Li luck

539
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,360
to become San Mao of our era earlier.

540
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,960
One single love story

541
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,040
is written into a dozen of books.

542
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,800
Good luck!

543
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,680
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

544
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,280
Can we drink this coke?

545
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,040
Do we have to anti-sugar?

546
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,920
We have to.

547
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,520
Ma Xiao Bing

548
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,680
can go through hospital
admission procedures next week.

549
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,440
If the pre-surgery
examination turns out fine,

550
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,560
probably next,

551
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,800
he can undergo his surgery.

552
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,880
Great.

553
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,560
This is Xiao Bing's grandfather.

554
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,360
This is Dr. Ai.

555
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:56,920
Hi.

556
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,960
Dr. Ai, thank you so much.

557
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,480
-The effects of the braces are showing.
-If not because of you

558
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,840
helping to strive for the surgery costs,

559
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,880
You finally visit on time.

560
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,079
or it'll be too late.

561
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,280
Didn't I visit on time before this?

562
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,599
-What do you think?
-You're welcome.

563
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,480
It's nothing.

564
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,240
Don't worry.

565
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,119
As long as Xiao Bing

566
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,240
undergoes the surgery,

567
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,359
his illness can be cured

568
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,079
before he turns 18 years old.

569
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,680
Thank you so much.

570
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,880
Normally speaking,

571
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,920
-Did you know?
-Before he turns 18,

572
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
-This time, the subsidy
-basically he can

573
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,319
-is just 30 percent.
-fully recover.

574
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,960
The remaining 70 percent

575
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,319
was paid out of Mr. Ai's own pocket.

576
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,920
So, for some time after
the surgery is done,

577
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,040
it might be a little tough for you.

578
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,520
-How much does it cost?
-You all need to take care of him.

579
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,680
RMB50,000 to RMB60,000 in total.

580
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,920
In the beginning, Mr. Ai

581
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,120
didn't want us to tell others,

582
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,120
but it should be fine to tell you.

583
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,120
So?

584
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,080
Does it deepen the feelings you have

585
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,000
towards Mr. Ai?

586
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,920
Thank you.

587
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,440
No.

588
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,400
I don't know what to say.

589
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,960
Mr. Ai,

590
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,400
is cleft lip surgery so complicated?

591
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,400
It's considered to be

592
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,160
a relatively complicated

593
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,240
facial plastic surgery.

594
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,720
First, we need to confirm

595
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,880
the basic anatomy of the lips,

596
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,280
next, perform separation

597
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,320
and incision.

598
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,040
The skin, muscle, and mucous membrane,

599
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,080
all of which needs to
be handled in layers.

600
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,600
After that, for the split part,

601
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,720
restoration

602
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,000
and continuous reconstruction is done.

603
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,760
The entire restoration process

604
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,960
might need to be done in few surgeries.

605
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,160
Sounds like Mr. Ai,

606
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,000
you know what you're doing.

607
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,000
Not exactly.

608
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,600
I'm just doing

609
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,960
what I ought to do.

610
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,120
In fact, treatment of cleft lip

611
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,320
tests the patient

612
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,000
more than it does the doctor.

613
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,200
Think about it.

614
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760
For example, now

615
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,160
you're only wearing braces.

616
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,480
And you already hope to

617
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,160
have it removed sooner.

618
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,440
But towards

619
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,560
patients with cleft lip,

620
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,880
it could possibly be a decade

621
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,360
they have to undergo continuous surgeries

622
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,400
and rehabilitation care.

623
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,480
It requires strong willpower.

624
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,520
If that's the case, let's go
to the orphanage next time

625
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,440
to visit Ma Xiao Bing,

626
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,760
and cheer him on as well.

627
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,520
Sure.

628
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,480
What's wrong?

629
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,240
Nothing.

630
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,960
I'm just admiring

631
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,680
this doctor who paid out of his own pocket

632
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,040
and do his best to perform surgery

633
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,560
for the patient.

634
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,040
You... You heard about it?

635
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
Zhou Wen told me.

636
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,800
She also asked me if, towards you,

637
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,800
my feeling of admiration increased.

638
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,320
The way you all put it

639
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,000
is too exaggerated.

640
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,200
I just feel, whether someone

641
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,760
will become a good or
bad person in future,

642
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,440
it mainly depends

643
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,600
on his growth process.

644
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,440
Children who lost their
parents since a young age

645
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,400
in fact, will harbor

646
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,360
negative emotions easily.

647
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,000
Together with congenital disease,

648
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,720
he's even more vulnerable
to trauma psychologically.

649
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,400
I understand.

650
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,480
Mr. Ai,

651
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,440
you want to do your best

652
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,400
to cure Ma Xiao Bing,

653
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,080
both physically

654
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,720
and psychologically.

655
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,840
I'm the same as him.

656
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,880
We're both orphans.

657
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,880
But I was lucky,

658
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,200
since I had my grandparents

659
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,040
by my side

660
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,640
and guide me so I don't go astray.

661
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,640
In comparison,

662
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,680
Ma Xiao Bing

663
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,320
isn't so lucky.

664
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,640
Therefore, I'm thinking,

665
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,560
I'll do what I can

666
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,080
to bring him some

667
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,960
positive influence,

668
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,240
or

669
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,880
create a better environment

670
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,840
so in future, he could become

671
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,680
a better person.

672
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,640
Your braces are ready.
I'll bring them to you.

673
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,560
OK.

674
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,440
[In fact, liking someone]

675
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,240
[isn't particularly difficult.]

676
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,480
[In the beginning,]

677
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,120
[we'll unknowingly]

678
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,400
[attracted by the person's
appearance, strength,]

679
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
[or even naivety,]

680
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,440
[it's just a feeling in general.]

681
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,480
[But if we can]

682
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,040
[slowly discover through
spending time together]

683
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
[that everything about him]

684
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,720
[is worth my having feelings for him,]

685
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,600
[it's such a great feeling.]

686
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,600
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

687
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,080
I was stuck in a traffic jam.

688
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,280
I'm late again.

689
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,840
No need to apologize to me.

690
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,880
I'll give you a special privilege.

691
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,720
You aren't considered as being
late if you arrive within an hour.

692
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,560
Really?

693
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,120
Let's go.

694
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,320
Thank you

695
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,080
for giving up on your action film

696
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,840
to watch romance movies with me.

697
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,240
That's my plan.

698
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,160
I'll keep you company today,

699
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,400
and you'll keep me company the next time.

700
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,080
That way, in a week,

701
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
we'll be going to the movies twice.

702
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,760
Oh, right.

703
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,200
Let me show you something scary.

704
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,080
[Sheng Ming is my boyfriend.]

705
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:08,780
[Michelle]

706
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,440
[Being lovey-dovey with
someone else's boyfriend.]

707
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,160
[Have you got no shame?]

708
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,560
Fess up.

709
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,040
How many girlfriends do you really have?

710
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,240
You're the only person I like.

711
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,960
You know that.

712
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,360
Why are you so anxious?

713
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,520
Don't worry. I know.

714
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,080
It must a prank pulled by netizens.

715
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:14,920
Let me tell you,

716
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,200
it really isn't easy for me nowadays.

717
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,320
If I post a selfie,

718
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,920
they'd say it's edited.

719
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,960
If I post lovey-dovey
pictures with my boyfriend,

720
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,680
they'd say my boyfriend

721
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,280
was snatched from someone else.

722
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,040
But I don't care.

723
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,000
Why should I, right?

724
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,640
Go in first.

725
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,800
I need to use the washroom.

726
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,720
But the movie's going to start soon.

727
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,520
Hurry up.

728
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,500
[Xiao Tao]

729
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,040
What exactly do you want?

730
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,640
We've broken up.

731
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,080
[It's not a breakup if
I didn't agree to it.]

732
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,920
Forcing me to be with you.

733
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,120
What good will it do?

734
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,880
[There is.]

735
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,160
[Sheng Ming, I'm warning you.]

736
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,560
[Make things clear with her right now,]

737
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,240
[or I'll bring this to Weibo.]

738
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,800
[I'll tell everyone]

739
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,920
[she got between our relationship]

740
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,120
[and she stole my boyfriend.]

741
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,880
[I'm going to turn all her followers]

742
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,080
[into anti-fans.]

743
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,520
You...

744
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,520
Sheng Ming!

745
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,880
Sheng Ming!

746
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,280
I...

747
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,920
What's wrong?

748
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,480
Do you feel unwell somewhere?

749
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,520
Is it because you were exhausted lately?

750
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,400
What about this?

751
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,520
Let's not watch the movie.

752
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,360
Let's get something to eat

753
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,040
and after that,

754
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,360
we'll go home and rest, OK?

755
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,920
Yi Yi,

756
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,760
you're so good to me.

757
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,480
It's my fault.

758
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,440
What's wrong?

759
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,600
Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

760
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,280
The person who messaged you,

761
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,880
I know her.

762
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,760
We've been dating for 10 years.

763
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,880
When we first knew each other,

764
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,960
I haven't broken up with her yet.

765
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,720
Do you remember asking me
for help to edit your photo?

766
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,040
On that night,

767
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,880
I broke up with her.

768
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,480
So, did you break up

769
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,360
because of me?

770
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,440
I don't want to find excuses for myself

771
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,040
and say you're not the reason.

772
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,160
But I indeed developed feelings for you.

773
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,160
I really like you,

774
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,920
so I decided to break up with her.

775
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,920
She texted me on WeChat later

776
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,360
and called me,

777
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,120
but I didn't reply.

778
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,840
I really couldn't bear to part with you.

779
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,280
Yi Yi.

780
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,880
Yi Yi.

781
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,440
I didn't handle

782
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,360
this matter properly.

783
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,840
I got you involved in this.

784
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,080
So, what do you plan to do?

785
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,080
I don't know.

786
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:24,960
Yi Yi.

787
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,120
Hello.

788
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,960
[Hello, your car number plate
is 683, right?]

789
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,080
Yes.

790
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,600
[Come and move your vehicle, quickly.]

791
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,680
[I couldn't move my vehicle because
your vehicle is in the way.]

792
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,800
[I need to go now.]

793
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:54,960
Vehicle?

794
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,080
I drove here.

795
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,720
[How else did you come here?]

796
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
[I'm speechless.]

797
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,480
[The carpark slot
is narrow to begin with,]

798
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,200
[and you went and
park in a slanted manner.]

799
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,320
[You did it on purpose, right?]

800
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,720
Sorry.

801
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,240
I'll go back right away.

802
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,120
[Where are you now?]

803
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,960
But I don't know

804
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,760
where I am currently.

805
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,160
Let... Let me have a look.

806
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,800
I'm now

807
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,880
7 kilometres away.

808
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,360
It'll take half an hour
for me to be there.

809
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,720
[Half an hour?]

810
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,760
[I have an appointment later.]

811
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,320
[How will you make up
for it if it's delayed?]

812
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
[What an unlucky day.]

813
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,360
[It started raining after I left,]

814
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,200
[and a female driver's
blocking my carpark slot.]

815
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:43,920
[I don't care.]

816
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,480
[10 minutes.]

817
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,800
[I'm going to barge my way out
if you're still not here.]

818
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,640
I'm sorry.

819
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,280
It's an unlucky day for me too.

820
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,520
I'm sorry.

821
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,800
I'm sorry.

822
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,440
I'm sorry.

823
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,240
I'm... I'm going...

824
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,840
I'm going back now.

825
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,360
I'm... I'm going back now.

826
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,860
[CAROL'S]

827
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,040
After everything that I've told you,

828
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,560
yet you won't listen.

829
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,720
You deserve it.

830
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,640
How can you blame it on Yi Yi?

831
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,600
It isn't her fault.

832
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,440
Agreed.

833
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,680
Sheng Ming, this unworthy man.

834
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,480
Come on, give me his WeChat.

835
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,240
I'm going to scold him badly.

836
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,360
Give me your phone.

837
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,040
What's the use of scolding him?

838
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,080
That's the way things are.

839
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,120
At least I'll feel better
after scolding him.

840
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,160
Beating people is illegal
in a lawful society.

841
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,960
Or else, I'm going to give him a beating.

842
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,840
Why not?

843
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,840
Cover his head with a gunny bag,

844
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,760
no one will ever find out.

845
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,640
Do you want to be jailed?

846
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,720
That's enough.

847
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,960
If you beat him up,

848
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
how am I going to meet up
with him in future?

849
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,040
You still want to meet up?

850
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,480
Aren't you going to breakup with him?

851
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,920
I haven't made up my mind yet.

852
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,000
Ma Yi Yi,

853
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,440
you're going to tolerate this?

854
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,760
In all seriousness,

855
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,440
I'll pay for you to

856
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,080
fix your brain.

857
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,520
In all seriousness,

858
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,840
he really is the person I like the most

859
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,480
this year.

860
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,080
You're too truthful.

861
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,360
Wait.

862
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,040
It's only been 20 days since new year.

863
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,240
If that's the case...

864
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,880
If that's the case, last year also counts.

865
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,920
Why don't we close the shop

866
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,480
for tonight?

867
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,080
Tell us.

868
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,720
Where do you want to go?

869
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,400
We'll accompany you.

870
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,240
Tell you what,

871
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,960
I have morning shift tomorrow,

872
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,480
but it's OK because of you.

873
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,320
I'll stay up overnight with you.

874
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,400
Good girl.

875
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,840
[I'm done. Come pick me up.]

876
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,760
[I feel like having steamboat.]

877
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,940
[Li Li]

878
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,600
[Today is a bit tricky.]

879
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,480
[I have something to do.]

880
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:57,420
[Deng Hao Ran]

881
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,760
[We'll eat steamboat tomorrow.]

882
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,480
[You have something on everyday.]

883
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,880
[Why is it I don't have the feeling]

884
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,960
[of having a boyfriend?]

885
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,860
[Li Li]

886
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,480
The usual rule.

887
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,840
We'll listen to the person
who's going through a breakup.

888
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,120
Tell us, where do you want to go?

889
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,760
My treat.

890
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:10,960
I couldn't.

891
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,200
I'm not interested.

892
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,160
Are you sure?

893
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,880
I have a good idea, you know.

894
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:22,960
Come on.

895
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,080
Come on.

896
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:29,800
Stop.

897
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,680
I'm not going.

898
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,760
Are you sure?

899
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,320
Hurry up.

900
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,960
Shake it!

901
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,400
Shake it!

902
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,880
Coming up next, the greatest

903
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,200
electronic music video!

904
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,120
I want to know,

905
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,200
are you ready?

906
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,400
Everybody, let's move it!

907
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,680
Why must we

908
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,840
make things difficult for ourselves?

909
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,720
Let our brother dance with her.

910
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,120
Let's leave an hour later.

911
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,800
Does that make us

912
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,920
bad friends?

913
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,480
30 minutes.

914
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,080
Anyway, look at

915
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,240
our Aunt Ma.

916
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,280
She said she didn't want to come just now.

917
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,920
Look, now,

918
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,720
she's more hyped than anyone else.

919
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,800
Come on.

920
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,000
Let's video her

921
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,280
and keep as evidence.

922
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,020
[Are you asleep?]

923
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,520
[She hasn't checked her phone
once in the past three hours.]

924
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,640
[Impossible.]

925
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,280
[Usually, her mobile phone]

926
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,920
[never leave her side.]

927
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,240
[Why have I only read two pages so far?]

928
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,800
[Aunt Ma has been]

929
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,820
[Wu Ying]

930
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,120
[partying for three hours.]

931
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,680
[Someone come and bring her away.]

932
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,000
[Partying?]

933
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,920
What do you mean?

934
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,520
Come on, let's go.

935
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,440
I don't understand.

936
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,480
No, wait.

937
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,680
Nowadays, deaf-mute
people also go clubbing?

938
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,800
That's a clubbing hand signal.

939
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,560
He wants to have a drink with you.

940
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,440
You chased away your sister's suitor.

941
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,160
I can at least decide that.

942
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,080
After all,

943
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,680
dating someone younger doesn't suit her.

944
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,480
You're right.

945
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,680
Mr. Ai suits her more.

946
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,520
Come back here. Come on.

947
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,560
Sit down.

948
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,560
You two talk too much.

949
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,640
Are we going to drink or not? Come on.

950
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,440
Come on.

951
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,360
Cheers.

952
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,480
Anyway, youngsters nowadays.

953
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,400
That DJ,

954
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,880
what's he playing?

955
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,720
It's a mess.

956
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,720
He has no taste at all.

957
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,400
I miss

958
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,000
our songs back then.

959
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,760
Those tunes were so easy to dance along.

960
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,640
I remember when we used to
go clubbing in the past,

961
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,920
there's this song.

962
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,520
I remember it's got a good beat, called...

963
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,080
What's it called again?

964
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,040
That... That song, that song.

965
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,000
That... That song, that song.

966
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,960
Pokemon.

967
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,520
Boss Deng,

968
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,040
we have a song request,

969
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
"Pokemon".

970
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,160
Play it yourself.

971
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,560
I'm not going.

972
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,560
Me neither.

973
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,000
Please.

974
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,840
I'm not going.

975
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
I broke up with my boyfriend.

976
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,480
You go.

977
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,040
Fine, I'll go.

978
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,200
Thank you.

979
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,080
Bring the glowstick.

980
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,320
And my maraca.

981
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,080
I need my own stage.

982
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,480
Thank you.

983
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,760
Thank you.

984
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,240
Brother, switch to another song.

985
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,640
To what song?

986
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,720
Play "Pokemon".

987
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,360
This is lame.

988
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,080
Are you serious?

989
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,000
Not only am I serious,

990
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,720
it's also with sincerity.

991
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,520
Come on.

992
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,000
Bring out your QR code.

993
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,000
Sure, no problem.

994
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,560
Hi.

995
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,040
Excuse me, are you queuing?

996
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,520
Yes, it's quite crowded.

997
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,880
You might have to wait a while longer.

998
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,720
Thank you.

999
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,780
[Ai Jing Chu]

1000
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,960
[Reply if you saw my message.]

1001
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,800
Mr. Ai,

1002
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,680
what are you doing here?

1003
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:48,920
I'm

1004
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,720
just here to look for a friend.

1005
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,240
You sure like to play this
game for someone unskilful.

1006
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,200
I'm talking about you.

1007
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,280
It's none of your business.

1008
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm joking.

1009
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,680
Don't be angry.

1010
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,800
What are you two doing here?

1011
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,320
I saw you replying to

1012
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,480
Sister Zeng Li's moment,

1013
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,800
and I knew you'd be here.

1014
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,760
And so I came over.

1015
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,560
Mr. Ai...

1016
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,280
I came with Liu Yu Cheng.

1017
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:19,840
That's right.

1018
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,719
Where's Zeng Li?

1019
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,280
They're inside.

1020
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,080
OK.

1021
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,960
Do you visit the nightclub often?

1022
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,880
I can't hear you.

1023
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,280
I said, do you visit the nightclub often?

1024
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,960
I can't hear what you're saying.

1025
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,639
Type into a message.

1026
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,300
[Do you visit the nightclub often?]

1027
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,719
There's no signal here.

1028
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,800
Why do you need signal?

1029
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,719
Just show it to me

1030
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,840
will do.

1031
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,720
Why are you laughing?

1032
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,360
You finally hit me again.

1033
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,920
However, your father

1034
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,080
has an old injury on his leg.

1035
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:11,960
This time, he fell

1036
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,920
on the same spot.

1037
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,680
It's best to have someone look after him.

1038
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,480
Dr. Jiang

1039
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,840
is mature, good-looking,

1040
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,040
and has a successful career.

1041
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,320
Compared to that young lad,

1042
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,280
he's much more suitable.

1043
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,800
Here, I'll show you.
Just now, I sent to you...

1044
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,920
Wu Ying, where are you going?

1045
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,760
I'll see you home.

1046
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,320
Are you still angry

1047
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,720
that I'm gaming with Xia Xia?

1048
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,760
But that isn't Xia Xia.

1049
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,440
It's my roommate, Mike.

1050
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,320
He said to let you be jealous,

1051
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,400
and you'll care about me more.

1052
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,200
But I didn't expect it makes you

1053
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,960
want to talk to me even less.

1054
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,800
I'm not.

1055
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,200
I just no longer feel like gaming.

1056
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,040
So, you like clubbing now?

1057
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,840
Although I'm not good at it,

1058
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,600
I'll learn.

1059
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,960
You don't have to do all this for me.

1060
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,600
I volunteered to do so.

1061
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,520
Did you know?

1062
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,040
You're really charming.

1063
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,600
You're the type that, amidst the crowd,

1064
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,400
you'd stand out the most,

1065
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,080
you're that type of girl.

1066
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,400
We have a six years' age difference.

1067
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,560
There's no way

1068
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,240
we'll end up together.

1069
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,320
Age, personality, occupation,

1070
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,520
all kinds of practical issues,

1071
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,920
we couldn't avoid any of it.

1072
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,080
Have you been feeling down recently?

1073
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,600
You keep saying things that
sound as if you're discouraged.

1074
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,640
No.

1075
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,720
No matter what happened,

1076
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,280
if you're unhappy,

1077
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,880
you can tell me.

1078
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,240
If you did,

1079
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,280
I'll share the burden with you.

1080
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,200
There really isn't.

1081
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,440
I'm going home.

1082
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,400
You should go back earlier too.

1083
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,680
Don't you have lecture tomorrow morning?

1084
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,480
At least let me see you home.

1085
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,320
It's late.

1086
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,520
No need. It's in a different direction.

1087
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,720
Be safe.

1088
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,400
Your hand.

1089
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,800
Up next, tonight

1090
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,600
is your favorite Electro Night!

1091
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,560
I want to know,

1092
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,240
are you guys ready?

1093
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,200
Pump it up!

1094
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:12,260
♫ The quiet snow ♫

1095
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:19,860
♫ Suddenly cascaded ♫

1096
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:30,340
♫ My sight frozen at your appearance ♫

1097
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:37,260
♫ I could not believe it,
holding my breath ♫

1098
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:45,020
♫ A feeling strikes at my heart ♫

1099
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:52,740
♫ Heart beating wildly,
crossed the boundary ♫
