00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,910
I'm saved.

3
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,290
Mr. Ai, are you OK?

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:23,900
I'm fine.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,130
Go and check-in to your room.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,400
Why aren't you returning to your room?

7
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,330
Now that I've brought you here,

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,450
I should go back now.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,970
Go back? Where are you going?

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,220
Dongshan Recuperation Center.

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,660
Dongshan Recuperation Center?

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,870
It's in the opposite direction
from where we alighted just now.

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,120
Mr. Ai, you should've said so earlier.

14
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,530
Doesn't matter.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,410
It's faster for me to walk alone.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,100
Go quickly.

17
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,570
I'm going back.

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,570
Wait.

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,340
No need. This...

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,450
Put this on.

21
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,460
And also this.

22
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,289
Wait here.

23
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,410
I'm going upstairs to take something.

24
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,530
I'll be right back.

25
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,260
Wait for me. Don't go.

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,980
Wait for me.

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,180
[Sweet Teeth]
[Episode 4]

28
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,420
Double 6.

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,320
Chen Chen,

30
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,850
time to sleep.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,680
No, no. There's none.

32
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,610
A pair of K.

33
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,240
You... You're on your own now.

34
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:47,880
Sister Chen,

35
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,090
where's your treasure chest?

36
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,840
Sister Chen!

37
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,729
There. It's over there.

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,410
Did you fall ill?

39
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,410
Zeng Li, where were you just now?

40
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,720
You didn't pick up my calls.

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,600
What did I tell you?

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,039
Return the phone to Aunt.

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,770
Return it.

44
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,490
Zeng Li.

45
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:00,950
Be good.

46
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,840
Hey!

47
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,850
Where do you think you're going?

48
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,640
Where do you think you're going?

49
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,690
Hurry up. Are you playing or not?

50
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,650
Is it warm?

51
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,759
Yes, it is.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,200
I need to use it.

53
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,280
Zeng Li!

54
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,160
Hurry up.

55
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,210
Where is he?

56
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,079
Sorry, just now, there was a

57
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,410
tall man here, where did he go?

58
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,810
He's already left.

59
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,850
He told me to give this to you.

60
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,370
Thank you.

61
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,570
[He shouldn't have walked far.]

62
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,210
Just now, it took us an hour

63
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,290
to walk from the car to the hotel.

64
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,610
Now, it's only been 20 minutes

65
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,590
since Mr. Ai left.

66
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,600
It doesn't make sense.

67
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,810
He should be around here.

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,290
Where did he go?

69
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
It's fine. It's fine.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's just an owl.

71
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,710
An owl.

72
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,680
[The mountain road is covered with snow.]

73
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,480
[Everywhere I see is a vast
expanse of whiteness.]

74
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,880
[The cold wind roared,]

75
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,160
[such that I could barely
keep my eyes open.]

76
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,290
My goodness,

77
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,680
can't I think of something else?

78
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,570
[Within the mountain, I saw a]

79
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,810
[black object moving.]

80
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,640
[It seems to be a human.]

81
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,200
[I thought, could it be
he's the same as me,]

82
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,290
[having also lost his way?]

83
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,130
[When I was about to walk over,]

84
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,410
[he suddenly opened his mouth.]

85
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,570
[Liu Bao Chang.]

86
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,010
[Liu Bao Chang.]

87
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,120
Go away!

88
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,520
Don't come over!

89
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,570
Don't come over! Go away!

90
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,409
Go away!

91
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,080
It's me, Ai Jing Chu.

92
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,630
It really is me.

93
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,120
Ai Jing Chu?

94
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,510
You almost scared me to death.

95
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,280
Forgive me.

96
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,420
What are you doing here?

97
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,580
I came to look for you.

98
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,580
Look for me?

99
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,220
You're having a fever,

100
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,780
yet you purposely saw me to the hotel.

101
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,220
I'll worry

102
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,070
if you walk back alone,

103
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,490
so I brought you some medicine.

104
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,450
Here, I'll place them inside.

105
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,880
Remember to take it when you go back.

106
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,930
There's a heat pack as well.

107
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,860
Carry it.

108
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,740
And also, this umbrella.

109
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,580
Here.

110
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,740
You walked so far in the night,

111
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,460
just to bring me these stuff?

112
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,840
Yes. Now that I've brought these to you,

113
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,300
I'll go back first.

114
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,700
When you arrive,

115
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,580
message me

116
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,690
to tell me you arrived safely.

117
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,180
I'll get going.

118
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,980
Zeng Li,

119
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,370
the hotel

120
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,220
should have rooms available still, right?

121
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,330
That we have to find out from the staff.

122
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,640
Let's go.

123
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,560
No, you don't have to see me off.

124
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,400
It's troublesome enough as it is.

125
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,810
I couldn't walk any further.

126
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,340
Really.

127
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,240
I don't think I can make it

128
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,930
to Dongshan Recuperation Center.

129
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,860
OK, let's go.

130
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,250
I'd better give you a hand.

131
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,730
Thank you.

132
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,420
Mr. Ai,

133
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,490
when you walked alone just now,

134
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,370
weren't you scared?

135
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,730
It was all right.

136
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,860
Just that it's a little cold.

137
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,810
Mr. Ai, hang in there.

138
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,890
We're almost there.

139
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,860
OK.

140
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,660
Oh, right, Mr. Ai.

141
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,540
Did you see the owl just now?

142
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,460
No.

143
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,370
I saw it just now.

144
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,490
It's so scary.

145
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,890
The face of that owl

146
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,130
resembled "Liu Bao Chang."

147
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,420
Who's "Liu Bao Chang"?

148
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
There's no room left?

149
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,710
Two companies having staff bonding event.

150
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,290
There really is no room left.

151
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,740
What do we do now?

152
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,780
Hello, Hi.

153
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,100
This is Dongshan Hot Spring Hotel.

154
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,300
How can I help you?

155
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,600
[He seems to be feeling unwell.]

156
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:57,860
[What to do?]

157
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,100
[It can't be helped. The only way is....]

158
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,640
Luckily no one was in
the corridor just now.

159
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,890
Thank you.

160
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,650
Why not, tonight,

161
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,800
you'll just sleep here,

162
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,320
and we'll decide what to do when
we wake up tomorrow morning.

163
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,620
I still think

164
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,820
it isn't ideal.

165
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,760
Why don't

166
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,760
I lie here for a while,

167
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,920
and when the fever's subsided a little,

168
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,830
I'll leave right away.

169
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,270
It's midnight now,

170
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,240
and I'll worry if you go out
alone this late at night.

171
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,800
Besides, I feel bad.

172
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,310
Don't worry.

173
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,870
I'm a righteous person.

174
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,159
I won't do anything to you.

175
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,600
Don't worry.

176
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,159
Are you a righteous person?

177
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,600
Of course.

178
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,480
I'm also down with a fever.

179
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,100
OK.

180
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
I believe in you.

181
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,520
[Those gossipy colleagues of mine]

182
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,830
[must never find out.]

183
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,040
Zeng Li, are you in?

184
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,430
Zeng Li, are you in?

185
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,280
[Just what
I'm most afraid about right now.]

186
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,410
[Could it be we were discovered just now?]

187
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,400
Oh no.

188
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,350
It's Wu Wan Xia.

189
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,750
She loves to gossip.

190
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,400
Let's pretend we're not in.

191
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,510
Zeng Li, I heard your phone ringing.

192
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,430
Why didn't you answer me?

193
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,480
What's going on?

194
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:29,990
Did you faint?

195
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,360
Or maybe fell ill?

196
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,799
Don't tell me she's dead.

197
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,070
Even if you don't open the door,

198
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,039
she'll open it anyway.

199
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,720
Zeng Li!

200
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,309
Stay still.

201
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,230
I'm going to get someone to open the door.

202
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,679
[This is bad. It's over.]

203
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,990
What do I do?

204
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,070
Sorry.

205
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,360
Wan Xia.

206
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,830
I've been knocking for a long time.

207
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,920
Why didn't you answer me even once?

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,780
What were you doing?

209
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,920
I was taking a bath just now.

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,910
I didn't hear you.

211
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,440
You're wearing so many layers
for someone who was bathing.

212
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:07,710
Just now, you took from us

213
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,840
so much stuff.

214
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,270
Did you hide them in your blanket?

215
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,400
I took a nap after bathing,

216
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,920
that's why the blanket is messy.

217
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,200
So, just now,

218
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,620
you took so much stuff,

219
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,680
what were those for?

220
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,640
I... I...

221
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,320
I left my mobile phone in the courtyard,

222
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,710
and I went to search for it.

223
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,320
But I'm asking you,

224
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,960
you took so much stuff just now.

225
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,670
What were those for?

226
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,190
Zeng Li, you...

227
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,200
I caught a cold.

228
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,400
Go back quickly.

229
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,280
I don't want you to catch it.

230
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,600
Isn't your friend going to come?

231
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
You're going to sleep already?

232
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,880
My friend...

233
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,600
She couldn't come tonight
because something happened.

234
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,440
Go back and sleep quickly.

235
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,530
OK, fine. I'll go.

236
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,530
I'm taking back the heat pack.

237
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,850
It really does feel warm.

238
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,330
Zeng Li, listen to me.

239
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,050
Wearing these clothes to go to sleep,

240
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,000
you'll only feel more and
more uncomfortable later.

241
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,170
Leave

242
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,330
quickly.

243
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,240
Fine,

244
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,600
I'll go.

245
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,560
I'll just go.

246
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,960
What's the big deal?

247
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,890
Mr. Ai, it's fine now.

248
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,290
Mr. Ai!

249
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,250
Mr. Ai!

250
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,480
Mr. Ai, what happened to you?

251
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,800
Why isn't he breathing?

252
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,570
Mr. Ai!

253
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,850
Mr. Ai, don't scare me!

254
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,570
CPR.

255
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,690
Right here.

256
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,900
Mr. Ai!

257
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,810
Mr. Ai!

258
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,700
Mr. Ai!

259
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,810
Mr. Ai!

260
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,060
Mr. Ai!

261
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,900
Mr. Ai!

262
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,100
Mr. Ai!

263
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,540
Mr. Ai!

264
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,580
You gave me such a fright.

265
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,700
It's true that I almost
suffocated to death.

266
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,530
I didn't do it on purpose.

267
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,380
As you know,

268
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,260
that colleague of mine

269
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,200
loves to gossip.

270
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,160
If she sees me sleeping...

271
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,120
Sees both of us in the same room,

272
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,270
I'd be dead meat.

273
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,860
I feel you.

274
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,650
It does you no good.

275
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,860
You should sleep.

276
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,890
I'm going to take a bath.

277
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,690
Zeng Li,

278
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,180
with your CPR technique,

279
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,580
I wouldn't have survived just now.

280
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,340
Zeng Li, are you asleep?

281
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,060
You can answer me if you're asleep?

282
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,970
I ran out of water, but I'm still thirsty.

283
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,770
You can drink mine.

284
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,900
Thank you.

285
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,180
[What should I do? Let's count sheep.]

286
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,840
[One sheep, two sheep,]

287
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,010
[roast lamb leg, mutton hot pot...]

288
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,420
Mr. Ai, are you asleep?

289
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,340
I think he's asleep.

290
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,120
I'm awake. What's wrong?

291
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,060
I thought you've fallen asleep.

292
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,740
I was about to,

293
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,730
and I heard you calling for me.

294
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,800
I just, all of a sudden,

295
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,030
I couldn't fall asleep.

296
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,480
Do you still have the
earpiece I gave you earlier?

297
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,220
It's in the pocket of my coat.

298
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,100
I'll take it for you.

299
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,340
No need.

300
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,370
I'll do it.

301
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,700
[Seems like I'm becoming
more and more awake.]

302
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,490
[What should I eat for breakfast?]

303
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,220
Zeng Li,

304
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,010
I suddenly remembered.

305
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:18,940
What is it?

306
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,700
I remembered

307
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,300
who "Liu Bao Chang"  is.

308
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,170
I...

309
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,650
What's wrong with you?

310
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,060
Why bring up this name?

311
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,570
So, what happened to him in the end?

312
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,990
Don't ask me. I have no idea.

313
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,050
Zeng Li,

314
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,770
good night.

315
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,850
You haven't eaten yet, right?

316
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,079
Fried chicken,

317
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,700
french fries,

318
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,859
coke.

319
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,220
Brother,

320
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,849
do you think these are the food I can eat?

321
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:12,900
Sister,

322
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,569
where am I going to find
salad for you at this hour?

323
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:15,900
Besides,

324
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,780
Uncle fell ill,

325
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,660
yet you're still going on diet.

326
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,569
Where's your conscience?

327
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:19,910
What's the relationship
between those two matters?

328
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,310
The relationship is,

329
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,160
when you're feeling down,

330
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,750
having food with high calories

331
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,069
will increase your level of happiness.

332
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,000
Come on, eat.

333
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,640
You'll have energy to look
after Uncle when you're full.

334
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,520
No.

335
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,200
Even if it's the end of the world,

336
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,720
I'm also going to say no to calorie.

337
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,800
These sweet and sour chicken wings,

338
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,710
coated with a thin layer of

339
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,000
peanut butter on the outside.

340
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,510
Why are Koreans

341
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,350
so skilled at making chicken wings?

342
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,440
The cheese is still warm.

343
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,840
Stuff like ketchup

344
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,920
are outdated.

345
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,790
French fries with cheese

346
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,030
is truly a fragrant combo.

347
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,280
Look.

348
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,960
Is this just a coke?

349
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,030
No, this is coke with lemon.

350
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,720
A cup of coke

351
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,270
with two slices of lemon,

352
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,070
it gives soul to the coke.

353
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:34,960
It's great.

354
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,310
Deng Hao Ran!

355
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,590
I hate you.

356
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,610
It's fine.

357
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,390
No need to refrain
yourself in front of me.

358
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,440
I'm not going to marry you anyway.

359
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,350
Thanks for that.

360
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,510
You feel much better now, right?

361
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,600
That's good.

362
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,880
Dr. Hao, how's my father?

363
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,920
The diagnostic report is out.

364
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,570
Your father's fine.

365
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,520
After taking antihypertensive drugs

366
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,110
and IV drips overnight, he should be fine.

367
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,720
I'm going to get a nurse to
ready the prescription medicine.

368
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,630
Wait here for awhile.

369
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,320
Thank you.

370
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,200
Thank you.

371
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,200
I'm going to take a look at my father.

372
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,440
Deng Hao Ran!

373
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,440
I ate 2,000 kcals for nothing.

374
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,550
You didn't.

375
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,680
You enjoyed it.

376
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,990
So...

377
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,350
So, why didn't you eat it?

378
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,960
I'm on diet.

379
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,960
You're on diet?

380
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,070
You're on diet?

381
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
-You're on diet?
-It hurts.

382
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
-You're on diet?
-It hurts.

383
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,200
We're in the hospital.

384
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,880
Stop fooling around.

385
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,920
I'll give you serious injuries

386
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,270
so you could get hospitalized directly.

387
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,360
[He looks quite handsome]

388
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,480
[when he's asleep.]

389
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,480
[Is he dreaming?]

390
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,230
[What am I doing, staring at him?]

391
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,850
[I was almost scared to death last night.]

392
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,060
[Share blessings or withdraw from group]
[Ma Yi Yi：I was so scared last night.]

393
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,360
[Luckily my father was just having
an episode of hypertension.]

394
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,340
[Ma Yi Yi：Luckily my father was just
having an episode of hypertension.]

395
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,550
[Zeng Li, I'm going to visit
Dongshan Temple later.]

396
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,820
[Ma Yi Yi：Zeng Li, I'm going to
visit Dongshan Temple later.]

397
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,360
[On my way there,]

398
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,820
[Ma Yi Yi：I'll look for you at
Dongshan Hot Spring Hotel on the way.]

399
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,680
[I'll go look for you at
Dongshan Hot Spring Hotel.]

400
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,220
[Wu Yin：Yi Yi, the temperature's
dropped recently.]

401
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,160
[Yi Yi, the weather's turned cold lately.]

402
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,060
[Wu Yin：Hypertensive patient
must keep themselves warm,]

403
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,040
[Patients with hypertension
must keep themselves warm,]

404
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,620
[Wu Yin：especially their
limbs and the head]

405
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,680
[especially their limbs and the head.]

406
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,820
[Wu Yin：Tell Uncle not to eat food
items with high cholesterol.]

407
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,800
[Tell Uncle to stop eating]

408
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,110
[food items with high cholesterol.]

409
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,340
[Ma Yi Yi]

410
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,880
[Zeng Li, is my bed still there?]

411
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,120
[It's not taken over]

412
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,920
[by your lover, right?]

413
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,720
[If I take photo of Ai Jing Chu sleeping]

414
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,720
[and send to the group,]

415
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,920
[I'm sure it'll catch the
two of them off guard.]

416
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,680
[It's a skew.]

417
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,350
[So hot.]

418
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,100
[Outpatient Building]

419
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,110
Next, No. 34.

420
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,950
Who is No. 34?

421
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,950
I'm No. 34.

422
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,080
I'll see you outside.

423
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,960
Come in first.

424
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,760
-Wait here for a minute.
-Thank you.

425
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,110
Sister, I'm here.

426
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,680
Your wound was treated yesterday.

427
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,720
What are you doing here?

428
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,440
Sister, look.

429
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,160
The feeling of redness, swelling,
heat and pain are present.

430
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,550
I think it's inflamed.

431
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,270
Xiaoya,

432
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,120
bring him to the next room,

433
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,030
remove his dressing and check.

434
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,000
Wait a second. Wait.

435
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,790
Sister, aren't you going
to examine it yourself?

436
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,640
It hurts.

437
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,680
It hurts so much.

438
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,110
The dressing is so white.
There's no suppuration.

439
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,240
I don't think it's inflamed.

440
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,280
She'll just examine it for you.

441
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
If it is,

442
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,470
can I come and see you?

443
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,400
Can you not come if it isn't?

444
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,830
Follow me.

445
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
In that case, goodbye, Sister.

446
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,590
Next.

447
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,310
I'll take some of these,

448
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,960
this.

449
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,320
Zeng Li,

450
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,080
since when did you stoop so low

451
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,240
to be stealing eggs?

452
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,440
This is takeaway.

453
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,850
You can't do that in a buffet.

454
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,820
Put it back.

455
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,160
Vietnamese pho.

456
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,030
What are you? A robber?

457
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,680
It's not rice noodles at all.

458
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,800
Zeng Li, something's up with you.

459
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,790
There isn't.

460
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,700
Be honest.

461
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,510
Are you hiding someone?

462
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,400
I know. You must've watched
too many spy movies.

463
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,680
Are you hiding a handsome guy?

464
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,110
Seems like it's idol dramas
you've watched one too many.

465
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,230
I don't believe you. Show me.

466
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:05,670
No.

467
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,550
Show me.

468
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,670
Who's there?

469
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,830
Zeng Li, you...

470
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,710
You must be hiding a man.

471
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,470
My eggs!

472
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,510
You must be hiding a man.

473
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,960
You must be hiding a man.

474
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,110
Chen Chen!

475
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,990
Help!

476
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,870
Help!

477
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,720
My son is injured. Can someone help?

478
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,270
A nail...

479
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,400
A nail got inside his mouth.

480
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,280
My son.

481
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,950
Whose client is it?

482
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,110
Call the ambulance, quick.

483
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,920
I'll... I'll do it. I'll do it.

484
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,070
Is any doctor around?

485
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,750
Go get us a doctor, quick.

486
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,670
Make a phone call.

487
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,510
How did this happen?

488
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,960
Help get us a doctor, quick.

489
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,310
How did this happen?

490
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,750
Doctor.

491
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,000
Doctor.

492
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,630
Mr. Ai.

493
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,270
What's wrong?

494
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,880
Here's what happened.

495
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,360
My colleague's son accidentally fell

496
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,670
and a steel nail pierced
through his mouth.

497
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,400
There's so much blood.

498
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,440
Can you please help to examine him?

499
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,750
OK, one second.

500
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,630
I'll come out right away.

501
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,840
OK.

502
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,710
Then I'll wait for you outside.

503
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,590
Mr. Ai.

504
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,430
Let's go.

505
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,270
Aren't you dressed

506
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,080
too little?

507
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,240
You have a fever still.

508
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,040
Mr. Ai, wait.

509
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,080
They say the mountain roads
are sealed due to heavy snow.

510
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,440
The ambulance couldn't
come for the time being.

511
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,810
What do we do?

512
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,740
I'm a doctor.

513
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,630
That's right.

514
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,240
The doctor is here.

515
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:30,750
Is the ambulance here?

516
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,630
Doctor.

517
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,160
The mountain roads are
sealed due to heavy snow.

518
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,170
Ambulance couldn't come.

519
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,920
Here, child, open your mouth.

520
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:37,830
Let me have a look.

521
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,070
Let doctor have a look.

522
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,520
It'll be OK. It won't take long.

523
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,830
How is it?

524
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,200
One of his tooth was knocked out.

525
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,080
Also, a steel nail

526
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,070
punctured through his lower jaw.

527
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,400
Luckily the wound isn't deep.

528
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,510
We just have to remove it,

529
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,000
but it won't be easy to stop the
bleeding on the inside of his mouth,

530
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,440
that's why he'll need stitches.

531
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,110
If we couldn't go to the hospital,

532
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,320
we could only do it here.

533
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,880
OK.

534
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,350
We have an infirmary.

535
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Carry the child to the infirmary first.

536
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,680
Come on. OK.

537
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,270
Come on, slowly.

538
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,560
That settles it.

539
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,440
Mr. Ai.

540
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
That's right, come on.

541
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,760
Thank you.

542
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,800
Let's go.

543
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,310
It'll be OK.

544
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:20,950
It'll be OK.

545
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,030
Chen Chen is a good boy.

546
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,470
That's right. Good boy.

547
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,120
Chen Chen is a good boy.

548
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,000
Lie still.

549
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,000
Chen Chen.

550
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,640
Can this doctor handle the surgery?

551
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,320
He's an attending physician

552
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,590
from Donghu University
Hospital's dental department,

553
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,470
Ai Jing Chu.

554
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,470
He's very skilled.

555
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,320
If you don't believe me, look.

556
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:34,880
The straightening of my teeth

557
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,750
was done by him.

558
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,710
You have to queue for few
days for his consultation.

559
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,360
Don't be ridiculous.

560

00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,920
Of course it is.

747
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,929
I must treat you to a meal.

748
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,170
All the restaurants in Donghu,

749
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,250
you can choose any.

750
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,600
Abalone, lobster, shark fins,

751
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,760
or any fine delicacy.

752
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:40,650
Anything is fine.

753
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:41,170
Dr. Ai,

754
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,520
when are you available?

755
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,940
[Cousin：Gosh, he's too handsome.]

756
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,520
[He's too good-looking.]

757
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,100
[Eldest Aunt：Zeng Li is finally dating,
and with such a good man too.]

758
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,750
[Zeng Li's finally in a relationship,]

759
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,040
[and it's with such a good man as well.]

760
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,260
[Second Aunt：He's Donghu University
Hospital's attending physician, too.]

761
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,800
[He's the attending physician of
Donghu University Hospital too.]

762
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,180
[Cousin：Wow, he became an attending
physician at such a young age?]

763
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,080
[He became an attending
physician at such a young age.]

764
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,060
[Eldest Uncle：Oh my, when Xiao Zeng said
to pick up a friend, it's her boyfriend.]

765
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,480
[So, when Xiao Zeng said
to pick up her friend,

766
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,080
[it's her boyfriend?]

767
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,160
[What are you all talking about?]

768
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,700
[Zeng Li：What are you all talking about]

769
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,940
[Group name: No work, gossip only]
[Zeng Li, remove from group]

770
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,330
[Who added Zeng Li into the group?]

771
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,850
[Hurry.]

772
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,540
[You were removed from
group by "Second Cousin"]

773
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,370
Xiao Zeng.

774
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,680
Let's have a meal together
with Dr. Ai some time.

775
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,570
My treat.

776
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,520
No need.

777
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,770
You don't have to go to such trouble.

778
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,890
These few days, when are you available?

779
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,330
You can choose any restaurant you want.

780
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,560
Director Li, if you really want to

781
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,810
repay Dr. Ai's kindness,

782
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,950
you just have to look after

783
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,200
Zeng Li well.

784
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,480
What are you talking about?

785
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,210
I get it.

786
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,370
I get it now.

787
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:32,850
Someone's calling.

788
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,370
OK. I won't disturb your work.

789
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,250
You all can carry on.

790
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,320
Hello.

791
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,170
Hello.

792
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,200
How is the child?

793
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,290
He's fine.

794
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,200
We just coaxed him to sleep.

795
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,450
There was such a large wound in his mouth,

796
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,890
and it doesn't hurt at all now.

797
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,400
Stitching of the wound was done so well.

798
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,260
Your skill level

799
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,500
is too impressive.

800
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,880
If Xiao Zeng marries you in future,

801
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
she's guaranteed to lead an easy life.

802
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,600
Sister Chen, you misunderstood.

803
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,450
There's nothing between me and Mr. Ai.

804
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,160
I didn't. You don't have
to explain any further.

805
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:56,690
I'm sorry.

806
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,560
I'll answer this call first.

807
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,450
Sure. Go ahead.

808
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:00,850
I'm telling you,

809
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,080
you have to lecture her for me.

810
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,260
-I've told her many times.
-Brother-in-law.

811
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,410
She just won't listen to me.

812
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,570
I'm still at the hotel.

813
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,640
Xiao Zeng.

814
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:07,850
Keep driving inwards.

815
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:08,560
Just listen. That's right.

816
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,760
-Walk to the end and you'll arrive.
-Just listen.

817
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,370
Dr. Ai will be such an ideal boyfriend.

818
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,890
He's kind, good-looking,

819
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,000
and a skilled doctor at that.

820
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,000
-Make sure you grab this opportunity.
-Zeng Li.

821
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,680
My family is here.

822
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,850
Your family is here?

823
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,160
See you, Mr. Ai.

824
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,090
My

825
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,160
coat.

826
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,400
Coat?

827
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,880
He left his coat in your room.

828
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,080
Coat.

829
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,650
Coat.

830
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,440
What's this?

831
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,730
Dr. Ai spent the night
in her room last night?

832
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,600
Sister Chen, that's not it.

833
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,080
Dr. Ai,

834
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,960
our Zeng Li is single still.

835
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,480
Look, you're also single.

836
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,040
You two...

837
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,040
It's a misunderstanding.

838
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,730
There was no room available last night,

839
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:45,690
so we had no choice.

840
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,640
-You had no choice?
-You had no choice?

841
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,760
That's not it.

842
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,690
Yesterday afternoon,

843
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,640
we met at the base of the mountain,

844
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,560
and we had no other choice.

845
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,570
No, that's not it.

846
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,490
It's because he was having a fever.

847
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,480
I know.

848
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,000
Understood.

849
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,440
We understand.

850
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,880
We're not the type of
people who like to gossip.

851
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,810
No, we're not.

852
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,770
So, no need to be anxious.

853
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,160
Things between you youngsters,

854
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,770
are up to you youngsters to decide.

855
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,330
We won't talk anymore.

856
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:06,610
Take more photos.

857
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,080
Zeng Li.

858
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,880
You're leaving already?

859
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,440
We haven't finished taking photos.

860
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,330
He's leaving already?

861
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,440
Dr. Ai.

862
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,810
Dr. Ai.

863
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:14,920
They're indeed quite compatible.

864
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,210
This... Why is he leaving?

865
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,250
The prettiest girl in our library

866
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,730
finally has a boyfriend.

867
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,330
Are we going to have
wedding candy to eat soon?

868
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,770
Anyway, Dr. Ai and our
Zeng Li are really compatible.

869
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,880
After he bought me a ticket,

870
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,810
he left.

871
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,040
I looked everywhere for him.

872
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,950
He might've left by now.

873
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,540
You didn't ask for his WeChat?

874
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,140
That isn't your style.

875
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,500
[After what happened with Zhang Teng,]

876
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,580
I daren't take initiative anymore.

877
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,100
It's too bad.

878
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,270
Such a handsome guy

879
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,230
and so kind too.

880
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,790
He's exactly my ideal type.

881
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,990
You should stop thinking about him then.

882
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:46,980
It means you two

883
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,860
aren't meant to be.

884
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,310
Go look for Zeng Li, quick.

885
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,710
[Who knows what she's doing?]

886
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,990
[She hasn't picked up calls.]

887
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,670
-Dr. Wu, you've got a patient.
-Coming.

888
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,420
I'll talk to you again.

889
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,790
My patient's here. I'm hanging up.

890
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,350
I'm not done yet. Wu Yingg!

891
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,420
Hello?

892
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,910
I'll just give this a try.

893
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,500
I ask for your blessing.

894
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,310
Grant me a good relationship.

895
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,990
Also, grant my two good friends,

896
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,800
Zeng Li and Wu Yingg the same.

897
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,350
Please.

898
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,940
[A peaceful life]

899
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:39,940
Wait.

900
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,080
[My wish was heard.]
