[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,240
I... I was just going to
turn off the lights for you.

3
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,910
He kissed me.

4
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,670
He's probably drunk.

5
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,519
His lips

6
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
are a little soft.

7
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,910
Just like my legs going weak.

[Sweet Teeth]
[Episode 16]

9
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,630
It hurts.

10
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,630
Go to bed.

11
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,680
Stop playing video games.

12
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,630
You...

13
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,190
You're a bad boy.

14
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,160
It's been so long since

15
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,270
you played video games with me.

16
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,430
Look at those noob girls,

17
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,270
all of them have
boyfriends as their guide.

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,400
And me?

19
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,600
I can only

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,910
get beaten by their boyfriends.

21
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,400
Then, tomorrow,

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,630
I'll beat them up, OK?

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,760
Go to bed earlier tonight.

24
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,240
Just choose an assist for me.

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,160
Win a game with me,

26
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,190
and I'll go to bed immediately.

27
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,990
You said so yourself.

28
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,070
[What's with this assist?]

29
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,680
[He's rushed to the opposite
side to get killed again.]

30
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,430
[Did the boss give you a drumstick?]

31
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,710
He's scolding me again.

32
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,550
Just quit if you don't wish to play.

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,990
Don't scold girls.

34
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,030
[I'll quit.]

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,590
[Let's see how you'll guide
a female on your own.]

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,400
Don't, don't.

37
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,920
I'm dying.

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,750
We can't lose.

39
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,550
I don't want to lose stars.

40
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,710
I won't let it happen.

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,590
Go, go!

42
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,200
Kill, kill!

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,240
One more health point left. Hurry!

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,480
Give me five!

45
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,590
We won the game.

46
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,550
You can go to sleep now, right?

47
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,990
You're so good.

48
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,640
Not only you're good,

49
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,079
you're also capable

50
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,200
and cute.

51
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,680
In this world, no one else

52
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,550
treats me as good as you.

53
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,200
But you're so much younger than me,

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,870
and I still like you so.

55
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,710
I really,

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,680
really,

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,829
like you very much.

58
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,310
Are you serious,

59
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,120
or are you drunk?

60
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,079
If you'll also say this to me

61
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,589
when you're sober,

62
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,480
it'll be great.

63
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,310
I don't want to take advantage of you.

64
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,680
Tomorrow morning when you wake up,

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
you'll regret it.

66
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,600
I won't regret.

67
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,160
Ma Yi Yi,

68
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
why are you drinking on your own?

69
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,720
Where's Zeng Li?

70
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,600
She wrapped herself in a blanket

71
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,630
after coming back to our room.

72
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,360
That's probably what it
means by yearning for love.

73
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,430
After all, my sister

74
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,190
has never dated anyone before this.

75
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,120
Suddenly finding herself

76
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,280
caught in between two men.

77
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,600
It's understandable that
she's feeling a bit restless.

78
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,040
She's lacking in experience.

79
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,990
She needs more training.

80
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,280
Yu Yi, how are you feeling?

81
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,550
Yu Yi!

82
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
Tell me, where does it hurt?

83
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,240
Yu Yi

84
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,430
I don't dare to move you around.

85
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,430
You scared me.

86
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,190
Are you available now?

87
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,280
I need to talk to you.

88
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,480
I was going to talk to you.

89
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,950
Easy.

90
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
Are you kneading dough?

91
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,280
You're injured so badly,

92
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,159
yet you didn't even utter a word.

93
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,040
Do you enjoy the feeling of

94
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,480
shouldering the weight
of the world so much?

95
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,840
No.

96
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,600
I didn't feel anything

97
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,870
during the day.

98
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,040
Just now, after I came back to the hotel.

99
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,280
suddenly,

100
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,800
I couldn't even bend my waist.

101
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,510
And before I took a bath,

102
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,950
I saw it was quite serious.

103
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,630
There's only this safflower
oil in my backpack,

104
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,630
and I couldn't reach behind my back,

105
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,720
so I could only come to you.

106
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,950
Oh, right.

107
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,070
Make sure you don't tell Zeng Li

108
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,840
about this.

109
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,870
Why? You're scared she'll worry about you?

110
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,510
Of course.

111
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,600
It's normal to have

112
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,630
a little injury or two on an outing.

113
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
I don't want to make everyone else

114
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,840
feel bad.

115
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,600
Besides,

116
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,040
after that time,

117
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,800
I scared her with the
falling-into-lake prank,

118
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,840
she never went with me

119
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,680
on a boating trip since.

120
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,870
That's why,

121
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,800
this time, I don't want her to

122
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,750
get traumatized about me and skiing.

123
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,990
A little towards here.

124
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,920
That's right.

125
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,480
If you knew,

126
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,990
why did you tell that kind of joke?

127
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,600
I like to joke with her.

128
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,550
She's so cute.

129
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,390
Did you know?

130
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,310
She'll believe anything you say to her.

131
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,120
It's quite problematic actually.

132
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,920
She'll even cry if you scare her.

133
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,480
Easy, easy.

134
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,120
Easy, easy.

135
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,950
That's right.

136
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,310
Ask you something.

137
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,040
Do you think

138
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,680
Zeng Li likes me?

139
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,510
I don't know.

140
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,040
Tell me how you feel.

141
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,840
For the past few days,

142
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,720
how did you feel about it?

143
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,310
I didn't feel anything.

144
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,800
Have you finished applying?

145
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,840
I'm almost done.

146
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,160
Right, so be it.

147
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,480
What I mean is,

148
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,990
I can't tell.

149
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,630
True. Why did I ask you?

150
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,280
We're the same type of
straightforward men.

151
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,390
So,

152
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,600
did you ask her about it?

153
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,510
No.

154
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,190
Before, when I saw her

155
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,720
writing the novel,

156
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,720
I was sure she likes me,

157
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
because she remembers

158
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,390
everything that happened between us

159
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,240
by heart.

160
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,480
Later, I heard

161
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,240
she's never dated anyone else since,

162
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
so I thought

163
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,120
maybe she's waiting for me.

164
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,630
But this time after I came back,

165
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,240
when we spend time with
each other face-to-face,

166
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,720
I really didn't have the feeling,

167
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,630
because the way she looked at me

168
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,080
was like a friend.

169
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,510
Just like someone she could trust,

170
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,030
a youngest uncle

171
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,030
who she could depend on.

172
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,670
Here you go.

173
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,560
What she's thinking,

174
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,910
probably she herself

175
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,720
will know.

176
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,600
I know,

177
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,440
that's why I'm in no rush

178
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,270
to get an answer from her.

179
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
After all, we were apart

180
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,120
for so long.

181
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,200
I think

182
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,270
she should give it some serious thought.

183
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,200
Who am I

184
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,270
to her?

185
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,150
[You should give her some
time to think about it.]

186
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,440
You were looking for me just now?

187
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,790
It's fine now.

188
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,030
I'll go to the infirmary

189
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,080
to bring you some ointment.

190
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:54,840
Wait here.

191
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,200
Sure, let's have a match.

192
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,320
Mr. Ai,

193
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,480
he's so cocky.

194
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,750
Let's teach him a lesson.

195
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,670
Wu Ying,

196
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,390
time for breakfast.

197
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,440
Get up.

198
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,080
Give her a call.

199
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,870
She's not answering.

200
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,240
Did you hear her ringtone?

201
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,440
Yes.

202
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,670
Didn't you say you're
going to eat breakfast?

203
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,030
Why are you all standing here?

204
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,270
We're here to wake Wu Ying,

205
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,360
but we realized she will
neither open the door

206
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,320
nor is she answering her phone.

207
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,870
She had so many drinks yesterday.

208
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,720
Did she get alcohol intoxication?

209
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,120
Are you serious?

210
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Will she be OK?

211
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,750
In that case,

212
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,960
I'll go and get the hotel staff.

213
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,270
Sure. You do that.

214
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,630
You're all here?

215
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,390
Good morning, Mr. Ai.

216
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:13,910
Good morning.

217
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,390
[As long as I don't find it embarrassing,]

218
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
[he'll be the one who's embarrassed.]

219
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,120
[She looks so calm.]

220
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,750
Mr. Ai, where's Liu Yu Cheng?

221
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,790
He didn't come back to
our room last night.

222
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,790
Could it be...

223
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,790
Liu Yu Cheng's inside?

224
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,630
Let me hear.

225
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,030
Don't push.

226
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,270
There's a sound.

227
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,630
Good morning, everyone.

228
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,240
Good morning.

229
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,960
Is Liu Yu Cheng inside?

230
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,840
Yes.

231
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:53,840
So,...

232
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,030
So, is everyone here?

233
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,870
Can we go and eat breakfast now?

234
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,150
He's still sleeping.

235
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,080
We're not going.

236
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,720
You guys go ahead.

237
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,960
Let's go.

238
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,440
As expected,

239
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,510
cats that catch mice don’t meow.

240
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,600
She's something.

241
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,510
You eat so little.

242
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,720
In this world,

243
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,790
the least stylish thing to do

244
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,480
is to post selfie on Moments

245
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
with the hotel's location.

246
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,790
Also,

247
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,480
turning breakfast buffet

248
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,120
into brunch buffet.

249
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,790
It's so strange.

250
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,510
What's so strange?

251
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,390
Aren't you two a little too quiet?

252
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,360
I remember in the past,

253
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,120
when you two meet each other,

254
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,270
you'll talk back to each other

255
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,150
as a way of showing respect.

256
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,600
Your older brother's tired today.

257
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,600
Why did you bring food for me?

258
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,910
Isn't... Isn't it your favourite?

259
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,840
I just helped to take it.

260
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,560
Where's mine?

261
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,270
You can eat mine.

262
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,960
You can have it as well.

263
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,630
I thought you took your own food.

264
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,790
Forget it.

265
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,360
I don't want food that's
handed out in contempt.

266
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,510
Eat your food.

267
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,150
Here, let me show you something good.

268
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,750
A girl you met recently?

269
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,320
How is it? Is she pretty?

270
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,480
Why does it feel like

271
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
she resembles Ma Yi Yi?

272
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,150
How so?

273
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,240
They look completely different.

274
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,670
Look, she obviously resembles her,

275
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,790
especially her eyes.

276
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,270
Oh, right.

277
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,670
Your ex-girlfriend,
Li Li, looked like this.

278
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,990
The previous ex,

279
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,870
and the one before that
also looked like this.

280
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,080
I realize the type of women you like

281
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,910
all look the same.

282
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,440
Go to hospital quickly

283
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,240
to cure your prosopagnosia.

284
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,200
Sure. Give me medical expenses.

285
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,200
Ask the person who gave you the disease.

286
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,360
What are you all talking about

287
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,510
so happily?

288
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,320
Why look at me?

289
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,030
[Seems like last night,]

290
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,440
[a lot of stuff happened.]

291
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,720
[Today, everyone]

292
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,510
[seems to be acting strangely.]

293
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,270
What's wrong?

294
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
About that...

295
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,240
I...

296
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,510
I booked spa session at 11 am.

297
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,150
It's almost time.

298
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,790
I'd better hurry.

299
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,870
You're going for spa?

300
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,480
What about me?

301
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,390
If you want to go,

302
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:25,990
you can join me.

303
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,790
I'm not going.

304
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,840
I'll stay in the hotel room.

305
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:33,720
That's fine.

306
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,790
Forget it.

307
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,870
It must be boring if you go alone.

308
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,240
I'll go with you.

309
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,150
OK.

310
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,240
Go and get changed.

311
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,870
Please take off your shirt,

312
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,510
and lie on the bed.

313
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,510
We'll come back in a while.

314
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,360
Sure, thank you.

315
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,630
[Why is she so calm about it,]

316
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,390
[as if nothing happened?]

317
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,030
Aren't you going to take off your shirt?

318
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,200
I'm not doing it.

319
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,150
Why?

320
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
I don't like taking off my clothes

321
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,120
and being touched by someone else.

322
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,390
I'll wait for you outside.

323
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,720
You're thirsty?

324
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,510
Deng Hao Ran,

325
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,910
can you act more naturally?

326
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,870
But I'm doing exactly that.

327
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,910
I...

328
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,510
If you don't know what to say,

329
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,240
just don't speak.

330
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,270
Don't look for things to say.

331
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,120
In that case...

332
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,119
What do you want to say? Just say it.

333
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,480
About what happened yesterday...

334
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,150
Yes... Yesterday...

335
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:12,960
Yesterday,

336
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,390
both of us were impulsive.

337
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,119
None of us should take it seriously.

338
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,430
This matter

339
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,630
is mainly my fault.

340
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm unreliable.

341
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,630
I get ahead of myself easily.

342
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,150
Of course it's your fault.

343
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,800
Luckily I'm broad-minded.

344
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:33,390
I'll just treat it as

345
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,600
being kissed by a pig.

346
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
Who are you scolding a pig?

347
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,150
Whoever answering me.

348
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,320
Right back at you.

349
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,430
You're so childish.

350
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,430
[Many things are just a
thought during the moment.]

351
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,670
[Suddenly, you like someone,]

352
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,800
[and suddenly you think of letting go.]

353
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,000
[Certain people, after
turn around and walk away,]

354
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,390
[you'll never meet each other again.]

355
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
[But others,]

356
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,430
[if you can't be lovers,]

357
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,320
[and are no longer friends,]

358
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,040
[I'd rather remain on the same spot.]

359
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,000
[None of us should take
the first step forward.]

360
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,710
Please wait a moment.

361
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,600
I'll bring your shoes over.

362
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,560
OK. Thank you.

363
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,600
Are you hungry?

364
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,360
Shall we go and eat some food?

365
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,390
I have a question.

366
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,600
You have to answer me honestly.

367
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,040
Do you like me

368
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,280
or not?

369
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,710
Yes.

370
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,320
Which kind of like?

371
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,840
It feels like novelty.

372
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,430
Who do you take me for?

373
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,800
I'll like any man that I came across?

374
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,840
So, what am I to you?

375
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,190
Boyfriend.

376
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,430
What?

377
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,230
Boyfriend.

378
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,840
Boy...

379
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,710
So, I'm your boyfriend now?

She's just jealous.

426
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,760

such an easy target.

00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:17,910
I know that,

568
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,320
towards how I remarry
after getting a divorce,

569
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,390
only to divorce

570
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,950
and remarry again,

571
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,520
you've always held a grudge.

572
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,190
Especially

573
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,190
divorcing your Uncle Deng.

574
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,360
He's very good to you,

575
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,430
and it also took you a lot of time

576
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,950
before blending in with this family.

577
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,360
I admit,

578
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,520
before this,

579
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,320
I did have this idea.

580
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,040
But I think

581
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,600
it's actually very selfish.

582
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,230
Each person only gets
to live their life once.

583
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
We only have one lifetime.

584
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,190
You're able to

585
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,600
live your life by following your heart,

586
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,320
in fact, I should support your decision.

587
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,760
Mother,

588
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,600
do you think Uncle Peng

589
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,120
is your destination?

590
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,600
I think he is.

591
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,120
I also hope that he is.

592
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,520
So, Zeng Li,

593
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,150
what about your destination?

594
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:34,630
Brother.

595
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,630
Quickly. Come on, they're here.

596
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,870
They're here.

597
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,710
De Fang,

598
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,430
Xiao Li,

599
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,670
Xiao Yi,

600
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,390
-you're all here.
-Yes.

601
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,470
Your uncle

602
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,120
was pacing back and
forth inside the house.

603
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,670
When he heard you've arrived,

604
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,760
he quickly ran outside.

605
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,950
Go inside the house
quickly and take a seat.

606
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,630
-Come on.
-OK.

607
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,870
-Come on.
-Let's go.

608
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,150
You've gotten better.

609
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,890
-Let's go in and take some rest.
-You have everyone's seniority

610
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,950
-in the family memorized.
-OK.

611
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,630
Of course.

612
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,280
I did my homework this time.

613
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,080
Let's go.

614
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,800
Come on.

615
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,840
Cheers. Cheers.

616
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,040
Happy New Year.

617
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:05,800
Happy New Year.

618
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,560
Back then, Xiao Li

619
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,230
was still a teenager.

620
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,230
Her personality

621
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,910
wasn't as outgoing.

622
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,040
She was always so quiet.

623
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,280
When we

624
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,190
have reunion dinner,

625
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,390
she won't say a word.

626
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,470
If we ask her to address the seniors,

627
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,120
she couldn't recognize anyone.

628
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:16,950
She was so anxious, she almost cried.

629
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,910
Sorry, Third Cousin.

630
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,470
I was indeed still young at that time.

631
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,040
It's fine. It's fine.

632
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,080
I still remember,

633
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,430
your youngest uncle's too impressive.

634
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,430
He stood up

635
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,320
and told you to call him

636
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,040
"youngest uncle",

637
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,360
he gave you a red packet.

638
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,520
He even said to us,

639
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,120
it's Lunar New Year.

640
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,230
Xiao Li shouldn't do this for nothing.

641
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,520
If she did it, she'll be
given a red packet.

642
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,800
That red packet was at least this thick,

643
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,360
you know?

644
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,520
Really?

645
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,120
The red packet had so much money inside?

646
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,630
That was when I received scholarship

647
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,320
and I didn't know how to spend it.

648
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,280
So, I could only bring it here

649
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,560
and give everyone a red packet.

650
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,360
Give everyone?

651
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,150
But I only saw

652
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,040
you giving to Xiao Li alone.

653
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,670
Come and get your red packet.

654
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,710
Xiao Li,

655
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,150
quick, greet your youngest uncle.

656
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,670
He has all the red packets ready.

657
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,230
Come on.

658
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,560
Come on.

659
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,150
The dumplings are here.

660
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,150
In future,

661
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,560
Xiao Li won't call

662
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,470
our Xiao Yi "Youngest Uncle".

663
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,520
Few years back,

664
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,910
when we told Yu Yi to come back to China,

665
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,470
he won't even listen to us.

666
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,870
But some time ago,

667
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,120
he saw you

668
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,080
writing an online novel,

669
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,560
and he just decided to come back.

670
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,000
Mother.

671
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:11,910
OK, OK.

672
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,950
Eat more, all of you.

673
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,840
There're some more in the kitchen.

674
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,560
Sure.

675
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,280
Sure, no problem.

676
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:15,950
Come on.

677
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,120
-Give these dumplings a try. Come on.
-Alright.

678
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,660
[Random amount RMB2,000, wishing my
family great health and happiness]

679
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,120
Yu Yi,

680
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:28,950
you're something.

681
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,040
You're giving out red packets
with such attractive sums.

682
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,670
Snatch the red packet quickly!

683
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,470
Snatch the red packet!

684
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,280
Wait. Give me a minute.

685
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,710
This is to pay for

686
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,560
what I owe you all before.

687
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,430
Next time,

688
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,120
don't make fun of me and Zeng Li.

689
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,280
Don't worry.

690
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,430
Come on, cheers.

691
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,190
Come on, cheers.

692
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,840
Happy New Year.

693
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,760
Happy New Year.

694
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,280
Mother, Happy New Year.

695
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,150
Happy New Year.

696
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,000
Happy New Year.

697
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,910
Happy New Year.

698
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,150
Happy New Year.

699
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,950
Mother,

700
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,280
seriously.

701
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,230
Today, in front of everyone else,

702
00:29:59,230 --> 00:29:59,600
why did you mention

703
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,360
what happened during my childhood?

704
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,870
It's nothing.

705
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,390
I haven't asked you yet.

706
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,840
How are things going between you two?

707
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,040
As a teacher yourself,

708
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,080
why are you so gossipy?

709
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,230
You're my son.

710
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,280
Can't I even ask you about it?

711
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,520
To be honest, about you
two dating each other,

712
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,710
from the beginning,

713
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,760
I didn't quite agree with it.

714
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,320
Although you're distant relatives

715
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,840
who are outside of three generations,

716
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
but if rumours spread,

717
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,430
it still doesn't sound so nice.

718
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,950
Look at you.

719
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,080
Because of her, you gave up
high salaries, green card,

720
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,280
and so on.

721
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,190
I really don't know what to do with you.

722
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,000
Mother,

723
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,000
The reason I came back this time

724
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,470
is mostly to look after you and father,

725
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,080
right?

726
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,800
Quit it.

727
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,000
Don't use me and your father

728
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,080
as an excuse.

729
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,000
This time,

730
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,800
if you don't bring me
back my daughter-in-law,

731
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,560
I won't thank you for it.

732
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,670
[He gave up the green card
to come back to China?]

733
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,840
[Is it really because]

734
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,910
[he saw the novel I wrote,]

735
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,630
[that's why he came back from abroad?]

736
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,320
-I'm here!
-Run slowly.

737
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,870
I was looking forward to setting
fireworks on Lunar New Year.

738
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,040
Youngest Uncle.

739
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,560
Not bad.

740
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,390
In the past, you liked
to set off fireworks,

741
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,190
but you were afraid you'll get burned.

742
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,760
During each Lunar New Year,

743
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,870
you'd beg me to set those off for you.

744
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,430
You've really grown up now.

745
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,320
You even dare to set off
fireworks on your own.

746
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,000
Of course.

747
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,910
I'm no longer the same as before.

748
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,840
I know.

749
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
Everyone says

750
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,840
I'm different from before,

751
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,120
that I became much more outgoing.

752
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,910
But I know,

753
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,870
it's all thanks to you.

754
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,040
Thank you,

755
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,150
Youngest Uncle.

756
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,760
You're indeed different from before.

757
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,870
In the past, when I told
you to call me that,

758
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,840
you always refused to do so.

759
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,120
Nowadays,

760
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,430
you have no problem with calling me that.

761
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,910
That's because in your heart,

762
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,520
I'm just

763
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,630
your youngest uncle.

764
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,760
Yu Yi, I...

765
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,600
That day, when all of
us were playing the game,

766
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
"I ever",

767
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,600
you said the person you like was present.

768
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,950
That person wasn't me, right?

769
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,390
It's Ai Jing Chu?

770
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,320
Just now,

771
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,320
before you answer this question,

772
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,390
I was still

773
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,230
feeling lucky,

774
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,230
It seems I no longer have a chance.

775
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,320
I'm sorry.

776
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,520
Silly.

777
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,560
Why are you apologizing to me?

778
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,950
I'm the one who missed the opportunity.

779
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,430
It's not your fault.

780
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,360
Ai Jing Chu

781
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,390
is a really good man.

782
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,230
You like him?

783
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,670
I think he's worth it.

784
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,630
But

785
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,950
I don't even know

786
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,120
what he thinks about me.

787
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,760
I think

788
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,000
he likes you very much.

789
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,280
Many people say

790
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,950
women's instincts are accurate.

791
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,870
But I feel,

792
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,280
when you care about someone,

793
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,080
men's instincts are just as accurate.

794
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,120
You two can have a match.

795
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,560
I'll take videos for you two.

796
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,320
Actually,

797
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,150
in that day's video,

798
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,430
he didn't video a lot of things.

799
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,950
It's just that,

800
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,710
he didn't capture me
that much in the video.

801
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,040
[In the past, when I
taught you how to ski,]

802
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,040
[did you ask me to]

803
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,320
[take more photos of you]

804
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,000
[as well as videos?]

805
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,840
[You still dare to bring it up.]

806
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:50,430
[You promised me]

807
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,560
[to go to the advanced ski trails.]

808
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,360
[In the end, shortly after you guided me]

809
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,150
[at the intermediate ski trails,]

810
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,560
[you left for United States.]

811
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:56,910
[Zeng Li,]

812
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:57,910
[look over here.]

813
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,000
[The camera's here.]

814
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,080
[I'm filming you.]

815
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,000
[Don't go at such high speed.]

816
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,080
[Look out in front of you.]

817
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,150
At that time,

818
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,280
when I saw the video,

819
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,280
I realized,

820
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,190
in his eyes

821
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,040
and his heart,

822
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,080
it's all about you.

823
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,270
When it comes to Xiao Chu,

824
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,670
He's a meticulous person,

825
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,960
and he considers much more than others.

826
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,270
Besides, he keeps a lot
of things to himself

827
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,600
and isn't ready to express it.

828
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,080
In fact, you two are very similar.

829
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,520
It's over.

830
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,480
In that case,

831
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,880
in this lifetime,
I might never get to hear

832
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,000
Mr. Ai's love confession.

833
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,150
No need to overthink.

834
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,520
I feel

835
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,310
you two are people with similar vibes.

836
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,630
You'll get nearer to each other slowly.

837
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,400
Youngest uncle.

838
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,080
[Hi,]

839
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,520
[Zeng Li from year 2021.]

840
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,670
[I'm very happy to get to
know you 10 years ago.]

841
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,600
[Thank you for growing up
healthy and happy,]

842
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,080
[met the love of your life,]

843
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,790
[and became the person you wish to be.]

844
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:35,670
Yu Yi.

845
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,270
Let's continue to set off the fireworks.

846
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,000
OK.

847
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,270
[Yu Yi,]

848
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,710
[my youngest uncle.]

849
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,600
[Thank you]

850
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,230
[for lighting up the world for me]

851
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,190
[during my darkest moments in life.]
