00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,240
invisalign,

190
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,600
would it feel weird

191
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,400
when I kiss my boyfriend?

192
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,640
Excuse me.

193
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,480
I guess you don't have
an experience in this area.

194
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
It does feel a little weird,

195
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,360
but it's fine.

196
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Why is it stained?

197
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,400
Thank you, Dr. Ai.

198
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,360
You're welcome.

199
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,340
[Zeng Li]

200
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,880
It happened last night.

201
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,600
It's like nothing happened.

202
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,640
She didn't even reply my text.

203
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,700
[Zhou Wen]

204
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:47,920
Dr. Ai.

205
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,120
The researches you asked for

206
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,680
the residents in regards to

207
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,160
oral thrush,

208
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,880
I found them.

209
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,600
However, I can't access the files.

210
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,640
I made screenshots

211
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,560
and sent them to you.

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,160
Can't you email it to me?

213
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
The phone is more convenient.

214
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,880
Is there a problem?

215
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,760
Nothing.

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,800
How many more left?

217
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,600
Around 56 photos.

218
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,000
The internet here isn't working well.

219
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,920
If the notifications
are bothering you,

220
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,280
would you like to mute your phone?

221
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,840
No.

222
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,040
I'm waiting for news.

223
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,120
Who are you waiting for?

224
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,520
Mr. Ai.

225
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,240
Pass me your phone.

226
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,400
I'll mute myself.

227
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,520
Mute yourself?

228
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,100
[Mute notifications]

229
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
I totally get it.

230
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,600
When you're waiting

231
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
for a text from someone,

232
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,280
everyone else's messages

233
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,640
annoy you.

234
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,520
This

235
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,160
is known as the symptoms

236
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,440
of falling in love.

237
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,280
Mr. Ai.

238
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,600
Would you like to head
to the library to read?

239
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,440
You're unusually

240
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,680
talkative today.

241
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,320
Sister Zhou Wen, let's grab lunch.

242
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:00,920
Let's go.

243
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,120
Mr. Ai.

244
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,720
Are you joining us?

245
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,840
Mr. Ai isn't.

246
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,680
He has plans this afternoon.

247
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,240
How did I end up

248
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,800
at the library?

249
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,640
What did she mean

250
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,880
by her behaviour last night?

251
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,600
Even if I ask her,

252
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,520
she would have forgotten everything.

253
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,280
Forget it.

254
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,800
Come here.

255
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,040
Come here.

256
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,520
What are you staring at?

257
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,520
Did your Mr. Ai

258
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,120
put on skating shoes?

259
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,200
He has been rolling back and forth.

260
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,080
I think he's waiting for somebody.

261
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,520
Over here?

262
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,880
Who else could he be
waiting for besides you?

263
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,720
That can't be.

264
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,400
Mr. Ai didn't text me.

265
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,840
Hold on.

266
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,480
Since when Mr. Ai

267
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
became mine?

268
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,360
He can't possibly be

269
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,800
mine, right?

270
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,880
Mr. Ai.

271
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,320
What are you doing here?

272
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,040
Zeng Li.

273
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,120
What are you doing here?

274
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,000
I work here.

275
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,760
If I'm not here,

276
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,520
where else would I go?

277
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,600
On the contrary,

278
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,600
what are you doing here?

279
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,160
Are you going anywhere?

280
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,120
I just had lunch.

281
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,280
I was about to buy a cup of milk tea.

282
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,920
I'll get going then.

283
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,360
Let's go together.

284
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,400
Do you enjoy milk tea too?

285
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,480
I've a class in the afternoon.

286
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,240
There's still time.

287
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm just taking a walk around.

288
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,920
Let's go then.

289
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,160
You haven't removed your braces.

290
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,640
You're right.

291
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,480
[How should I ask her about the]

292
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,400
[incident last night?]

293
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,920
[Should I...]

294
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,040
[Forget it. I shouldn't ask.]

295
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,680
By the way, Mr. Ai,

296
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
I noticed a problem.

297
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,640
The quality of the braces

298
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,680
isn't the best.

299
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:34,920
What's wrong?

300
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,480
I only wore it for a day

301
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,360
and it's all stained.

302
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,960
[You brought it up first.]

303
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,240
Your braces turned yellow

304
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,600
because you were drinking coffee

305
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,800
last night.

306
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,280
Coffee?

307
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,560
Are you kidding?

308
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
Last night, I recall us

309
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
drinking wine together.

310
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,880
Also, I clearly remember

311
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,200
removing my braces before that.

312
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,440
When did I put it back on?

313
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,960
Last night after drinking,

314
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,840
you dragged me

315
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,720
to your cafe

316
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,360
and made me a lot of cups of

317
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,720
coffee.

318
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,200
You even demonstrated

319
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,240
your latte art techniques.

320
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,560
Have you forgotten?

321
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,080
I think I did make coffee.

322
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,400
I had too much to drink.

323
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,560
I was really tipsy.

324
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,920
I thought it was all a dream.

325
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,760
Did you drink any?

326
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,840
No.

327
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,200
You took a sip though.

328
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,200
What happened next?

329
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,200
Next, you...

330
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,360
I?

331
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,560
You...

332
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,960
Think about it yourself.

333
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,080
Think about it myself?

334
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,920
Let me recall.

335
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,200
Let me recall.

336
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,040
A dog!

337
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,120
A dog?

338
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,160
Yes.

339
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,200
I remember bringing home

340
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,920
an Alaskan Husky
from the skewers' joint.

341
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,600
I also brought it back
to the coffee house.

342
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,280
I also...

343
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,800
You also...

344
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,800
I also kissed the dog.

345
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,640
Come by the clinic at noon tomorrow.

346
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,240
I'll clean the braces for you.

347
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,240
It can't be the first kiss, right?

348
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,880
That depends on you.

349
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,319
It can't be.

350
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,319
It was a

351
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,280
really adorable dog.

352
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,520
What happened next?

353
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,839
Did you help take it home?

354
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,120
I can't let Wu Ying and

355
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,720
Yi Yi learn about this

356
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,320
or they'd tease me

357
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,160
for one whole month.

358
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,200
[I should be able to clean this up]

359
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,040
[before Sheng Ming arrives.]

360
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,880
[This is perfect.]

361
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,040
You're here.

362
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,240
Why are you all dressed up

363
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,240
at home?

364
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,840
Come on in.

365
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,760
Come in.

366
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,840
What happened to your leg?

367
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,560
It's nothing.
I hit something just now.

368
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,080
Are you sure?

369
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,800
I'm fine.

370
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,760
Be careful.

371
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,920
Are you sure your leg is fine?

372
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,800
It's fine.

373
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,520
Well,

374
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,120
where's your room?

375
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,240
Over there?

376
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,960
Stay here and wait for me.

377
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,720
On the count of three,

378
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,000
you say, turn on the lights, okay?

379
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,440
Three.

380
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,720
Two.

381
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,240
One.

382
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,640
Turn on the lights.

383
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,200
It's beautiful.

384
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,600
Previously, you told me

385
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,760
the bruises on your

386
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,720
legs

387
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,560
were formed

388
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,040
while you head to the
toilet half asleep at night.

389
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,040
With these lights,

390
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,480
you wouldn't hurt yourself anymore.

391
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,080
I was worried you'd find
turning on the lights a hassle,

392
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,120
so I installed a code

393
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,760
in your phone.

394
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,880
Next time, just order your phone

395
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,760
to turn on the lights,

396
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,360
the lights will turn on automatically.

397
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,760
You're so nice to me.

398
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,600
I'll treat you even
better in days to come.

399
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,360
I want a hug.

400
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,600
Yi Yi.

401
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,520
I should go.

402
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,560
I've to work overtime.

403
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,720
Well,

404
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,720
I shall get going then.

405
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,320
Hello.

406
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,480
I'm working overtime.

407
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,120
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

408
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,480
I've lived for 26 years.

409
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,080
I'm doubting my charm
for the first time ever.

410
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,640
That means he's a gentleman.

411
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,200
Both of you weren't dating for long.

412
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,680
It's the 20th century.

413
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,440
He's not a monk

414
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,640
from the Great Tang.

415
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,120
You encountered too many players.

416
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,160
You're not used to dating

417
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,800
a normal man.

418
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,240
Wu Ying.

419
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,600
Wu Ying.

420
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,040
Wu Ying, what are you up to?

421
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,320
Why aren't you speaking?

422
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,720
Please criticise me.

423
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,680
She's probably gaming again.

424
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,400
Wu Ying.

425
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,000
Wu Ying. Wu Ying.

426
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,120
Someone must help her
with her addiction.

427
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,080
Wu Ying. Wu Ying.

428
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,840
Curse these women.

429
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,880
Stop bothering me.

430
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,260
[Defeated.]

431
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,800
Wu Ying. Wu Ying.

432
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,880
Our friendship is over.

433
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,480
Didn't your cutie

434
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,400
urge you to go to bed tonight?

435
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,360
My favourite function

436
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,240
on Mobile Legend

437
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,520
is stealth mode.

438
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,960
I sent a screenshot for Liu Yu Cheng.

439
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,640
Great.

440
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,760
It's exactly what I wanted.

441
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,800
It's 11:30pm already.

442
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,040
Why didn't he text me
urging me to go to bed?

443
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:13,660
[Liu Yu Cheng is in a sweet duo.]

444
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,440
Isn't this

445
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,080
the girl who has a crush on him?

446
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,960
How impressive.

447
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,600
They are going to spend
the night gaming together?

448
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,800
Go ahead.

449
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,780
[Exit game.]

450
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,840
It'd be best if he doesn't annoy me.

451
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,440
Are you out of your mind?

452
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,280
27 and 21

453
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,440
are not the same.

454
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,120
One is at his prime,

455
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,160
and the other is falling behind.

456
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,720
There is a huge gap in age,

457
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,520
but you're just as pretty.

458
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,760
Yes.

459
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,200
Give it to me.

460
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,520
Give it to her.

461
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,000
That's weird.

462
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,560
When I met her previously,

463
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,960
I didn't find her extraordinary.

464
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,640
However, the more

465
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,480
I look at her photos,
the prettier she is.

466
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,280
She probably edited them.

467
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,000
Don't worry.

468
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,760
Isn't that so?

469
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,280
Yes.

470
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,360
She must have edited her photos.

471
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,240
Come on.

472
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,880
Nobody's eyes could grow this huge.

473
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,000
Is she an alien?

474
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
There's another possibility.

475
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,800
What is it?

476
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,160
You're being paranoid.

477
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,000
Previously,

478
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,600
she probably meant nothing

479
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,480
to you.

480
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,160
You wouldn't even
pay attention to her.

481
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,640
Right now, because of Liu Yu Cheng,

482
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,040
she became your love rival.

483
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,880
That's why you'd pay
attention to her.

484
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,840
Love rival?

485
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,000
I don't even like him.

486
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,680
Are you sure about that?

487
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,400
Well, we've never seen you

488
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
stare at

489
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,320
another girl's photos

490
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,040
for such a long time.

491
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,200
That's weird.

492
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,760
I counted 100 last week.

493
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,360
How did it

494
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,160
become 96 pieces today?

495
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,920
Several matching spoons

496
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,880
went missing too.

497
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,800
Would people steal
something like that?

498
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,000
Don't they have
something better to do?

499
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,080
Were our goods stolen?

500
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,320
That's possible.

501
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,920
You asked your friend

502
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,880
to purchase

503
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,920
those utensils all the way from Japan.

504
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,120
They can't be found at usual places.

505
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,400
By the way,

506
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,920
I read this post on Weibo.

507
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,560
After eating,

508
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,680
many customers would

509
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,480
pack away the plates, glasses

510
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,920
and utensils home with them.

511
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,640
Would that

512
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,680
occur at our cafe as well?

513
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
What do we do?

514
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,640
I got it.

515
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,120
Let's watch the surveillance.

516
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,280
Let's investigate.

517
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,160
Oh my god.

518
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,160
Is this really Sister Zeng Li?

519
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,880
That's juicy!

520
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,720
Fast forward.

521
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,360
Play it again.

522
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,480
Hurry up.

523
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,640
They kissed.

524
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,240
[This can't be real.]

525
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,960
There's another angle.

526
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,720
This is the one.

527
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,080
This is it.

528
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
[Goodness gracious.]

529
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,360
This angle. This one.

530
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,560
Which one looks better?

531
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,600
Enlarge the footage.

532
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,200
They kissed!

533
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,080
I lost my first kiss

534
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,040
just like that.

535
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,480
You probably stole

536
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,280
his first kiss too.

537
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,760
Who's cursing me?

538
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:05,960
Zeng Li.

539
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,200
I've known you for a long time.

540
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,800
I didn't know you
were such an expert.

541
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,760
Mr. Ai, that poor thing.

542
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,800
Not bad at all.

543
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,760
Not bad at all.

544
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,800
Do avoid spicy and

545
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,320
pungent food.

546
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,400
Okay.

547
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,280
Xiao Fan.

548
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,400
Have you prepared

549
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,120
the ultrasonic cleaner?

550
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,480
I forgot to.

551
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,840
I'll head to storage

552
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,560
and move the antique over.

553
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,160
Okay.

554
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,760
However, Mr. Ai,

555
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,640
if the braces are stained,

556
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,080
effervescent tablets would

557
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,960
do the trick, right?

558
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,400
They could be obtained
at regular pharmacies.

559
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,480
Why would the

560
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,960
patient come all the way here?

561
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,360
Just go if you're asked to.

562
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Stop blabbering on.

563
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,680
I'll go.

564
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,760
The machine is pretty heavy.

565
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,680
What's going on?

566
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,520
The patient who's coming by

567
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,280
the clinic intentionally is Zeng Li.

568
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,440
In order to meet each other,

569
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,560
they are going through a huge hassle.

570
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,600
[Mr. Ai.]

571
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,160
[I've some matters to attend to.]

572
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,840
[I can't drop by to clean my braces.]

573
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,360
What does that even mean?

574
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,600
It clearly shows

575
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,280
how guilty I am.

576
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,080
I dare not meet him.

577
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,440
Forget it.

578
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,520
He probably mentioned
cleaning my braces

579
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,440
casually.

580
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,640
Perhaps, he forgot all about it.

581
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,440
If I do not show up
when I promised to,

582
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,720
he'd find me irresponsible.

583
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,760
He'd think I'm avoiding him.

584
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,040
What do I do?

585
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,880
She went crazy

586
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,720
for an hour.

587
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,280
Go and talk to her.

588
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,320
What should I say to her?

589
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,560
Should I tell her,

590
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,160
Zeng Li, you're great.

591
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,800
That was a sexy kiss, heroine.

592
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,840
Should I say that?

593
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,200
I'm not going to.
Talk to her yourself.

594
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,600
What do I do?

595
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,560
How am I going to face Mr. Ai?

596
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,120
Hello.

597
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,160
[Hello, Zeng Li.]

598
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,920
Why didn't you

599
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,880
reply my text?

600
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,800
Hurry up and take a look.

601
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,280
I didn't read your text.

602
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,160
I'll take a look.

603
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,960
[Okay.]

604
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,260
[Editor in charge: These are samples
of the cover designs. Pick one.]

605
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
[You didn't reply me.]

606
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,200
[I'm submitting this
to the editor first.]

607
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,360
It's up to her

608
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,320
to pick the illustration.

609
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,160
Okay.

610
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,080
The book is publishing soon.

611
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,360
We're planning

612
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,960
a few book signing events for you.

613
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
The first stop would be at Yancheng.

614
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:49,960
[Are you okay with that?]

615
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,760
Hold up.

616
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,240
Wait.

617
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,080
I've a problem.

618
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,240
[What is it?

619
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,240
No.

620
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,760
I did not agree to go on public.

621
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,400
I can't do that.

622
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,720
I get nervous easily.

623
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,120
I can't handle major events.

624
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,040
There's a first in everything.

625
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,720
[Isn't that so?]

626
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,440
[If you'd like to sell your book,]

627
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,520
[book signings are a must.]

628
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,120
[Besides, you're an author now.]

629
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:10,840
[This is a]

630
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,120
[great opportunity to promote yourself.]

631
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,360
At this moment,

632
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,960
Hurry up and cultivate a readership.

633
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,080
The sales of your next book

634
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,920
would be guaranteed.

635
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,880
I haven't thought

636
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,120
that far ahead.

637
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,480
Besides, I wrote the book for fun.

638
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,080
I've never thought of

639
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,080
publishing the book.

640
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,760
If you're reluctant to,

641
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,360
we might have to reduce the

642
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,080
printing of the first book.

643
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,120
[How about this?]

644
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,120
[Reconsider my offer.]

645
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,080
[I'm going to]

646
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,920
[speak to the editor-in-chief.]

647
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,640
[Okay?]

648
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,200
Okay.

649
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,600
[Well, bye.]

650
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,240
It's almost 5pm.

651
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,040
Would Mr. Ai

652
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,960
be waiting for me?

653
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,520
Zeng Li.

654
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,040
Yesterday, you said

655
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,480
you need to head to
the library at 5pm

656
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,640
because a donor came to deliver books.

657
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,560
Mr. Li wants all of you

658
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,800
to help out.

659
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,000
You're right.

660
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,000
How could I forget that?

661
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,640
Mr. Ai, my absence isn't intentional.

662
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,480
My superior had orders.

663
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,840
I'm not going to get my
braces cleaned.

664
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,280
I'm not avoiding you.

665
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,200
Dr. Ai.

666
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,520
Are there any more patients?

667
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,520
There's one more.

668
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,360
The madam who came
for a complete denture

669
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,120
the last time.

670
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,400
She made an appointment at 6pm.

671
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,360
You will have to work overtime.

672
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:35,840
Okay.

673
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,480
Are you waiting for Zeng Li?

674
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,120
No.

675
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,320
She sent me a text just now.

676
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,760
She had some urgent
matters to attend to

677
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,400
at the library.

678
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,520
She won't be coming to
get her braces cleaned.

679
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,040
That schoolmate of yours

680
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,480
donated a huge number of books.

681
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,720
What was her name again?

682
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,400
Li Qian.

683
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,960
It sounds familiar.

684
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,720
Li Qian.

685
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,400
Li Qian.

686
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,520
Thank you for donating

687
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,360
the books to us.

688
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,760
You're the reason why.

689
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
After we graduated,

690
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,640
the library was recruiting graduates.

691
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,120
My mom insisted me to
take the examination.

692
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,680
Apparently,
it's relatively stable and easy.

693
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,800
I refused to.

694
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,600
I forced myself into the
field of banking.

695
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,680
Over the years,

696
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,160
I never had a break.

697
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,360
Look at you now.

698
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,600
Every day, you could

699
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,680
spend your time with

700
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,280
a bunch of elderly.

701
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,880
Take life easy as you
wait for retirement.

702
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,040
I'm pretty happy

703
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,200
about the decision I made then.

704
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,680
Congratulations.

705
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,000
If I remember correctly,

706
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,840
you're half a year older than I am.

707
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,800
Yes, I think so.

708
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,520
Here's an advise.

709
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,120
You're stepping into 27.

710
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,240
You spend all your
time in the library.

711
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,720
There are no career ladders to climb

712
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,600
nor many men to choose.

713
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,560
You should hurry up and
settle down with whomever.

714
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,320
Honestly, it's really difficult

715
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,080
to juggle both a relationship

716
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,320
and a career.

717
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,680
You should at least
focus on one of those.

718
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,200
In my opinion,

719
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,160
I think life now is pretty great.

720
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,480
It's simple.

721
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,520
I'm just being nice.

722
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,360
My apologies.

723
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,080
I'm hosting a wedding
dinner in six months.

724
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
I did not invite you either.

725
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,240
You wouldn't want to come all the way

726
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
to send me money either.

727
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,400
Besides,

728
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,920
you don't have a boyfriend now,
do you?

729
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,440
You'd be annoyed if you came anyway.

730
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
Junior, was this you?

731
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,400
Goodness.

732
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,080
If I did not know you,

733
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,120
I could barely recognise you.

734
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,840
Your cheeks probably

735
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,040
lost like two to three pounds.

736
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,800
I removed my wisdom teeth.

737
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,120
Of course my face would slim down.

738
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,480
It almost sounded like

739
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,600
I'm accused of going under the knife.

740
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,520
Zeng Li.

741
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,360
During university days,

742
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,800
you'd form a clique
with your dorm mates

743
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,840
to gossip about me.

744
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,520
You're still as annoying as ever.

745
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,280
I...

746
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,160
Zeng Li.

747
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,400
Mr. Ai.

748
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,280
It's been a day.

749
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,480
You haven't texted me.

750
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,720
I told you to drop by the hospital.

751
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,320
You didn't show up either.

752
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:06,640
Zeng Li.

753
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,560
Hurry up and

754
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,800
introduce him to your

755
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,080
old school mate.

756
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,200
This is a doctor at
Donghu University Hospital,

757
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,800
Ai Jing Chu.

758
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,480
Dr. Ai.

759
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,920
Dr. Ai

760
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,280
is Zeng Li's boyfriend.

761
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,800
They are doing very well.

762
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,760
Perhaps,

763
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,880
they'd get married in a flash.

764
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,480
Li Qian.

765
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,200
You should hurry up.

766
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:25,880
You can't allow

767
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,280
Zeng Li to be ahead of you.

768
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,040
Hello, I'm Ai Jing Chu.

769
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,680
Hello, I'm Li Qian.

770
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,040
Are you really Zeng Li's...

771
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,880
Yes.

772
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,080
We've been

773
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,160
dating for quite some time.

774
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,160
Which department are you at, Dr. Ai?

775
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,680
My friend is a doctor as well.

776
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,320
He has been complaining
how tiring it is.

777
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,320
The pay is minimum too.

778
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,920
Life isn't easy for young doctors.

779
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,600
The dental department. It's alright.

780
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,560
I hardly work overtime.

781
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,320
Dentists are great.

782
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,760
They make a lot of money.

783
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,440
Look at Zeng Li.

784
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,880
Her boyfriend is
good looking and capable.

785
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,160
I'm so jealous.

786
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,120
That's flattering.

787
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,600
However, as a

788
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,360
professional dentist,

789
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,240
I should inform all of you

790
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:09,920
some general knowledge,

791
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,880
the size of the face is
related to the mandible.

792
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,360
It has nothing to do with teeth.

793
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,880
Even if you remove all of your

794
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,640
teeth,

795
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,440
your face will not reduce in size.

796
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,920
You came, Mr. Ai.

797
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,000
Why didn't you inform me?

798
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,480
You probably heard everything

799
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,160
just now.

800
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,400
I came to return the books.

801
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,640
I overheard when I was at the door,

802
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,080
so I stayed and listened
a little longer.

803
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,800
Did you really come to return books

804
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,960
or came to cause me troubles?

805
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,320
Why would Mr. Ai

806
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,160
do that to you?

807
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,400
He was rescuing the

808
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,440
damsel in distress.

809
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:46,920
All right?

810
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,840
Are you satisfied with the way

811
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,560
I resolved this problem for you?

812
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,600
Turn off the lights.

813
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,360
Turn on the lights.

814
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,000
Turn off the lights.

815
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,840
Turn on the lights.

816
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:12,840
Turn off the lights.

817
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,980
[Liu Yu Cheng: Let me show you.
I haven't shaved in days. I feel...]

818
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
[Let me show you.]

819
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,639
[I haven't shaved in days.]

820
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,360
[I think I look like a beast.]

821
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,120
[Girls with a fairy tale dream]

822
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,760
[did not meet their princes in the end.]

823
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,840
[They claim that fairy tales are a lie.]

824
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,320
[However, at this moment,
I believe in fairy tales.]

825
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,640
[Even if the man I was waiting for]

826
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,480
[did not come in a white horse,]

827
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,360
[but when I'm feeling helpless,]

828
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,720
[he's put on the armour silently]

829
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,760
[and fight for me.]
