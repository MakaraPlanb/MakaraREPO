Hold on!

Greetings, Commandant Li.

31
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,675
Greetings, Mr. Hu.

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,838
Do you have a minute?

33
00:02:13,838 --> 00:02:15,437
A word, please.

34
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:18,199
What can I help you with?

35
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,520
God of Local Land’s Birthday

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,919
is arriving soon.

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,639
I was hoping to hold a game

38
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:25,199
to celebrate it with the civilians,

39
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,759
but

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,240
there’s not enough money.

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,800
My hands are tied.

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,520
Commandant Li,

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,000
you don’t know

44
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:41,360
how much I envy you.

45
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,880
I mean,

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,520
when you were in the mountain,

47
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,320
you had quite a reputation

48
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,199
and amassed a fortune.

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,199
Later,

50
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,720
you accepted the court’s amnesty

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,080
and started to

52
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:59,080
climb up the ladder steadily.

53
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,520
You’re covered in glory!

54
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,479
Mr. Hu,

55
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:05,440
that’s not entirely accurate.

56
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,559
I robbed the rich to help the poor.

57
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,240
Civilians were never my targets.

58
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,800
True.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,080
And I’ve always donated grains to them

60
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,325
ever since I became an official.

61
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:15,880
Yes.

62
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,039
Everyone in Bingzhou

63
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,759
knows about our family’s generosity.

64
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,279
Commandant Li,

65
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:24,279
I admire you
for always putting the people first.

66
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,160
I don’t think

67
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:28,360
anyone else in the city

68
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,839
has the kind of money

69
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,960
and prestige

70
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,759
to hold such a game.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,080
Thanks, Commandant Li.

72
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:39,320
I’ll entrust the rest to you.

73
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,546
Mr. Hu...

74
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:41,525
- Good day.
- Hey, Mr. Hu...

75
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,440
Wait, Mr. Hu!

76
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,399
Mr. Hu!

77
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,039
I’m sorry. My bad.

78
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,425
Mr. Hu!

(Bingzhou Government Office)

80
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,759
Mr. Hu!

81
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:54,739
Sachets and pendants!

82
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,279
Mr. Hu!

83
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,880
Father,

84
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:07,520
did Hu Yiliang force this thing on you?

85
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,759
No one could force me to do anything.

86
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,320
Am I that spineless to you?

87
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,520
I’m only taking this job

88
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,160
for the sake of our family.

89
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,040
With Princess’s coming,

90
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:24,519
we’ve been on the rise.

91
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,440
Many have had their eyes on us

92
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,880
to catch us in the act

93
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,160
if we make any mistakes.

94
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,079
So I’m thinking

95
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,000
we can take this chance

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
to do something good for the public

97
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,519
to stop those criticisms.

98
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,720
Why is it us again

99
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,519
to pay for this kind of thing?

100
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,200
I said

101
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,279
it’s for the best of our family!

102
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,839
But Uncle Li...

103
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,519
Yes?

104
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,959
Little money is left

105
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,480
in reserve

106
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,880
after the grand wedding.

107
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,880
If we’re to sponsor

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,640
this game on our own,

109
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,839
we’ll have to pawn some properties

110
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,760
as an expedient.

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,239
No way!

112
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:14,440
Master,

113
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:18,359
everything costs money
in case you don’t know.

114
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,920
Look,

115
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,040
to prepare for this game,

116
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:24,480
we’ll have to pay for clothes and meals,

117
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:26,200
utensils and whatnot.

118
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,200
All the expenses

119
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,839
will come from our pocket.

120
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,640
A game or two like this

121
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,119
wouldn’t be too big

122
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,760
a financial burden to us before,

123
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,760
but now is different.

124
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,279
With a new member in our family

125
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,480
and so much money pouring out,

126
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,640
we’ll have to

127
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,959
tighten our belt.

128
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:52,600
Mother...

129
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,925
I don’t think a festive game

130
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,900
would be too costly.

131
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,425
Uh...

132
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:58,225
Father.

133
00:05:58,575 --> 00:05:59,119
Yes?

134
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,839
Were all the celebrations in town

135
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,160
sponsored by us before?

136
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,040
There were a few.

137
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,320
Did the public say nice things
about you afterwards?

138
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,079
Well...

139
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,200
All they knew was
the Li Family had money to burn.

140
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,640
Prefect took all the credits

141
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,239
of being fair and clean-handed

142
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,440
and putting people first.

143
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,399
Hadn’t you tricked me
into accepting the amnesty,

144
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,200
I wouldn’t have been held back

145
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,920
by that old fox all the time!

146
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,720
You’re to blame!

147
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,239
Amnesty?

148
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,959
Speaking of that,

149
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,959
it is

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,320
quite a long story.

151
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:46,480
Mr. Hu,

152
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,079
bandits in the mountain are too fierce

153
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,239
to be captured at the moment.

154
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:50,760
And there are hundreds of casualties

155
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,920
on our side

156
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,279
due to their traps and ambush.

157
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,799
The rest had no other choice

158
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
but to retreat to the foot.

159
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,359
Go on and call for reinforcements!

160
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,279
Yes, sir!

161
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:10,550
(To Hu Yiliang)

162
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,119
What are you doing here?

163
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,119
To talk to you secretly, Mr. Hu.

164
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,079
Talk to me?

165
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,040
About what exactly?

166
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,880
After sending up
additional troops four times,

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,600
your people
still haven’t got halfway.

168
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,799
You’re stuck, aren’t you?

169
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,480
Your resources up there

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,359
are limited, aren’t they?

171
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,000
If the battle drags on,

172
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:42,399
it’s only a matter of time
before you surrender.

173
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,480
Yes, and so what?

174
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Even if you take over this mountain,

175
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,440
my father and I are capable enough

176
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,160
to occupy a new one and start over.

177
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,160
What game are you playing

178
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,679
in the middle of the night?

179
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,920
I’m here to offer you a deal,

180
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,359
Mr. Hu.

181
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,320
At that time,

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,200
he and Hu Yiliang

183
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,040
put on a show together.

184
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,640
That he pretended

185
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,079
to be held hostage.

186
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,720
In order to save him,

187
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,679
I had to accept the court’s amnesty.

188
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,559
Father,

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,279
time has proved

190
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:25,640
that I made the right decision.

191
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,640
You could be a lion in the mountain,

192
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,799
but serving the court

193
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,679
is to build a better future
for our family.

194
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,559
- You...
- Qian is right.

195
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,559
He’s long-sighted

196
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,640
and ambitious.

197
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,599
It would’ve been a waste of his talent

198
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:40,039
being holed up in the mountain.

199
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,200
It is what it is now.

200
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,640
The past doesn’t matter.

201
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,960
What matters is

202
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,239
that we must pay

203
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,239
for this game.

204
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,520
Master.

205
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,040
Yes?

206
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,650
Master!

207
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,239
What?

208
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,719
Calm down. Don’t be mad.

209
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,760
I believe

210
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,760
there is one way.

211
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:00,599
I mean,

212
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,840
we’re out of money,

213
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:05,919
but Princess came

214
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,359
with a handsome amount of dowries.

215
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:08,880
You...

216
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,039
Besides,

217
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,880
we’re all family now

218
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,960
and we’re in this together.

219
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,799
She can’t sit this one out.

220
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,559
Right?

221
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,479
Mother!

222
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,760
Enough!

223
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,359
How could you

224
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,599
have your eyes on her dowries?

225
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,679
Father,

226
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,080
I’m willing to help with what I have.

227
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,000
You...

228
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,599
- Baoning...
- That’d be great!

229
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,359
If words get out about this,

230
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:32,000
I, Li Changqing,
would be a laughing stock!

231
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,799
Indeed!

232
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,359
She’s marrying down to me already.

233
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,400
We can’t afford to give others

234
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,000
more leverage against us.

235
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,159
Fine. Alright.

236
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,760
I’ve heard enough

237
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,880
about your “can’t” and “no”.

238
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,679
Alright.

239
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,559
Just go ahead

240
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,520
and sell our stuff to look good.

241
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:52,000
Before we go there,

242
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,679
I think we have another option.

243
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,559
What is it, Your Grace?

244
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,479
I’m all ears.

245
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,760
Father, you’ve been here for decades

246
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,200
and you must be familiar
with the local merchants.

247
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,960
Rich families and businessmen

248
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,359
into charity can be found

249
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:10,039
all over the state.

250
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,400
Father,

251
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,440
all I need is a list of merchants

252
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,159
that you think are dependable in town.

253
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,159
And I’ll go from there.

254
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,840
We can give it a try.

255
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,440
It’s cold at night.

256
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,760
Don’t get sick.

257
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,385
So,

258
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,599
is the list detailed enough?

259
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,200
If not,

260
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,919
I can have men redo it.

261
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,200
It has everything

262
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,359
I need.

263
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:43,840
You can finally
take a few days off from work.

264
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,119
Go get some rest.

265
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,159
I’ll take care of this business.

266
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:48,960
You’re cleaning up the mess

267
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,760
for my family.

268
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,320
As your husband and a son,

269
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:54,760
I can’t sit on my hands.

270
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,080
Your deficit

271
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,599
is partly because of me.

272
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,200
Had I known our wedding
would cost so much,

273
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,400
we shouldn’t have...

274
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,200
I don’t know how I can ever repay you

275
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,000
since the day you married me.

276
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,559
The wedding expense

277
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,960
is really nothing.

278
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,440
It’s late. Go to bed.

279
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,799
Don’t distract me.

280
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,679
No.

281
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:22,000
I want to be here with you.

282
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,880
I can’t read like this.

283
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,159
Then don’t.

284
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,000
I’ll tell you everything in it.

285
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,840
I’m familiar

286
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,679
with all those names.

287
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,760
What do you need to know?

288
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,080
I can tell you.

289
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,039
As crafty as Hu Yiliang is,

290
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:46,640
he’s trying to help the people.

291
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,719
Father takes this job from him

292
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,000
only to improve our family’s image

293
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,280
at the cost of money

294
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,840
after our high-profile

295
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,080
and extravagant wedding ceremony.

296
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,640
Both of their intentions are justified.

297
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,400
The problem is who will foot the bill.

298
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,640
Those in the local business circle

299
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,880
with similar intentions are many.

300
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,159
All they need is a chance.

301
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:13,119
And we may have the right one for them.

302
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,679
So you’re going through the list

303
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,359
to select the right one.

304
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,239
You’re a genius.

305
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,760
I can’t let you do all the work alone.

306
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
I’ll

307
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,280
make it easy for you.

308
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:34,875
(Dong Shanhu)

309
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,119
This garden has been long abandoned.

310
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,280
It’s unprofitable.

311
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,119
I have other properties.

312
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,400
We can skip this wasteland.

313
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:45,400
(Dong Shanhu)
I will

314
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,119
take this garden.

315
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,239
Thank you, Miss Dong!

316
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,400
Good day, Miss Dong.

317
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,760
You have a sharp eye, Miss,

318
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,039
that you got this garden

319
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:10,919
at less than half of the usual price.

320
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,640
Have eyes on the future

321
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,320
and wait for opportunities to come.

322
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,719
Speaking of which,

323
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:18,559
one is coming our way.

324
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,375
(Li’s Mansion)

325
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,719
Greetings, Your Grace.

326
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:27,719
Please rise.

327
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,000
We aren’t in the capital.

328
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,440
Courtesies are unnecessary.

329
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,400
I’ve long heard

330
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,520
that Miss Dong in Bingzhou

331
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:36,479
is quite a businesswoman.

332
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:38,880
I’m glad to finally meet you.

333
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,200
Don’t take

334
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,640
their jokes seriously.

335
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,200
Send in everything.

336
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,159
They’re...?

337
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,599
Just some fruits and vegetables.

338
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,760
Nothing valuable,

339
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,719
but fresh.

340
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,479
I hope you don’t mind.

341
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,719
They aren’t

342
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:09,080
in season yet, are they?

343
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,200
Greenhouses are warm enough

344
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,719
for them to grow.

345
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,359
We’ve had a good year,

346
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,400
so I’m sharing the fresh
fruits and vegetables with everyone.

347
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,520
Is it easy to preserve them?

348
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,119
I’d like to have some
delivered to the palace.

349
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:22,359
The longer they travel,

350
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:24,640
the less fresh they taste.

351
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,320
You can sell them here

352
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:29,000
and even in the capital.

353
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:30,799
Maybe your fruits and vegetables
will be good enough

354
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,239
to enter the palace.

355
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
You’re wise, Your Grace.

356
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:36,000
I had the same idea,

357
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,000
but I barely had

358
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,119
any contacts inside.

359
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,479
If it weren’t for Commander Li,

360
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,559
I wouldn’t

361
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,039
even get to

362
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
see you here.

363
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,960
If you’re into this business,

364
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,599
I can pull some strings.

365
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,760
That’d be much appreciated.

366
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:55,440
Darling,

367
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,520
how much do you know about Dong Shanhu?

368
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,400
I seldom cross paths with merchants,

369
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,159
but I’ve heard about her.

370
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,760
It’s said that
she could use an abacus at three,

371
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,919
worked the counter
and made inventories at seven

372
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,479
and took over the shop before thirteen.

373
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:12,239
Now, she even
has branches in the capital.

374
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,840
Her business covers almost everything

375
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,719
in Jinxi.

376
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,599
Remember that face-washing cream

377
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,320
you asked me to buy for Mother?

378
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,960
Her shop made it.

379
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:25,239
Girls here are really something.

380
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:28,719
Jinxi is relatively free.

381
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,840
It’s common for women
to do business here.

382
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:33,520
A woman with her wealth and impact

383
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,520
must’ve seen tons of big shots.

384
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,960
I don’t even make the cut.

385
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,479
You’re a well-known princess.

386
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:42,080
Who wouldn’t want to meet you?

387
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,640
Cut it out. Stop joking.

388
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,359
It was too soon to bring up

389
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,520
the game to her.

390
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,239
I’ll sound her out on it

391
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,520
when I go to her shop later.

392
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:50,960
Good call.

393
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:56,960
(Unifon)

394
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,919
Pendants!

395
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,719
Take a look!

396
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,599
(Unifon)

397
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:02,250
Go and

398
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,875
- recalculate last month’s gross margin.
- Welcome. Feel free to look around.

399
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,290
Welcome, Your Grace!

400
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:12,950
Thanks.

401
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:15,280
Welcome, Your Grace!

402
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,080
Rise, all of you.

403
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,760
I dropped by and recognized your shop,

404
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:21,039
so I came in to have a look.

405
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,880
Serve tea to Her Grace.

406
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,280
Yes.

407
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,119
This way, please, Your Grace.

408
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,280
Feel free to look around.

409
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,880
Why are

410
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,640
all your staff members female?

411
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,440
Your Grace,

412
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,159
those girls

413
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,000
are either homeless

414
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,559
or war orphans.

415
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,239
I gave them jobs

416
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,280
to help them support themselves

417
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,880
instead of depending on
their future husbands.

418
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,760
Merchants have always been seen
as arrogant,

419
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,640
but, Miss Dong,

420
00:16:58,719 --> 00:16:59,640
you’re noble and talented.

421
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,359
And you set a good example for the rest.

422
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,799
Thanks for your compliment, Your Grace.

423
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,880
There’s nothing much I can do,

424
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,520
but from now on,
whatever the Li Family needs

425
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,040
that your shop can provide,

426
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,119
we’ll all purchase it from you.

427
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,800
That’s the least I can do

428
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,000
for those girls.

429
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,839
Thank you, Your Grace.

430
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,520
If you need my help in the future,

431
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,439
all you need is to ask.

432
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,520
Actually, there’s something now.

433
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Do you know we have God of Local Land’s
Birthday coming at the end of this month?

434
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:28,775
Yes.

435
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:29,920
I know.

436
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,359
(Still Water Runs Deep)

437
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,160
Excellent!

438
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,119
Well done!

439
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,920
Your Grace,

440
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,920
you lifted us out of the crisis.

441
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:42,599
Our family owes you a great deal.

442
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,199
Happy to help, Father.

443
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,040
Your problem is also mine.

444
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,000
Uncle Li.

445
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,640
Yes?

446
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,800
Miss Dong is from
a rich business family.

447
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,079
She’s more calculated

448
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:56,880
and sharper

449
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,359
than most men in this circle.

450
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:02,160
Taking advantage of her

451
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,000
is almost impossible.

452
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:06,640
Your Grace,

453
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,160
I suggest

454
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,839
you tread carefully.

455
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,119
Don’t ruin the Li Family’s reputation

456
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,959
for some short-term gains.

457
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,239
You’re worrying too much, Miss Gao.

458
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,560
She wants something in return of course

459
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:22,680
and so do we.

460
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,079
She can increase
public awareness of her brand

461
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:26,160
and our family can actually

462
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,760
do something for the people.

463
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,000
It’s win-win. Isn’t that great?

464
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,119
I can’t agree more, Your Grace.

465
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,800
Even I can’t do better than that.

466
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:51,000
Miss Dong is impressive.

467
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,680
Everything, big and small,

468
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,560
is well-prepared

469
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,800
and all under her control.

470
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:58,800
I thought Cuju
was only popular in the capital,

471
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,239
but it’s also well-received in Bingzhou.

472
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,319
Look, Your Grace.

473
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,040
Everyone on the red team

474
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:06,040
is Commandery Prince’s comrade
in the army.

475
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,119
While the black one
is a team of skilled civilians.

476
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,550
Go, go, go!

477
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,500
Come on!

478
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:14,040
There wouldn’t be such a big crowd

479
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:15,680
without his comrades,

480
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,800
and Miss Dong

481
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,239
wouldn’t have sponsored the game.

482
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:19,479
Yes, of course.

483
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,839
He always does things for you silently.

484
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You should be nicer to him in return.

485
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,359
Are you on his side now?

486
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Did he buy you over?

487
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,975
Good!

488
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,400
Let’s go!

489
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:33,959
Your Grace,

490
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,239
how do you like today’s game?

491
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,400
You must’ve done a lot of work.

492
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,640
Soldiers and civilians
are having fun together

493
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,119
in this big game.

494
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,719
Every one, high and low, in Bingzhou

495
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,040
must be praising you for it.

496
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
I’d rather they don’t.

497
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,439
What they think doesn’t matter.

498
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,079
What matters is your satisfaction.

499
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,160
What an irony!

500
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,359
I thought

501
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,880
you’d become the new Mrs. Li,

502
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,280
but heaven played a cruel joke

503
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:03,119
that someone else took your spot.

504
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,599
Thanks for your concern,
Madam Zhuang.

505
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,479
You’d better watch

506
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,079
what you say.

507
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:14,079
Where’s that show-off?

508
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,079
Madam He isn’t into such games.

509
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,599
She claimed to be sick days ago.

510
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:22,199
Uncle Li knew her too well

511
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,680
and let her be.

512
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,160
I bet she didn’t want to be embarrassed.

513
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,800
She failed to raise her daughter well.

514
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,839
Of course others
would talk behind her back.

515
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,880
Li Dongzhi is about my daughter’s age.

516
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,400
Her marriage

517
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,839
is going to be a big problem.

518
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:39,875
Good!

519
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,599
Young Master says

520
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,239
this is for you, Your Grace.

521
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,250
Over here! Over here!

522
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,325
Wait!

523
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:48,875
My ball!

524
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,040
Baoning, am I your hero?

525
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:56,875
Here!

526
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:57,950
Here!

527
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,079
Come on, Li Qian!

528
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,319
Let’s go!

529
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,880
Qingke, get me the stationery.

530
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,520
I’m writing back to him.

531
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes.

532
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:29,199
You and Commander Li

533
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,119
are so sweet.

534
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:34,325
Nice!

535
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:38,950
Pass the ball!

536
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:40,160
Shoot!

537
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:42,719
Goal!

538
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,319
Nice shot!

539
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:46,719
Good job, Young Master!

540
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:48,760
Well done!

541
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:53,250
(Red Team Three Goals)

542
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,920
What’s the sentence

543
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
for hitting on a princess?

544
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,000
That’s to amuse you
in case you get bored.

545
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,959
Xiaoman.

546
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:02,000
How could I get bored
with such a good game?

547
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:03,760
I’m curious about the result.

548
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,400
Are you able to win, darling?

549
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:09,199
Jin Xiao!

550
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:11,399
We need more practice.

551
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,880
Boys,

552
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,680
show everything you’ve got!

553
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:26,160
We can’t afford to lose in public!

554
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,439
Her Grace has promised

555
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,719
handsome rewards

556
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,160
if we win!

557
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,719
Great!

558
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,839
Since this is a game for everyone,

559
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:43,280
I’d like to play with the others, too.

560
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,319
Go get them!

561
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:05,640
Goal!

562
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,599
(Black Team Four Goals)
Good!

563
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:24,425
(Black Team Five Goals)

564
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,839
Yes!

565
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,525
Good job!

566
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,319
I hate

567
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,359
that you fight against me
over everything.

568
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,150
I’ve never done so.

569
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,560
I only get

570
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,575
what I deserve.

571
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:49,200
Catch this!

572
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,479
You deserve it?

573
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,880
What’s taken from the others

574
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,439
will have to be returned.

575
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:58,119
If it’s not yours in the first place,

576
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,959
it’ll never be.

577
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:02,479
Boys,

578
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,199
give it your all!

579
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,560
Don’t make

580
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,400
Xuanjia Battalion look weak
in front of everyone!

581
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,040
Catch it!

582
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:18,600
Come on!

583
00:25:18,825 --> 00:25:19,425
Go!

584
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,000
Go, go, go!

585
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:28,199
(Red Team Six Goals)

586
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:29,079
Yes!

587
00:25:29,175 --> 00:25:31,319
Bravo!

588
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:42,400
Are Young Master Zhao
and Her Grace...?

589
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,319
Grand Empress Dowager

590
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:49,680
had betrothed Her Grace

591
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,760
to him.

592
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:54,640
Just when they were
about to get married,

593
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,959
something happened

594
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,839
and ended their engagement.

595
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,439
Commander Li is a rare catch,

596
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,680
but he’s still no match

597
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,119
for the one with noble birth.

598
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,079
Was Her Grace married down

599
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,119
to the Li Family

600
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,040
because His Majesty
no longer favored her?

601
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,280
Was that why

602
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,239
her previous engagement got canceled?

603
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,280
Madam Zhuang’s eldest brother-in-law is

604
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,000
Chief Councilor Wang’s favorite student.

605
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,199
Ladies and their daughters here

606
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,880
wouldn’t dare to offend her.

607
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,959
Who’d know

608
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,880
Her Grace is of loose morals

609
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,760
that she sits and does nothing

610
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,680
while Young Master Zhao
crosses the line?

611
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:43,280
- Qian...
- Madam Zhuang,

612
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,520
it’s well-known

613
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
in Mu’an

614
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,319
that Her Grace means everything
to Grand Empress Dowager.

615
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,439
If she even hears one word

616
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:53,040
that you said,

617
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,959
the Zhuang Family will be doomed!

618
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:57,920
Madam Zhuang,

619
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,800
from now on,

620
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,160
be cautious with
your words and actions.

621
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,800
And stop spreading rumors.

622
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:09,920
How could this happen?

623
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,839
I only took a sick leave for one day

624
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,880
yet she stirred up much trouble!

625
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:16,439
She being married down to us

626
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,839
doesn’t mean she can walk all over us!

627
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:19,839
What’s worse,

628
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:21,359
word on the street is

629
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:24,079
she and Young Master Zhao

630
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:25,800
have something going on behind our back.

631
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,400
She might not care about her name,

632
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,119
but we care about ours!

633
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:31,680
Calm down, Madam.

634
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,760
They’re just rumors.

635
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,280
Don’t take them seriously.

636
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,280
Outsiders

637
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,719
are saying such vicious words

638
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,280
simply out of jealousy.

639
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,640
Her Grace

640
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,239
is pure and noble.

641
00:27:45,675 --> 00:27:46,775
I don’t think

642
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,839
she’d ever put
the Li Family in harm’s way.

643
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,640
There is no fire without smoke.

644
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:53,040
Was she as upright as she said,

645
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,319
would others still talk behind her back?

646
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,680
May I ask,

647
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,719
what’s setting you off, Mother?

648
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,599
Your Grace,

649
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:04,680
please don’t blame her.

650
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,640
She’s simply misled

651
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,839
by those rumors.

652
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,719
You know how outsiders

653
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,760
like to gossip.

654
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
It’s their biggest joy,

655
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,599
am I right?

656
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,800
Just so you know,

657
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,040
Madam and I

658
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,640
are inclined to trust you.

659
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:23,040
I wonder

660
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,680
what kind of rumor

661
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,479
would shoot up Mother’s disbelief in me.

662
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,119
Your Grace,

663
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:33,920
a woman should follow
the man she marries.

664
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:36,199
In that spirit, however noble you were,

665
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,959
as Li Qian’s wife,

666
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:39,319
you should abide by our family rules.

667
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:41,160
Scandals involving you and another man

668
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,199
are intolerable!

669
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,199
Madam,

670
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,560
Her Grace’s image can’t be tarnished!

671
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,520
I’m tarnishing it?

672
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,520
Your princess

673
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,199
took that man’s love token
in broad daylight.

674
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,680
Stop defending her!

675
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,400
What love token?

676
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:56,675
Everyone in the mansion
is talking about it.

677
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,199
Stop denying it!

678
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:00,239
I didn’t take that so-called love token.

679
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,359
Search my place if you don’t believe me.

680
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:05,880
Sure. You think I wouldn’t dare?

681
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,280
Come with me to the West Courtyard!

682
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,000
Madam,

683
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,000
think twice.

684
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,800
Uncle Li and Qian will be mad

685
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,319
if they find out about this.

686
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:15,760
Why should I care how they’ll feel?

687
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,239
What about my feelings?

688
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:19,439
Everyone is laughing at me right now,

689
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,640
saying we let our son

690
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,920
marry a slut on a pedestal!

691
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,479
Madam...

692
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,079
It’s fine.

693
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,479
Look, Madam.

694
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:07,800
Why is Young Master Zhao’s pendant

695
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,719
in this room?

696
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:11,359
Shut up!

697
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,640
It’s not your place

698
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,719
to ask Her Grace!

699
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:14,800
What else do you have to say

700
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,119
in front of the evidence?

701
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,199
This jade pendant

702
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,560
has been with me since I was little.

703
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,119
I’m giving it to you

704
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,439
as your wedding gift.

705
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,199
I... I can’t take it.

706
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,640
It’s too valuable.

707
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,719
Your Grace!

708
00:30:28,825 --> 00:30:29,450
Qingke...

709
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,150
Your Grace!

710
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,995
Hey...

711
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:32,225
Zhao... Zhao Xiao...

712
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,359
There are a lot of people

713
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,239
in our chamber.

714
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:50,280
How dare you rifle through

715
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,040
Her Grace’s jewelry case!

716
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:58,560
Qian, you don’t know what happened!

717
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,119
Nanny Tian

718
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,439
just found a love token in the room

719
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,400
that someone else gave your wife.

720
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,719
You didn’t know that, did you?

721
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,119
This jade pendant

722
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,760
is Young Master Zhao’s wedding gift

723
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,560
to us.

724
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,239
Baoning didn’t mean to take it,

725
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,920
but I asked her to

726
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,000
for an auspicious start.

727
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,239
Is that a problem?

728
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:43,675
Yes!

729
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,319
- Uh...
- Look at you

730
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:48,880
and your slanderous remarks!

731
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,300
She didn’t take them to heart

732
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:51,760
out of leniency.

733
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,160
But, Mother,

734
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:54,880
if she decided to

735
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:57,319
punish you for slander,

736
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:59,280
even Father couldn’t help you out.

737
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,599
I didn’t mean to do that.

738
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:04,000
I... I had such speculation

739
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,359
because those servants kept...

740
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,640
We’re on the rise and in others’ way.

741
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,560
To get rid of us,

742
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,640
they keep making up stories

743
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:12,400
and churning the waters.

744
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,680
Mother,

745
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:16,319
do you really want some hearsay

746
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:17,920
to split us up?

747
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,239
Qian,

748
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,680
I tried to talk Madam out of it.

749
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,079
Now, you know the truth.

750
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:37,520
Do not

751
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,479
pull a stunt like this again.

752
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,479
My wife is tired.

753
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:43,839
Qingke,

754
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,239
show Madam out for us.

755
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:46,959
Yes.

756
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,280
And,

757
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
from now on,

758
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,319
no one

759
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,800
shall set foot in
the West Courtyard again

760
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:56,000
without Baoning’s permission.

761
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,400
Try this.

762
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:34,199
Take a bite.

763
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,359
Have some tea.

764
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,479
Behold!

765
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,680
Look at this brush.

766
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,199
See?

767
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,919
Here’s another one.

768
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,320
Talk to me or I’m leaving.

769
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,159
I said I’m going!

770
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,840
I’m sorry, darling.

771
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,239
I didn’t know a pendant

772
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,679
would lead to such a mess.

773
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,280
I never intended to take it,

774
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,919
but Zhao Xiao

775
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:58,080
didn’t give me any time.

776
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,639
He tossed it to me and left.

777
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,439
Then I thought

778
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,520
I’d return it to him later,

779
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:06,239
but I guess I forgot about it.

780
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,959
Nothing happened between us, I swear.

781
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,040
I know.

782
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,439
Then why are you still mad?

783
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,760
Because I have a right to.

784
00:35:20,475 --> 00:35:22,199
I’m mad
because you didn’t tell me about it.

785
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,000
That pendant was unimportant

786
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,879
and easy to forget.

787
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:32,239
You forgot about it?

788
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:36,199
I’m glad you did.

789
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:41,080
Are we good now?

790
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,040
I’m still mad.

791
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,120
Why?

792
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,919
I’m mad at myself

793
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:46,479
for all that you’ve suffered

794
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,080
because of my negligence.

795
00:35:50,075 --> 00:35:51,636
All I need is your trust anyway.

796
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,600
(Yongqing State)

797
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:06,100
(Respect Etiquette and Loyalty)

798
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,040
Your Highness.

799
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:17,719
All the troops
and everything else are ready.

800
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,080
Pass my order.

801
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
We’ll march in two days!

802
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,320
Your Highness,

803
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,320
with His Majesty’s belief in peace

804
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:29,199
and the upcoming signing of the treaty,

805
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,159
sending troops now

806
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,679
would make His Majesty...

807
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,639
He’s too sick in bed

808
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,159
to control me.

809
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,919
From now on, I’m the one in charge.

810
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,040
Yongqing is under my reign.

811
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,600
Besides,

812
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,320
my father intended
to sign the treaty, not me.

813
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,280
This time,

814
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,919
I’ll have Li Qian pay double

815
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,479
for humiliating me!

816
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,000
(Li’s Mansion)
Bad news, Master!

817
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,280
(Li’s Mansion)
It’s the border!

818
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,600
Everyone is saying

819
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,560
that we stole Master’s military report.

820
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,280
Just as I expected.

821
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:22,439
Tell me where the report is,

822
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:24,959
or I’ll throw you all

823
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:26,959
into prison!

824
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,520
Uncle Li,

825
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,919
they’ve been your servants for years

826
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:35,080
without any lapse.

827
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,600
Someone else

828
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,560
might be responsible for the theft.

829
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,719
If not them,

830
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:44,840
who else could it be?

831
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,239
Even if they were thieves,

832
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,840
they’d steal

833
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:52,919
money and valuable objects.

834
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,679
None of them could read.

835
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:57,120
What would they

836
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,719
need a military report for?

837
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,280
Miss Gao is right.

838
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
We’re innocent!

839
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,879
Master, we’ve been with you for years.

840
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,879
We’ve been serving your family
since our parents’ generation.

841
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,800
We’d never betray you!

842
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:10,280
Please trust us!

843
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:12,080
Have you seen

844
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,719
anyone suspicious

845
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,040
in the mansion lately?

846
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:17,840
Her Grace was often seen

847
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,239
in the study earlier to prepare for
God of Local Land’s Birthday.

848
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:22,840
It has never happened before.

849
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,679
What are the odds
that as soon as she came,

850
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,080
the military report went missing?

851
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:30,719
Uncle Li,

852
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:34,399
Bingzhou is at the forefront
against Yongqing.

853
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,479
With Her Grace’s bond

854
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:37,560
with the imperial family

855
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,120
and His Majesty’s suspicious nature,

856
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,320
it is possible

857
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,320
that he has someone he knows

858
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:48,320
to oversee local officials’ work,

859
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,399
especially military affairs.

860
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,080
Miss Gao,

861
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:54,560
I advise you to think

862
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,040
before you speak.

863
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,199
Your Grace.

864
00:39:03,879 --> 00:39:05,040
What brings you here?

865
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:07,199
If I showed up any later,

866
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:09,719
I’d be called a thief.

867
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,239
Your Grace,

868
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:16,800
I didn’t mean to suspect you,

869
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,800
but,

870
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,199
files on Uncle Li’s table

871
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:25,040
are all classified.

872
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:27,719
If they went missing

873
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,639
and fell into the wrong hands,

874
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,360
there’d be dire consequences.

875
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,239
I figured

876
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:34,560
you were in his study

877
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,360
a lot earlier

878
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:38,479
for God of Local Land’s Birthday,

879
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,040
which made me

880
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,679
start to think.

881
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,800
Please don’t mistake me.

882
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:45,479
I don’t mean you did it.

883
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,080
Father,

884
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:49,919
what’s your take on this incident?

885
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,159
There are moles in our house.

886
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:00,199
They must be dug out.

887
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Speaking of moles,

888
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:04,919
it’s time to

889
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,919
get down to some serious business.

890
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,080
Father, may I draw your attention

891
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,600
to the situation at home?

892
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:13,040
What are you talking about?

893
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,639
Father, had it occurred to you

894
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,040
that how words

895
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,000
you just said in the study

896
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,639
got into my ears even before you left?

897
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:33,719
Is Liu Da at the stable here?

898
00:40:33,919 --> 00:40:34,600
Yes.

899
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,840
I’m here.

900
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,439
Liu Da, 22 years old,

901
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,719
five years of service here

902
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,159
as the chief of the stable,

903
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,919
responsible for
feeding and cleaning horses.

904
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:50,040
You’re limited to the gatehouse

905
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,919
and the stable
unless otherwise requested.

906
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,800
Is that correct?

907
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,840
Yes... that is correct.

908
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,800
On April 18, when Master and Madam

909
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:05,639
went to Falan Temple
to pray during the fair,

910
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,879
you sneaked into the inner court
at a quarter past seven

911
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,239
and hit on the cleaner, Jiaoxing,

912
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,360
in the yard

913
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:13,399
for a few minutes without permission.

914
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,959
At a quarter past one in the afternoon

915
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,800
on April 25,
Chunni at the garden house...

916
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,900
(Li’s Mansion)

917
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,320
Your Grace, that’d be all.

918
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,560
What... what’s the point?

919
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,639
Father, Mother

920
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:33,239
and everyone else

921
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:36,000
heard what Qingke just read.

922
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,560
As the saying goes,

923
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:39,679
state and family are run by rules.

924
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:41,199
Nothing can be accomplished
without norms or standards.

925
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,120
Think of home as a mini court.

926
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,639
Everyone shall abide by the law.

927
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,919
Whether you’re a groom,

928
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,600
a cleaner

929
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,120
or a chef,

930
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,760
fulfill your duties accordingly

931
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:55,399
and adhere strictly to the family rules.

932
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,719
The theft in Father’s study is an alert.

933
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:00,239
All the servants

934
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:01,840
had access to that place.

935
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,439
Who should be responsible for the theft?

936
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,360
That’s why rules must be made clear

937
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,000
in the beginning.

938
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,239
If anything goes wrong,
we go straight to those in charge.

939
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,120
When they understand

940
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,919
how much is at stake,

941
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,320
they’ll keep their people in line

942
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,879
spontaneously.

943
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,239
Mother trusted Miss Gao

944
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,840
and had her

945
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,350
take care of everything at home

946
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,760
before I came.

947
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,199
All the servants

948
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:25,919
were also assigned by her.

949
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,000
But without necessary rules

950
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:30,199
and order,

951
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,919
anyone can come and go

952
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:34,120
inside the mansion freely.

953
00:42:34,925 --> 00:42:36,360
What do you have to say about that,

954
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,760
Miss Gao?

955
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:44,239
Nothing went wrong

956
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:45,360
before Your Grace

957
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,040
joined this family.

958
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,639
Master and Madam trusted me

959
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,951
and gave me the power.

960
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,439
What are you implying, Your Grace?

961
00:42:56,879 --> 00:42:58,360
Are you blaming me

962
00:42:58,679 --> 00:42:59,879
or Master and Madam

963
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,280
who appointed me?

964
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,600
Don’t try to shift the blame on me,

965
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,080
Miss Gao.

966
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,880
Their trust

967
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:12,000
doesn’t exonerate you

968
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,320
from negligence.

969
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:14,719
But, at this point,

970
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:16,199
a solution

971
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:18,080
is better than pointing fingers.

972
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,560
As you know,

973
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,120
we can’t tell any outsiders

974
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,040
or the local authority
that we lost classified files.

975
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,919
Or if the government looks into it,

976
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,159
they’ll

977
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,230
have Father take full responsibility.

978
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,399
That cannot happen!

979
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,439
All of you

980
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,399
keep your mouths shut, you hear?

981
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:40,719
If you breathe a word to others,

982
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:42,040
I’ll sell

983
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,600
your whole family!

984
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,919
He Cuihua, stop blaming others!

985
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,639
My files were stolen at home.

986
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,159
How did you do your job?

987
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,199
Why did you blame me again,
Li Changqing?

988
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,479
Didn’t you tell me

989
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:55,679
that Miaorong is educated and smart

990
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,975
and I should let her take charge?

991
00:43:56,975 --> 00:43:57,475
I...

992
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:59,280
Now what? Something happened

993
00:43:59,399 --> 00:44:00,600
that would cost you your job

994
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,280
and you started to yell at me?

995
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,959
Why didn’t you
watch your things closely?

996
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:05,520
- That’s enough.
- Weren’t you in charge of...?

997
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,240
Miaorong was the one...

998
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:06,950
Father, Mother,

999
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:08,360
don’t worry too much.

1000
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:10,879
If you trust me,

1001
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:13,159
give me three days

1002
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,520
and I will

1003
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,239
give you an answer.

1004
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,725
Sure.

1005
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:27,350
(Anyuan Gate)

1006
00:44:27,725 --> 00:44:30,040
(Li Dongzhi)

1007
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,479
Have a look!

1008
00:44:32,175 --> 00:44:34,175
Take a look!

1009
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,959
Have a look!

1010
00:44:51,475 --> 00:44:52,755
What about this one?

1011
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,959
Look at that young man.

1012
00:44:57,959 --> 00:44:59,360
He’s handsome!

1013
00:44:59,399 --> 00:45:01,439
- Excuse me.
- He is, indeed!

1014
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,700
I’d like this one, too.

1015
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,239
Make it cheaper.

1016
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:05,000
And this one.

1017
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,971
Cheaper, please.

1018
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,360
- What did you do?
- Look at you!

1019
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,280
You’re clumsy.

1020
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,760
Apologize to that young man now.

1021
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:14,639
No need.

1022
00:45:14,919 --> 00:45:15,879
I’m not a man,

1023
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:19,040
but a girl just like you two.

1024
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:24,525
She...

1025
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,239
She’s wearing men’s robe.

1026
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,479
I wish she was a man.

1027
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,879
I know.

1028
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:31,950
She’s good-looking!

1029
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,120
I’ve been away for too long.

1030
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,075
I agree.

1031
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,175
Mother will talk my ear off for sure.

1032
00:45:36,175 --> 00:45:38,175
When will we meet a real man?

1033
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,300
(Li’s Mansion)

1034
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,560
You bastards!

1035
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:01,320
Are you trying to kill me?

1036
00:46:02,175 --> 00:46:03,040
(Feelings Grow)
Take her away!

1037
00:46:04,025 --> 00:46:04,919
Shut up!

1038
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:06,600
Stop!

1039
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,080
What are you doing?

1040
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,399
There you are!

1041
00:46:10,575 --> 00:46:11,199
Nanny!

1042
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:12,919
Save me, please!

1043
00:46:12,975 --> 00:46:14,239
All these years,

1044
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:15,959
I’ve been

1045
00:46:15,959 --> 00:46:18,439
(Feelings Grow)
diligent and loyal to your family,

1046
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:21,120
but Princess is getting rid of me

1047
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,159
as soon as she came.

1048
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:24,399
How dare you talk nonsense

1049
00:46:24,399 --> 00:46:25,280
and twist facts!

1050
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,320
You know better than anyone

1051
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,600
why Her Grace is punishing you.

1052
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,000
Nanny, stand up.

1053
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:30,040
Dongzhi!

1054
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,800
Welcome home, Dongzhi!

1055
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,760
Miaorong,

1056
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:34,159
what’s going on?

1057
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,360
Dongzhi,

1058
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,040
meet your sister-in-law,

1059
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:40,320
Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

1060
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,320
Nice to meet you.

1061
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:43,959
Your brother told me a lot about you.

1062
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,320
May I call you Dongdong?

1063
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:50,760
That’s my nanny.

1064
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,760
May I ask what she did

1065
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,280
that you’re being so cruel to her?

1066
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,639
- She...
- Dongzhi,

1067
00:46:56,199 --> 00:46:57,760
don’t be so rude

1068
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,959
to Her Grace.

1069
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:00,159
She’s a princess.

1070
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:02,199
Your parents

1071
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,959
must obey her,

1072
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,959
not to mention your brother.

1073
00:47:06,879 --> 00:47:08,479
She can say

1074
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:09,679
and do whatever she wants.

1075
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:11,919
You cannot stand in her way, understand?

1076
00:47:12,879 --> 00:47:14,320
Don’t offend her

1077
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,520
for a nanny.

1078
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,080
If your brother knows,

1079
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,120
he’ll call you disrespectful.

1080
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:22,760
Being a princess

1081
00:47:22,959 --> 00:47:24,239
doesn’t mean you can abuse your power

1082
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:25,320
and kill innocent people.

1083
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:28,840
Innocent or not,

1084
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,080
let’s find out together.

1085
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,360
Don’t jump to the conclusion yet.

1086
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:35,439
Father,

1087
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,560
my investigation into the theft

1088
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,800
in your study earlier

1089
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,159
has shown a preliminary result.

1090
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,159
All the evidence

1091
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,080
leads to Nanny Tian.

1092
00:47:44,399 --> 00:47:47,719
I didn’t do it! I’m innocent!

1093
00:47:47,919 --> 00:47:50,879
She’s been with us for decades.

1094
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,679
Why would she go into my study

1095
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:54,959
to steal the report?

1096
00:47:55,919 --> 00:47:56,560
Qingke.

1097
00:48:07,399 --> 00:48:08,320
Gambling house?

1098
00:48:09,479 --> 00:48:10,919
Nanny Tian is a heavy gambler

1099
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,479
and a regular there.

1100
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:14,080
As a maid,

1101
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,639
her monthly salary
is no more than five taels of silver.

1102
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,399
But those records in your hands

1103
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:21,760
are covered with 50 and 100 taels.

1104
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:24,320
Nanny Tian,

1105
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,199
where is all that money from?

1106
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,280
I went there to gamble

1107
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,719
on my day off occasionally.

1108
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,120
You can’t pin the theft on me

1109
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,120
just because I got lucky

1110
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,080
and won money.

1111
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:39,479
Nanny Tian,

1112
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,159
you can’t read or calculate.

1113
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:42,439
Don’t make things up.

1114
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,959
Gambling houses are to rip gamblers off.

1115
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,360
An experienced and skilled one

1116
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,679
might not come out
with money to go home.

1117
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:49,399
How could you, a housemaid,

1118
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,560
rake in a fortune worth more than

1119
00:48:51,919 --> 00:48:54,320
your entire life’s earnings

1120
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,320
in a few hours on your day off?

1121
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,959
You’d better confess now.

1122
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,320
It’s possible

1123
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,600
that she was in luck

1124
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,600
and on a winning streak.

1125
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,300
Right.

1126
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,959
It might be unfair

1127
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:12,840
to convict her of theft

1128
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,560
based on a few slips.

1129
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:16,239
After all,

1130
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,479
she’s Dongdong’s nanny

1131
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,199
and she’s old.

1132
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,479
If others learn about this,

1133
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:26,399
they’ll call us inhumane.

1134
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:29,210
