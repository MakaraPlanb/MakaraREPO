=Episode 37=

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,560
Your Majesty, we’ve got rid of them.

28
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,600
Qing An took advantage

29
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,400
of my lapse.

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,600
Once my bodyguards are back,

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,080
we’ll recapture the palace

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,160
and get revenge!

33
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,840
We’re caught unprepared, Your Majesty.

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,560
Our priority now is to mass our troops

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,640
to suppress the rebellion.

36
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,240
With your bodyguards in Bingzhou,

37
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,360
I know of an empty fortress

38
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,840
that we can use as a temporary shelter.

39
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,720
We’ll stage a comeback

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,160
when the remaining force finds us.

41
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,640
I can’t escape

42
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,760
in disgrace!

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
We’ll come back

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,440
when the right time comes, Your Majesty.

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,560
I need you

46
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,640
to take care of something first.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,240
What do you need, Your Majesty?

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,000
Bring Siqin to me.

49
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,280
What do you need him for?

50
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,440
Siqin is one of the top arms makers

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,280
in the world.

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,040
With him on our side,

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,120
his weapons can make up

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,840
for our short of hands at the moment.

55
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
And

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,280
Qing An will lose his right-hand man.

57
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,400
What if he refuses to serve under you?

58
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,560
Lock him up until he says yes.

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

60
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,800
(Li’s Mansion)
You can’t go to the capital wounded.

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,240
(Li’s Mansion)
How about you rest for a few more days?

62
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
Don’t leave yet, please?

63
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,520
Relax, Steward Li.

64
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,200
I’m fine.

65
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
I can’t wait any longer.

66
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,160
But...

67
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,240
Wei Shu,

68
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,560
take good care of him!

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,600
Will do, Steward Li.

70
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,360
I’ll make sure he arrives safely.

71
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,760
Let me help you.

72
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,120
What’s so urgent

73
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,600
that you’re risking your life?

74
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,360
Be very careful, my lord!

75
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,800
You’re rushing back

76
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,440
for national security, I believe?

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,640
It’s more important than that.

78
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,360
I don’t believe there’s such a thing.

79
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,600
You wouldn’t understand.

80
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:20,875
(Unifon)

81
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,720
You’re in a wonderful mood, Miss.

82
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,280
I assume our business is booming.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,300
(Unifon)

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,440
Jin Xiao,

85
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,520
why are you standing in my way?

86
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
What do you want?

87
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,400
I...

88
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,125
I...

89
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,760
I’m leaving if there’s nothing.

90
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,840
Unlike you,

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,880
I have work to do

92
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,680
instead of hanging out on the streets.

93
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,640
Shanhu,

94
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:05,250
I...

95
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,600
So...

96
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,120
Is this for me?

97
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,300
Yes.

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
I want to apologize

99
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,330
for my previous mistake.

100
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,400
I bought

101
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,920
what’s said to be

102
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
Princess Jia’nan’s favorite
face-washing cream

103
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,000
especially for you.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
Mr. Jin,

105
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,440
you’re indeed hopeless.

106
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,640
Who’d give my own product
to me as a gift

107
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,960
other than Jin Xiao?

108
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,960
If you ask me,

109
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,240
he didn’t think that much.

110
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
What do you mean?

111
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,560
He must’ve done his homework

112
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,240
about what’s popular
among ladies in town

113
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,240
and picked it up for you.

114
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,200
That’s quite sweet, actually.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,289
(Unifon)

116
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,320
Excuse me.

117
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,080
Let’s go.

118
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,360
Let me go!

119
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,640
Let go!

120
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,680
Let me go!

121
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,520
Let go of me!

122
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,520
It’s you,

123
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,040
the dethroned.

124
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,080
Mocking at me

125
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,560
doesn’t change the fact
that you’re my captive.

126
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,160
What’s done is done.

127
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,360
Seizing me won’t make any difference.

128
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,600
Not exactly.

129
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,680
You raided me

130
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,600
when I lowered my guard.

131
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,720
Once I regroup my troops,

132
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,840
Yongqing will still be mine.

133
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,520
This is the workroom for you

134
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,760
to make all my weapons.

135
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,080
I won’t do anything for you.

136
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,960
No weapons in the world

137
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,440
will help you defeat Qing An.

138
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,240
Are you aware of
The Book of Supreme Weapons?

139
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,960
Never heard of it.

140
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,080
It’s said that

141
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,360
some weapons are
10 times powerful than others,

142
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,800
almost like God’s gifts to soldiers.

143
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,120
I didn’t care about that
when I was little,

144
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,320
but now, I can’t wait to see

145
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,520
if they’re as magical as people said.

146
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,880
If you work for me,

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,440
fame and wealth will be guaranteed.

148
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,240
I...

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,800
I can’t care less about them.

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,680
People of Yongqing are living in misery

151
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,880
under your tyranny.

152
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,320
I’d never aid a tyrant like you.

153
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,400
It’s unnegotiable.

154
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,400
Your life is in my hands.

155
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,525
You must do what I say

156
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,240
whether you like it or not.

157
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,000
Qing Tai,

158
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,120
obedience

159
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,799
never stems from arms

160
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,760
or wars.

161
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,840
Sadly, you don’t get that.

162
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,640
Just because you’re skilled

163
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,240
doesn’t mean you get to lecture me.

164
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,200
Your job

165
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,920
is to make weapons for me.

166
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,800
Get them done

167
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,120
or I see no need to keep you alive.

168
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,125
Stop. No need to make the bed.

169
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,120
Your Highness,
you woke up at almost nine.

170
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,720
Are you going to sleep again

171
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,400
right after lunch?

172
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,120
I’m sleepy.

173
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,080
Should I call in physicians?

174
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,240
Why? I eat and sleep well.

175
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,280
If Grandmother heard them coming,

176
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,640
she’d think I’m ill again.

177
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,080
You may leave.

178
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,000
I’m taking a nap.

179
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,280
Don’t wake me up
unless it’s about Grandmother.

180
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,160
Yes.

181
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,360
Just go.

182
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
You’re always sharp.

183
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,720
How could you not know?

184
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,400
What do you mean?

185
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,560
Her Highness

186
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,560
has never been so sleepy before.

187
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,560
She’s not so much sleepy

188
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,960
as bored, sad,

189
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,560
heartbroken and depressed.

190
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,320
She’d only put all that behind
in her sleep.

191
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,240
It’s bad enough

192
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,440
that we couldn’t cheer her up.

193
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,760
Letting her sleep
is the least we could do.

194
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,150
Sorry, my lord, Her Highness is asleep

195
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,080
She is asleep?

196
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,480
Qingke, let me see her and I’ll go.

197
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,560
When did you come back?

198
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,080
Just now.

199
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,560
Get out.

200
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,840
Grandmother has found out

201
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,600
about us.

202
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,200
You can drop your act.

203
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,400
Baoning,

204
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,600
I was wrong.

205
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,240
Oh, really?

206
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,720
Lord Xin, Li Qian is never wrong!

207
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,880
Leave now or I’ll shout.

208
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,760
Qingke...

209
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,560
Baoning,

210
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,640
I’m sorry.

211
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,680
I really am!

212
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,680
The past is the past.

213
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,480
The last generation’s feud
is among them.

214
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,160
My mother and your father were adults.

215
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,360
Whatever happened between them,

216
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,440
I shouldn’t have blamed you for it.

217
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,880
The past has nothing to do with you

218
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,040
and I shouldn’t have
taken it out on you,

219
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,640
broken your heart

220
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,000
or even hurt you.

221
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,000
I made a huge mistake.

222
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,960
I was supposed to be the one

223
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,520
to protect you

224
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,040
and the one

225
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
to take good care of you,

226
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,400
but I failed completely.

227
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,720
Baoning, I...

228
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,560
It’s my fault! I’m sorry!

229
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,160
I’m such an idiot!

230
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,760
Can you hear yourself?

231
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,400
Please forgive me!

232
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,120
Baoning,

233
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,760
could you give me another chance

234
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,360
and take me back?

235
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,160
What game are you playing now?

236
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,840
I’m such a jerk

237
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:44,475
that hurt you this much.

238
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,760
These are desserts

239
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,840
I picked up on my way here.

240
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
They’re still hot.

241
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,320
Better eat them now.

242
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,880
Baoning,

243
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,040
I mean

244
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,520
every word I just said.

245
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,160
I’ll wait for you.

246
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,960
What did he do now?

247
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,960
I knew it.

248
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,200
That bastard upset Your Highness again!

249
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,040
There, there, Your Highness.

250
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,160
Let’s go tell Grand Empress Dowager.

251
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,560
I’m sure she’ll...

252
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,600
No.

253
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,400
You should go.

254
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,600
I need some space.

255
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,000
Is Her Highness awake?

256
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,280
Grand Empress Dowagers asks for her.

257
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,320
Tell her

258
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,200
I’m out to visit Su.

259
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:15,900
Yes.

260
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,040
Why are you lying to Stewardess Meng?

261
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,000
I don’t want Grandmother
to see me like this,

262
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,160
or she’ll get worried.

263
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,120
Alright. Get me clothes and the sedan.

264
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,360
I’m going to spend the night with Su

265
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
and come back tomorrow.

266
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,240
Come again?

267
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,240
I’m still going to be with Baoning.

268
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,480
Please accept us.

269
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,560
You little bastard!

270
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,800
I have to teach you a lesson

271
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,240
to knock some sense into you!

272
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,840
Master, Master!

273
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,850
Go away!

274
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,600
Don’t beat him. He’s wounded!

275
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,800
Are you still my son?

276
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,560
If you do this,
your mother would never rest in peace!

277
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,960
What am I supposed to tell her

278
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,560
when I met her down there?

279
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,720
That your son

280
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,400
married your killer’s daughter?

281
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,880
And you!

282
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,400
What are you going to tell her?

283
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,480
How are you going to explain it?

284
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,120
Father,

285
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,440
I’ve asked myself that a million times

286
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,840
during which

287
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,960
I’ve hurt Baoning over and over.

288
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,400
Mother’s death remains unclear.

289
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,120
Even if her father did kill Mother,

290
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,480
I’ve decided to let that go.

291
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,280
I know I’ll be damned or go to hell

292
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,440
but that’s the price I’m willing to pay.

293
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,720
I can’t live without Baoning.

294
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,200
No one and nothing can separate us!

295
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,175
You...

296
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:16,880
Report!

297
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,079
Sir,

298
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,839
Lord Xin is summoned to the palace.

299
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,875
Get out!

300
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,050
What’s this about?

301
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,600
Lord Xin, Grand Empress Dowager
asks to see you.

302
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,280
Her Highness summons me?

303
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,000
Yes.

304
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,840
Please come with me.

305
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:02,725
(Shoukang Palace)

306
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,280
How do you feel, Your Highness?

307
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,475
Good.

308
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,080
I’m refreshed.

309
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,680
It’s the only one working.

310
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,200
Your Highness, Lord Xin asks to see you.

311
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,320
Lord Xin? What brings him here?

312
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,680
Your Highness,
you’ve just had your medicine.

313
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,320
Why not...?

314
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,760
No need. I was going to
summon him anyway.

315
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,800
Send him in.

316
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,425
Yes.

317
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,720
You’re doing this
for Princess Jia’nan, right?

318
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,520
Of course.

319
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,080
She and Li Qian are fighting.

320
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,520
I need to know

321
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,520
what he’s thinking for her sake.

322
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,320
I want her

323
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,240
to live happily.

324
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
You care about her so much

325
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,240
that you think everything for her.

326
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,560
Help me get prepared.

327
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,080
Yes.

328
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

329
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,000
Li Qian,

330
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,760
do you remember

331
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,000
Baoning chose to marry you

332
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,920
when you were a nobody?

333
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,800
I’ll never forget

334
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,560
what she’s done for me.

335
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,960
I thought you already did!

336
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,200
Or how could you hurt her like this?

337
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,640
It’s all my fault.

338
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,920
You can make promises all you want,

339
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,280
but can you actually keep them?

340
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,360
Couples should always

341
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,640
be grateful for each other’s sacrifice.

342
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,960
Back then, Baoning was given two edicts.

343
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,320
One was to marry you.

344
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,960
The other was to let you die.

345
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,880
She chose the first one
to save your life.

346
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,480
Could you ever repay her for that?

347
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,640
Ask yourself,

348
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,280
how did you,

349
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,120
a commandant’s son,

350
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,000
rise to one of the most
powerful figures?

351
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,080
You’ve got a high ranking in court,

352
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,000
Jinxi under your control
and a noble title,

353
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,800
yet you’re giving Baoning so much pain.

354
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,040
How am I supposed to accept that?

355
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,840
I’m so sorry, Your Highness.

356
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,840
I made tons of mistakes.

357
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,040
But I’ve decided to let go of the past

358
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,720
and spend the rest of my life
with Baoning.

359
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,720
She’s the apple of my eye,

360
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,640
not a toy you can call upon to play.

361
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,360
Why are you having a change of heart?

362
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:01,435
Are you not committed or weak-minded?

363
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,480
Let me be clear.

364
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,440
You two are over.

365
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,400
I’ll issue an edict tomorrow

366
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,760
to have you two divorce.

367
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,960
Please don’t, Your Highness!

368
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,400
Power and ranking mean nothing to me.

369
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,680
I’ll give them and everything else up

370
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,040
as long as I can be with Baoning.

371
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,240
I love her with my heart and soul.

372
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,320
I won’t agree to divorce!

373
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,960
You have no choice.

374
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,650
Servants!

375
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,280
Your Highness!

376
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,440
Your Highness!

377
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,840
Your Highness!

378
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,080
Your Highness!

379
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,120
I did hurt Baoning

380
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,720
and I’ve been regretting it ever since.

381
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,080
Please, Your Highness,

382
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,280
give me a second chance!

383
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,000
I’ve made my decision, period.

384
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,520
If you insist on
proceeding with this order,

385
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,720
I’m afraid I won’t obey it.

386
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,960
I’d rather die than lose Baoning!

387
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,360
Servants! Get him out!

388
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,760
Your Highness!

389
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,480
Your Highness!

390
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,275
Please don’t do this!

391
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,320
I’m begging you!

392
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,400
Lord Xin bought your bluff.

393
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,960
All these years,

394
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,440
I’ve been doing everything I can

395
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,080
to protect Baoning

396
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,640
and keep her from any harm.

397
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,120
But what did Li Qian do?

398
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,440
He drove her so mad
that she came back home.

399
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,160
Poor girl! Even when she’s here,

400
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,600
she’s trying to look happy
to not worry me.

401
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,320
I can’t imagine how hard she cried
behind my back.

402
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,480
Are you really ordering them to divorce?

403
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,280
Of course not.

404
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,800
I only said that as a threat

405
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,400
so that he’d learn his lesson

406
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,880
and never hurt Baoning again.

407
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,160
Meanwhile, I was testing

408
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,480
how deep

409
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,920
he loves her.

410
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,120
Do you think he passed the test?

411
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
He tore the
Letter of Divorce into pieces,

412
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,800
which shows he fears no one.

413
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,480
No matter what happens in the future,

414
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,720
I believe

415
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,160
he’ll keep Baoning safe.

416
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,680
Indeed.

417
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,680
I do feel sorry for him, though.

418
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,120
He’ll have trouble sleeping tonight

419
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,840
after those harsh words you said.

420
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,360
That’s only a small price to pay.

421
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,520
Fangling,

422
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,880
I’m tired.

423
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,920
Take me back to nap.

424
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:41,000
What happened?

425
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,560
Lord Xin seems overwhelmed.

426
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,120
It’s great

427
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,840
that he’d let go of the past.

428
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,960
What’s holding you back?

429
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,280
They say a broken mirror
can join together.

430
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,640
But even if the two broken pieces

431
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,080
became a whole again,

432
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,200
the crack would still be there.

433
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,080
Trust, once lost,

434
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,200
is hard to be regained.

435
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,440
Don’t you still

436
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,000
want to be with him?

437
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,360
You two can go back

438
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,680
to the good old days if you want.

439
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,560
I’m not sure if we should.

440
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,840
You didn’t touch yesterday’s food?

441
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,560
Now isn’t the time to be picky.

442
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,200
Look around.

443
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,760
You’re in prison,

444
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,160
Better get used to it.

445
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,440
At least you still
have something to eat.

446
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,840
You won’t eat it?

447
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,440
Fine. Whatever.

448
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,000
Some die while others get to live.

449
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,600
Lin, be patient

450
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,000
and hang in there.

451
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,360
We’ll reunite soon.

452
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,600
Then we’ll be together forever.

453
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,444
Did you just come back, Your Highness?

454
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:53,900
Yes.

455
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,160
Grand Empress Dowager is still sleeping.

456
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,760
Who’s a sleepyhead now?

457
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,920
Finally,

458
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,960
she’s caught Her Highness sleeping in.

459
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,640
I know, right?

460
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,120
Her Highness has never
slept this long before.

461
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,680
Somehow,

462
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,675
Princess is also
sleeping long hours lately.

463
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,480
She is?

464
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,640
Yes. She’s in bed all day

465
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,600
but just can’t sleep enough.

466
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,200
Is she...?

467
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,320
Her hand is cold.

468
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:05,285
Why isn’t it getting any warm?

469
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
Grandmother!

470
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,320
Rise and shine, Grandmother.

471
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,240
Grandmother, wake up.

472
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Grandmother!

473
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,560
Wake up, Grandmother!

474
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,560
Stewardess Meng, Qingke!

475
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,760
Stewardess Meng, Qingke!

476
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,600
Come in!

477
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,720
Grandmother!

478
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,600
Can you hear me, Grandmother?

479
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,280
What’s wrong, Your Highness?

480
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,720
I keep calling her but get no response!

481
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,560
What’s happening, Stewardess Meng?

482
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,120
Your Highness!

483
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,160
Grandmother!

484
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
- Wake up!
- Your Highness!

485
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,280
- No way!
- Grandmother!

486
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,720
Open your eyes, Grandmother!

487
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,320
Grand... Grand Empress Dowager...

488
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,320
has passed away.

489
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Grandmother!

490
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,600
Look at me, Grandmother!

491
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,960
I’m right here, Grandmother!

492
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,520
Grandmother!

493
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,960
Grandmother!

494
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,560
Go get physicians, Stewardess Meng!

495
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:29,700
Yes.

496
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,320
Grandmother, I’m here with you.
Grandmother!

497
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,520
(Shoukang Palace)

498
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,280
Hurry!

499
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,450
(Pure and Gracious)

500
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,720
I’m sorry, Your Highness,

501
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,360
Grand Empress Dowager
was advanced in years

502
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,160
and her symptoms match

503
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,480
a sudden heart attack.

504
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,680
Did anything set her off

505
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,560
that she passed away

506
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
in rage?

507
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,320
Grandmother!

508
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,440
Look at me, Grandmother!
Grandmother!

509
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,280
Your Highness.

510
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,840
Your Highness.

511
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,200
Here.

512
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,000
Is everything alright, Mother?

513
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,560
I’m fine.

514
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,760
I’m watching you

515
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,640
practicing calligraphy as usual, no?

516
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,760
You weren’t like this before.

517
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,360
So

518
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,520
what was I like?

519
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,560
“You... You’re absentminded again!
Keep writing!

520
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,720
You can’t slack or play games all day!

521
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,600
Don’t forget you’re the Empress’s son.

522
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,760
You must work harder than others.

523
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,760
Understand?”

524
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,675
You can speak

525
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,000
much better than you write.

526
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,800
You’re smiling again, Mother.

527
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,400
All thanks to you, An.

528
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,325
I’ve been writing all morning.

529
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,520
Can I go play with my brother now?

530
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,920
That’s... The death knell.

531
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,520
Who died?

532
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,120
Grand Empress Dowager.

533
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,560
She passed away?

534
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:34,775
Who...?

535
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,080
It’s Grand Empress Dowager!

536
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:39,725
She... It’s...

537
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,120
Mother, what’s that sound?

538
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,240
It’s the death knell.

539
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:49,785
What’s that?

540
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,280
An,

541
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,120
you’ll know

542
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,320
when you grow up.

543
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,360
Go back to your seat.

544
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,600
Let’s go.

545
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,720
It’s time to get down to business.

546
00:33:37,175 --> 00:33:41,225
(Shoukang Palace)

547
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:48,550
(East Warmth Chamber)

548
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,000
Is Princess alright?

549
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,360
How could she be?

550
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,800
She’s been crying all day
without having anything.

551
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I’m going in to check on her.

552
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,120
Marquis, you can come some other time.

553
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,760
Lord Cao’s wife is inside with her.

554
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,639
Better not disturb them.

555
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,400
Sure. I’m relieved that she’s not alone.

556
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
If she needs anything,

557
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,800
you can always come to me.

558
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,719
I know.

559
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,600
You combed my hair when I was little.

560
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,040
Now, it’s my turn to comb yours.

561
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,400
If we could live again,

562
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,640
how about we swap places?

563
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,120
I’d treat you the same way
you treated me

564
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,000
that I’d love you,

565
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,160
take care of you,

566
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,360
always take your side

567
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,440
and give you
the best things in the world.

568
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,240
I’d never let you get hurt in any way.

569
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,500
Tell me the truth.

570
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,920
Who came to see Grandmother yesterday?

571
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,080
Stewardess Meng, you must know that.

572
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,200
It was Lord Xin.

573
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,875
What brought him over?

574
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,880
When he showed up abruptly,

575
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,480
Her Highness meant to test him for you.

576
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,080
She reprimanded him hard

577
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,600
and threatened to

578
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,240
issue the Letter of Divorce.

579
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,840
Lord Xin refused to comply and...

580
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,080
And tore it into pieces.

581
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,760
What was he thinking?

582
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,160
Actually, he...

583
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
How could he make such a scene
in front of Grandmother?

584
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,760
She was too old to handle that!

585
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,160
Your Highness!

586
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,600
Your Highness, where are you going?

587
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,920
Where’s Baoning?

588
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
I’m sorry.

589
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,760
I wasn’t sure which way she took

590
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,200
and I lost her.

591
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,840
My lady!

592
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,680
My lady, Stewardess Meng,

593
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,680
Marquis is here.

594
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,425
- Marquis.
- Marquis.

595
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,960
When did Baoning leave?

596
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,520
What did she say before that?

597
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,400
She said she has to confront Lord Xin.

598
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,040
Li Qian?

599
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,880
What?

600
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,640
Grand Empress Dowager
passed away?

601
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,440
Impossible!

602
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,760
It’s true. They’ve rung the death knell.

603
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,920
Oh, no, right now, Baoning needs me.

604
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,320
I must go and be with her.

605
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,080
- Where are you going?
- My lord...

606
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,360
Father.

607
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,680
Have you stirred up enough trouble?

608
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,560
Who is it? Stop!

609
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,480
No entry into the military camp!

610
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,680
I’m Princess Jia’nan.
How dare you stop me!

611
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,880
I’ve just learned of the news

612
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,120
that Grand Empress Dowager...

613
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,120
Where’s Li Qian?

614
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,700
Baoning!

615
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,575
Baoning, what are you doing?

616
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,800
Stop playing innocent!

617
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,080
Are you trying to deny
what you did to Grandmother?

618
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,400
Baoning,

619
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,040
I know you’re in tremendous pain

620
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,960
but I did just hear about her death.

621
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,520
Grandmother ordered you to divorce me

622
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,760
and you tore
the Letter of Divorce apart,

623
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,960
didn’t you?

624
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:53,960
Yes.

625
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,760
Why did you do that?

626
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,120
I couldn’t afford to lose you.

627
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,000
Do you know

628
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,000
she died of a heart attack
induced by rage?

629
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,320
It’s your fault!

630
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,440
What?

631
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,600
How did that happen?

632
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,920
Baoning, you...

633
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,960
She’s gone.

634
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,680
Nothing you say would bring her back.

635
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,640
But...

636
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Would you rather let me
sign my name on it?

637
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,880
If that’d buy her a few more years,

638
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,080
yes, I’d do that.

639
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,120
Really?

640
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,600
Yes.

641
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,600
Baoning, I know you only said that

642
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,760
out of grief and anger.

643
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,800
I beg you to calm down and listen to me.

644
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,840
Grand Empress Dowager’s death

645
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,400
pains me deeply,

646
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
but trust me,

647
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,080
from now on,

648
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,760
I’ll take care of you just like she did

649
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,800
and I’ll dig to the bottom
of what happened.

650
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,360
No one and nothing in this world

651
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,760
can matter more than Grandmother.

652
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,680
I didn’t even get to
see her one last time

653
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,840
or be there for her before she left

654
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,800
all because of you!

655
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,200
How could I still be with you?

656
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,120
I know.

657
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,560
I made a huge mistake.

658
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,000
I shouldn’t have destroyed that letter

659
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,960
but I couldn’t possibly see this coming.

660
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,160
Whatever I say is of no use.

661
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,680
Just kill me now.

662
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,280
I’ll pay with my life.

663
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,960
You think I wouldn’t dare?

664
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,560
Your injury won’t change anything.

665
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,200
I’ll never forgive you again.

666
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,000
My lord!

667
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,560
Step aside, Father.

668
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,120
Jiang Baoning, what more do you want?

669
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,080
Your father took my wife’s life

670
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,720
and now, you’re taking my son’s?

671
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,080
We never meant to be your enemy.

672
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,240
Couldn’t you leave us alone?

673
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:34,960
My lord...

674
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,720
You want to end things once and for all?

675
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,400
Fine. Let’s do it!

676
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,080
Father,

677
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,760
this is between Baoning and me.

678
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
I can handle it.

679
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,320
Shut up!

680
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,560
Did she care about you at all

681
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,480
when she attacked?

682
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,560
The gilding ball is broken.

683
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,680
That’s a sign.

684
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,040
You and I are done.

685
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,600
Our relationship ends here and now.

686
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,960
Baoning!

687
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,440
Baoning!

688
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:31,600
(Saint Grand Empress Dowager’s Tablet)

689
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:37,575
(Memorial)

690
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,600
Your Highness.

691
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,600
Release her.

692
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,080
But Grand Empress Dowager
had her imprisoned here.

693
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,440
Open your eyes!

694
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,520
Empress Dowager
is the one in charge now.

695
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,920
If you don’t know who you’re serving,

696
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,320
you’re dismissed!

697
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,960
Yes, I’m sorry.

698
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,960
I’ll only take orders
from Empress Dowager.

699
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,680
Enough. Open the door.

700
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,280
Yes.

701
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,920
That’s all. You may leave.

702
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,640
Yes.

703
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,880
Congratulations, Your Highness!

704
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,640
Rise, Miaorong.

705
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,640
What are you

706
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,320
congratulating me on?

707
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,200
Your Highness,

708
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,680
you’ve become the head of the palace.

709
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,320
Everyone will have to listen to you.

710
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,440
How great is that?

711
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,520
I don’t think so.

712
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,120
It’s too soon to celebrate.

713
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,840
Don’t forget

714
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,040
Princess Jia’nan is still out there.

715
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,320
Your Highness,

716
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,960
without Grand Empress Dowager,

717
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,520
she’s nothing.

718
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,360
You don’t need to worry about her.

719
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,240
You’re wrong.

720
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,960
Grand Empress Dowager might be gone

721
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,440
but Jiang Baoning
can still oversee the court

722
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,480
while I’m stuck

723
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,000
inside these walls with maids.

724
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,680
That’s not

725
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,560
good enough.

726
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,440
So,

727
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,040
what do you have in mind, Your Highness?

728
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,480
You two have been here all night.

729
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,920
Go back to rest.

730
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,560
I’ll stay.

731
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,680
You’ve done much more than us.

732
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,120
You should rest.

733
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,200
I’m fine.

734
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,000
Look,

735
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,800
you all should get some rest.

736
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,080
We’ll still have to be here for days.

737
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,840
If you all collapse,

738
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,960
who will look after Baoning?

739
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,000
I’ll stay with her now.

740
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,040
Thank you, my lady.

741
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,920
No need to thank me, Stewardess Meng.

742
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:14,760
Let’s go.

743
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,480
Baoning,

744
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,400
I know you’re overwhelmed.

745
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,760
It’s fine to cry.

746
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,760
There’s just the two of us.

747
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,600
Let it all out.

748
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,600
I’m here with you.

749
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,440
Princess Jia’nan is most filial.

750
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,680
Grand Empress Dowager’s death

751
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,240
must’ve hit her hard.

752
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:54,960
It’s late.

753
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,040
What brings you here, Your Highness?

754
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,200
I came to the mourning hall

755
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,120
to pay my respects, of course.

756
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,440
Others all did that in the morning.

757
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,880
Why did you wait until now?

758
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,440
Her Highness

759
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,320
was too grieved

760
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,280
over Grand Empress Dowager’s death

761
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,880
to get out of bed earlier

762
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,000
and she struggled

763
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,560
to make it all the way here this late

764
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,560
despite her condition.

765
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,480
Go ahead, Your Highness.

766
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,440
Wait for it, Grandmother.

767
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,040
You’ll soon reunite

768
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,320
with your most beloved granddaughter

769
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,120
down there.

770
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,560
Grand Empress Dowager’s death

771
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,320
must pain you the most.

772
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,800
Look at you.

773
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,400
You look awfully pale.

774
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,080
I can’t stand

775
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,520
seeing you torturing yourself like this.

776
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,240
If you don’t want to leave Grandmother,

777
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,920
I can give you a chance

778
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,320
to guard her tomb. How about that?

779
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,960
You...

780
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,360
What are you doing, my lady?

781
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,960
Her Highness is helping

782
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,800
Princess Jia’nan
fulfill her filial duty.

783
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,160
Princess Jia’nan

784
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,040
volunteering to guard
Grand Empress Dowager’s tomb for life

785
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,280
will leave a mark in history.

786
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,920
You can’t stop her, my lady.

787
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,320
I’ve drafted

788
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,480
the application for you

789
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,560
and stamped it.

790
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,840
All we need is your fingerprint.

791
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,880
Don’t do it, Baoning! Get up!

792
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,320
My lady! My lady!

793
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,520
Useless!

794
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,880
Don’t, Baoning!

795
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:06,800
My lady!

796
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,240
My lady!

797
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,640
Let me go!

798
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,480
My lady!

799
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,400
How dare you!

800
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,400
Let go of me!

801
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,160
Put your finger on it.

802
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:18,680
Baoning!

803
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,800
- And you’ll forever be with her tomb.
- No, Baoning!

804
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,450
Baoning!

805
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,160
Let me go!

806
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,360
You’ll never be back
to the capital again.

807
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,280
Baoning!

808
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,680
Baoning!

809
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,400
Stop!

810
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,000
Are you alright, Baoning?

811
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,000
If you had come a second late,

812
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,360
Baoning would’ve been exiled

813
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,040
to guard Grand Empress Dowager’s tomb.

814
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:00,840
Your Highness,

815
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,440
a word, please?

816
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,160
Marquis Jinghai,

817
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,680
what are you doing?

818
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,680
I should ask you that,

819
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,960
Your Highness.

820
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,720
Princess Jia’nan misses
Grand Empress Dowager,

821
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,360
so I’m sending her
to guard the tomb out of kindness.

822
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,480
I don’t see your reason

823
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,440
to stop me.

824
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,160
Listen to

825
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,840
what I’m about to say carefully.

826
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,040
Anyone,

827
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,240
I mean anyone,

828
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,360
who lays a finger on Princess Jia’nan

829
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,120
is an enemy of mine.

830
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,800
Believe me,

831
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,000
you don’t want to

832
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,440
act against me.

833
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,400
That’s all I have to say.

834
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,800
The rest is up to you.

835
00:52:28,025 --> 00:52:33,100
(Ciyuan Hall)

836
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,960
Does it hurt, Miaorong?

837
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,720
We can call in physicians again.

838
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,640
I’m fine.

839
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,080
I’m a nobody here

840
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,320
and I can’t trouble them again

841
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,440
or hire others from the outside.

842
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,360
But your injury can’t wait.

843
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,025
We can beg Empress Dowager for help.

844
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,200
After all, you’re working for her.

845
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,760
I don’t want to owe her more.

846
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,600
What do you mean?

847
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,400
She gave me permission

848
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,400
to come here to visit you.

849
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,520
She did?

850
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,225
Yes.

851
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,080
The pain has stopped

852
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,840
after you applied that powder to me.

853
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,325
Hey, don’t hurt yourself again.

854
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,520
Have her treated by a physician.

855
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,200
Why are you still so nice to her

856
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,040
when she sounds ungrateful?

857
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,360
Our previous plan
to kick Jiang Baoning out failed,

858
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,360
and now, I have another one.

859
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,960
Only Zhao Xiao
can’t interfere this time.

860
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,560
Neither can Li Qian.

861
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,080
But we need Gao Miaorong
to make it work.

862
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,840
Take good care of her.

863
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,560
Ask Li Lin to visit her regularly

864
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,920
to cheer her up.

865
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:28,920
Understand?

866
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:29,920
Yes.
