00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,319
It’s windy out there.

28
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:01,160
How about you sleep inside?

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,360
There’s a boundary between
men and women,

30
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,300
right?

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,759
I’m a man and you’re a woman,

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,960
it’s inappropriate for us
to sleep in one room.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,240
Fine, Li Qian.

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,000
You’ll pay for this.

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,600
Li Qian, get in here!

36
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,199
Your Grace, what do you ask of me?

37
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,320
Sit down.

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,559
Don’t look at me.

39
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,200
No way.

40
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:45,880
Morning, Your Grace.

41
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:49,920
Morning.

42
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:52,959
How was your sleep last night?

43
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,359
Nothing felt strange to you, right?

44
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Anything strange?

45
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,375
Yeah.

46
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,320
I woke up somehow feeling

47
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,640
my arm was numb.

48
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,559
A numb arm, huh?

49
00:05:06,675 --> 00:05:07,300
Right.

50
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,320
I guess it resulted from
your bad sleeping position.

51
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,225
Bad sleeping position?

52
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:11,799
Yeah.

53
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:12,920
Does it make your arm numb?

54
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,040
Yes.

55
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,160
Different people, different symptoms.

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,825
Let’s hit the road.

57
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:20,250
Okay.

58
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,079
Your Grace, look.

59
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
Look what I have got.

60
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,679
What are the two fish for?

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
For eating.

62
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,160
Aren’t you hungry?

63
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,160
You eat them.

64
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,239
I won’t eat them.

65
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,279
You said it.

66
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,160
It smells so good.

67
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,079
The fish is crispy outside,
and tender inside.

68
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,600
It’s so well cooked.

69
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,640
Your Grace.

70
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
How about you deign to have a taste?

71
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:42,959
All right.

72
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,440
I’m full.

73
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:45,760
Let’s keep walking.

74
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,040
Your Grace, it’s barren ahead of us.

75
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,279
I guess there will be no food.

76
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,239
Please bear with it.

77
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:52,920
Not until we arrive at a town by night

78
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,160
will there be food.

79
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:55,679
Seriously?

80
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,440
Do you really only feed yourself?

81
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,480
You said you wouldn’t eat the fish.

82
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,679
You’re unbelievable!

83
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,399
Other than roasting,

84
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,320
fish can also be wrapped
in lotus leaves, and cooked on the fire.

85
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:18,200
It’s called beggar’s fish.

86
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,920
It uses the similar
cooking method of beggar’s chicken.

87
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,440
How about a taste?

88
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,200
Are you fooling me?

89
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,160
No, no.

90
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,440
You’re an elegant princess.

91
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,880
You surely can’t get used to
eating like this.

92
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:31,920
Please bear with it.

93
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,279
Just one bite.

94
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,679
Goodbye, sir.

95
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,480
What can I do for you?

96
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Food

97
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,440
or room?

98
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,679
Two rooms,

99
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,079
and some good dishes.

100
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,679
Sir,

101
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,880
the money is only enough for one room.

102
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,399
As for dishes...

103
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,200
Two fine rooms.

104
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,959
Best food,

105
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,760
send to our rooms.

106
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,760
Sure, lady.

107
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,480
I’m on it.

108
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,679
Your Grace, it’s...

109
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,799
Look,

110
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,239
there’s a tailor shop over there.

111
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Go buy two fine dresses for me.

112
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,079
Pretty and comfortable ones.

113
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:20,720
But I mean...

114
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,000
No “but”.

115
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,959
Just go.

116
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:36,375
(Alcohol)

117
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,320
You’re in a good mood, aren’t you?

118
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,280
Booze, huh?

119
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,440
This is for you.

120
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,559
It’s been a long journey.

121
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:53,080
Good.

122
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,300
Tuck in.

123
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,475
What?

124
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,675
It’s just

125
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,080
the journey was tough,

126
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,359
I haven’t got a chance
to thank you properly.

127
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,799
That’s why you bought the drink and food

128
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,719
to reward me?

129
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:25,719
I’ll remember everything that
you have done for me

130
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,159
forever.

131
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:32,559
Your Grace, what the...

132
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:40,184
Your Grace, you...

133
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,640
Li Qian.

134
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,520
Li Qian.

135
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,159
I promise you’ll be alright.

136
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,050
Someone’s over there.

137
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,479
Sleeping drug.

138
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,080
Baoning.

139
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,640
No.

140
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,719
Check that spot.

141
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,880
Qing Tai’s soldiers.

142
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,080
Baoning must be around.

143
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,840
Search carefully.

144
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,039
Help!

145
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,175
Help!

146
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,359
- Quickly, go.
- Help!

147
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,975
Help!

148
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:37,840
Baoning.

149
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:56,850
Chase them!

150
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,520
They want me.

151
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,760
I don’t want to be your burden.

152
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,400
You live, I live. You die, I die.

153
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,640
I’ll be at your side,
come hell or high water.

154
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,750
Stay alert.

155
00:13:57,955 --> 00:14:00,500
(Jinxi)

156
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,320
Watch out!

157
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:36,880
Come on!

158
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:46,725
Chase them!

159
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,000
Your Highness.

160
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,960
Your Highness, no!

161
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:51,239
This is Jinxi.

162
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,799
Li Qian is the son of
the Commandant of Bingzhou.

163
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,000
The garrison is heavy here.

164
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,880
We’d better not mess with them.

165
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,359
Your Highness,

166
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
once they

167
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,520
find out our moves,

168
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,799
I’m afraid we aren’t able to
escape from Mu’an anymore.

169
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,520
Please listen to my advice.

170
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,320
Let’s hunker down for now,

171
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,520
and bide our time.

172
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,719
Retreat.

173
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,719
Yes, my lord.

174
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:17,919
Retreat.

175
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:29,000
Your Highness,

176
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,960
is your headache eased?

177
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,575
Yeah.

178
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,359
I feel much better.

179
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:38,400
Thank you for these days.

180
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:41,919
I grew up along with Baoning.

181
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,000
Now, she’s married to Yongqing State,

182
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,000
the person who concerns her
the most must be you.

183
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,320
I wonder if I can

184
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,400
see her again in this life.

185
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,280
I’m sure you can.

186
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:55,875
Yeah.

187
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:57,450
Your Highness,

188
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,960
this is the secret message
Xiaoman urged to the palace.

189
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:07,600
Unbelievable!

190
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,320
Qing Tai never really
wanted to marry Baoning.

191
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,520
The whole thing has been a fraud.

192
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,159
Baoning, my poor granddaughter,

193
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,599
sacrificed herself for the greater good,

194
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,559
but she was made a victim!

195
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Baoning was extricated by Li Qian,

196
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,479
but they were hunted.

197
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:26,800
Your Highness,

198
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,919
Baoning is in danger.

199
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,280
Li Qian?

200
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,679
A low position can’t satisfy Li Qian,

201
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,880
and he serves Empress Dowager Cao.

202
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,280
I’m not sure

203
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,320
what’s the purpose of his action.

204
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,679
Your Highness,

205
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,679
it may not be
as complicated as you think.

206
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:52,640
Baoning is a clever girl.

207
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,239
If she doesn’t feel like
running away with Lord Li,

208
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,359
Lord Li can’t force her.

209
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,960
You mean she follows him voluntarily?

210
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,599
Remember the fire at Treasure House?

211
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,560
Lord Li got Baoning

212
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,800
out of the fire.

213
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:09,599
And afterwards, it was

214
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:11,359
Lord Li who risked his life
keeping Baoning away from danger.

215
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,479
During the joust,

216
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,920
Baoning was almost

217
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,719
obtained by Yongqing State.

218
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,959
Fortunately, Lord Li won the race.

219
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,280
Though he was nearly discovered,

220
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,359
to me,

221
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,119
a strong bond had been formed

222
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,719
between them.

223
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,160
If so,

224
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,319
why did Baoning never bring it up?

225
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,319
Even though Baoning falls for Lord Li,

226
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,119
he wasn’t born in a royal family.

227
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,040
If he tried to act against the emperor
or Marquis Jinghai,

228
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,599
his family would be in danger.

229
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,239
And Baoning chose to marry

230
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,479
the prince of Yongqing
for the greater good.

231
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,160
I see.

232
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Li Qian is a good man.

233
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,599
I think Lord Li and Baoning
are on their way

234
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,680
to seek help.

235
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:00,119
It’s just...

236
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,119
If His Majesty learns about it,

237
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,560
I’m afraid Lord Li...

238
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:06,475
Yes.

239
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
You have a point.

240
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,760
However, we are not Baoning.

241
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
This choice

242
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,479
has to be made by her.

243
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,520
Baoning is now in danger,

244
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,199
what choice can she make now?

245
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,359
Come, Su.

246
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,839
Follow me.

247
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,550
(Tayuan Temple)

248
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:46,079
Master, let’s talk over there.

249
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,640
Master, how is she doing?

250
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Mr. Li,

251
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,680
it’s not a kind of poison
made in our state.

252
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,199
It’s not difficult to cure her,

253
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,959
however, the aftereffect can last long.

254
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,925
Even if she takes my gold elixir,

255
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,760
it’ll still take years
to clean her system.

256
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,199
And she didn’t get enough nutrition
when she was little,

257
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,640
so she has a weak body.

258
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,359
She needs extra care in the future.

259
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,280
Is there any harm done to her core?

260
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,000
What’s the relationship
between you and the lady?

261
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,079
She’s my wife.

262
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,640
In this case,

263
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:25,680
I must mention this.

264
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,239
Before the poison is
completely cleared out of her system,

265
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:30,680
you can’t have intercourse.

266
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:32,760
Once she’s pregnant,

267
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,719
I’m afraid neither the mother
nor the baby can survive.

268
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,560
Thank you for the information.

269
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,825
You bastard.

270
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,800
I’m not your wife.

271
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,450
I’m not going to make a baby with you.

272
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:02,680
Your Grace,

273
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,520
time to drink the medicine.

274
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,160
The medicine can’t be left to be cold.

275
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,319
If it’s difficult for you to wake up,

276
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,359
I’ll have to adopt a radical measure.

277
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,900
Get off the bed.

278
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,325
Your Grace,

279
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:45,040
we’re now in Jinxi.

280
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,400
Please rest for half a day

281
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,920
before we get back to the journey.

282
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:50,800
No.

283
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,119
Liu Xiaoman escaped to Yunzhong.

284
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,925
If he can’t find me,

285
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:58,199
he’ll do everything he can to
send the message to the palace.

286
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,199
When I’m back in the palace,

287
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,425
I’ll ask the Grand Empress Dowager

288
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,280
to pardon and reward you.

289
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:05,550
Your Grace,

290
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,400
your current health condition

291
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,479
doesn’t allow you
to go on a long journey.

292
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,920
You’d better go back to
Bingzhou with me for the time being.

293
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,599
I have to go.

294
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:18,800
It’ll be too late if I don’t leave now.

295
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,479
It’s okay.

296
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,719
Just let it be late.

297
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,925
I know that you fight to
return to the imperial palace

298
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,319
for my benefit.

299
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:27,479
However, I really don’t want you to
go back to a place

300
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:30,839
where I can barely see you.

301
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,675
You’re out of your mind.

302
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,920
If I don’t go back in time,

303
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,479
you’ll be convicted of
kidnapping a princess.

304
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,160
For the benefit of the people,

305
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:43,959
the imperial court won’t start a war,

306
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,839
and Qing Tai will get away with it.

307
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,359
The crime of kidnapping a princess

308
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,400
is enough to make sure you’re
sentenced to decapitation.

309
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,000
Even so,

310
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,160
I’ll never let go of your hand.

311
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,725
Your Grace,

312
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,850
I, Li Qian, adore you.

313
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,479
I’ve been keeping my love to myself.

314
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,239
I wish you to marry me.

315
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,400
If you’re willing to do so,

316
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,800
I’ll keep my promise to you.

317
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,839
I’ll stay by your side
for the rest of my life.

318
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,319
We live and die together,

319
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,680
with our hearts connected.

320
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,079
Your Grace,

321
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,000
please search your heart for an answer.

322
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,680
It’ll be the death of you.

323
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,199
I’m not afraid.

324
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,040
Li Qian!

325
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,040
You bold dirtbag!

326
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,680
Come out and face me!

327
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,000
It’s Lyu.

328
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
Come out now!

329
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,160
Are you waiting for me
to invite you out?

330
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,280
Lord Lyu, calm down.

331
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,400
How dare you let my dainty sister

332
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:13,880
get hurt?

333
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,839
She traveled and slept
in the wilderness with you.

334
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,800
Her reputation is defiled.

335
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,640
Is this how you protect her?

336
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:19,479
Lord Lyu,

337
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,479
it’s all my fault.

338
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,839
But I love Her Grace with all my heart.

339
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:26,760
Love her with your heart?

340
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,400
How dare you say it?

341
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:31,680
We don’t step in it.

342
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,880
Let them fight.

343
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,520
Don’t forget what Her Highness said.

344
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
Let’s go find Baoning.

345
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,175
Sure.

346
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:41,079
You plotted

347
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,359
the kidnapping of
the Commandery Princess,

348
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,199
which is a capital crime.

349
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,680
What makes you think you can say
that you love her?

350
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,875
Lord Lyu,

351
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:49,560
do you wish to see

352
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,800
her married to the prince of Yongqing?

353
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,319
As her elder brother,

354
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,880
do you have the heart
to watch your beloved sister

355
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
fall prey to a villain?

356
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,719
Don’t lecture me using the excuse
of doing this for her.

357
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,599
Yes, Qing Tai is a cursed bastard,

358
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,319
but you aren’t anything better than him.

359
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,359
Wasn’t there any selfish motive

360
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,400
when you took her away?

361
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,079
Why don’t you fight me back?

362
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,800
It is my fault.

363
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,560
If by doing this,

364
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,520
you’re letting your anger out,

365
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,920
then just keep beating me.

366
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:40,375
(Mount Wutai)

367
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:43,079
Master Zhao.

368
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:44,439
Hurry.

369
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,775
Baoning.

370
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,725
Su.

371
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,800
Lord Cao.

372
00:24:59,675 --> 00:25:00,439
Baoning.

373
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,439
It must have been a tough journey.

374
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,079
Su,

375
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,640
you two just got married.

376
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,839
You’re here to see me in Jinxi,

377
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,959
is there something important?

378
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,150
Baoning, good guess.

379
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,880
It’s the Grand Empress Dowager’s order.

380
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,350
What’s this?

381
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,875
Kill him or keep him alive.

382
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,599
It’s your call.

383
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,280
Wait!

384
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:50,119
Lord Lyu, please put down your sword.

385
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:51,959
What are you doing here?

386
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,119
If I could,

387
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,599
I would never watch

388
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,079
Qing Tai take Baoning away.

389
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,239
In order not to get the Mansion
of Marquis Jinghai involved,

390
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,920
I have broken the tie with my father.

391
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,119
He can never stop me from

392
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:06,000
marrying Baoning anymore.

393
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,160
I’m here

394
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,280
to take Baoning back to
the capital city,

395
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:10,400
and then, she and I will get married.

396
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,599
If so, there’s one more reason
for me to kill him.

397
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,800
What Li Qian did

398
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,800
is for the benefit of
me and Commandery Prince.

399
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,680
Please have mercy.

400
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:25,839
I don’t want to tell you off, Zhao Xiao.

401
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,560
Do you have any idea
what’s going on right now?

402
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,199
Why are you so dull?

403
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:31,000
How can I convince myself
to marry my sister to you?

404
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,719
Where is Baoning?

405
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:36,400
I’m taking her away.

406
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,079
Master Zhao,

407
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
it has come to this.

408
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,839
I won’t let you take her away.

409
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:44,640
Li Qian,

410
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,650
what’s the meaning of this?

411
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,560
When Her Grace was in danger,

412
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,599
you and I were supposed
to rescue her together.

413
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,239
But you didn’t show up.

414
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,239
I didn’t meet you up

415
00:26:58,239 --> 00:26:59,100
for a reason.

416
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,640
I stepped out

417
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:02,959
because I genuinely thought

418
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:05,800
you could make Her Grace happy.

419
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,160
But now,

420
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,650
I simply can’t

421
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,280
entrust a hesitant man

422
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,760
with Her Grace.

423
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,719
From now on, Her Grace

424
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,239
will be safeguarded by me alone.

425
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:28,719
Li Qian,

426
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,119
what’s the meaning of your words?

427
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,319
Are you saying

428
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,800
you’re fighting me
over Princess Jia’nan?

429
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,199
You’re a man of lowly birth.
You don’t have the right!

430
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,640
Also,

431
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,719
the Grand Empress Dowager wanted

432
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,959
her to marry me.

433
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:47,359
She belongs to me.

434
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:48,839
She belongs to nobody.

435
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,959
She belongs to wherever

436
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,680
her heart goes.

437
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,839
I hope she doesn’t sacrifice herself

438
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,800
for anyone or anything anymore.

439
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:57,239
Her husband,

440
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:58,680
her life

441
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,000
should be decided by herself.

442
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,439
What a speech of hypocrisy!

443
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,040
I see you as my brother

444
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,800
while you stab me in the back.

445
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,000
Very well then.

446
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,520
I’d like to see

447
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,760
if you can convince my sword.

448
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,079
What?

449
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,040
Are you afraid?

450
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,719
If you can,

451
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:27,760
just take my life.

452
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,680
But

453
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,680
you won’t take Her Grace away.

454
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,680
Whether I can or not

455
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,680
is not up to you.

456
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:40,325
Stop!

457
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,119
Here’s the imperial edict.

458
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:43,800
Li Qian, listen.

459
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,959
To Li Qian, the Commander
of Longevity Hill Imperial Guards.

460
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,199
Commandery Princess Jia’nan,
the first daughter of Princess Yong’an

461
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:05,239
is smart, elegant, and refined.

462
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,880
Growing up at the side of
the Grand Empress Dowager,

463
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:10,079
Princess Jia’nan is Her Highness’s
beloved granddaughter.

464
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,560
It is the wish of Her Highness that
I issue an imperial edict

465
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:16,000
to choose a fine fiancé among the
officials for Princess Jia’nan.

466
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,560
Li Qian, the Commander of
Longevity Hill Imperial Guards,

467
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,839
is a noble man who masters
both martial arts and literature.

468
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,760
They are to be married
on an auspicious day on site.

469
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,719
Li Qian, is the imperial edict received?

470
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,520
The imperial edict is received.

471
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,199
Thank you, Your Majesty.

472
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,199
How come there are
two pieces of imperial edicts?

473
00:29:50,425 --> 00:29:51,375
These are two blank scrolls

474
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,400
that the former emperor gave
the Grand Empress Dowager.

475
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,599
They have been kept in
the Directorate of Palace Seals.

476
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:57,599
That’s why Her Highness

477
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,079
sent me and my husband

478
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,800
to personally deliver the two
imperial edicts to you.

479
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:03,959
One is to grant marriage,

480
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,520
the other is to grant execution.

481
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,880
Her Highness has allowed you to

482
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,599
make life decisions on your own.

483
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:13,920
Your happiness

484
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,959
means everything to her.

485
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,160
Between you and me,

486
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,520
only one

487
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:42,520
gets to walk out of here alive.

488
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,079
I believe I’m a worthy man
for Princess Jia’nan.

489
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:47,959
I honestly can’t give up Baoning.

490
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,920
If you still hold a grudge
or hatred against me,

491
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:52,719
just bring it on.

492
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,975
Zhao Xiao, are you crazy?

493
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,239
Killing him is against
the imperial edict.

494
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:52,000
It’s a monstrous crime.

495
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:55,280
The edict is issued.

496
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,199
What’s done cannot be undone.

497
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,479
Do you really want to kill him

498
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,125
and make my sister lose her fiancé

499
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,680
before her wedding?

500
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,319
Think of Baoning.

501
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,439
Why?

502
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,599
Why things turn out to be like this?

503
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,530
She was supposed to be my wife.

504
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:28,851
My wife.

505
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,850
My hatred for you

506
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:37,575
will last forever.

507
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,040
From now on,

508
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,680
we’re not brothers anymore.

509
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,275
We’re eternal enemies.

510
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:12,850
Young Master.

511
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:16,760
Did Master send you?

512
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,725
Yes.

513
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,075
What did Master say?

514
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:31,825
Young Master.

515
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,599
Your father has sent his men
to take you home.

516
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,300
He is furious

517
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,839
because of you

518
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,719
and threatens to renounce you.

519
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,199
Fine, do it.

520
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:49,479
I can’t even keep the woman I love.

521
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,719
What is the point of an heir status?

522
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,800
Master was talking in anger.

523
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,359
You’re his only son.

524
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:00,199
Everything he does

525
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,439
is for your good.

526
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,239
What a perfect excuse.

527
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:06,400
Since I was a child,

528
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,575
he’s been doing things that I dislike

529
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,800
in the name of being for my good.

530
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,679
For my good?

531
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,399
I think he is for his own good.

532
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,500
All his life he’s been living
for the title of marquis.

533
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,400
He ignored my mother

534
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,239
and let her die of depression.

535
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,239
He wants me to live heartlessly

536
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,320
only for so-called responsibilities

537
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,120
just like him.

538
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,360
Why are you looking at me like this?

539
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:50,800
You’re good-looking.

540
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,625
You’re ugly.

541
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,959
Look how many scars are there
on your face?

542
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,439
And your chest, too.

543
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,600
You always get new wounds
before old wounds are healed.

544
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
When will it end?

545
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:02,959
It doesn’t matter.

546
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,080
I have rough skin
that can withstand injury.

547
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,000
Why?

548
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,919
Do you care about me?

549
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:12,700
What are you talking about?

550
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,760
Are you trying to murder your husband?

551
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,919
Shameless.

552
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:18,200
What husband?

553
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,560
We haven’t married yet.

554
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,399
It’s not a good reason.

555
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,479
The edict that
guarantees our marriage is issued.

556
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:24,760
You are destined to be my wife.

557
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,439
What if I don’t want to marry you?

558
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:27,080
You surely want.

559
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,679
You’re over-confident.

560
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,600
All right.

561
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,080
Take out the other edict.

562
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:41,950
Baoning, what…?

563
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,479
Baoning, I know you too well.

564
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,679
In order not to leave anything
that others can hold against you,

565
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:50,000
you definitely
destroyed the other edict.

566
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,679
I know you did it for me.

567
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,439
So, you care about me.

568
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,239
Don’t flatter yourself.

569
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:07,800
Your brother comes to kick me out.

570
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,375
I’d better go.

571
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:23,925
Lyu.

572
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,600
What’s up?

573
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,400
Where is he?

574
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,575
What do you mean?

575
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,679
Baoning,

576
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,199
what do you see in Li Qian?

577
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,800
Of all the fine young men
all over the country,

578
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,159
why do you choose him?

579
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,200
I don’t know either.

580
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,650
I was somehow destined to

581
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,719
choose him.

582
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:53,600
Baoning,

583
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,439
what do the men of the Jiang Family

584
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:56,479
gallop across the battlefield for?

585
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,600
If I can’t protect a woman,

586
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,159
I might as well
take off my armor and go home

587
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,159
to be a common person.

588
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:02,975
Baoning,

589
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,080
if you say no,

590
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:06,280
the edict

591
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:07,840
doesn’t matter at all.

592
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,800
I’ll take you away right now.

593
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:10,959
Lyu.

594
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,080
I won’t regret my choice.

595
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,760
Really?

596
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,400
Never.

597
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,080
Baoning,

598
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:27,600
if he fails you in the future,

599
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,575
make a fuss as you may.

600
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:30,840
Anyway, your marriage

601
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,199
is bestowed by the emperor.

602
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,199
I don’t believe he dares discard you.

603
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,199
If it gets too big,

604
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:36,879
write to me.

605
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,479
I’ll go to pick you up.

606
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,900
Don’t be afraid if you have children.

607
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:41,000
If the Li Family won’t raise them,

608
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,719
we will bring them up.

609
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,080
They can inherit my surname and title.

610
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,399
Maybe we can produce a general.

611
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,760
Our family will have
qualified successors.

612
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,679
Why do you cry

613
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,600
for no reason?

614
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,199
Baoning,

615
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:07,679
remember,

616
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,400
the Jiang Family will always

617
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,439
be your strongest backing.

618
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,550
Yeah.

619
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,439
Li.

620
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,725
What are you doing here?

621
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,719
Because of the two attendants
of your princess.

622
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,719
I’m their savior.

623
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:26,575
But they’re ungrateful.

624
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,550
They kept asking to see
their princess all the way.

625
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,199
They gave me a headache.

626
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:31,399
So I sent them back.

627
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,159
Is there any news of Qing Tai?

628
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:37,320
You don’t miss anything.

629
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,525
As you expected,

630
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:40,879
Yongqing State has deployed

631
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,679
many scouts as internal agents
at every key pass.

632
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,439
I caught a few.

633
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,959
Under torture,

634
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:46,600
they all confessed.

635
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:49,239
The enemy tried to take the opportunity
of the princess being sent to wedding

636
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,320
to knock on the city gate,
attack from inside and outside,

637
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,199
break the border and invade our country.

638
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:55,639
Now the princess is sent back safely.

639
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:56,959
The enemy didn’t get what they wanted.

640
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:59,360
I’m afraid they’ll declare war
with the excuse

641
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,600
that the princess has broken
the promise of marriage.

642
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:02,840
Where is Qing Tai?

643
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,239
He escaped.

644
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:06,959
The scouts reported,

645
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:08,800
when the frontier forces of the enemy

646
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,639
recalled the troops in Mu’an
on a large scale,

647
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,840
there was no unusual action.

648
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,919
So I don’t think he’s left the border.

649
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:18,879
Jin Xiao.

650
00:39:19,675 --> 00:39:21,525
Send the news to the capital
as soon as possible.

651
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,840
I’ll write to my father,

652
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,360
asking him to step up security against
Bingzhou and surrounding capitals

653
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,679
and make sure to catch Qing Tai.

654
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:28,225
Yes.

655
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,650
Baoning.

656
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,600
The Grand Empress Dowager
asked you to get married here

657
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:44,919
in order not to make more trouble.

658
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,100
In a few days,

659
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:48,399
your aunt will come

660
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:50,320
and bring you wedding presents.

661
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,950
You’ve helped me a lot these days.

662
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,350
I just want you to be happy.

663
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:58,550
Now you’re far away
from the ignoble strife.

664
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,600
You should live your life happily.

665
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:02,375
Of course.

666
00:40:03,525 --> 00:40:04,100
Yeah.

667
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,560
Ahead is the courtyard for Baoning
to stay before the wedding.

668
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,719
Li Qian, let’s say goodbye.

669
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,600
By the way, let me remind you.

670
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,560
Don’t you see Baoning again
before the wedding.

671
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:21,425
Yeah.

672
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:35,950
Baoning.

673
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:38,425
Stay here with a light heart.

674
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,450
I’ll pick you up to our wedding
in a few days.

675
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:49,900
(Bingzhou)

676
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,425
(Li’s Mansion)

677
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:56,919
Young Master, Master is waiting for you
at the ancestral hall.

678
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,100
Yeah.

679
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:06,826
(Li’s Ancestral Hall)

680
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,520
(Serve Ancestors with Filial Respect)
Father, I’m back.

681
00:41:13,075 --> 00:41:14,000
Get on your knees.

682
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,400
(Commandant of Bingzhou Li Changqing)

683
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,040
You bastard.

684
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,575
I let you go to the capital

685
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,760
to follow up the clue

686
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,919
to your mother’s murder on one side,

687
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,719
and bring glory on our ancestors
on the other side.

688
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,080
What did you do?

689
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,679
How dare you be so
undaunted and reckless?

690
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,479
In front of the people of Yongqing,

691
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,959
you took away the Commandery Princess.

692
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,199
If the imperial court blames us,

693
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,040
the whole family will be doomed.

694
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,879
Father.

695
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:50,560
Don’t call me father.

696
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,639
I should call you father.

697
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,560
I dare not

698
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:55,320
be your father.

699
00:41:56,425 --> 00:41:57,320
You bastard.

700
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,639
How dare you take advantage of me!

701
00:41:58,879 --> 00:42:00,080
You need a spanking.

702
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,000
Father, father.

703
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:02,450
Stop it. Stop it.

704
00:42:03,399 --> 00:42:05,080
I have injuries all over my body.

705
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,050
Oh?

706
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,175
Who has hurt you?

707
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,600
I’m your son.

708
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:13,760
The minor injuries

709
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,225
are no big deal.

710
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,919
Father, before you punish me,

711
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,120
I have something important

712
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,159
to ask you.

713
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,100
I wrote to you and asked you to
be on guard against Qing Tai.

714
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,320
How is it going?

715
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,900
The army of Yongqing

716
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,239
stationed outside the city.

717
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:31,760
Qing Tai

718
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,325
sneaked in a few days ago.

719
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,159
Now he’s hiding somewhere in the city,

720
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,675
waiting for the chance
to get through the pass.

721
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,520
My men almost caught him the other day.

722
00:42:41,399 --> 00:42:43,200
But he is too cunning.

723
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:44,520
He slipped away.

724
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,040
He tries to take revenge on me.

725
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,700
He knows our family
is guarding Bingzhou City.

726
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,040
So he deliberately gathered his army

727
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,199
outside the city.

728
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:56,040
If the enemy breaks the border defense,

729
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:57,239
our family must be blamed

730
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:59,159
for the fall of the border.

731
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:01,879
So, we must catch Qing Tai

732
00:43:02,439 --> 00:43:03,560
before the enemy breaks through.

733
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,575
Yeah.

734
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,719
You.

735
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,320
It hurts. Don’t punish me.

736
00:43:11,479 --> 00:43:12,760
Why didn’t you listen to me?

737
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,040
Move.

738
00:43:16,879 --> 00:43:18,560
Over there. Over there.

739
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,775
(Zhou’s Mansion)

740
00:43:24,675 --> 00:43:25,399
Don’t move.

741
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:30,575
Take them all away.

742
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,159
Go.

743
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:46,959
Speak.

744
00:43:47,879 --> 00:43:48,719
Where’s Qing Tai?

745
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:01,250
Distinguished guests.

746
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:02,399
Come in, please.

747
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:04,199
Here, beauty.

748
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,280
Fill the cup.

749
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,040
Qing Tai. You can’t escape.

750
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:34,679
Li Qian, the shame you put on me today,

751
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,360
I must repay you with a hundredfold.

752
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,120
I’m waiting for that.

753
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,879
The King of Yongqing comes in person.

754
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,879
(Bingzhou City)
Why does he bring so few soldiers?

755
00:45:59,575 --> 00:46:00,775
(Bingzhou City)
Commandant Li,

756
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,825
I know

757
00:46:03,399 --> 00:46:05,479
you have my son.

758
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,560
Our countries have been
living together in peace.

759
00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:12,725
I don’t want to see

760
00:46:13,439 --> 00:46:14,800
war breaks out between us

761
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,719
just because of personal grudges.

762
00:46:19,399 --> 00:46:20,400
Let my son go.

763
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,679
I’m willing to
make compensations for you.

764
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,760
Prince Qing Tai

765
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,760
will inherit the throne in the future.

766
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,600
If he dies in our country,

767
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,600
it will not only
shake the foundation of his country,

768
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,959
but also undermine
their national prestige.

769
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,719
Though we got the confession
from their scouts,

770
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,600
their army didn’t really

771
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,840
start the war.

772
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,719
So we have no reason

773
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:49,280
to kill their prince.

774
00:46:49,525 --> 00:46:50,959
(Bingzhou City)

775
00:46:50,959 --> 00:46:53,399
Qian, what do you think?

776
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,760
The King dare come in person,

777
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:57,840
I don’t think he’s unprepared.

778
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,959
I guess their troops

779
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,450
are lying in ambush nearby.

780
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:05,159
The Emperor has just regained power
and the national treasury is in deficit.

781
00:47:05,919 --> 00:47:06,919
We can’t

782
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,280
start a war.

783
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,350
That’s why

784
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,080
you have to catch Qing Tai,

785
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,760
threaten his father

786
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:20,239
and force their troops to retreat?

787
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,800
Your Majesty, devising cunning schemes
to marry our princess

788
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,239
isn’t a personal grudge.

789
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,159
Our country warmly invited the prince,

790
00:47:28,399 --> 00:47:30,075
(Bingzhou City)
yet he held evil intentions of

791
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,959
taking the opportunity to invade us.

792
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:33,520
If you really

793
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,360
don’t want to fight with us,

794
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:37,280
you should show sincerity.

795
00:47:39,879 --> 00:47:42,360
As the king of Yongqing,

796
00:47:43,399 --> 00:47:44,900
I didn’t discipline my son well.

797
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:49,439
(Bingzhou City)
As a result, he tried to offend your country.

798
00:47:49,919 --> 00:47:50,959
I’m ashamed.

799
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,399
As long as you let Qing Tai go,

800
00:47:54,919 --> 00:47:58,439
I will sign an alliance with you.

801
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:03,040
Our countries will forge a brotherhood
from now on.

802
00:48:03,439 --> 00:48:06,840
Our troops along the borders
and in each district

803
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:11,560
will never invade you again.

804
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:15,840
Your Majesty.

805
00:48:17,879 --> 00:48:19,425
Your word carries weight.

806
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,919
But I must report to the throne

807
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,520
before we sign the alliance.

808
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,080
A mere verbal statement is no guarantee.

809
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,959
I’m just Commandant of Bingzhou.

810
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:31,120
I dare not make the decision.

811
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,959
I’ll give you my scepter as a token.

812
00:48:37,439 --> 00:48:39,719
Return it to me

813
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,239
when we sign the alliance.

814
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:45,959
The scepter is second only to
the imperial seal in his country.

815
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:49,159
He seems to be sincere.

816
00:48:57,775 --> 00:49:03,750
(Bingzhou City)

817
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,479
Even if she doesn’t marry me,

818
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,840
she won’t marry a toad, either.

819
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,199
You’re a toad wishing to eat swan meat.

820
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:39,750
Li Qian.

821
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,639
I remember you.

822
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,000
I’m honored to get Your Highness’s

823
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:46,275
special treatment.

824
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,639
Even if I’m a toad,

825
00:49:50,399 --> 00:49:52,239
your father has to exchange

826
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,159
his scepter with me for you.

827
00:49:55,399 --> 00:49:56,239
Li Qian.

828
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,879
Drag him back.

829
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:00,760
Qing Tai, come back.

830
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,120
Let go of me.

831
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:04,000
Let go.

832
00:50:04,879 --> 00:50:05,760
Let go.

833
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,900
(Bingzhou City)

834
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,575
(Qinzheng Hall)

835
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:24,760
Qing Tai deserves death.

836
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:27,879
Do they think
we don’t have valiant generals?

837
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,125
If he dares to invade us,

838
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:33,040
we’ll fight at the strength
of the whole country.

839
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:40,800
How’s Baoning?

840
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,225
Your Majesty,

841
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,800
the Commandery Princess
stays in Bingzhou according to

842
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,750
the Grand Empress Dowager’s order.

843
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,159
She’ll marry Li Qian
on an auspicious day.

844
00:50:52,399 --> 00:50:53,280
What did you say?

845
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,879
Issue an edict.

846
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,500
Dissolve the marriage immediately.

847
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,575
