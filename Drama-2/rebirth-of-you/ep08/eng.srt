00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
your life

191
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,039
or Baoning?

192
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,479
With a heart so dear,

193
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,039
until death do us part.

194
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,280
What are you doing?

195
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,640
Your Majesty,

196
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,960
I truly love Her Grace.

197
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,450
Please give us your blessings.

198
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:44,925
You...

199
00:10:44,925 --> 00:10:45,725
Stop!

200
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,799
Your Majesty!

201
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,919
Your Majesty!

202
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,119
Your Majesty, you...

203
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:55,239
How could you do this to him?

204
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,919
Guards! Guards! Come in!

205
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,239
Have him treated
in my palace immediately.

206
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,359
- Yes.
- Yes.

207
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,159
Grandmother,

208
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,080
he’s coveting my woman!

209
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:14,799
Your woman?

210
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,039
Your Majesty,

211
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,880
you already have a wife

212
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,919
and a son.

213
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,559
Baoning is no longer yours.

214
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,559
She deserves to have a home

215
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,479
and live her own life.

216
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,840
I will not allow anyone

217
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,400
to stand in the way of her happiness,

218
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:37,719
including the Emperor!

219
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:44,375
Let’s go.

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,375
(Shoukang Palace)

221
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,479
Lie back down!

222
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,400
Or your wound will open up again.

223
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:06,119
Your Highness.

224
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,359
You’re brave.

225
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:11,599
You almost got killed for Baoning.

226
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,851
Do you regret that?

227
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,679
I’ll die a hundred times
for Her Grace if I have to.

228
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:18,850
Good.

229
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,440
Did you know

230
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,159
His Majesty’s attitude towards Baoning?

231
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:26,325
Yes.

232
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,559
Let me ask you something.

233
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,000
If she becomes your wife,

234
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,375
how are you going to protect her?

235
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,799
I’ll do my best

236
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
and go back to Nanmin

237
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,159
to carry on my father’s legacy

238
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:44,600
and battle against pirates.

239
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,150
Mhmm.

240
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,599
Stop my family’s power from expanding

241
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:50,559
and never set foot again in the capital.

242
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:51,650
I see.

243
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,239
You’re wise

244
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:55,000
to know when to let go.

245
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,359
Here’s another question.

246
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,440
If Baoning is married into your family,

247
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,679
how are you going to treat her?

248
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
I’ll cherish her

249
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,440
as if she’s my life.

250
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,479
Are you waiting up for me, Grandmother?

251
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,960
We need to talk.

252
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,280
About what?

253
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:28,960
I’ve thought long and hard

254
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,359
and realized that
the Emperor wouldn’t let you go

255
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,239
no matter who you’d marry.

256
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:37,239
On that note, your future husband

257
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:39,679
must be brave and capable enough

258
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,799
to stand against him.

259
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,889
What do you think of Zhao Xiao?

260
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,559
Grandmother,

261
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,960
I had a long day.

262
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,359
Can we talk about it later?

263
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,840
We can’t! There’s no time!

264
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,359
When the Emperor asked him
what he felt about you earlier,

265
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,679
he said,

266
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,159
“With a heart so dear,
until death do us part”.

267
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,799
That infuriated the Emperor

268
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:11,320
and he almost killed Zhao Xiao.

269
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,799
He has a strong background

270
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,039
as Marquis Jinghai’s son.

271
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,679
His talent and personality

272
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:25,760
are both laudable.

273
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:28,440
His love for you

274
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,719
is unwavering even in face of death.

275
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,599
Most importantly,

276
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,799
he’s not afraid of power.

277
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,039
Baoning,

278
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,000
he certainly is the best for you.

279
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,039
But...

280
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:48,719
But Nanmin is so far away.

281
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,679
I want to be with you.

282
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,039
Silly!

283
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,400
If you’re happy,

284
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,679
I’m happy.

285
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,080
Don’t worry about me.

286
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:03,080
Just tell me

287
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,520
if you want to marry him.

288
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,359
If you do,

289
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,239
I’ll betroth you to him.

290
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,200
It’s for your wound.

291
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,760
Fine.

292
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,000
I’ll do what you say.

293
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,700
Good.

294
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,359
I’m relieved.

295
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,479
We need to get things ready

296
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,520
before going to Longevity Hill.

297
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
Are we going there?

298
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,325
Yes.

299
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:06,400
Empress Dowager remains

300
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,039
the head of the harem as I promised

301
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,280
despite the power shift.

302
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,719
She needs to know about your betrothal

303
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,919
and sign off on it.

304
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,359
Bring me with you

305
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,320
and you’ll feel less bored on the way.

306
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,880
Zhao Xiao should go with us, too,

307
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:26,000
and pay respects to her.

308
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,799
If you insist.

309
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,080
(Marquis Dingbei’s Mansion)

310
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,840
My lady,

311
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,599
Lord Cao is rude.

312
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,320
He keeps avoiding you

313
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,119
when you pay him visits.

314
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,559
His position has been undermined.

315
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:45,760
Better keep a distance from him.

316
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,159
He refuses to see me

317
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,000
for my sake.

318
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,400
I can’t do much for him,

319
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,359
but I won’t be those who run away

320
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,719
when he’s down.

321
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,880
His Majesty doesn’t need him anymore

322
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,760
since Empress Dowager
handed over the throne.

323
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:04,199
I’d help him in any way if I could.

324
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,959
You’re a saint, my lady.

325
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,199
Even when he keeps ignoring you,

326
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:08,839
you’re still worried about him.

327
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,000
Su.

328
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,800
There you are.

329
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,880
Someone came earlier

330
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,359
to propose marriage to you.

331
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,040
His name is Han Qizong.

332
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:19,800
His father and I

333
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,160
have vetted him.

334
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,000
He’s as handsome as they said.

335
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,359
I’m not marrying him, Mother!

336
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,400
You aren’t?

337
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,050
Well...

338
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,760
He’s from
an established family of scholars.

339
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,719
I said I won’t marry him!

340
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,520
Talk to her!

341
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,000
Go!

342
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:45,839
Su,

343
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,199
is there

344
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,800
someone else in your mind?

345
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,040
As long as he’s a good match,

346
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,880
we can propose the marriage

347
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,160
to his family.

348
00:17:57,425 --> 00:17:58,000
That’s right.

349
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,000
I...

350
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,040
I just want to stay with you.

351
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,560
We love you,

352
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,280
but you can’t be with us forever,

353
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,079
right?

354
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,880
You can tell us

355
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,000
if you’re in love with another man.

356
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,479
But if you aren’t,

357
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:19,239
we suggest you consider Han Qizong.

358
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,599
Father, Mother,

359
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,040
I’m tired.

360
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,560
I’m going back to my room.

361
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:25,719
Su,

362
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:26,325
- listen...
- Enough.

363
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:29,479
Go ahead.

364
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:46,239
That’s a sudden change of attitude.

365
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,400
Is she seeing someone?

366
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:05,920
My lady,

367
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,359
may I light the lamps?

368
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,719
Or are you in bed?

369
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,319
Get the carriage.
We’re going to Lord Cao’s Mansion.

370
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,439
My lady,

371
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,640
not again, please!

372
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,160
No...

373
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,239
My lady!

374
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,100
(Lord Cao’s Mansion)

375
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,560
My lady. This way, please.

376
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,839
I see that you’ve compromised

377
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:38,880
and let me in.

378
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,800
Now, it’s too late

379
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,800
to turn your back on me.

380
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,280
I haven’t had a chance

381
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,800
to thank you for all your help before.

382
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,479
Now that you’re sick,

383
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,479
I hope my medicine
can make you feel better.

384
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,199
I hate to ask this,

385
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:27,760
but could you do me a favor?

386
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:30,546
I’m unable to protect myself

387
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:33,015
at this point.

388
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,319
That said,

389
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,599
I’ll do anything within my power

390
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,199
to help you.

391
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,040
Lord Cao,

392
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,040
will you marry me?

393
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,119
I know that’s too big

394
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,160
and abrupt a request,

395
00:21:58,479 --> 00:21:59,040
but

396
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,880
I’m indeed desperate.

397
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:12,040
You should go.

398
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,640
My parents are eager

399
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,359
to marry me to Empress Han’s relative,

400
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,119
but I can’t be with a stranger.

401
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:23,920
I understand you refuse to drag me down,

402
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,239
but given your situation,

403
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,280
you need my family’s power, don’t you?

404
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,439
I’m doing alright!

405
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,199
Whatever happens to me is my problem!

406
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,239
I don’t need anyone’s sympathy!

407
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,599
Lord Cao!

408
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:36,680
Lord Cao!

409
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,079
Leave!

410
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,160
I apologize if I offended you.

411
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:06,839
Su.

412
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,300
Yes?

413
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,319
Your head isn’t even in the game.

414
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,119
So, what happened?

415
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:20,359
Nothing.

416
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:23,280
Look,

417
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:24,880
we aren’t related by blood,

418
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,359
but we’re like sisters.

419
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,920
Is there anyone else

420
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,800
who you’d rather share your secret with?

421
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,280
Baoning,

422
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:38,359
I don’t know what to do.

423
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,160
Your Grace,
to what do I owe this pleasure?

424
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,400
You seem laid-back, Lord Cao.

425
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,719
Only to please myself amidst the pain.

426
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,000
That’s still better

427
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,760
than someone

428
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,199
who’s unable to even do that.

429
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,079
What are you insinuating, Your Grace?

430
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,760
You must be aware of Han Qizong.

431
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,880
What’s your point, Your Grace?

432
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:24,479
That man

433
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,280
is related to Empress Han.

434
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,119
He’s good-looking

435
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,400
and quite capable.

436
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,800
But he’s already lost two wives

437
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,479
at the age of 25,

438
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,280
and they both died mysteriously.

439
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,959
Their families tried to file a case

440
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,359
but got suppressed by him.

441
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,640
According to my source,

442
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,880
that man

443
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,479
is an abusive husband.

444
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:44,959
He beats his wives and servants

445
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:46,640
whenever he’s stoned.

446
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,239
Why did you bring him up, Your Grace?

447
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:56,000
He’s asked Marquis Dingbei

448
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,280
to marry Su to him as his third wife.

449
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:03,560
The Han Family is nothing

450
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,079
without Empress Han.

451
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,400
Or how would a humble widower like him

452
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,680
dare to propose
to Marquis Dingbei’s daughter?

453
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,479
You can do the drawing over

454
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:16,959
if it’s ruined

455
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,119
but there’s no do-over

456
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:20,760
if someone’s life is ruined.

457
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,560
My lady!

458
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:31,439
My lady!

459
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,450
My lady!

460
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,160
Lord Cao is here to propose!

461
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,599
What?

462
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,479
You mean you wish to marry Su, Lord Cao?

463
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
I am sincere

464
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:52,439
and I hope you’ll approve it.

465
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,560
Su is our only child.

466
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,719
We can’t make the decision

467
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,800
before checking with her.

468
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,239
I’ll leave you to it

469
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,959
and I hope to hear back from you soon.

470
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,254
Sure.

471
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:11,975
Wait!

472
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:18,719
Su!

473
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:30,837
(Marquis Dingbei’s Mansion)

474
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,280
You don’t need to come out.

475
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,225
Lord Cao,

476
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,760
what changed your mind all of a sudden?

477
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,359
Life is too short

478
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,239
to have any regrets.

479
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,400
(Ciyuan Hall)

480
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,719
Is it true that Grand Empress Dowager

481
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:06,400
had them hang the lanterns earlier?

482
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,040
Yes.

483
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:08,920
Eunuch Liu from the Shoukang Palace

484
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,640
gave us specific instructions.

485
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,520
In that case,

486
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,280
Her Highness must’ve accepted me.

487
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,325
Grand Empress Dowager
is going to Longevity Hill.

488
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,319
Are you sure?

489
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,719
Our men in her palace

490
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,199
didn’t hear the word,

491
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,520
but she had arranged

492
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,560
a visit to Longevity Hill

493
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,479
with Princess Jia’nan in two days.

494
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,520
What could that visit for

495
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,319
other than Her Grace’s marriage?

496
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
Are there

497
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,760
any candidates yet?

498
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,439
Marquis Jinghai’s son and Lord Cao

499
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,560
were invited to
the Shoukang Palace days ago.

500
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,439
That explains it.

501
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,640
No wonder His Majesty
stabbed Marquis Jinghai’s son!

502
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,160
Grand Empress Dowager

503
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,520
marring Jiang Baoning to him

504
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:01,920
must’ve provoked him.

505
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,479
Baihe,

506
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,079
we’re going to Longevity Hill tomorrow

507
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,839
to beat Grand Empress Dowager

508
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,920
and Jiang Baoning to it
before they arrive.

509
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:10,675
Um.

510
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:13,479
Grand Empress Dowager
only cares about her granddaughter.

511
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,400
Get those lanterns

512
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,051
out of my sight!

513
00:28:17,051 --> 00:28:18,825
(Ciyuan Hall)

514
00:28:18,825 --> 00:28:21,225
(Qinzheng Hall)

515
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,560
How is it possible

516
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,040
to manage such a vast land?

517
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:32,079
Your Majesty,
Commandery Princess Jia’nan is here.

518
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:33,040
Send her in!

519
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,319
Baoning,

520
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,680
finally, you’ve come to see me

521
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,920
since we came back from Longevity Hill.

522
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:44,560
I’m a true emperor now.

523
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,119
Give me some time,

524
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,040
and I’ll make you my empress.

525
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,239
It’s just that

526
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,199
lately, there are rumors

527
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:56,319
about Grandmother
marrying you to someone else.

528
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,560
My mind is a mess.

529
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,719
I don’t want to think about it

530
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:04,439
and I could really use a trip to
Longevity Hill with Grandmother.

531
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,520
No problem

532
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,800
as long as you’re still with me.

533
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,959
You can go

534
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,000
wherever you like.

535
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,719
I heard

536
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:14,079
the Treasure House at Longevity Hill

537
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,479
keeps all kinds of delicate gadgets.

538
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,959
As you know, I’m into such things,

539
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:19,319
so,

540
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,479
may I have the layout of that place?

541
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,400
I’d like to take a look.

542
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:24,400
Of course!

543
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,520
Du Sheng,

544
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:28,599
fetch that layout

545
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,599
for her.

546
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

547
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:30,675
Thanks.

548
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,150
(Gate of Divine Might)

549
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:43,326
(All is at Peace)

550
00:29:48,225 --> 00:29:48,760
Stop!

551
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,119
No weapons are allowed inside!

552
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,439
Hand me your weapons.

553
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,725
Let them in.

554
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:33,839
(Wu Man)

555
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,599
(First Prince of Yongqing, Qing Tai)
Qing Tai pays respects to you, Your Majesty.

556
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:40,959
Please rise.

557
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:41,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

558
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,439
What your long journey to Mu’an

559
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:50,439
is for?

560
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,520
Mu’an and Yongqing
are neighbors.

561
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,959
Friendly exchanges are necessary.

562
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:59,439
We’ve already missed

563
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:00,839
Empress Dowager’s birthday celebration

564
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,479
and we shall at least come

565
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,319
and congratulate you
on your assumption of power.

566
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:12,599
We hope you like

567
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,640
the gold, silver and jewelry

568
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,760
from our state.

569
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,680
That’s very kind of you.

570
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,880
Mother is enjoying her retirement

571
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,920
at Longevity Hill after her birthday

572
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,239
and can’t receive you in person.

573
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:30,959
I’m going to hold a welcome banquet

574
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,920
for you tonight instead.

575
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,680
Your Majesty’s hospitality is
much appreciated.

576
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,079
After the banquet,

577
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,160
I’d like to go to the Longevity Hill

578
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:40,680
to pay a courtesy visit

579
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,920
to Empress Dowager.

580
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,439
Your Majesty,

581
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:51,079
news came from the Ciyuan Hall

582
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,239
that the Empress had left

583
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:53,680
for Longevity Hill early this morning.

584
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,040
Why did she go there?

585
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,640
Grandmother and Baoning

586
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,359
were going for relaxation.

587
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:04,079
Her presence

588
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,920
would only ruin Baoning’s mood.

589
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,839
She was concerned

590
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:09,920
that Empress Dowager

591
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,400
would feel lonely there,

592
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:14,959
so she’d like to keep her company.

593
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,139
Hadn’t Mother tricked me

594
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,000
at the banquet that day,

595
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,310
I would’ve never married Han Tongxin!

596
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,839
What have you found

597
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,119
on Song Xianyi?

598
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,520
It’s confirmed

599
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,439
that she went to see

600
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:37,079
Empress Dowager there secretly.

601
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:40,280
No wonder

602
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,239
she was promoted so quickly.

603
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,279
She must’ve tipped off Grandmother, too.

604
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,280
Pass my order.

605
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,760
Confine Song Xianyi

606
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,989
to the Cold Palace,
effective immediately!

607
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

608
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,880
My respects to you, Your Highness.

609
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:10,319
Mother.

610
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,779
What brings you here?

611
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,680
I came urgently

612
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,515
because I have big news.

613
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,359
What is it?

614
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:19,959
Mother,

615
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:22,560
Grand Empress Dowager

616
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,160
is on her way here with Jiang Baoning

617
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,119
and Marquis Jinghai’s son.

618
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:27,839
They’re coming

619
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,599
to discuss their marriage

620
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,760
with you.

621
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,839
That’s it?

622
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,079
How is that big news?

623
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:35,839
Mother.

624
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,280
The Archduke’s Mansion is in charge
of the army for generations.

625
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,880
Marquis Jinghai’s son
is guarding Nanmin for decades.

626
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,880
If those two sides

627
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,880
with strong forces become allies,

628
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:46,800
chaos will rise for sure!

629
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:50,520
I’ve already retired.

630
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,760
State affairs

631
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,959
are now the Emperor’s concerns.

632
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,119
Besides,

633
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,959
Marquis Jinghai guarded Nanmin

634
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,520
for so long.

635
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,479
He was dedicated.

636
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,959
We can count

637
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:07,319
on his son’s loyalty.

638
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,080
But, Mother...

639
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,479
Stop. I’ve heard enough.

640
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,199
I don’t get to decide

641
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:15,040
or interfere in

642
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,600
who Baoning will marry.

643
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,479
Grand Empress Dowager is only coming

644
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:21,919
to ask me to issue a standard edict

645
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,919
as a formality.

646
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,959
Jiang Baoning, you want a happy marriage

647
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,000
after driving a wedge
between me and the Emperor?

648
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:39,959
In your dreams!

649
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,399
Young Master.

650
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:55,840
Li Qian!

651
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,239
Good to see you.

652
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,040
What happened to you?

653
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,479
I’m fine. Nothing serious.

654
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,520
That wound is totally worth it

655
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,360
because Grand Empress Dowager

656
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,120
is marrying
Commandery Princess Jia’nan to me!

657
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
I’m here

658
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,919
with Her Grace and Her Highness

659
00:35:09,919 --> 00:35:11,360
to seek Empress Dowager’s approval.

660
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:16,719
Li Qian?

661
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:18,479
Are you alright?

662
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:21,280
Their carriage is right behind.

663
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,159
They’ll arrive shortly.

664
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,560
I should go

665
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,800
and pay respects to Empress Dowager.

666
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:25,600
See you.

667
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,040
Hey,

668
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,000
you must

669
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,159
attend our wedding!

670
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,560
Goodbye.

671
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,120
I will.

672
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,639
After coming such a long way,

673
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:56,879
I do need to freshen up.

674
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,120
Try this one.

675
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:07,199
It makes you glow.

676
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:09,040
Some tea will soothe you.

677
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,199
Greetings, Your Highness.

678
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,625
My respects to you, Mother.

679
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:25,159
All rise.

680
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:28,719
How are you doing here?

681
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,080
Thanks for asking.

682
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:32,879
I’m doing fine.

683
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,000
The weather here is always pleasant,

684
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,479
which makes it a perfect resort.

685
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,959
May I ask

686
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,520
what this visit is for, Mother?

687
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,600
Yi has already married.

688
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,875
It’s time to focus on

689
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,239
Baoning’s marriage

690
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,320
before she gets too old.

691
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:53,000
I can’t agree with you more, Mother.

692
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:54,479
It is time

693
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:57,600
to find the right man for her.

694
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,959
I heard

695
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:04,360
you brought Marquis Jinghai’s son along.

696
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,360
I wonder

697
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,439
if you’re in favor of him.

698
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:11,360
That’s right.

699
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:16,360
He stood out from tons of candidates.

700
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,000
You’re still the head of the harem.

701
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:25,360
I can’t bypass you
to make the decision alone.

702
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:27,479
Thanks for your respect.

703
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,719
I trust your judgment

704
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:31,239
and your read of people.

705
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,800
Marquis Jinghai’s son
is from a noble family.

706
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,239
His personality and looks

707
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,840
are impeccable.

708
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,159
Mother, I assure you

709
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:40,320
that I’ll have Bureau of Astronomy

710
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,040
select an auspicious date

711
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,280
to announce the betrothal.

712
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:46,760
Good.

713
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,125
Hey, you,

714
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,080
tell your Empress Dowager

715
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:06,520
that First Prince of Yongqing is here.

716
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:10,000
Please wait for a moment.

717
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:11,560
I’ll let Her Highness know.

718
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:24,919
Don’t drop it.

719
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
Empress Dowager likes
that potted pine the most.

720
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,360
Yes.

721
00:38:29,425 --> 00:38:30,120
How rude!

722
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,879
This is the First Prince of Yongqing.

723
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:33,959
How dare you get into his way!

724
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,919
I... I’m so very sorry, Your Highness.

725
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,040
Don’t do it again.

726
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,510
Your Highness,

727
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,360
Empress Dowager is ready for you.

728
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,159
Piss off!

729
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,199
This way, please.

730
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,840
Your Grace.

731
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,399
Nice to see you again.

732
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:24,760
I’m here with Grandmother to relax

733
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,679
and go into the Treasure House

734
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:27,479
for The Book of Supreme Weapons.

735
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:33,360
They say you’re marring
Marquis Jinghai’s son.

736
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,399
Congratulations.

737
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,639
Do you also think

738
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,840
that I should marry him?

739
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,239
He’s an all-round talent

740
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,159
of noble birth.

741
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
I figure you’ll be happy with him.

742
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:55,600
You don’t know that.

743
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:57,199
I’m sorry for offending you.

744
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:02,719
So, are there new leads

745
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,719
to that book?

746
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,879
Is that thing all you care about?

747
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:10,280
I’ve located the secret door
in the Treasure House.

748
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,840
I’ll get that book for you as promised.

749
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:18,679
Your Grace!

750
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,399
Wait for me, Your Grace!

751
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,639
Where are you going?

752
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,600
The Treasure House of course!

753
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,320
I can’t come all the way
without going there.

754
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,360
Your Grace!

755
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,639
Your Grace!

756
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,239
Wait for me, Your Grace!

757
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,159
Don’t go!

758
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,360
If you want anything,

759
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,959
just tell Grand Empress Dowager
and she’ll give it to you.

760
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:37,199
You don’t need to go there in person!

761
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:38,639
If I don’t go,

762
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:40,520
how am I supposed to know
what I should ask for?

763
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,150
Right.

764
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,439
You have a point there.

765
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,159
Look, Your Grace!

766
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:04,280
They’re probably envoys

767
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,199
who haven’t left
after Empress Dowager’s birthday.

768
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,239
Let go!

769
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:24,919
She’s the Commandery Princess!

770
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:26,025
- Let me go!
- Back off!

771
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,000
Let go of Her Grace!

772
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,919
Are you
the Commandery Princess of Mu’an?

773
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,840
Why did you attack me?

774
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,199
I didn’t! I don’t even know you!

775
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,560
I think she aimed at this snake.

776
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,959
Rumor has it that women of Mu’an

777
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,520
only stay indoors and do needlework.

778
00:41:47,025 --> 00:41:49,465
Your pretty face

779
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,465
and attacking skills prove that wrong.

780
00:41:52,879 --> 00:41:53,825
How chatty!

781
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:54,400
Let’s go.

782
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,879
Are you still going to
the Treasure House, Your Grace?

783
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,760
Maybe tomorrow.
I’m no longer in the mood.

784
00:42:22,487 --> 00:42:25,475
(Treasure House)

785
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,959
Your Grace,

786
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:29,959
are we here too early?

787
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:31,840
There’s not even a guard.

788
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,719
The Guards of Li have just taken over
Longevity Hill.

789
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,040
They haven’t assigned anyone here yet.

790
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:37,560
I see.

791
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,270
Alright.

792
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:43,520
You can stay here.

793
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,560
I’m going in.

794
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,600
Sure.

795
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:53,775
(Treasure House)

796
00:43:05,439 --> 00:43:08,040
The layout says to turn one object

797
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,879
to get access to the treasures.

798
00:43:10,439 --> 00:43:11,719
Where is it?

799
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,360
Found it. This must be it.

800
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:29,800
And turn these two.

801
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:57,040
The Book of Supreme Weapons!

802
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,040
Here it is!

803
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:01,800
Oh no!

804
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,040
How is this place on fire?

805
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:15,560
Qingke!

806
00:44:17,439 --> 00:44:18,439
Qingke!

807
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,000
Help!

808
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,959
Fire!

809
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,320
Your Grace!

810
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:31,479
Your Grace!

811
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:33,040
Your Grace!

812
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,520
Your Grace!

813
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,760
Help!

814
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,320
