Why can you say you have true love?

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,480
Dongzhi.

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,040
Dong...

31
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,440
I said,

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,000
let’s break up.

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,680
Dong...

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,920
You’re my enemy.

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,160
If you come to me again,

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,640
I’ll unmask you.

37
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,200
Don’t blame me for being merciless.

38
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,000
This is yours.

39
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,600
Take it back.

40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,800
Your Highness, the secret order
has been issued.

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,000
We’re going to Bingzhou.

42
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,120
Now that you can’t let go of Miss Li,

43
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,080
why don’t you go tell her?

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,640
I’m in such a bad situation.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,120
Even if I find her,

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,280
I’ll have her suffer with me.

47
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,680
I don’t want to get her implicated.

48
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,225
Let’s go.

49
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,474
Pendants.

50
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,256
Dustpans. Come and have a look.

51
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

52
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
Before my father died,

53
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,800
he told me about the Dark Force.

54
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,400
Now, Father has been dead.

55
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,960
Qing Tai reigns over Yongqing State.

56
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,840
If he advocates peace

57
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,920
and creates a peaceful world
for our people,

58
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,160
I’d like to give the throne to him

59
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,320
and live in seclusion forever.

60
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,360
But Qing Tai is overweeningly ambitious

61
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,680
and wants to provoke disputes
between states.

62
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,120
By then, innocent civilians

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,800
will suffer from wars

64
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,040
and get stuck in deep distress.

65
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,519
You’re the Dark Force

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,160
Father meticulously trained
when he was alive.

67
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,320
Father gave me the token
before he died.

68
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,600
Everybody,

69
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,240
will you overthrow
Qing Tai’s despotic rule with me

70
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,360
and bring peace back to our people?

71
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,840
We pledge to serve you with our lives!

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
Dongdong.

73
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,880
Open the door, Dongdong.

74
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,880
Dongdong.

75
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,040
I know you’re in there.

76
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,320
Listen to me.

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,400
Old Lady Liu will have
her birthday party.

78
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
(Family Rules)
I’d like to take you there.

79
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
Maybe,

80
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,560
I can find some suitable
young men for you.

81
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,800
Open the door, will you?

82
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,160
I don’t want to know any young men.

83
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,920
Mother, if you’re so free,

84
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,120
why don’t you think about
how to flatter my father?

85
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,280
What are you talking about?

86
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,360
Your father always flatters me.

87
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,240
When do I need to flatter him?

88
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,360
I just want to take you

89
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,080
to Liu’s Mansion and meet new friends.

90
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,600
I’m not going. I’m not.

91
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,880
Come out, Dongdong.

92
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,000
Open the door!

93
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,240
Be quick.

94
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,080
Open the door, will you?

95
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,240
I won’t.

96
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,480
You won’t.

97
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,920
I’ll open it myself.

98
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,425
Madam.

99
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,720
Madam.

100
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:50,080
My foot hurts.

101
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,800
Are you all right?

102
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,360
Fine. You won’t open the door.

103
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,440
Just stay in there

104
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,600
and don’t come out.

105
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,440
Go get some servants.

106
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,280
Yes.

107
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,400
I will have

108
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,000
all the doors locked.

109
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,360
Let’s see if you’ll come out.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
Come on. Lock all the doors.

111
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,560
I’ve got the doors locked.

112
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,800
Dongdong, did you hear me?

113
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,160
I’ve got the doors locked.

114
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,120
Just lie in there.

115
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,120
When you want to come out, tell me.

116
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,440
I’ll get you out.

117
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,920
Fine. Just stay in there.

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,600
Be careful, Madam.

119
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,680
I won’t get you out.

120
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,320
Naughty girl.

121
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,040
Be careful, Madam.

122
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,680
She’s really got the doors locked?

123
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,675
Mother!

124
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Anyone there?

125
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,480
Mother, are you really going to

126
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,000
lock me in my room forever?

127
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,240
Mother!

128
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,920
Dongdong, the gate is locked.

129
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,040
Why is your cruel mother

130
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,480
locking you up so securely?

131
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,320
Father. Help me.

132
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,960
Father, here I am.

133
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,600
Father.

134
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Here I am.

135
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,125
Father.

136
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,200
Come on, Dongzhi.

137
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,480
Look how you’re disgracing me.

138
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,280
Your mother only locked one door

139
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,320
and you can’t come out?

140
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
I just don’t want to break the door.

141
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,880
Break it, then.

142
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,160
It’s just a door.

143
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,840
I can afford that.

144
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,880
Li Dongzhi!

145
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,240
- Here she comes.
- Li Changqing!

146
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Run. Run quickly.

147
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,600
- Thank you, Father.
- What are you doing?

148
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,400
- Come back!
- Darling.

149
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,920
- You bad girl.
- Darling.

150
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,080
Come back!

151
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,160
Are you trying to piss me off?

152
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,080
I can’t live.

153
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,520
My daughter can’t get married.

154
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,800
I can’t live, either.

155
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,400
What a bad daughter she is!

156
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,680
What kind of guy you are?

157
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,480
Why did you help her?

158
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,280
What did you just say?

159
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,760
You called your daughter bad girl?

160
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,960
What am I, then?

161
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
What else can you be?

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,720
You’re just

163
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,040
a disrespectful bad man!

164
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,280
What else do you think you can be?

165
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,200
He Cuihua, how dare you
abuse your husband!

166
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,880
How daring!

167
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,400
(Farm and Study)

168
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,400
Baoning, are you all right?

169
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,240
Yes.

170
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,360
What’s the rush for?

171
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,520
I was just...

172
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,480
Your mother forced you
to find a husband again?

173
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
You indeed know me.

174
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,400
My mother locked me in my room
and didn’t let me out.

175
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,480
Luckily, my father saved me.

176
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,080
I was just trying to hide somewhere.

177
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,360
I’ll say no more,

178
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
or my mother will catch up.

179
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,075
Wait.

180
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,320
But the town is in chaos.

181
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,600
I know.

182
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,000
Once the Dark Force is activated,

183
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,720
there’ll certainly be a war in Yongqing.

184
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,640
Hope this war

185
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,680
will bring peace to our people.

186
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,880
When we return to Yongqing,

187
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,000
we don’t know when we can come back.

188
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:27,480
All we can wish is that
everything will go smoothly

189
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:29,200
and the two states will be reconciled.

190
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,400
By then,

191
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,880
we can come back here,

192
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,520
without any restraint.

193
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah.

194
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,040
When we leave,

195
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,350
no one knows when we can be back.

196
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
Don’t be upset.

197
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,600
Let’s enjoy ourselves
before it’s too late.

198
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,040
Before it’s too late?

199
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,200
Right.

200
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,720
Before it’s too late.

201
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,925
Siqin,

202
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,240
I suddenly remember
I’ve left something behind.

203
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,640
I have to fetch it myself.

204
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,600
Your Highness, please come back early.

205
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,675
I will.

206
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,000
Your Highness,

207
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,600
bring my regards to Miss Li.

208
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:12,950
(Li’s Mansion)

209
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,440
What?

210
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,080
Are her clothes still there?

211
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,320
I have her room checked.

212
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,200
Clothes of this season
have been taken away.

213
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,840
Money and some valuable things
are gone, too.

214
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,280
She took them away, I guess.

215
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,000
Fine, fine, fine.

216
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,360
Li Changqing.

217
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,250
Mm.

218
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,440
You’re satisfied now, aren’t you?

219
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,040
You’ve been spoiling your daughter.

220
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Look what she has done.

221
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,240
She ran away from home.

222
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,400
Let’s see if she dares to come back.

223
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,960
Even if she does, I won’t accept her.

224
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,520
If she dares to come back again,

225
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,000
I’ll break her legs!

226
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,000
You know what?

227
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,920
It’s all because of you

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,560
who keep making a mess at home.

229
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,320
Fine, fine!

230
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,720
It’s all my fault.

231
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,040
Dongdong shouldn’t have left.

232
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,560
- I should have, all right?
- Qingke,

233
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,080
get the note to me.

234
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,040
- Mm.
- I can’t live!

235
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,800
(We shall meet again someday.)
Dongdong ran away from home.

236
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,680
What do I do?

237
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,560
I can’t live.

238
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,960
How can I live?

239
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,280
What can I do?

240
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,480
Father, Mother.

241
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:21,520
Mm?

242
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,240
Dongdong ran away from home

243
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,440
just in a fit of pique.

244
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,360
If you trust me,

245
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,960
I can find her.

246
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,480
But you have to promise me something.

247
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,800
Leave us.

248
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,400
Yes.

249
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,080
I want a favor from you.

250
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,640
Tell us, Your Grace.

251
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,280
I want you to promise me

252
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,880
to respect Dongdong in her marriage

253
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,800
and not to force her
to marry anyone she doesn’t like.

254
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,640
No way.

255
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,480
You’ve married Qian

256
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,120
and you have nothing to worry about.

257
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,200
But Dongdong has.

258
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,520
She’s my own daughter.

259
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,440
You and she don’t worry
about her marriage.

260
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,400
But I do.

261
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Mother,

262
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,480
I didn’t get on with Dongdong
for a long time.

263
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,720
But I indeed like her

264
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,320
and treat her as my own sister.

265
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Think about it.

266
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,640
Dongdong used to stay
in the military camp.

267
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,680
But since Her Grace came to our family,

268
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,120
she stayed at home for a longer time.

269
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,400
What does that mean?

270
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,320
It means Dongdong likes Her Grace.

271
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,640
You make sense.

272
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,120
Mother, think about it.

273
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Dongdong has a strong personality.

274
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,840
Even if we get her back this time,

275
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,720
she may run away from home again.

276
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,560
What if she always runs away from home

277
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,080
in case of any problem?

278
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,440
Our family will be restless.

279
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:46,975
Mm.

280
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,640
Most importantly,

281
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,880
Dongdong’s time will be wasted.

282
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,960
Instead of wasting time,

283
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,480
why don’t you let her
find a man she likes

284
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,320
and live a happy life as you and Father?

285
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,360
Let’s listen to Her Grace.

286
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,640
Think about us when we were young.

287
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,440
Enough. How shameful!

288
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,240
If you can get Dongdong back

289
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,600
as you said,

290
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,000
I’ll promise you that.

291
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,400
Deal.

292
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,800
Ling’er.

293
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:29,800
Mm?

294
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,720
What did Dongdong say before she left?

295
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,600
I...

296
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,560
I was just passing by
on my way to the latrine.

297
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,360
I didn’t see anything.

298
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,720
I’m not asking what you did last night.

299
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,080
You’re giving yourself away.

300
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,760
Your Grace, spare me.

301
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,720
I really don’t know

302
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,040
where Miss has gone.

303
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,200
What?

304
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,320
Ling’er, stand up.

305
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,560
I don’t mean to punish you.

306
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,760
But you know.

307
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,480
Dongdong is out there alone.

308
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,440
We don’t know if she has trouble

309
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,200
or if she has enough money.

310
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,640
The town is also in chaos.

311
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,400
If you know something, tell me

312
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,800
so that I’ll stop worrying.

313
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,400
But...

314
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,200
Don’t worry.

315
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,760
I didn’t ask you anything today.

316
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,880
Miss Dongzhi said

317
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,720
now that she could no longer
stay at home,

318
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,360
she would just leave.

319
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,720
Oh, she also said

320
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,120
that she had somewhere to go

321
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,400
and she just hadn’t been there
for a while.

322
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,200
Hadn’t been there for a while?

323
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,680
Fine. Qingke, walk her back.

324
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,205
Mm.

325
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,800
Don’t let anyone see you.

326
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,280
Qingke,

327
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,720
get Liu Xiaoman to me.

328
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,075
Mm.

329
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,100
(Qinfang Pavilion)

330
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,125
Sachets.

331
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:45,925
Young Master.

332
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:47,750
Sachets. Come and have a look.

333
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,525
Come and have a look.

334
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,040
I don’t think she’ll come.

335
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,320
Welcome back

336
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,720
See you.

337
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,800
You’re welcome.

338
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,560
All right. See you next time.

339
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,600
- He was waiting for a girl, I guess.
- Umbrellas.

340
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,300
Let’s go, Li.

341
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,900
Beautiful umbrellas.

342
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:20,125
How much?

343
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:21,000
I’ll buy it for you.

344
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:23,040
See you. You’re always welcome.

345
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,840
It’s where I met you for the first time.

346
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:29,320
Steamed stuffed buns.

347
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,840
Qing An, you’re a liar.

348
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,080
I can’t visit Li’s Mansion.

349
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,640
Where else can I meet her?

350
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,760
Sir, come on in.

351
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,520
Don’t be shy. Come on.

352
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,240
Quickly. Quickly.

353
00:15:54,775 --> 00:15:55,700
I’ll drink it.

354
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,925
Good.

355
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:00,600
Cheers.

356
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,800
What a handsome young man!

357
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,200
Excuse me,

358
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,880
have you seen a young man?

359
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,880
He’s like this tall and strong.

360
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,880
He has long hair

361
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,600
and looks clumsy.

362
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,760
But he’s actually handsome and cute.

363
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,640
Handsome and cute man?

364
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,440
We don’t have one.

365
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,000
But we’ve got a lot of beautiful girls.

366
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,560
Forget it. I’ve got something to do.

367
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,440
I’ll come next time.

368
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,480
Young Master,

369
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,520
you sound like

370
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,960
that man matters a lot to you.

371
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,120
How about this?

372
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,600
Leave a note.

373
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,440
If he comes someday,

374
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,040
I’ll give it to him.

375
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,680
But,

376
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
you need to pay for that.

377
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,440
Don’t bother.

378
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,640
He isn’t very important.

379
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:57,650
Sachets.

380
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,560
Young Master, don’t rush to leave.

381
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,440
- Young Master.
- Don’t bother.

382
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,520
He isn’t very important.

383
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,599
He doesn’t mean anything.

384
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,480
Don’t rush to leave.

385
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,079
Why not tell me your name?

386
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,440
If that man comes

387
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,920
and asks me about it, I can reply.

388
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,480
What man?

389
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
He’s a liar and idiot.

390
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,079
Young Master.

391
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,200
Silly girl.

392
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,280
You’re an idiot.

393
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,560
- Li Dongzhi,
- Umbrellas.

394
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,520
how silly you are!

395
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,119
You chose to leave.

396
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,425
- Why did you come again?
- Beautiful umbrellas.

397
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,040
Come on.

398
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,680
Young Master, young...

399
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,750
(Yixuan Flower Shop)

400
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,872
Hot steamed stuffed buns.

401
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,600
I’m free now.

402
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,960
But why do I feel so lonely?

403
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,280
Qing An,

404
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,080
can we meet again?

405
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,000
Young Master, do you want a fan?

406
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,950
- Have a look.
- How about some cucumbers?

407
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,475
- This one looks good, too.
- They’re fresh.

408
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:02,200
They were picked this morning.

409
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,040
Would you like one?

410
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,856
Pendants. Have a look.

411
00:18:04,856 --> 00:18:06,080
- Fabrics.
- I’ll give you a discount.

412
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,960
This one looks good.

413
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,480
He’ll like it.

414
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,920
- This one is too big.
- Umbrellas.

415
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,720
It’s suitable for a man with big hands.

416
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,280
For a girl,

417
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
round fans will be better.

418
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,480
Yes. He has big hands.

419
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:20,950
Umbrellas.

420
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,480
Beautiful umbrellas.

421
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,280
I’ll take this one.

422
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
All right.

423
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,200
Rascal!

424
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,960
How dare you flirt with me!

425
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,600
You rascal!

426
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,080
I’ll beat you, rascal.

427
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,720
- I’ll beat you to death.
- He deserves it.

428
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,840
You ran away quickly.

429
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,200
Or I’ll kill you.

430
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,800
- Give it to me.
- Yeah. Go away.

431
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,080
Can you get it?

432
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,400
Where’s she?

433
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,000
Give it to me.

434
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
- Where has she gone?
- Come here.

435
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,720
Stand properly. Stand there.

436
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,560
All of you.

437
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,640
- I want it. I want it.
- Don’t snatch it.

438
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,880
One by one.

439
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,760
- Who wants it first?
- Umbrellas.

440
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,520
- Me.
- Me.

441
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,080
You?

442
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,325
Give it to me.

443
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,080
Don’t snatch it.

444
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,880
Or I’ll punch you.

445
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,040
Here.

446
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,120
Thank you.

447
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,625
Mm.

448
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,000
Here’s yours.

449
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,925
Thanks.

450
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:10,550
Mm.

451
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,240
May I go home with you?

452
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,280
Do you not have a home?

453
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,480
Almost.

454
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,440
I was forced to get married.

455
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,520
Then I ran away from home.

456
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,800
But after I went around,

457
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,680
I realized that I had nowhere to go

458
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,200
in such a big world.

459
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,600
Why?

460
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,960
Because I can’t find the man I like.

461
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,480
Without him, I don’t have a home.

462
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,720
Maybe he’s just behind you.

463
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,240
My mother said,

464
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,600
if you keep thinking
of the man you like,

465
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,440
you’ll realize that he’s behind you

466
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,240
and protecting you secretly.

467
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,800
Your mother must have deceived you.

468
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,400
She never deceives me.

469
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,440
You don’t see him
because you’re stupid.

470
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,680
Come on.

471
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,080
Wait for me.

472
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,600
Forget it.

473
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,960
I’ll go see my aunt.

474
00:20:20,775 --> 00:20:21,480
Young Master, do you want a ride?

475
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,720
Do you go to Sanyuan Town?

476
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,200
Yes.

477
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,440
But,

478
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,680
it’s a long trip.

479
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,120
There’s no inn along the way.

480
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,640
We’ll travel overnight, I guess.

481
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,640
I can afford it.

482
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,560
All right. Come on. Go.

483
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,680
Come on.

484
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,640
Be careful.

485
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,560
Here we go.

486
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
You want a ride?

487
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,760
Go, follow that carriage.

488
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,960
All right. This way.

489
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,150
Baoning,

490
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,160
Liu Xiaoman said
you had something to tell me?

491
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,920
Baoning?

492
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,120
Baoning?

493
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,160
Baoning!

494
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,000
Young man, where are you going?

495
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,960
I was just joking. Don’t be serious.

496
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,040
Don’t joke about that.

497
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,440
I want you to always be with me.

498
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,640
I’ll be.

499
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,375
Tell me.

500
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,640
What do you want me for?

501
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,760
Young man,

502
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,920
your sister is gone.

503
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,200
But you aren’t anxious at all?

504
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,800
She has only a few places to go.

505
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,160
Do you really think she can travel
around the world?

506
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,200
I’m right.

507
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,800
You know where she has gone.

508
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,600
I can never hide anything from you.

509
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,480
Dongdong always knows

510
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,840
how far to go.

511
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
She must have left a note for something.

512
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,080
Before she left, she said

513
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,480
she hadn’t been there for a while.

514
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,440
It means she was once there.

515
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,280
I’m sure you know it, don’t you?

516
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,025
Mm.

517
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,960
Looks like

518
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,400
she’s determined not to come back.

519
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,280
So, she must have gone to Madam Li.

520
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,880
Who’s she?

521
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,680
A distant aunt of ours.

522
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,280
She takes care
of our pharmacy house.

523
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,440
When Dongzhi and I were little,

524
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,560
we visited her several times.

525
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,800
After we grew up, we didn’t go there.

526
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,920
Don’t worry.

527
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,280
Dongzhi is clever.

528
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,080
She won’t suffer.

529
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,240
I know where she is.

530
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,640
But I won’t expose her.

531
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,040
I won’t be worried in normal times.

532
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,720
But you know what’s going on lately.

533
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,440
The town is in chaos

534
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,480
with so many refugees.

535
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,520
I’m indeed worried about her.

536
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,360
Besides, I promised Father and Mother

537
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,520
to get Dongdong back.

538
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,840
You must help me.

539
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,360
All right. I’ll help my dear wife.

540
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,560
What?

541
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,960
She’s your sister.

542
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,080
I’m helping you!

543
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,400
All right. Whatever you say.

544
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,240
We’ll set out tomorrow, all right?

545
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:19,600
(Tea)

546
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
Here it is.

547
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,040
Young Master,

548
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,000
it’s the tea you ordered.

549
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,800
Enjoy it before you move on.

550
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,440
Thank you.

551
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,040
Let’s take a rest.

552
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:31,880
Come on.

553
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,680
You’re quite gulping.

554
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,880
You must have been very thirsty.

555
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,560
But when you drink it so quickly,

556
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,880
aren’t you wasting it?

557
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:39,900
We need some rest.

558
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,575
What?

559
00:23:40,575 --> 00:23:42,183
We may not find an inn before dark.

560
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,320
Good tea.

561
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,920
I’ll have another bowl, then.

562
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,880
No problem.

563
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,440
We don’t charge

564
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,040
for refill.

565
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,960
The hot water is over there.

566
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,200
Please go get some.

567
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:56,025
Mm.

568
00:23:56,225 --> 00:23:57,240
- Enjoy yourself.
- No problem.

569
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,160
What would you like?

570
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,000
A pot of tea.

571
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,120
All right.

572
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,600
Fine.

573
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,840
Let me wipe it.

574
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,400
Wait a second.
The tea will be ready soon.

575
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
So much money?

576
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,560
He must be a rich young man.

577
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,680
I can have a few gambles with it.

578
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,920
Please, please spare my life.

579
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,760
Spare my life.

580
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,440
Spare my life, please.

581
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,920
I can spare your life.

582
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,960
Promise me three things.

583
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,240
Not to mention three things,

584
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,040
I’ll even do thirty for you.

585
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,880
First, give back the purse to its owner

586
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,275
without taking away anything.

587
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:40,000
Mm.

588
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,925
Second, don’t tell him you saw me.

589
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,640
Mm.

590
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,450
Tell me you picked it from the floor.

591
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,125
Mm.

592
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,000
Third, give up gambling.

593
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,960
Or I’ll cut your limbs now.

594
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,840
Hero,

595
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,960
I’ll give up. I will.

596
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,625
Go.

597
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:53,225
Mm.

598
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,750
Mm.

599
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,560
Young Master,

600
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,200
you left your purse on your table.

601
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,280
What happened to your face?

602
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,320
I... I fell just now.

603
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,675
Let’s take a rest.

604
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,000
Something’s wrong.

605
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,400
Can it be him?

606
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,320
I’m indeed the stupidest.

607
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,400
You’re always there.

608
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,800
Always behind me, right?

609
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,480
Sorry, I got the wrong person.

610
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,840
- Sorry.
- Are you all right?

611
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,560
The fan...

612
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,480
What happened?

613
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
Did you leave something?

614
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,880
Shall I turn the horse

615
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,800
and return?

616
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,920
Forget it.

617
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,400
I don’t need to force it
when we’re not destined to meet.

618
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,560
Stop.

619
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,240
Do you have anything to eat?

620
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,000
No. All food was eaten last night.

621
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,800
Xiaoman,

622
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,320
here’re some money and food.

623
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:25,960
Distribute it to them.

624
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Yes, Your Grace.

625
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,800
Come on. Come on.

626
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,760
Quickly. Here’s food.

627
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,560
It’s for everyone.

628
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Don’t rush.

629
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,320
Thank you.

630
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,080
It’s yours.

631
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,560
Thank you. Thank you.

632
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,280
Be careful.

633
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,800
Thank you.

634
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,200
- It’s yours.
- Thank you.

635
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:40,600
Take it.

636
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,040
Thank you.

637
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,680
It’s yours.

638
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,160
Thank you.

639
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,725
Take it.

640
00:27:42,725 --> 00:27:43,310
Thank you.

641
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,440
- Thank you, kind man.
- It’s yours.

642
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,200
Natural and man-made disasters
are terrible.

643
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,360
There aren’t man-made disasters,
but continuous natural ones.

644
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,720
Hope our charity house
will be built soon

645
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,040
where they can stay for the moment.

646
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,640
It’s for everyone.

647
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,040
Be patient.

648
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,475
- We’ll just do what we can.
- Take it. You’re welcome.

649
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,680
For the sake that we try so hard,

650
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,440
fate will be nice to us.

651
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,000
Mm.

652
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,040
Thank you.

653
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,400
They’re such good men.

654
00:28:05,575 --> 00:28:06,175
Thank you.

655
00:28:06,175 --> 00:28:07,100
At last, we have some food.

656
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,450
Xiaoman,

657
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,200
do we still have some water?

658
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,920
Young Master, look.

659
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,643
I’m starving.

660
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,840
Exactly.

661
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,080
The water is gone.

662
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,920
The food is distributed, too.

663
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,840
Looks like we’ll also be hungry today.

664
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,040
For the sake that we try so hard,

665
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,200
fate will be nice to us.

666
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,520
Steward Dong.

667
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,400
It’s the carriage of the Dong Family.

668
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,200
Steward Dong.

669
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,000
Your Grace.

670
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:37,325
Mm.

671
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,240
I met you in Dong’s Mansion.

672
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,440
But Your Grace, why are you here?

673
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,960
It’s a long story.

674
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,080
Well,

675
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,440
may I borrow some food and water?

676
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,920
Sure.

677
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,640
I’ll go get some for you.

678
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,600
All right.

679
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,280
Robbery!

680
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,080
Robbery!

681
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,960
Robbery!

682
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,000
Don’t move.

683
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,720
Your...

684
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,640
Don’t move. Nobody moves!

685
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,680
Help me, Young Master!

686
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,320
Don’t move!

687
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,960
Leave your goods and food.

688
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,320
And you’ll live.

689
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,440
Otherwise...

690
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,240
What are you laughing at?

691
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,520
Be serious! We’re doing a robbery!

692
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:18,150
I...

693
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,520
I know you.

694
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,840
You’re not a bandit.

695
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,120
I don’t think

696
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,640
you’re bandits.

697
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,960
You just have no way out.

698
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,520
But once you kill anyone,

699
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,040
there’s no turning back.

700
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,400
We don’t want to kill anyone.

701
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,160
All we want is money.

702
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,080
Yes. We only want money.

703
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,160
- We want money.
- We don’t want to hurt anyone.

704
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,760
Baoning,

705
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,800
don’t bother to negotiate

706
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,960
with such ungrateful men.

707
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,520
Step back and I’ll take care of them.

708
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,320
Come on. The world is in chaos.

709
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,280
I believe you’re not bad men.

710
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,120
Maybe you’re just desperate.

711
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,960
All you want is something to eat

712
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,880
and somewhere to live.

713
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,120
How about this?

714
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,200
Let me recommend a place to you.

715
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,000
If you want to stay there,

716
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,160
try with your efforts.

717
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,800
What do you think?

718
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:05,725
A place?

719
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:06,875
Where is it?

720
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,480
Is that true?

721
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,560
We’re building a charity house
in Bingzhou.

722
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,120
If you don’t mind,

723
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,880
go there with my seal.

724
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,720
If you have somewhere better to go,

725
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,800
you can leave.

726
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,040
You... You are
Commandery Princess Jia’nan?

727
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
Let’s kneel

728
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,640
and thank Her Grace.

729
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,320
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thank you, Your Grace.

730
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,680
- Get up. Get up.
- Thank you, Your Grace.

731
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,600
Thank you, Your Grace.

732
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,480
Shall I wait for you?

733
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,920
No. I’ll stay for days.

734
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,480
All right, then.

735
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,320
Dongdong!

736
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,120
- Aunt.
- It’s been long since you last came.

737
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,800
Why didn’t you visit me?

738
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,240
Here I am.

739
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,120
I’ll stay and accompany you.

740
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,200
Really?

741
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,960
Mm.

742
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,400
Come on.

743
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,560
Let’s get in.

744
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,120
You’re this tall now. Come on.

745
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,280
Dongzhi, I thought
we wouldn’t meet again.

746
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,680
But I saw you again as I expected.

747
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,640
This is where I have to leave you.

748
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,560
I don’t know when we can meet again.

749
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,800
Hope you’ll be all well.

750
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,840
Who’s that?

751
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,875
My brother.

752
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,800
Young Master, what brings you here?

753
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,520
Aunt.

754
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,960
Long time no see.

755
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,400
You don’t visit us in town.

756
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,000
We have to disturb you.

757
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,600
I hear you got married.

758
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,760
So this is...?

759
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,320
This is my wife Jiang Baoning.

760
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,120
Greetings, Aunt.

761
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,480
Young Master, Madam,
nice to meet you.

762
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,760
Aunt,

763
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,200
don’t bother.

764
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,640
We just came to visit you.

765
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,680
By the way,

766
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,240
we came to see the lost cat.

767
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,840
Who’s the cat?

768
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,880
Whoever comes out is the cat.

769
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,200
Baoning.

770
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,560
Dongdong,

771
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,000
after you left,

772
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,480
I had no one to talk to

773
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,280
at home.

774
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,200
My dear sister-in-law,

775
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,720
in our family,

776
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,400
only you truly miss me.

777
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,640
What are you talking about?

778
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,360
Father and Mother miss you, too.

779
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,600
They just don’t say it.

780
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,560
I’m not going back, anyway.

781
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,560
It took me trouble to run out.

782
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,720
It’s just fine.

783
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,560
We’re going to stay for days,

784
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
accompany Aunt,

785
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,240
and see how you’ll enjoy your life here.

786
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,875
Ah?

787
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,440
Let’s not stand here.

788
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,280
Get in.

789
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,400
Let’s get in.

790
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,200
Come on.

791
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,120
Don’t talk nonsense.

792
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,840
Abalone shell.

793
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,880
Fleeceflower root.

794
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,625
Qian,

795
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,960
when are you going back home?

796
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,160
Kicking me out when I just came?

797
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,680
It’s such a good place.

798
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,320
Aunt is showing Baoning around
the farmlands of herbs.

799
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,880
What’s the fun of that?

800
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,960
The farmlands are uncultivated.

801
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,720
In the past

802
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,000
when there were many kinds of herbs,

803
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,520
Aunt liked to make up prescriptions.

804
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,520
She even worked out

805
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,120
many prescriptions for difficult cases.

806
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,650
What a pity!

807
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,720
Why did I forget
Aunt’s folk prescription?

808
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,000
Be seated, please.

809
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,440
Drink it.

810
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,840
What’s this?

811
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,160
According to Young Master,

812
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,760
you’re born to be weak

813
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,520
and you have residual poison
in your body.

814
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,239
So, you have been held up.

815
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,800
My brother looks serious.

816
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,840
I didn’t expect him to be so impatient.

817
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,679
Don’t talk nonsense, Miss.

818
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,800
This is very serious.

819
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,225
Oh.

820
00:34:24,225 --> 00:34:25,080
I’ll drink it.

821
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
Be careful, Baoning.

822
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,120
Yeah, Madam.

823
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,480
Don’t be impatient.

824
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,840
I’ve arranged the dosages
according to the prescription.

825
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,719
One bowl a day. It’ll work in a month.

826
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,719
Aunt,

827
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,480
Dongdong told me that

828
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,920
you used to grow many herbs.

829
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,600
Do you want to grow some again?

830
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,120
It’s big anxiety to me

831
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,960
over the past years.

832
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:52,480
I’m not strong enough
to grow anything now.

833
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,320
Now, the town is in chaos

834
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,520
where refugees are homeless.

835
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,320
If they do farm work for you

836
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,560
in exchange for food and accommodation,

837
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
will you agree?

838
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:05,960
But...

839
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,560
After the disaster is over,

840
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,080
will they stay here?

841
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,520
If we have to pay them,

842
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,360
my mother won’t agree.

843
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,360
So, we need a long-term deal.

844
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,480
Whoever wants to stay

845
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,920
will be the owner of the pharmacy house.

846
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,560
You mean...?

847
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,800
She means

848
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,680
when the herbs spout,

849
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,360
you can try selling them to drug makers.

850
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,880
It’ll be a lot of money

851
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,920
- and will prosper this place again.
- Mm.

852
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,080
Yeah.

853
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,720
When everybody makes concerted efforts,

854
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,960
they’ll make money

855
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,920
and become the owner.

856
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,440
My husband and Dongdong know me best.

857
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,800
Let’s waste no time. I’ll go hire men.

858
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,960
Qian, Baoning,

859
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,360
leave it to me without concern.

860
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,960
Look at Dongzhi.

861
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,200
No one can restrain her.

862
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,160
Surprisingly, you ran away from home,

863
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,760
but helped with such a good thing.

864
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,840
I’m so happy.

865
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,800
Qian, luckily, you came. I’m serious.

866
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,480
You hired those people for farm work.

867
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,720
When we’re back home,

868
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,080
I’ll praise you
in front of Father and Mother.

869
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,640
I’m not going back,
no matter what you say.

870
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,640
I’ll stay and help Aunt.

871
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,600
What are you talking about?

872
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,760
Li Qian,

873
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,440
take it back to the room.

874
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,075
All right.

875
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,160
Dongdong,

876
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,800
everything here

877
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,880
is almost arranged.

878
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,200
What’s your plan, then?

879
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,640
Next?

880
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,040
Instead of staying here,

881
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,080
you’re more needed somewhere else.

882
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,080
You mean

883
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
you’ve convinced Dongdong?

884
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:29,825
Mm.

885
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:31,160
Awesome. But how?

886
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,520
I told you.

887
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
I promised Father and Mother

888
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,920
to get Dongzhi back home.

889
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,280
I promised them

890
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,080
because they also promised me something.

891
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,840
Looks like

892
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,560
you’re a good doctor.

893
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,040
Why am I a doctor?

894
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:51,975
Mm.

895
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,880
Other doctors

896
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,120
heal wounds.

897
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,120
But my Doctor Jiang

898
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,200
heals hearts.

899
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,920
She heals it completely.

900
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,200
Don’t flatter me.

901
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,600
I have an ulterior motive.

902
00:38:05,925 --> 00:38:06,475
Ah?

903
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,960
For me?

904
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,920
For...

905
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,440
Saving money.

906
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,680
Actually, Miss Dong and I

907
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,760
have established a charity house
in the name of disaster relief.

908
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,520
Then,

909
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,200
we need a manager.

910
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,840
I think Dongdong is a good choice.

911
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,560
I can achieve many things at one stroke.

912
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,372
Mm.

913
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,280
Baoning,

914
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,320
I’ve made a big bowl of tonics

915
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,480
according to Aunt’s prescription.

916
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,400
Drink it quickly.

917
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,160
I didn’t see anything.

918
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,760
It’s all your fault.

919
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,200
Even Dongzhi is trying hard to help us,

920
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,280
I’ll take care of the rest.

921
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,200
No way.

922
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,040
Don’t you remember
what Grandmother said?

923
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,560
When you’re here,

924
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,680
time flies faster.

925
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,880
Young Master, Madam, Miss,

926
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,520
visit me often when you have time.

927
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:21,975
Mm.

928
00:39:21,975 --> 00:39:23,400
Do come and visit me.

929
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,680
Aunt, take good care of yourself.

930
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,360
We’ll come next year.

931
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,480
Deal?

932
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,025
Mm.

933
00:39:30,025 --> 00:39:31,600
Aunt, take care.

934
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,000
All right. Get in the carriage.

935
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,300
Let’s go.

936
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,640
Get in there.

937
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,320
We’re leaving, Aunt.

938
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:40,920
All right.

939
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,480
Money, money.

940
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,640
They keep asking for money.

941
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,640
When the disaster broke out,

942
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,920
the national treasury
was opened, wasn’t it?

943
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,840
When Zuo Yiming asked for money,

944
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,240
I gave him some

945
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,600
from the Imperial Household Department.

946
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,600
What? Short of money again?

947
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Don’t be angry, Your Majesty.

948
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,950
Your Majesty,

949
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,480
it’s the budget for the Empress’s birthday
from the Ministry of Rites.

950
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,080
It’s prepared as what the Empress wants.

951
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,400
I know

952
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,920
you’ve been busy with disaster relief.

953
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,480
I held it up for days.

954
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,400
But her birthday is coming.

955
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,160
I can no longer delay it.

956
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,920
Nuisances!

957
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,040
The disaster relief isn’t over yet.

958
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,640
But she’ll hold a birthday banquet.

959
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,960
Isn’t it ridiculous?

960
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,680
Your Majesty, why not tell Her Highness

961
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,640
to simplify her birthday banquet

962
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,600
so that we can relieve the pressure
of money shortage?

963
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,560
No way. An emperor
can’t break his promise.

964
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,360
I promised her to hold the banquet
in the way she wanted.

965
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,840
I can’t break it.

966
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,280
However,

967
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,560
it depends on her

968
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,680
if she can hold it successfully.

969
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,120
You,

970
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,720
go tell the Ministry of Rites
and the Imperial Household Department

971
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,240
to make her reduce expenses

972
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,880
with rightful reasons.

973
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,400
I understand.

974
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,880
The birthday banquet is coming soon.

975
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,400
Why hasn’t anything started yet?

976
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,920
Your Highness,

977
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,520
everything you want is precious.

978
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,200
For such a big purchase,

979
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,280
according to the rules
of the Ministry of Rites,

980
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,680
we need a price comparison
on the market.

981
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,400
Many sellers are involved.

982
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,080
Still doing the price comparison.

983
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,440
Why don’t you just find

984
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,120
some official trading houses
you used to deal with?

985
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,000
Famous merchants

986
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,800
have been recorded.

987
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,640
You’re right, Your Highness.

988
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,880
But the price comparison is a rule.

989
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,640
We don’t dare to disobey it.

990
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,960
Funny.

991
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,360
If there are always new sellers,

992
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,040
I’ll have to keep waiting?

993
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,280
Wait.

994
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,280
Why wasn’t there such a rule before?

995
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,960
Your Highness,

996
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,000
there’s always a price comparison

997
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,600
for a big purchase of precious things.

998
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,720
But not many sellers attended it.

999
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,360
Maybe you didn’t notice it.

1000
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,560
Strangely enough,

1001
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,040
I don’t know why,

1002
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,040
but this year,
many private trading houses took part.

1003
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,880
So, the result hasn’t been out yet.

1004
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,200
Yeah.

1005
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,720
Just tell me.

1006
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,640
When will the price comparison be over?

1007
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,600
And when can I get the result?

1008
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,440
It’s hard to say.

1009
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,880
Please be patient, Your Highness.

1010
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,240
What about you?

1011
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,000
Decorations for the banquet

1012
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,680
should be picked in the Palace.

1013
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,920
Why isn’t anyone preparing them?

1014
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,680
You have no idea, Your Highness.

1015
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,560
The Imperial Household Department
is now sealed

1016
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,040
for the annual inventory.

1017
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,760
All utensils should be checked

1018
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,760
and registered.

1019
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,640
Our staffs are working overtime

1020
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,200
so that we can complete it
as soon as possible

1021
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,840
and then serve you.

1022
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,840
I don’t want to listen.

1023
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,440
I just wonder

1024
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,240
when you can start the decoration
for the banquet.

1025
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,120
I’m sorry, Your Highness.

1026
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,560
All right.

1027
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,680
I can’t order you about, right?

1028
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,080
His Majesty promised me

1029
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,200
to hold the birthday banquet.

1030
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,960
But you both don’t cooperate.

1031
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,240
Fine. I’ll go tell His Majesty.

1032
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,440
Wait to be punished.

1033
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,320
But...

1034
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,480
- Baihe, go.
- Yes.

1035
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,680
Don’t be angry, Your Highness.

1036
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,960
Don’t be angry, Your Highness.

1037
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,700
(Ciyuan Hall)

1038
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,600
After His Majesty gave us the order,

1039
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,480
see?

1040
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,080
We indeed offended Her Highness.

1041
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,280
Exactly.

1042
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,720
We pick the lesser of the two evils.

1043
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,800
We would rather offend Her Highness

1044
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,440
than disobey His Majesty.

1045
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,760
Stuck between them,

1046
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,760
we suffer, one way and another.

1047
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,520
It’s wise of you.

1048
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,480
The inventory
of the Imperial Household Department

1049
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,080
concerns the property in the Palace.

1050
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,400
Even the Empress

1051
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,280
can’t stop it forcibly.

1052
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,200
You flatter me.

1053
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,480
You had a good idea

1054
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,640
by asking some familiar trading houses

1055
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,560
to delay the price comparison.

1056
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,000
After you.

1057
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:19,760
After you.

1058
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,040
Your Majesty.

1059
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

1060
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,360
What brings you here?

1061
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,680
Your Majesty,

1062
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,160
two stubborn officials
of the Ministry of Rites

1063
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,960
and Imperial Household Department

1064
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,120
found excuses of the price comparison

1065
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,240
and the inventory.

1066
00:44:39,575 --> 00:44:41,440
They just can’t spend any money.

1067
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,760
Ridiculous!

1068
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,280
I’ve never heard of such excuses.

1069
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,320
You’re the Empress.

1070
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,520
Go argue with them.

1071
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,760
I...

1072
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,680
I did.

1073
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,160
But they said

1074
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,200
Your Majesty indeed promised me
to hold the banquet.

1075
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,560
They just didn’t cooperate.

1076
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,480
If I weren’t too busy
reviewing the reports,

1077
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,120
I would argue with them personally.

1078
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:05,425
Well,

1079
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,880
you’re the Empress of the harem.

1080
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,120
They should all listen to you.

1081
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,920
Go argue with them on my behalf.

1082
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,160
Tell them I sent you.

1083
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,840
Your Majesty, why don’t you go?

1084
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,960
I’m too busy to go.

1085
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,000
I’ll leave you alone, Your Majesty.

1086
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:30,825
Mm.

1087
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,280
Father punished Dongdong
to do the embroidery.

1088
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,000
It’s her tender spot.

1089
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,520
He asked you to supervise her,
but you let her sleep.

1090
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,120
How will you explain to Father?

1091
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,840
Just show him the embroidery
the maids do.

1092
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,320
Dongdong is poor at that.

1093
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,400
You should be more aware.

1094
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,400
Fine. You won again.

1095
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,320
Did you cheat to let me win?

1096
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,120
I didn’t.

1097
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,075
How about this?

1098
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,080
Let’s bet.

1099
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,880
Whoever loses

1100
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,120
shall realize a wish of the winner.

1101
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:21,880
What do you think?

1102
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,070
Seriously?

1103
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:23,625
Mm.

1104
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,120
A real man never goes back on his words.

1105
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,000
Come.

1106
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,520
Sorry.

1107
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,160
It doesn’t matter.

1108
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,200
Be careful not to

1109
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,040
drop your chess piece again.

1110
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,000
Why has Wei Shu come?

1111
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,200
Wei Shu?

1112
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,760
Stop cheating.

1113
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,760
He’s indeed come.

1114
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,400
Young Master.

1115
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,560
Your Grace.

1116
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,960
Young Master, a report
from the Battalion.

1117
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,040
Whose turn?

1118
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:00,920
Mine. Mine.

1119
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,550
I won.

1120
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,400
Fine. You indeed won.

1121
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,840
Why don’t you ask me
what I want?

1122
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,240
I’ll give you whatever you want.

1123
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:14,760
Your Grace.

1124
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,640
Your Grace.

1125
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,960
Your Grace, news came from the Palace

1126
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,360
that the Grand Empress Dowager
was ill in bed

1127
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,520
and no one knew how she would end up.

1128
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,440
Get packed and go.

1129
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,200
The Grand Empress Dowager is ill?

1130
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,240
My grandmother is ill
and I have to go back.

1131
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,160
Father, Mother, I’m sorry.

1132
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,160
Qian, take the best servants

1133
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,160
and the fastest horses

1134
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,040
of our family.

1135
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,520
Leave immediately.

1136
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,320
I just received the report
of the Battalion.

1137
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,360
I’m really too busy to leave now.

1138
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,160
But I’ll ask Wei Shu to go with you.

1139
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,360
When my work is done, I’ll catch up.

1140
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,640
Business is important.
Don’t bother to go.

1141
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,520
I’ll be back soon.

1142
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,640
Yeah, Qian.

1143
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,880
With our servants escorting her,

1144
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,160
nothing will go wrong.

1145
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,400
Besides, Her Grace is familiar
with the capital city.

1146
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,560
- She’ll be all right.
- Mm.

1147
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,640
Focus on your business.

1148
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,720
When you go back alone,

1149
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,200
I can’t help worrying.

1150
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,920
I’ll set out one day later at most.

1151
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,040
Take good care of her.

1152
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,280
Don’t get her hurt even a little bit.

1153
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,320
Yes, Young Master.

1154
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:13,925
Baoning.

1155
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,560
Baoning,

1156
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,000
let me go with you.

1157
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,320
Don’t make trouble.

1158
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,000
She’s going back to the capital
for important things.

1159
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,440
Listen to Mother.

1160
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,720
All right, then.

1161
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,280
Be careful on your way, then.

1162
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,320
- Mm.
- Off you go.

1163
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,640
All right. I’m leaving.

1164
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,550
Mm.

1165
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,720
Hengjin Ridge and Mount Dayan.

1166
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,240
These two places

1167
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,480
have very dangerous terrain,

1168
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,440
high in the west and low in the east.

1169
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,400
Our enemy is in a dominant position.

1170
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,520
But after such a long time,

1171
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,040
they have taken no action.

1172
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,520
Jin Xiao, what do you think

1173
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,720
of these two places?

1174
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,600
Come on.

1175
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:14,925
- Hey,
- I...

1176
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,760
I was just back from the mission

1177
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,480
my father assigned me in Yunlin.

1178
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,000
Now you’re discussing with me

1179
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,240
about the joint defense
between Yunlin and Bingzhou.

1180
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,320
Come on.

1181
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,240
Yunlin isn’t too far away.

1182
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,560
But shouldn’t you at least
give me a dinner?

1183
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,360
What’s wrong?

1184
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,920
Anything urgent?

1185
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,800
Baoning is back to the Palace
for something important.

1186
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,440
I’ll catch her up after my work is done.

1187
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,880
You can take some reset later.

1188
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,880
Fine. You have a wife.

1189
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,160
I’m all right with it.

1190
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,880
But shouldn’t you consider

1191
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,200
for other soldiers?

1192
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,200
Right? Right?

1193
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,480
Does anyone have a problem?

1194
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,040
Fine. Let’s continue.

1195
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,160
And this area. Look.

1196
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,760
Your Majesty, my birthday is coming.

1197
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,560
But wherever I go,

1198
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,080
I’m turned down.

1199
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,840
In this way,

1200
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,840
can I still hold the birthday banquet?

1201
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,360
Your Majesty,

1202
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,480
will you really not interfere?

1203
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:17,920
Your Majesty.

1204
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,040
I’ve got some important business to do.

1205
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,960
I’ll give you full authority
to arrange the banquet.

1206
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,600
Don’t let me down.

1207
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:31,900
I...

1208
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,320
Your Highness,
why is His majesty leaving?

1209
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,160
What important business?

1210
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,560
They were even whispering.

1211
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:56,640
Baihe.

1212
00:51:56,925 --> 00:51:57,400
Mm?

1213
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,240
Go and check

1214
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,880
what His Majesty is going for.

1215
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,400
Yes.

1216
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:08,500
(Shoukang Palace)

1217
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,360
Grandmother, tell me

1218
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,840
how you’re feeling now.

1219
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,680
I’m all right.

1220
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,840
At such an old age,

1221
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,320
I can’t avoid minor illnesses.

1222
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,240
Tell me, Stewardess Meng.

1223
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,560
During the seasonal change,

1224
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,800
Her Highness may have caught a cold

1225
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,360
and got a sudden disease.

1226
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,800
The chief physician checked on her.

1227
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,080
She’s getting better
after taking medicine for days.

1228
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,520
According to Chief Physician Tian,

1229
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,080
when Her Highness is taken good care of,

1230
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,560
she’ll recover tomorrow.

1231
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,520
Don’t worry too much, Your Grace.

1232
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,600
If you still worry,

1233
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,680
you can summon Chief Physician Tian

1234
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,480
and ask him personally.

1235
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,280
Grandmother,

1236
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,920
I’m just worried about you.

1237
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,325
His Majesty has arrived.

1238
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:57,800
Grandmother.

1239
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,325
You may rise.

1240
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:02,600
Baoning?

1241
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,440
What did you come for?

1242
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,360
Why didn’t you tell me?

1243
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,080
I heard Grandmother was still

1244
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,280
and came on the spur of the moment.

1245
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,440
So, I didn’t have time to tell you.

1246
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,120
Grandmother, how are you feeling?

1247
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,200
I’ve been ill for days,

1248
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,360
but you didn’t come at all.

1249
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,240
Now, you sound quite worried.

1250
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,200
I was so busy with political affairs

1251
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,280
that I have neglected your health.

1252
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,560
I’m sorry for that.

1253
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,000
Somebody. Ask the Imperial Kitchen

1254
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,280
to make some dishes
Grandmother and Baoning prefer.

1255
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:40,240
Yes.

1256
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,160
I’ll have dinner with you.

1257
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,600
Don’t bother.

1258
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,720
I don’t have an appetite.

1259
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,880
Fangling,

1260
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,200
I told you

1261
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,320
not to tell Baoning that I was ill.

1262
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,920
Why did you get her
to take such a long trip?

1263
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,760
Your Highness, we obeyed your order

1264
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,160
and no one in Shoukang Palace
told Her Grace about it.

1265
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,960
That’s weird, then.

1266
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,760
