=Episode 1=

27
00:01:57,225 --> 00:01:59,725
When I was a child, the late emperor
allowed me to climb on his desk

28
00:01:59,725 --> 00:02:00,975
and use the jade seal
to stamp on anything.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,581
He never got mad at me.

30
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:06,850
As a princess,

31
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,700
my identity is a blessing.

32
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,025
But I know

33
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,675
such a background

34
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:16,825
will also be the source
of all disasters.

35
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:19,825
Once I step into the Palace,

36
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:22,050
no matter how noble my status is,

37
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,275
I’ll still live

38
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:26,961
an endless and repeated life.

39
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,776
Now the Grand Empress Dowager rules
in place of the Emperor behind a screen.

40
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:31,825
The Emperor has no real power.

41
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,964
He wants to make me his empress.

42
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,800
What he wants

43
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,263
is nothing but
The Archduke’s Mansion behind me

44
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:39,925
that holds the military power.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,375
He wants to use me
more than he likes me.

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
I don’t want to be

47
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,837
a puppet in the harem.

48
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,000
No matter how high the palace wall is,

49
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:54,175
it can’t keep me, Jiang Baoning, inside.

50
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:01,250
(Mu’an)

51
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,399
Hold it well, Qingke.

52
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:07,119
Hurry.

53
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,320
Got it, Your Grace.

54
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,399
Your Grace, watch your hands.

55
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,240
Don’t worry. I’m good at

56
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,399
doing this kind of stuff.

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,679
Your Grace.

58
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,919
His Majesty really cares about you.

59
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,279
He knows you like it

60
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,425
and he just sent over
the mechanism blueprints.

61
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:27,000
All right, enough with the gibberish.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,550
Just hold it.

63
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,075
Oh.

64
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,616
(Commandery Princess Jia’nan,
Jiang Baoning)

65
00:03:49,575 --> 00:03:52,150
(Handmaid, Qingke)

66
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,039
Your Grace,
what are you making this time?

67
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,759
Take a guess.

68
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,199
Anyway, I’ll bring it to

69
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,119
the Machinist Contest
outside the palace this year.

70
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,039
Outside the palace?

71
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,520
Your Grace.

72
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,000
I’m afraid we can’t even go through
the Gate of Divine Might.

73
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,559
Since we were caught
sneaking out of the palace last year,

74
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,440
the palace is more heavily guarded now.

75
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,519
Your Grace.

76
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,559
What are you doing?

77
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,640
Last year, I accidentally broke

78
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,040
the door with mechanism for the contest,

79
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,959
and they kicked me out
before the game began.

80
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,440
Otherwise, I would have been the winner.

81
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,440
Your Grace.

82
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,000
You are noble.

83
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,720
Let’s not compete

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,399
with those common people.

85
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,000
But we came back
safe and sound last year.

86
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,440
His Majesty strengthened the guard

87
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,480
because you sneaked out
of the palace last year.

88
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,440
Just because His Majesty did that,

89
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,679
- I don’t want to marry him.
- Your Grace.

90
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,925
Let it go!

91
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:02,559
Let it go!

92
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,119
Your Grace, what is it?

93
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,920
It’s my secret weapon.

94
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,200
I’ll be the winner
of this year’s contest.

95
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,250
Cousin Lyu’s pass does work.

96
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:35,799
Wait. Wait.

97
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,959
(Tongfu Inn)

98
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,679
One good room.

99
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,200
Please come in.

100
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,239
I finally sneaked out of the palace.

101
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:45,279
If I marry His Majesty one day,

102
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,000
it will be harder for me
to enter the contest.

103
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:48,839
Forget it. Don’t think about it.

104
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,959
I need to get a pass
for the contest tomorrow.

105
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,350
Take a look.

106
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,249
Flowers.

107
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,040
Flowers.

108
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:57,550
Baked roll.

109
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,559
Cheap flowers.

110
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,775
The Book of Supreme Weapons
was famous for a while.

111
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:01,880
Flowers.

112
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,480
It disappeared many years ago.
Now it shows up again

113
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,239
and becomes a reward

114
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,279
for the Machinist Contest’s winner.

115
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,839
Young Master.

116
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,416
Does the drawing
really have a clue about Madam?

117
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,559
(Wei Shu, Li Qian)

118
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:15,359
(Wei Shu, Li Qian)
Who knows?

119
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,839
We won’t know
how it relates to my mother

120
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,200
until we get it.

121
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:23,075
(Artifice)

122
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,239
Isn’t that a pass
for the Machinist Contest?

123
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:27,559
Inside, please!

124
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,160
It’s worth a lot.

125
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:34,079
Stop!

126
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,279
Get up first.

127
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:38,959
Are you all right?

128
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,519
What is he doing?

129
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,119
There is only one place

130
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,279
to sell the pass.

131
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,959
Follow me.

132
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:49,760
Okay.

133
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,279
The list of contestants for tomorrow
has been decided.

134
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,079
Gather here.

135
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,450
(Mechanism Pavilion)
You can make a bet now.

136
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,320
Same winner for two years in a row.

137
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,720
Will there be a new winner?

138
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,600
Don’t miss it.

139
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:06,559
Come to make a bet.

140
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,519
Come on, hurry.

141
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,040
Come on.

142
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:08,925
Let’s take a look.

143
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:10,150
Okay.

144
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,720
You are eloquent.

145
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:13,880
Seems that you’ve been here for years.

146
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
To be honest,

147
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,160
I’ve been doing this

148
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,600
since the first contest.

149
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,679
Come on, bro. Come on.

150
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:22,640
- Do you know
- Hurry.

151
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,720
where to get the wooden pass
for the contest?

152
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,781
You can try your luck at Qingliu Alley.

153
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,720
Um.

154
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,200
You guys back there.

155
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,100
Hurry up and register.

156
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,959
- Come on.
- I’ll make a bet.

157
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,600
Hey.

158
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,799
Bro, do you want it?

159
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:42,100
- No.
- No.

160
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,700
No.

161
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:44,615
You don’t know the good stuff.

162
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,519
I met the pass right after I went out.

163
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,200
Seems that I’ll be the winner.

164
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:50,475
Hey.

165
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,119
Is this

166
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:53,640
the pass for the Machinist Contest?

167
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
You are an expert.

168
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,239
You recognize it at a glance.

169
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,920
How much? Give me a price.

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,200
A fair trade.

171
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,640
Twenty taels of silver.

172
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,799
Come on, the Mechanism Pavilion
only sells it at five taels of silver.

173
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,119
You sell it at twenty taels?

174
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,399
Why don’t you
go to the Mechanism Pavilion then?

175
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:10,440
I won’t sell it

176
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,160
for any less money.

177
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,440
Miss.

178
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,910
Have a look.

179
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,640
Twenty taels.

180
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,325
Bro.

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Didn’t we just meet?

182
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,880
No. No.

183
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,720
First come, first served.
I bought it first.

184
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:31,119
Miss, sorry.

185
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:33,366
He stole the wooden pass from me.

186
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:37,026
No. You got the wrong person.

187
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,760
Do you have any evidence
to prove that he stole your pass?

188
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,119
I don’t have any evidence now.

189
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,760
Then this is a trade between us.

190
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,479
I’m really sorry.

191
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,640
I’ll take him to the place

192
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,520
where justice will be done.

193
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,880
You are robbing him.

194
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,440
You...

195
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,750
Young Master, take care.

196
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,325
Miss.

197
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,119
Please don’t do this

198
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:01,676
in public.

199
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,599
Please, I really need
to enter the contest.

200
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,080
Don’t fight over it with a girl.

201
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,799
I’m sorry.

202
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,559
The wooden pass is mine.

203
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,599
Let’s go.

204
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:19,679
It’s him!

205
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,119
Get him!

206
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,320
Stop!

207
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,280
Don’t go!

208
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,559
It’s not my business.

209
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:02,799
Move.

210
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,479
You...

211
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,019
He seems to be there.

212
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,500
Come on.

213
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,425
Good stuff.

214
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,800
Move! Move!

215
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,599
Don’t move!

216
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:21,840
You can’t run.

217
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,571
Who is that?

218
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:42,800
Take a look.

219
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:44,925
On sale.

220
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,700
Ouch.

221
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:52,900
Get him!

222
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,719
I didn’t do it.

223
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,520
Take him away!

224
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:56,250
- Take him away!
- Come on!

225
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:56,875
Let’s go.

226
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,599
You came just right.

227
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,000
With your footwork,
who can catch up with you?

228
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,799
(Mechanism Pavilion)

229
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,000
Master, see.

230
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,520
This is the wooden pass for the contest.

231
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:13,479
Miss, you only have
half of the wooden pass.

232
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,359
(Mechanism Pavilion, Master)
According to the rules, you can’t enter.

233
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,679
Come again next year.

234
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:20,975
Master.

235
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:23,119
This young man helped us
catch the scalper.

236
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:24,225
Oh.

237
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,359
May I have your name?

238
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:30,080
I’m Zhang Qian.

239
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,640
Since you helped us,

240
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,039
I allow you to choose

241
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,320
one novel thing at our pavilion

242
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,119
as a thank-you gift.

243
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,640
Master.

244
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:40,159
I came to the capital this time

245
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,640
to join the Machinist Contest,

246
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,599
but I lost my wooden pass
on the way here.

247
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,559
I wonder if you could give me a chance

248
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,200
to enter the contest?

249
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,119
I see.

250
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,000
I can’t give you a chance that easily.

251
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Well, I’ll make up a question.

252
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:58,719
If you solve it,

253
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,400
I’ll break the rules to let you compete.

254
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,679
No problem.

255
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,760
Master.

256
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,479
I still have half a pass.

257
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,960
He has nothing.

258
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
I think your rules are unfair.

259
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,359
Unfair?

260
00:12:12,675 --> 00:12:14,520
Well, if you and this young man

261
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,840
both can solve my question,

262
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,719
I’ll let you two compete.

263
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,359
Go ahead.

264
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,359
(Mechanism Pavilion)
If you two

265
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,080
can throw down an egg

266
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,200
from the roof without breaking it,

267
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,240
you win.

268
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,559
Will you keep your words?

269
00:12:32,275 --> 00:12:33,556
No matter what method I use,

270
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,190
if I don’t break the egg,

271
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,320
you will let me
enter the Machinist Contest.

272
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,159
I’m a person of my word.

273
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,960
Look.

274
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,919
Look.

275
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,119
- I didn’t expect this.
- It isn’t broken.

276
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:19,225
- What a surprise.
- That’s new.

277
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:19,750
She is good.

278
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,080
It didn’t break
after falling from such a high place.

279
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,750
This design is amazing.

280
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:23,799
Yeah.

281
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,100
Hey.

282
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,239
It’s your turn.

283
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,400
Wait.

284
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,559
You are fooling the Master.

285
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,919
Master.

286
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:15,520
According to your request,

287
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,810
the egg was thrown from the roof
and it didn’t break.

288
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,264
Indeed.

289
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,280
You can join
the Machinist Contest tomorrow.

290
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,425
Ah?

291
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,799
Thank you, Master.

292
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:39,599
Waiter.

293
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:40,250
Yes.

294
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,559
Bring me a mandarin fish,

295
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,640
a roast duck and a dish of greens.

296
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,250
Okay.

297
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Hold on.

298
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,960
I didn’t bring money.

299
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Serve the dishes first,

300
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,880
I’ll go back to get the money.

301
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,719
We can’t do this.

302
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,400
What if you won’t come back?

303
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:56,599
How come?

304
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,479
Young Master, look at that.

305
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,320
How would I not come back?

306
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:06,220
- I’ll pay for
- I’ll give you the money.

307
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,200
this girl’s meal.

308
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,159
Okay.

309
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:12,926
Why did you do this?

310
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,880
(Son of Marquis Jinghai, Zhao Xiao)
I happened to see

311
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,559
you fight over the pass during the day.

312
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,479
You’re also here
for the Machinist Contest?

313
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,039
If you don’t mind,

314
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,479
can we eat together?

315
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:24,960
Since you paid for the meal,

316
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,159
let’s eat together.

317
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,080
Thanks, Miss.

318
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,559
Sir, here are your dishes.

319
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,000
I’m the son
of Marquis Jinghai, Zhao Xiao.

320
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,359
I want to be friends with you.

321
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,200
I wonder if you could

322
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,239
tell me your name.

323
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,440
You are the son of Marquis Jinghai?

324
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,359
My name is

325
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,239
Jiang Xian.

326
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,880
Jiang Xian.

327
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,799
Since he is the son of Marquis Jinghai,

328
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,679
maybe I met him when his family

329
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,039
entered the palace to pay respects
when he was a child.

330
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,799
Isn’t that the maid of the Emperor?

331
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,280
Why is she here?

332
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,760
And she is pregnant. Could it be...?

333
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,000
Thank you for the meal.
See you next time.

334
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,320
Miss Jiang!

335
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,200
(Wanlong Restaurant)

336
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,880
Miss.

337
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,270
It’s Cousin Lyu!

338
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:39,400
He found out I stole his pass so soon.

339
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,320
I can’t let him take me back now.

340
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:43,840
I’ll look into this
after I get back to the palace.

341
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,375
(Mechanism Pavilion)

342
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,100
This is good.

343
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,320
Hey, Miss Jiang.

344
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,039
You are also here
for the Machinist Contest.

345
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:00,000
Of course.

346
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,359
My clever kite

347
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,840
is prepared for the contest.

348
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,680
I see.

349
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,719
What is this?

350
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,199
How about mine?

351
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,839
You are here, too.

352
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,560
You got into the game
with that little trick.

353
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,040
I’m afraid you can’t even
pass the first round.

354
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,261
Wait and see.

355
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:23,599
Master has arrived.

356
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,719
Welcome to the Mechanism Pavilion

357
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:34,079
- for our annual Machinist Contest.
- Will I win this time?

358
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,000
There are twenty talents in total

359
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,719
who got the wooden passes
for the contest.

360
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,959
The winner will have

361
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,760
the prestigious
Book of Supreme Weapons.

362
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,760
Master.

363
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,439
Can you show us

364
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:48,599
the Book of Supreme Weapons now?

365
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,775
Yeah.

366
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:53,359
Mr. Zhang, no hurry.

367
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:55,920
The price can only be opened

368
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,439
by the winner in person.

369
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,680
Please show your best work.

370
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,160
The elders
of the Mechanism Pavilion and I

371
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,160
will grade your works on the spot

372
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,000
based on the idea, the craftsmanship
and the degree of completion.

373
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,199
The top four with the highest points

374
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,319
will advance to the next round.

375
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:14,239
Everyone, it’s your time now.

376
00:18:14,825 --> 00:18:15,359
Okay. Okay.

377
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,199
- Come on.
- Let’s go.

378
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,950
- Let’s go.
- Come on.

379
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:22,629
Master, look.

380
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:23,675
I invented this.

381
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:26,975
Wow.

382
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,439
I haven’t been
in such a lively place for a long time.

383
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,400
Um.

384
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,075
Miss Jiang.

385
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:46,275
When it flows down...

386
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:46,800
Hey.

387
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,160
Look at my boat.

388
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,680
Strange shape
and exquisite craftsmanship.

389
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,750
I’m better than you.

390
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,359
Wait...

391
00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:52,250
You...

392
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,760
Isn’t it interesting?

393
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,750
It’s awesome.

394
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,640
This is interesting.

395
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:06,959
This fish is so real.

396
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,640
It can even make a turn.

397
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,680
Yeah.

398
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,040
A live fish sways its tail

399
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,319
to change the direction of the current

400
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,880
and thus the direction it moves.

401
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,560
He added a switch
on the wooden fish’s tail

402
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,300
which can control the tail to sway,

403
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:25,075
then it can make turns.

404
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,689
I got it.

405
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,199
Hey, Miss Jiang.

406
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,860
Is your work broken?

407
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:48,800
No.

408
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,760
I just saw room for improvement.

409
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,200
It’s such a big kite.

410
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,800
It can not only fly
but also change its direction.

411
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,400
Master.

412
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,160
- This is a clever kite.
- The kite will win. Let’s go.

413
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,520
I just made an improvement.

414
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,839
I added a switch on it
and it can make turns now.

415
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,880
- I can control its direction.
- I also think she will win.

416
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,119
I’ve consulted a lot of people.

417
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,125
It’s really good.

418
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,731
I mean it, my work.

419
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:12,993
Um.

420
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,239
I’ll win this time.

421
00:20:17,325 --> 00:20:18,359
I declare

422
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,319
the top four contestants

423
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,079
in the first round today

424
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:25,785
are the inventors of bionic wooden fish

425
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,359
and clever kite.

426
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,920
It’s me.

427
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,359
Clairvoyance,

428
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,560
and unicycle.

429
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,880
The four of you need to be here
tomorrow morning

430
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,625
for the next round.

431
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,325
Um.

432
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,601
He plays cool.

433
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,100
(Mechanism Pavilion)

434
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,700
- Young Master.
- Take care.

435
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,319
How is it?

436
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:56,835
Did the item you brought
help you pass the round?

437
00:20:57,575 --> 00:20:58,280
It’s a toy my mother

438
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,199
made for me when I was a child.

439
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,280
I don’t really know how it works.

440
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:03,804
But I made one exactly like it

441
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:05,974
and it passed the first round easily.

442
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,839
Seems that what my mother made

443
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,250
is quite ingenious.

444
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,000
Come and have a look.

445
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,560
Did you see
the Book of Supreme Weapons?

446
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,450
- Take care.
- Have a look.

447
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:17,886
The Master of the Mechanism Pavilion

448
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:20,079
promised that the book is the prize.

449
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:22,974
Since she has
the Book of Supreme Weapons,

450
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,975
it means she may know something

451
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:25,675
Take a look.

452
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:27,119
- about what happened back then.
- Take a look.

453
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,959
It’s him.

454
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,079
- Wei Shu, you go back first.
- Take a look.

455
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,559
I need to find it out.

456
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:38,325
Um.

457
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,359
The contest is over.

458
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,079
Why would he
go back to the Mechanism Pavilion?

459
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:45,725
Take a look.

460
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:47,640
Could he go back
to steal the exam questions?

461
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:58,175
Hey.

462
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,400
Here.

463
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:04,005
I got you.

464
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,719
The people selected in this first round

465
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:07,800
look good.

466
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:10,439
But the test tomorrow
won’t be that easy.

467
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,280
Why are you suddenly...?

468
00:22:17,775 --> 00:22:19,334
It depends on their luck.

469
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:19,875
Um.

470
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:44,560
Take it away!

471
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,675
Hey.

472
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,680
Do you sneak into the backyard
of the Mechanism Pavilion

473
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,160
to steal the content of the game?

474
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,119
You really did everything to win.

475
00:22:58,839 --> 00:22:59,479
I’m going

476
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,560
to turn you in.

477
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,520
Go ahead.

478
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:04,719
I’m in the backyard.

479
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:05,920
Aren’t you also here?

480
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:09,640
If you turn me in,

481
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I’m afraid
you will also be disqualified.

482
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,599
- You...
- I don’t need

483
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,839
to steal anything.

484
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:19,119
It’s not difficult to win the game.

485
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,239
Then tell me

486
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:22,239
what you are doing here.

487
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,520
I just heard

488
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,040
the Master of the Mechanism Pavilion
is awesome.

489
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,079
She has all kinds of gadgets
she made in her room.

490
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,040
I’m intrigued,

491
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:28,920
so I came to have a look.

492
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:30,719
What’s in her room?

493
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,479
Well,

494
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,319
are you also interested?

495
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:34,839
Why should I be interested?

496
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,599
I just want to keep an eye on you

497
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:37,000
to make sure you can’t cheat.

498
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,400
This way.

499
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
I don’t need you to tell me.

500
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,100
(Integrity and Meritorious Deeds
are Praised)

501
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,950
Wow.

502
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,119
She is indeed the Master
of the Mechanism Pavilion.

503
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,400
There are a lot of treasures.

504
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,280
Isn’t this the rice paper
of the Qinzheng Hall?

505
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,760
The Qinzheng Hall.

506
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:30,560
You mean for the Emperor?

507
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,280
My family’s paper shop

508
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,800
supplies this kind of rice paper
only to the palace.

509
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:41,160
Is your family a royal merchant?

510
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:42,000
None of your business.

511
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,800
Why is His Majesty’s rice paper here?

512
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,959
The second round
of the Machinist Contest

513
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:10,000
is about cracking the mechanism.

514
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,880
You four will enter a secret chamber.

515
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,359
There are various traps I set up.

516
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,040
If you can crack the mechanism

517
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,920
and escape within four hours,

518
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,239
you can advance to the next round.

519
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,880
If you can’t,

520
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
you will be eliminated.

521
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,359
It’s you?

522
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,880
Wait, why are you here?

523
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,040
Just to be clear,

524
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,880
let’s go out on our own.

525
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,319
As you wish.

526
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,575
Hey.

527
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,239
I found the mechanism.

528
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,479
I’m gonna leave first.

529
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,000
Be careful!

530
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,040
Don’t waste your energy.

531
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,880
The rope net for hunting is strong.

532
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,719
Nothing good happens
every time I meet you.

533
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,040
That’s what I should say.

534
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,800
You said you would leave first.

535
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,760
That’s it?

536
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:42,040
I’ve looked around for a while
before you came.

537
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:44,199
There is a chessboard over there.

538
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,680
It’s the Exquisite Endgame.

539
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,119
The Exquisite Endgame?

540
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:52,040
Yes.

541
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:57,040
I need to take a black piece behind you.

542
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:58,275
Let’s swing over there.

543
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:10,479
Almost there. Again.

544
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,199
You are not fooling me, are you?

545
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,040
Who is fooling you?

546
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,359
Do it again.

547
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:34,760
Hurry.

548
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,119
Swing over there.

549
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,199
Where?

550
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,199
The third place in horizontal
and sixth in vertical.

551
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,000
We are even.

552
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,160
Let’s go.

553
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,119
There is no light here.

554
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,000
I can’t see the mechanism.

555
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:37,825
Wow.

556
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,925
Hey.

557
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,239
You are also here.

558
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,920
The first level is not difficult.

559
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,040
But this level is not easy.

560
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,839
I’ve been observing for a while
and I still don’t have any clue.

561
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,520
I’ll hold it. Go to get them here.

562
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:24,350
Okay.

563
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:24,951
Go ahead.

564
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:27,400
We found it.

565
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,359
I’ll check it first for you.

566
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,025
You just stay here.

567
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,280
The game is over now.

568
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,479
What’s going on?

569
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,280
Why is it a closed empty room?

570
00:29:39,975 --> 00:29:40,920
Let me out!

571
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,479
Seems that there are
many fake traps here.

572
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:43,640
We have to be more careful.

573
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,560
Let me out!

574
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,160
Let me out!

575
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,680
You deserve it.

576
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,160
Isn’t this...?

577
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,479
Hurry. Here is a depression.

578
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,959
It’s the same as the embossed pattern
on the ground before.

579
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:21,520
It should be the key to go out.

580
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:25,479
Take that ball!

581
00:31:39,925 --> 00:31:40,560
Be careful!

582
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,520
Miss Jiang!

583
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,239
Come on!

584
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,199
Don’t move. I’ll get it.

585
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,760
No. You don’t move!

586
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
Let’s walk together.

587
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,359
Let’s walk together.

588
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,280
Master Zhao, take it.

589
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:34,000
Not good!

590
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,119
Let’s go!

591
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:35,680
Okay!

592
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:47,199
Let’s go.

593
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:48,375
Um.

594
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:54,079
Here.

595
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:10,350
Come on.

596
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:25,000
Master.

597
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,320
Congratulations to you three
for advancing to the next round.

598
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,600
Don’t forget to release the one

599
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,679
who didn’t pass.

600
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,270
Yes.

601
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,450
Hey.

602
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,719
The three of us
are kind of allies today.

603
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,280
Let’s celebrate it together.

604
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,760
How about my treat?

605
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,199
I have something else to do.

606
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,040
Seriously?

607
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,159
He changes faster than the weather.

608
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:01,280
The challenge for the last round

609
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
is to find a waterproof material

610
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,239
in the mountains in one day

611
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,479
and bring it back
to the Mechanism Pavilion.

612
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,479
The first one who finds it

613
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:10,679
will be the winner
of the Machinist Contest.

614
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,800
Water gathers in the rosin
and doesn’t leak.

615
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,919
Isn’t this a waterproof material?

616
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,360
Seems that I’ll be the winner this year.

617
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:02,560
Miss Jiang.

618
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:05,280
Have you found anything?

619
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,360
I won’t tell you.

620
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,479
Miss Jiang!

621
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:28,879
Miss Jiang.

622
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,879
Take my hand

623
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,919
and try to climb up.

624
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:34,879
Come on.

625
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:18,399
Miss Jiang, are you okay?

626
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,375
Ah.

627
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,800
Luckily, my bones and muscles are fine.

628
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,600
Hey.

629
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,399
I saw you

630
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:36,439
fly down from the roof
to catch the egg that day.

631
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:38,040
Can you do that again and get me out?

632
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,159
This cave is too deep

633
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,919
and the stone is too slippery.

634
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,040
There is no place
where I can use the force.

635
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,600
There is only one way then.

636
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
What is it?

637
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:51,360
Help!

638
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,320
Is there anyone?

639
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,080
Is there anyone who can help us?

640
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:58,083
Is there anyone?

641
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,000
Help!

642
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,159
- Is there anyone?
- Is there anyone?

643
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,280
Is there anyone?

644
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:06,075
Miss Jiang? Mr. Zhang?

645
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:06,719
Hey.

646
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:07,520
We are here!

647
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,719
Young Master Zhao.

648
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,320
Get some people here to save us now!

649
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,900
Okay.

650
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,879
I’ll go to the Mechanism Pavilion
to get some help.

651
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,760
Wait for me.

652
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:14,760
Hurry!

653
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:25,700
(Mechanism Pavilion)

654
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,479
Mr. Zhang and Miss Jiang
fell into a cave.

655
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:30,150
Come with me to save them now.

656
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,700
Okay.

657
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:32,639
Follow me.

658
00:38:32,675 --> 00:38:33,225
Hurry!

659
00:38:33,225 --> 00:38:34,000
- Hurry!
- Yes.

660
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,600
Okay.

661
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,100
(Mechanism Pavilion)

662
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,959
Miss Jiang has a big heart indeed.

663
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,959
She can fall asleep in such a situation.
