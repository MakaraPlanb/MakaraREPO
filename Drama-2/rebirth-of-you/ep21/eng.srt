Miss Qi’s flowers

31
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,620
are all in the backyard.

32
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,980
I took the liberty to have a look first.

33
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,580
You won’t be disappointed, Your Grace.

34
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,260
That’s very kind of you, Miss Dong.

35
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,660
They’re nothing special

36
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,100
except for a pot of azaleas,

37
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,260
called Fiery Silk.

38
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,500
They’re of extreme rarity

39
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,700
and specifically ordered by the palace.

40
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,540
You can take a look

41
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,500
before they’re shipped to the capital.

42
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:31,260
- Please.
- Thanks.

43
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,860
What...? What happened?

44
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,580
Where’s everyone?

45
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,460
Come here!

46
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,385
Who did this?

47
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:48,575
Hey!

48
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,340
What’s the rush?

49
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,500
Is there a fire?

50
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,300
No.

51
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,180
We’ve been robbed!

52
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,540
Someone stole

53
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,820
Miss Qi’s flowers for the palace

54
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,640
from our backyard.

55
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,650
What?

56
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:01,945
You...

57
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,860
- You...
- What about me?

58
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,625
- You...
- Miss!

59
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:07,475
Miss!

60
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,660
I caught the thief!

61
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,580
Let go of me!

62
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,140
She did it!

63
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,060
What are you doing?

64
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,860
You stole my flowers?

65
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,540
So what if I did?

66
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,540
Do you know what those are?

67
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,260
Just a pot of cheap plants!

68
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,580
What’s the big deal?

69
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,260
Let go of me!

70
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,060
If you don’t,

71
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,780
I’ll tell Qian

72
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,900
to come with his men!

73
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,740
Then your whole yard

74
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,980
will be gone,

75
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,220
not to mention

76
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,300
some flowers!

77
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,740
How dare you!

78
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,740
You slapped me!

79
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,740
I’ll kill you!

80
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,380
Stop! Break it off!

81
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,300
You slapped me!

82
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,260
- They’re for the palace!
- Miss!

83
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,620
My whole family will die because of you!

84
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,260
- I’ll kill you first!
- Miss!

85
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,660
You must pay for it!

86
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,460
Go ahead,

87
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,825
or I’ll kill you!

88
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:00,725
Enough, Miss Qi!

89
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:01,340
Stop, Miss!

90
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,260
Who’s that girl?

91
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,780
Miss!

92
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,550
- I don’t know.
- You hit me! You...

93
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,380
- I heard she came with Her Grace.
- This isn’t over!

94
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,625
Then she must be of noble birth.

95
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,550
Wait for it! You...

96
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:11,825
You’re dead! Let me go!

97
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:13,660
Miss.

98
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,060
Miss.

99
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,220
Miss, are you alright?

100
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,660
You can’t get away with it!

101
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,460
No way!

102
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,700
- Miss Qi.
- Let go of me!

103
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,820
Miss Qi,

104
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,140
this young lady seems nice.

105
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,620
Could it be a misunderstanding?

106
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,820
Step aside, Mr. Shao.

107
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,100
It’s none of your business.

108
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,540
It’s my business to uphold justice.

109
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,100
After all,

110
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,900
she’s the Dong Family’s guest.

111
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,020
Isn’t it inappropriate

112
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,100
to be so rude to her?

113
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,940
It’s your fault!

114
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,860
Come out!

115
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:49,325
You...

116
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,460
Calm down, Miss Qi.

117
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,900
I’m the one to blame

118
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,700
that I didn’t see this coming.

119
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,500
It has nothing to do with you.

120
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,620
It’s me.

121
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,580
I shouldn’t have
brought those flowers over.

122
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,340
But what to do now?

123
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,540
Miss Qi,

124
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,740
your Fiery Silk is indeed rare.

125
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,340
Well,

126
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,500
give me three days.

127
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,820
I’ll find a replacement for you.

128
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,660
You and your family will be safe.

129
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,540
Your Grace...

130
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,060
Stop playing nice!

131
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,500
Listen,

132
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,060
I did nothing wrong!

133
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,620
Those cheap flowers

134
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,860
can be found anywhere!

135
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,700
But you’re

136
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:26,140
ganging up on me with them!

137
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,780
I hate you all!

138
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,580
Ignore her.

139
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,540
Let’s go back with Her Grace.

140
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:35,225
Fine.

141
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,460
Miss Dong,

142
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,780
a word, please.

143
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,300
Your Grace,

144
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,050
please excuse me.

145
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:40,725
Sure.

146
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:44,500
Mr. Shao,

147
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,420
how can I help you?

148
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,180
You’re Her Grace’s favorite.

149
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,900
I trust that you know that girl.

150
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,980
May I ask

151
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,620
who she is?

152
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,860
Not everyone

153
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,660
can be Her Grace’s relative.

154
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,940
Her father

155
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,060
was a millionaire

156
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,300
and she inherited

157
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,940
all his fortune alone

158
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,620
when he passed away.

159
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,780
Who knows which lucky man
will marry her?

160
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,020
Hold on, Miss Zhang.

161
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,260
What?

162
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,940
You’re too pretty

163
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,820
to have swollen eyes from crying.

164
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
Qi Dan

165
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,140
is from a military family.

166
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,780
She’s always rude.

167
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,500
I’m sorry

168
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,020
for what you’ve been through.

169
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,900
Thank you,

170
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,820
kind sir.

171
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,100
You’re a good man.

172
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,660
My name is Shao Yang.

173
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,060
You’re new in Bingzhou.

174
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,220
They shouldn’t have been so mean to you.

175
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,660
I apologize for them.

176
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,700
You didn’t bully me.

177
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,580
Why are you apologizing?

178
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,740
It’s worth it

179
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,380
if an apology or more

180
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,660
can put a smile back on your face.

181
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,860
What?

182
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,020
- They did this to you?
- Look, Mother!

183
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,150
Look, I’m badly injured!

184
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,700
Let’s go!

185
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,780
I demand an explanation!

186
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,260
Ow!

187
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:32,780
Madam,

188
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,900
your birthday is in a few days.

189
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,220
Here’s the menu for the banquet.

190
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,020
Please take a look.

191
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,925
Sure.

192
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,260
Madam He!

193
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,820
Madam He!

194
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,620
Madam Zhang,

195
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,820
I can hear you from afar.

196
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,180
What happened this time?

197
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,420
What happened?

198
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,060
It was your noble daughter-in-law!

199
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,180
She took my daughter to a banquet

200
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,900
only to bully her with the others!

201
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,220
They beat her up

202
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,980
over a few flowers

203
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,820
she picked!

204
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,940
Alright, alright.

205
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,580
Calm down.

206
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,180
Take a seat and have some tea.

207
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,380
You can tell me bit by bit.

208
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,260
Steward.

209
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,820
Yes, Madam.

210
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,940
Ask Her Grace to come over

211
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
to clean up

212
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,340
her mess.

213
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,020
Yes, Madam.

214
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,260
I apologize

215
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,860
for troubling you, Mother.

216
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,500
Mother, if you don’t mind,

217
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,580
I’d like to ask her something first.

218
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,820
You tortured her out there,

219
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,260
and now, you’re grilling her?

220
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,180
My poor late husband!

221
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,220
You saved an ingrate!

222
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,220
He’s rising high

223
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,740
with his family...

224
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:57,375
They keep stirring up trouble at home.

225
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,970
I’ll teach you a lesson.

226
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,075
My poor late husband!

227
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,940
Miss Zhang,

228
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,780
do you know

229
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,900
you destroyed
the most famous Fiery Silk?

230
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,100
There’s only one pot in Bingzhou

231
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,660
which was supposed
to be delivered to the palace.

232
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,380
If His Majesty finds out

233
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,780
you ruined it,

234
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,540
your whole family will be executed!

235
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,500
You’re bluffing.

236
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,340
They’re cheap

237
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,700
and nothing special.

238
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,500
Fine.

239
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,900
In that case,

240
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,500
find some for us.

241
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,180
You...

242
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,140
If they arrive at the palace on time,

243
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,500
the Qi Family will be safe,

244
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,820
and you, Miss Zhang,

245
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,100
will have a few more days to live.

246
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,140
Otherwise,

247
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,380
if they’re looking for people to blame,

248
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,540
your name

249
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,820
will be coughed up first.

250
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,276
Uh...

251
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,180
Also,

252
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,100
Madam Zhang will go down, too.

253
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,780
Fiery Silk

254
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,940
is something I’ve only heard about

255
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,420
but never seen in person.

256
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,180
The Qi Family sees it

257
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,860
as their most valuable treasure

258
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,780
and seldom shows it to others.

259
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,020
Miss Zhang,

260
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,140
what were you thinking?

261
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,500
Why did you have to pick those flowers?

262
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,540
You could get yourself killed!

263
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,780
Uh...

264
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,020
Your Grace,

265
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,020
you used to live in the palace.

266
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,820
You have connections there.

267
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,140
I’m sure

268
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,940
you can make this thing go away easily.

269
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,380
They aren’t just flowers
but the imperial family’s dignity.

270
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,340
It’s serious.

271
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,180
Without them,

272
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,580
the Qi Family,

273
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,300
Zhang Family

274
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,140
and even the Li Family
will be in trouble.

275
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,660
Look what you’ve done!

276
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,900
Madam Zhang,

277
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,940
your daughter

278
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,300
should be disciplined.

279
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:54,740
- She’s not a child anymore.
- I...

280
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,100
How could she be so stupid?

281
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,460
Didn’t she know

282
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,500
what she could

283
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,180
and couldn’t touch outside?

284
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,260
And look what happened!

285
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,340
She destroyed the gift for His Majesty,

286
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,420
which could implicate our family, too!

287
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,260
What a mess!

288
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:15,949
(Good Fortune and Longevity to Come)

289
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,140
Young Master,

290
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,140
look,

291
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,580
someone brought us flowers.

292
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,980
Wait!

293
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:21,600
Yes?

294
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,740
Fiery Silk!

295
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,860
Who was it?

296
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,260
I don’t know.

297
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,340
I heard the knock,

298
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,380
opened the door

299
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,380
and only saw the flowers.

300
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,140
No one was there.

301
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,900
I’m blessed!

302
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,460
(Elegance and Quietness)
Flowers!

303
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,140
(Elegance and Quietness)
Someone brought the flowers!

304
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,500
Fiery Silk?

305
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,140
Yes, that’s right!

306
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,140
Who brought them over?

307
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,620
A young man,

308
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,740
surnamed Shao.

309
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,220
Where is he?

310
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,460
He’s right outside.

311
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,580
I’m going! I’m going to see him!

312
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,140
Be careful.

313
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,340
Miss, wait for me!

314
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,075
Miss!

315
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,260
Miss!

316
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,700
Why are you following me?

317
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,620
Get out of my sight!

318
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,460
Don’t stand in my way!

319
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,140
Ever!

320
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,220
Get lost!

321
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,100
Liuhe.

322
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,750
Miss...

323
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,900
Come on, Liuhe!

324
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,340
You aren’t expecting me

325
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,020
to take these herbs
to the kitchen, are you?

326
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:22,950
What?

327
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:31,925
Mr. Shao,

328
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,020
thank you for the flowers.

329
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,820
By the way,

330
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,740
where did you get them?

331
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,780
A little effort and money

332
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,020
and there they were.

333
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,300
It broke my heart

334
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,820
seeing you suffer so much

335
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,020
and live in terror

336
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,780
over some plants,

337
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,140
so I spared no effort
to find another pot

338
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,300
and it paid off.

339
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,980
Mr. Shao,

340
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,460
I’m surprised

341
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,740
that you’d go to

342
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,700
such great lengths for me.

343
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,540
You did me a huge favor.

344
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,740
I must thank you for it.

345
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,180
Sure.

346
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,620
What are you going to do?

347
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,300
How about

348
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,300
I treat you

349
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,140
to lunch tomorrow?

350
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,700
- It’s a deal.
- Yes.

351
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,980
See you then.

352
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,500
Sure.

353
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,340
See you tomorrow.

354
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,500
Look

355
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,500
what’s in front of you.

356
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,740
Fiery Silk it is!

357
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,500
Who said there was
only one pot in Bingzhou?

358
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,860
Lair!

359
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,020
Getting another one

360
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,940
is a piece of cake.

361
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,140
Miss Zhang, you’re better connected

362
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,140
than me.

363
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,220
And your gown looks fabulous.

364
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,180
I have a set of jewelry that’d match it.

365
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,180
Qingke,

366
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,060
go get it.

367
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,500
I have tons of this stuff

368
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,420
in my room.

369
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:18,060
Open your eyes!

370
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,300
A pure red gem

371
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,700
this big

372
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,780
can only be the finest
pigeon blood ruby.

373
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,500
There’s a full set of it

374
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,020
crafted in the palace.

375
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,420
You can’t find it elsewhere

376
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,540
even with a thousand taels of gold.

377
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,780
Miss Zhang,

378
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,860
take a look.

379
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,260
They’re yours if you like them.

380
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,260
Really?

381
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:40,925
Yes.

382
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,740
Well,

383
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,100
I have more such accessories

384
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,980
than I can count,

385
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,300
but

386
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,620
girls can’t have enough jewelry, right?

387
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,660
So,

388
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,540
I’ll take them.

389
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,060
Your Grace,

390
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,700
you aren’t taking them back, are you?

391
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,100
Of course not!

392
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,820
It’s just that

393
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,300
your maid Liuhe seems capable.

394
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,340
I could use some extra hands.

395
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,700
You don’t want to

396
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,540
keep a burden, do you?

397
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,420
I don’t.

398
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,100
I’m sick of having her around anyway.

399
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,420
Alright then.

400
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,300
Thanks.

401
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,220
Your Grace,

402
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,100
why did you give your jewelry to her?

403
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,860
She doesn’t deserve it.

404
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,740
Didn’t you see

405
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,820
she was fully dressed up?

406
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,820
That certainly wasn’t for me.

407
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,180
So?

408
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,340
That jewelry is icing on the cake.

409
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,700
Miss Zhang.

410
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,591
Is there a table upstairs?

411
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:51,897
Yes, sir.

412
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,340
Mr. Shao.

413
00:15:57,825 --> 00:15:59,041
We’d like some tea.

414
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,210
Coming, sir.

415
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,000
Please enjoy.

416
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,075
Give us the menu, please.

417
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:05,625
Yes, coming!

418
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,060
Mr. Shao,

419
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,460
what’s on your mind?

420
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,180
You’re so gorgeous

421
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,740
that I can’t find words

422
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,540
to say to you.

423
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,300
I’m sorry.

424
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,460
I hope you don’t mind.

425
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,950
Mr. Wang, I’m here!

426
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,220
This set of jewelry you’re wearing

427
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,740
must be expensive, right?

428
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,780
Not exactly.

429
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:45,850
Enjoy your tea, sir.

430
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,340
It’s nothing special.

431
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,820
My father told me

432
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,940
to always keep a low profile outside

433
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,060
for safety,

434
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,980
- so
- Excuse me!

435
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,900
- when I’m out,
- Coming!

436
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,020
I always wear stuff
of medium quality or below.

437
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,100
You call that medium quality or below?

438
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,340
It’s really nothing.

439
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,220
I have a lot more

440
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,420
better and luxurious ones at home.

441
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,740
Your family is extremely wealthy.

442
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,660
We’re doing alright.

443
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,820
I’ve never seen

444
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,500
someone richer

445
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,620
than us, though.

446
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,740
Long time no see.

447
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,420
Miss Zhang.

448
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,140
I know.

449
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,700
No,

450
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:37,980
Duolan.

451
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,025
I mean,

452
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,700
may I call you that?

453
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,700
Why not?

454
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,740
We were a family of officials

455
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,860
until my father’s generation
started to do business.

456
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,780
Our business covers the entire state.

457
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,740
We might not be as wealthy as you,

458
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,740
but in Bingzhou,

459
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,220
no,

460
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,140
in the entire Jinxi,

461
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,420
our family is on the top of the list.

462
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,620
Really?

463
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,300
That Fiery Silk has already said a lot

464
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,860
about your family’s power

465
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,580
and wealth.

466
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,380
Is Miss Zhang back?

467
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,060
No.

468
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,940
And Liuhe?

469
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,420
Also no.

470
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,020
It worked!

471
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,620
What do you mean?

472
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,500
There should be a plaque outside,

473
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,220
saying, “Goddess of Love’s Chamber

474
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,140
where the matchmaking begins

475
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,140
with no guarantee of happy endings”.

476
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:57,000
Good idea.

477
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,740
Be careful, Duolan.

478
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,675
(Li’s Mansion)

479
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:02,300
Thank you.

480
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:02,860
Duolan.

481
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:03,975
Yes?

482
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,300
I’ll pick you up tomorrow.

483
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,500
Sure.

484
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,820
Let’s go to Wangyue Restaurant again.

485
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,980
I like their fish.

486
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,980
No problem.

487
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:14,925
Alright.

488
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:20,660
Duolan.

489
00:19:23,725 --> 00:19:26,060
Thank you.

490
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,540
Goodbye.

491
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:36,220
See you.

492
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,500
How does this one look?

493
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,460
You’re getting better and better, Madam.

494
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,900
Aren’t you sweet?

495
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:52,125
Mother.

496
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:54,805
There you are.

497
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,580
Where were you this early?

498
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,020
I heard

499
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,860
you skipped breakfast.

500
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,100
I’ve had them

501
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,620
make white fungus soup with lotus seeds.

502
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,500
Remember to have some.

503
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:05,220
Come, Su.

504
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,540
How are my flowers arranged?

505
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,570
Mother.

506
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,140
Yes?

507
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,700
I went to

508
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,980
see Physician Wang earlier.

509
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,740
Physician Wang?

510
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,740
Come here.

511
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,780
Tell me

512
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,220
what he said.

513
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,060
Sit with me.

514
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,300
He’s confirmed

515
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,700
that I’m pregnant.

516
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,100
I knew it!

517
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,460
I knew it!

518
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,660
If

519
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,260
Xuan’s father were still alive,

520
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,140
he’d be

521
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,260
over the moon now.

522
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,340
Mother.

523
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,620
Did he say

524
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,180
how far you are in your pregnancy?

525
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,900
I’m only over four weeks.

526
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,340
Look at you!

527
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,780
It’s been so long.

528
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,260
How could you not know?

529
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,500
My uterus was cold

530
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,420
and my period wasn’t always on time.

531
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,625
But Physician Wang did say

532
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,620
that there was a risk of miscarriage.

533
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,100
Miscarriage!

534
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,060
Then

535
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,340
did he say what to do?

536
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,180
Mother,

537
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
don’t panic.

538
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,740
He told me

539
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,140
to walk less

540
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,020
and rest more

541
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,020
and prescribed herbs
to prevent miscarriage.

542
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,175
He gave you herbs?

543
00:21:26,175 --> 00:21:26,800
Yes.

544
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,060
Wendie,

545
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,620
go now

546
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,020
to decoct the herbs.

547
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,900
- Go.
- Yes.

548
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:35,755
And you,

549
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,060
add a few more layers

550
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,260
to Su’s bed.

551
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:38,900
Yes, Madam.

552
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,740
Go!

553
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,780
Come here, Su.

554
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,340
Listen to me

555
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,580
and be good.

556
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,540
Go back to rest now.

557
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,060
Go.

558
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,225
Mother.

559
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:47,800
Yes?

560
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,460
Don’t worry.

561
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,820
Physician Wang said

562
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,780
I’d be fine

563
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,420
after taking the herbs and some rest.

564
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,140
Su,

565
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,540
I know

566
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,180
how much you’ve suffered

567
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,420
to help carry on our family line

568
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,960
but you’ve never complained about it.

569
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,860
The best thing

570
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,700
that has ever happened to my son

571
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,500
is marrying you.

572
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,820
As the old saying goes,

573
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,260
a good wife

574
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,300
merits half a state.

575
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,980
That can’t be more accurate.

576
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,340
Mother,

577
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,740
do you prefer boys or girls?

578
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,465
I only have a son.

579
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,740
If you can

580
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,340
give birth to a girl first,

581
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,340
I’ll finally be able to enjoy

582
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,900
raising a girl.

583
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,060
Am I right?

584
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,940
Their food is the best.

585
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,420
This way, please.

586
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,085
Come on, let’s go.

587
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,340
Mr. Li, the usual.

588
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,860
It’s very nice of you

589
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,600
to treat me to lunch.

590
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,220
I regard you

591
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,020
- as my own mother.
- Please have a seat.

592
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,140
It’s my fault

593
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,020
- that you haven’t tried local specialties
- This way, please.

594
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,460
after coming a long way here.

595
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,460
We should’ve come here earlier.

596
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,900
What would you like to eat?

597
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,340
I’m not picky.

598
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,500
We’re ready to order.

599
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,060
Coming.

600
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,540
Excuse me.

601
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,220
It’s good!

602
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,340
Yes, sir.

603
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,825
- Duolan?
- What would you like?

604
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:26,000
Please, Mr. Li.

605
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,850
Sure.

606
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,500
Madam!

607
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,420
Here.

608
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:30,860
Try this.

609
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,140
- Everyone is watching.
- Have some yourself.

610
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:34,165
- Don’t embarrass Miss Zhang here.
- Eat up.

611
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,780
It’s better

612
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,260
that you talk to her at home.

613
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,060
It’s tasty!

614
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,700
Here.

615
00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:46,095
You’re so sweet, Yang.

616
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:55,685
There you are!

617
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,060
Mother.

618
00:23:58,425 --> 00:23:59,140
Tell me,

619
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,300
who were you with earlier?

620
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,460
I...

621
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,460
I... I was with a friend.

622
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,900
Stop lying!

623
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:08,780
I saw everything

624
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,180
at Wangyue Restaurant.

625
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,980
Hey, stop!

626
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,540
Wait!

627
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,380
Did you blab to my mother?

628
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:17,925
I didn’t.

629
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,100
I... I did see it

630
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,220
but I swear

631
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,860
I didn’t tell anyone about it.

632
00:24:24,825 --> 00:24:25,740
Last time,

633
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,940
I drove you away,

634
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,900
but you still followed me there!

635
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,620
I told you to stop,

636
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,940
but you kept snooping on me!

637
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,780
I knew you did it! I knew it!

638
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,625
I didn’t!

639
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:33,150
Enough!

640
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,380
At this point,

641
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,060
you’d better be honest with me!

642
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:35,950
Go away!

643
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,780
Mother,

644
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:40,860
I...

645
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,300
I was with...

646
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,060
Mr. Shao.

647
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,700
He seems pretty nice.

648
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,620
Between him and Li Qian,

649
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,780
which one would you want to choose?

650
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,500
I think

651
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,220
both of them are good.

652
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,700
Duolan,

653
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,460
no matter what we say to others,

654
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,980
we know perfectly well

655
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,460
about our family’s situation.

656
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,180
Your father is gone.

657
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,540
The farmland he left isn’t
worth too much.

658
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,860
The only way

659
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,020
for us to live a well-off life

660
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,860
is to

661
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,780
marry you up.

662
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,700
The Shao Family had their days,

663
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,500
but they’ve been declining
since his generation.

664
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,260
Right now, he’s only a humble merchant

665
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,540
while Li Qian is doing so much better.

666
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:32,380
No one would dare to offend his wife!

667
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,700
Mother,

668
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,060
you have a point.

669
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,820
As good as Yang is,

670
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:43,100
marrying Li Qian

671
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,860
seems to be

672
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,380
a better deal.

673
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,340
That’s more like it!

674
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,260
Good girl!

675
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,380
(Elegance and Quietness)
You...

676
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,100
(Elegance and Quietness)
You’re driving me nuts!

677
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,180
Do you have any idea

678
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,100
how much my silk dress is worth?

679
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,340
How dare you mess it up!

680
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,060
I’m sorry.

681
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,580
Answer me.

682
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,860
Did you tip off my mother about it?

683
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,740
I swear to heaven

684
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,140
that it wasn’t me.

685
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,420
I hope not.

686
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,500
Listen,

687
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,860
you’d better behave yourself.

688
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,300
As you know,

689
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,980
I’m about to

690
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,700
marry Supervisor Li.

691
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,540
I’ll bring you with me

692
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,300
to his place

693
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,180
where I’ll be his wife

694
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,660
and you’ll be his concubine.

695
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,580
The two of us will still be together

696
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,620
for the rest of our lives.

697
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,340
How does that sound?

698
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,140
Aren’t you happy about that?

699
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,420
Say it! Answer me!

700
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,540
Get up.

701
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,540
I know

702
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,860
Her Grace is outside.

703
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,220
I... I swear I’d never
go between her and her husband

704
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,700
nor would I ever want to.

705
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,300
Alright, alright.

706
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,300
Get up.

707
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,700
Her Grace wouldn’t want you to suffer

708
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,460
and asked me to bring you some food.

709
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,300
Get up. Come.

710
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,300
That’s why

711
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,700
I know

712
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,620
how kind she is.

713
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,700
I wouldn’t dare

714
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,500
to exploit her kindness,

715
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,100
let alone steal her husband.

716
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,860
Relax. I know.

717
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,580
Weren’t you afraid

718
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,580
I’d punish you for betrayal

719
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,300
by telling us about your lady’s attempt?

720
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,740
I wouldn’t dare.

721
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,540
I’d never betray

722
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,220
Madam and Miss Zhang

723
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,180
or do anything

724
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,180
to harm Your Grace.

725
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,860
But as their maid,

726
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,740
I really don’t know what to do.

727
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,620
Don’t be their maid then.

728
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,300
I can free you from them easily.

729
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,020
That’s too kind of you.

730
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,300
But over the years,

731
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,860
I’ve seen them

732
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,700
as my family.

733
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:06,780
Fine.

734
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,340
If she doesn’t cross the line,

735
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,540
there won’t be too big a trouble.

736
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,620
You didn’t have dinner, right?

737
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,540
Hey, try the moon pastry.

738
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,780
You’re going to love it.

739
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,020
Take a bite.

740
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,540
Thank you, Your Grace.

741
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,140
Thank you so much.

742
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,475
(Bamboo Sways in Wind)

743
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,620
Commandant Li, a toast to you.

744
00:28:35,025 --> 00:28:36,060
Thanks. Appreciated it.

745
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,600
Cheers.

746
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,620
Me too, Commandant Li.

747
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,620
Mr. Li,

748
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,500
my father isn’t young anymore.

749
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,540
Do you mind

750
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,500
if I drink

751
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,180
for him?

752
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,180
Like father, like son.

753
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,260
Supervisor Li,

754
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,620
I bet you can drink like your father.

755
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,820
A toast to you.

756
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,540
Alright,

757
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,140
everyone,

758
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,100
I toast you all on behalf of my father.

759
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,460
- Make yourselves at home.
- Thanks.

760
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,060
Sure.

761
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,300
Be careful, Young Master.

762
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,020
Wait for me.

763
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,300
I’ll be right back.

764
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,180
Forget it, Young Master.

765
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,100
You’re still injured.

766
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,740
Mr. Wei,

767
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,180
Miss Gao asks to see you.

768
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,380
I see.

769
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,620
I’ll take Young Master
to his room first.

770
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,180
She says it’s urgent.

771
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,100
I can take Young Master back.

772
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,540
Young Master... I...

773
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,300
Go. Go ahead.

774
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,300
You take me back.

775
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,140
Take care of him.

776
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,260
Is there a chance to see Duolan?

777
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,380
Where... Where am I?

778
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,020
Young Master Qian,

779
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,140
it’s your study.

780
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,225
You don’t recognize it?

781
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,980
No... not the study.

782
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,420
I’m going back to the West Courtyard.

783
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,820
Lie down, Young Master Qian.

784
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,820
There you go.

785
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,620
Lie down and take a nap.

786
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,060
Take me to the West Courtyard.

787
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:52,900
Young Master Qian...

788
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,660
West Courtyard...

789
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,220
You’re drunk.

790
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,500
Get some rest here.

791
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,420
I’ll have them look after you.

792
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,860
Miss! Miss!

793
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,620
You can’t do this!

794
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,020
You can’t do this to Her Grace!

795
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,300
Excuse me?

796
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,900
You’re making a mistake, Miss.

797
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,060
Who are you to judge me?

798
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,780
Go away!

799
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:32,275
Duolan!

800
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,740
Mr. Shao.

801
00:30:36,825 --> 00:30:37,500
Duolan,

802
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,540
I came to see you

803
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,180
and here you are.

804
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,020
Mr. Shao,

805
00:30:45,275 --> 00:30:46,820
I’m needed elsewhere.

806
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,700
Please excuse me.

807
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,700
Duolan!

808
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,260
Where’s Commandery Prince?

809
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,580
He hasn’t come back yet.

810
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,100
Isn’t he drinking with the guests?

811
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,260
What’s going on?

812
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,340
Wei Shu said

813
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,860
he had a servant take him back

814
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,420
and told you not to worry.

815
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,900
Oh, no!

816
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,700
Zhang Duolan must be
making a move on Li Qian.

817
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,740
Let’s go!

818
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,350
What?

819
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,500
We had a nice dinner.

820
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,380
It was great.

821
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:27,700
Hey,

822
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,780
there you are.

823
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,860
Let’s enjoy fireworks together.

824
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,260
- Fireworks?
- Yes.

825
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,025
That’s right.

826
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,500
Madam Zhang said

827
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,420
she paid a fortune

828
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,220
to put together a firework show

829
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,500
for us.

830
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,550
A firework show!

831
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,140
It’s a little something

832
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,780
to thank you for taking me
and my daughter in.

833
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,100
I’ve had them go to the front hall

834
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,540
to tell your husband and the others.

835
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,500
They’ll join us there.

836
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,500
If

837
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,140
we aren’t going to watch the show here,

838
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:51,825
where is it then?

839
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:52,460
I’m looking forward to it!

840
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,380
Your Grace,

841
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,620
you probably don’t know

842
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,660
that I’ve had an expert

843
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,100
come over and select

844
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,220
the best viewing spot.

845
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,580
Let’s go, Madam.

846
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,620
Sure.

847
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,860
I can’t wait to see it.

848
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,700
- Let’s go.
- Please.

849
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,700
- Come on.
- Let’s go.

850
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,340
Your Grace,

851
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,540
what about your husband?

852
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,100
He must be somewhere at home.

853
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,780
Let’s watch the show first.

854
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,600
Come on.

855
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,260
Oh.

856
00:32:12,475 --> 00:32:13,125
Alright.

857
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,220
This is it, Madam He.

858
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,225
- Here?
- Yes.

859
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:16,750
Come on.

860
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,420
I’m so excited

861
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,060
about the show.

862
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,300
Here’s spacious enough

863
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,780
for the best viewing experience.

864
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,700
Agreed.

865
00:32:23,706 --> 00:32:26,975
(Virtuous, Diligent, Pleasant and Quiet)

866
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,380
Madam Zhang,

867
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,660
isn’t there a firework show

868
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,820
for us to enjoy?

869
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,260
Let’s see it now.

870
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,380
Trust me.

871
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,380
You won’t

872
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,060
be disappointed.

873
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:36,980
Good.

874
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:39,820
Start now!

875
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,620
Shoot them off!

876
00:32:42,675 --> 00:32:43,350
I’m thrilled!

877
00:32:46,575 --> 00:32:47,660
Nothing.

878
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,060
What’s wrong?

879
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:49,900
Where are the fireworks?

880
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,820
Shoot them off!

881
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,700
Did he not hear it?

882
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,900
Do it now!

883
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,140
That can’t be happening!

884
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,980
Is everything alright, Your Grace?

885
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,300
What’s going on?

886
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,500
Is Li Qian inside?

887
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,220
What?

888
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,300
Where is he?

889
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,940
Could he be slacking off inside?

890
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,140
Madam Zhang,

891
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,620
this is a tiny courtyard

892
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,100
with roofs in all directions.

893
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,020
It might not be
the best place for fireworks.

894
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,780
Maybe they’re set up somewhere else.

895
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,540
No way!

896
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,540
He said

897
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,180
it’d be right here.

898
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,220
Father.

899
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:20,760
Yes?

900
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,260
I think

901
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,460
the backyard is better
to shoot off fireworks.

902
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
Why don’t we go there?

903
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,380
Here’s too crowded.

904
00:33:31,775 --> 00:33:34,020
Let’s go to the backyard

905
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,825
and enjoy them.

906
00:33:35,825 --> 00:33:36,600
That’d be great.

907
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:37,620
Sure. Let’s go.

908
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,100
The backyard is big

909
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,620
but close to the stable.

910
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,620
If the hay catches any sparks,

911
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,740
it may become a big fire.

912
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,340
I suggest

913
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,575
we watch it here.

914
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,220
Don’t! Look away!

915
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:52,860
What happened?

916
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,060
It’s not for girls!

917
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,377
How could this happen?

918
00:33:57,475 --> 00:33:58,499
Shame on them!

919
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,740
Congratulations, Madam Zhang!

920
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,060
That’s very generous of you.

921
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:07,900
Anyway,

922
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,220
what’s done is done.

923
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,180
They can’t undo it.

924
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,580
I guess

925
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:15,265
you’ll have to accept them.

926
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:16,250
Madam!

927
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,140
Mother...

928
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:23,220
Madam...

929
00:34:30,975 --> 00:34:31,700
Duolan!

930
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,700
It’s only been a few days.

931
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,220
Why is she avoiding me?

932
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,900
Does she mean...

933
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,020
to follow her?

934
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,380
Duolan,

935
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,340
the past few days seemed like years

936
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,460
when I didn’t see you.

937
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,420
Were you avoiding me

938
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,740
and breaking up with me?

939
00:34:59,050 --> 00:34:59,660
Duolan,

940
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,940
you’re the nicest

941
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,620
and the prettiest girl in the world.

942
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,550
How could you do this to me?

943
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,300
Yang,

944
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,180
I know

945
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,780
how much you love me,

946
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,940
but now

947
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,060
isn’t a good time for us to talk.

948
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,620
How about another day?

949
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,250
Just go. Go.

950
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,340
Go ahead.

951
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,100
No one else is here.

952
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,580
They’re all at the banquet.

953
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:27,555
Isn’t now the perfect timing?

954
00:35:29,425 --> 00:35:30,500
We really can’t do this.

955
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,620
Please leave.

956
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,260
Didn’t you lure me here?

957
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,420
Are you...?

958
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:37,860
I...

959
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,980
Are you expecting someone else?

960
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,540
Is he inside?

961
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,780
Of course not!

962
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:45,980
No way!

963
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,300
Then

964
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,820
it’s just you and me.

965
00:35:50,575 --> 00:35:51,940
Wait, Yang...

966
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,700
Where’s Li Qian?

967
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,900
You...

968
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,740
Duolan,

969
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,860
I fell for you

970
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,740
the moment we met at Qi’s Mansion.

971
00:36:06,725 --> 00:36:07,540
Our encounter

972
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:09,935
is the best gift that I’ve ever had.

973
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,620
Will you

974
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,020
marry me?

975
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,220
Is this heaven’s will?

976
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,460
That I shouldn’t

977
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,740
marry Li Qian,

978
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,540
but Yang?

979
00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:33,460
Madam,

980
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,620
Duolan and I love each other

981
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,500
and we’ve made the promise together.

982
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,180
Please marry her to me.

983
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,700
I’ll come and propose to her tomorrow.

984
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,540
Mother,

985
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,020
please

986
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,980
give us your blessing.

987
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,260
I...

988
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,380
Madam Zhang is right.

989
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,220
What’s done is done.

990
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,180
They can’t undo it.

991
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,940
I guess you’ll have to accept them.

992
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:06,980
In this case,

993
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,420
I can’t wait to attend

994
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,260
Mr. Shao and Miss Zhang’s wedding.

995
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,100
Mother!

996
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,780
Get up!

997
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,940
Thank you, Mother.

998
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,940
Congratulations, Madam Zhang!

999
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,300
Yes. Congratulations!

1000
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,420
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations, Madam Zhang!

1001
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,260
Look how beautiful they are!

1002
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,725
They look so nice!

1003
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,420
- They’re pretty!
- This is great!

1004
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,950
They’re up in the air!

1005
00:37:42,475 --> 00:37:43,050
You...

1006
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,700
How come you’re here?

1007
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,380
Where were you?

1008
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,940
Servants in our mansion

1009
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,740
would never disobey my order,

1010
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,820
but the one with me earlier

1011
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,900
insisted on

1012
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,500
taking me to the study.

1013
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,020
I got suspicious,

1014
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,500
so I went to Father’s study to nap

1015
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,300
after he left.

1016
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,540
You could sense danger from afar

1017
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,460
and dodged a hit.

1018
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,660
That’s nothing
compared with your strategy

1019
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,060
and planning.

1020
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,660
Your pot of flowers

1021
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,060
brought together

1022
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,380
two lovebirds.

1023
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:19,025
Wait.

1024
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,660
How did you know that was me?

1025
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,140
My heart and soul belong to you.

1026
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,020
How could I not know?

1027
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,260
I’m your husband.

1028
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,220
Speaking of which,

1029
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,700
I got to give it to you.

1030
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,020
I knew you could

1031
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,540
get a pot of Fiery Silk in a breeze,

1032
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,620
but I never expected

1033
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,140
that you’d give that to Shao Yang.

1034
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,060
I noticed

1035
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,700
Shao Yang’s feelings for Miss Zhang

1036
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,780
back at Dong’s Mansion,

1037
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,180
so I gave him that pot of flowers

1038
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,820
as a tool

1039
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,780
to help him get closer to that girl.

1040
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,660
Not just that.

1041
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,380
You also helped Miss Zhang with her look

1042
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,980
by giving her expensive jewelry.

1043
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,220
That’d sure give her an advantage.

1044
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,540
After all that I’ve done,

1045
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,260
do you think I’m bad?

1046
00:39:12,925 --> 00:39:14,180
I love it.

1047
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,020
You love bad women?

1048
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:19,625
No.

1049
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,940
I love it when you do everything

1050
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,180
to show you’re possessive of me.

1051
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,780
I love it
when you think of me all the time

1052
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,660
and put me in your heart.

1053
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,380
Knock it off!

1054
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,500
I’m not possessive!

1055
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:37,860
Uh...

1056
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,980
Where’s Liuhe?

1057
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,220
I almost forgot about her.

1058
00:39:42,575 --> 00:39:43,375
Hey!

1059
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,460
Liuhe!

1060
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,420
Liuhe!

1061
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,220
Liuhe, wake up!

1062
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,660
Why are you here?

1063
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,820
- Qingke!
- Get up!

1064
00:40:00,075 --> 00:40:00,660
Come.

1065
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,140
Oh, no, Qingke!

1066
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,340
Miss Zhang is...

1067
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:06,220
is going to...

1068
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,300
Relax.

1069
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,180
Commandery Prince is fine.

1070
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,850
Miss Zhang and Shao Yang
are now engaged.

1071
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,940
She and Mr. Shao?

1072
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:14,625
Yes.

1073
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,180
Then...

1074
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,220
What now?

1075
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,820
She’ll force me to be his concubine.

1076
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,060
What should I do?

1077
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,100
Liuhe,

1078
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,060
are you still

1079
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,500
going to be her maid?

1080
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:27,940
I...

1081
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,660
Make the decision now,

1082
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,300
or I’ll ask Miss Zhang
to make it for you.

1083
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,220
Your Grace!

1084
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,020
(Bamboos Never Bend)
Come, everyone!

1085
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,020
(Bamboos Never Bend)
No wonder my last month’s salary

1086
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,180
disappeared mysteriously!

1087
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,980
You’re a thief!

1088
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,500
How dare you steal from the Li Family?

1089
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,260
Please! It wasn’t me!

1090
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,180
I swear I didn’t do it!

1091
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,980
(Erudition)
I caught you red-handed!

1092
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,780
(Erudition)
Don’t you deny it!

1093
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,380
I...

1094
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:53,580
What’s going on?

1095
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,900
- Madam, Miss.
- What happened?

1096
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,700
Is this how your family

1097
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,540
trains your maid

1098
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,180
by teaching her to steal from us?

1099
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,700
Hadn’t I needed firewood earlier,

1100
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,940
- I wouldn’t have found out!
- No way!

1101
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:04,260
- Really?
- She seemed honest.

1102
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,300
I caught her with the money!

1103
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,340
Mother!

1104
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,860
You dirty lowlife!

1105
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,675
Is this how you pay me back
for keeping you?

1106
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,060
Duolan is going to
marry you to her fiancé.

1107
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,940
How could you be so evil?

1108
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,260
Madam, I’m innocent!

1109
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,325
You must trust me!

1110
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:22,260
I didn’t do it!

1111
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,380
- Madam!
- Liuhe,

1112
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,300
what were you thinking?

1113
00:41:26,175 --> 00:41:27,820
Were you going to steal money

1114
00:41:28,175 --> 00:41:30,460
to bribe the Shao Family’s servants
for yourself?

1115
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,200
Miss Zhang.

1116
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,940
Liuhe is caught stealing money.

1117
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,650
- So,
- Really?

1118
00:41:32,725 --> 00:41:33,580
what are you going to do about it?

1119
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,780
We...

1120
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,220
What do you propose?

1121
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:43,100
According to our family rules,

1122
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,540
maids make mistakes...

1123
00:41:44,725 --> 00:41:45,340
Yes.

1124
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,820
Because they aren’t taught well.

1125
00:41:47,525 --> 00:41:48,540
By that logic,

1126
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,060
- you’re guilty of
- She’s a thief!

1127
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,820
harboring a thief.

1128
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,340
That’s

1129
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,060
utter nonsense!

1130
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,700
Duolan has nothing to do with her deed.

1131
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,660
Why should we be responsible

1132
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,980
for her crime?

1133
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:01,460
She’s scary!

1134
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,780
Madam, I’m innocent!

1135
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,220
Please speak for me!

1136
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,660
- I didn’t do it!
- Get lost!

1137
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,580
Stay away from me!

1138
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,220
You’re no longer our maid.

1139
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:11,075
Very well.

1140
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,740
Guards!

1141
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,740
Drag this thief out,

1142
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,260
flog her 20 times

1143
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,100
and kick her out!

1144
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,020
- Yes!
- Yes!

1145
00:42:18,025 --> 00:42:19,049
20 times!

1146
00:42:20,425 --> 00:42:21,300
Madam, Miss,

1147
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,300
take care.

1148
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,375
(Bamboos Never Bend)

1149
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,740
Just like that,

1150
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,300
Liuhe is free.

1151
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:36,380
Duolan.

1152
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:39,000
She’s gorgeous!

1153
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,460
Let me see.

1154
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,580
What’s that noise?

1155
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,180
Nothing.

1156
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,060
Go back!

1157
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,940
Come again tomorrow!

1158
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,740
No!

1159
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,060
We want to see the bride, too.

1160
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,775
Let us see her.

1161
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,700
Yes!

1162
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,100
- What’s going on?
- Let us see her!

1163
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,620
Please!

1164
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,020
We can’t wait to see her!

1165
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,020
My lady.

1166
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,140
Hello.

1167
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:02,900
Hi.

1168
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,300
She’s beautiful!

1169
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,380
Who are they?

1170
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,500
Why is there a big crowd?

1171
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,060
Uh... they’re my concubines.

1172
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,020
She doesn’t know about us.

1173
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,020
- I guess not.
- She doesn’t.

1174
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:14,820
Shao Yang,

1175
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,500
why didn’t you tell me

1176
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,260
you had concubines

1177
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,050
enough to fill up a house?

1178
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,075
She’s got a temper!

1179
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,580
Now you know.

1180
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,220
Don’t worry.

1181
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,180
You’re still my only wife.

1182
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:22,820
They’re...

1183
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,940
They’re to serve you.

1184
00:43:24,575 --> 00:43:25,380
Why are you still here?

1185
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:25,940
Go back!

1186
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,620
How dare you!

1187
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,100
Are you alright, darling?

1188
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,060
Darling!

1189
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,620
Did you get hurt, darling?

1190
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,380
This door should’ve been fixed long ago.

1191
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,180
I’m fine.

1192
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:35,775
Let go of me!

1193
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:38,460
Duolan! Duolan!

1194
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,940
Duolan!

1195
00:43:40,975 --> 00:43:42,025
- You big fat liar!
- She’s fuming.

1196
00:43:42,025 --> 00:43:44,620
Duolan! Duolan! Duolan!

1197
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,300
- Calm down, Duolan!
- You cheating bastard!

1198
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,700
How dare you lie to me!

1199
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,220
Duolan,

1200
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,380
we’re already married.

1201
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,620
Just let it go.

1202
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,420
My family is struggling

1203
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,420
only because the money we loaned

1204
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,460
hasn’t been paid back.

1205
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,460
But

1206
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,260
with all your dowries,

1207
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,500
we’ll be fine, won’t we?

1208
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,820
Shut up!

1209
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,780
You filthy swindler!

1210
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,980
I... I... I’ll strangle you to death!

1211
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,020
Go to hell!

1212
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,540
I... I’ll kill you!

1213
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,660
- Duolan! Duolan!
- Darling! Darling!

1214
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,225
Jerk! Bastard!

1215
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,060
Enough, you shrew!

1216
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,420
How dare you blame me!

1217
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,740
- Isn’t your family extremely wealthy?
- Liar!

1218
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,940
Aren’t you rich?

1219
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,420
What... what’s this?

1220
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,625
She lied about being rich.

1221
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:29,300
Yes!

1222
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,980
Don’t change the subject!

1223
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,780
You fooled me

1224
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,480
and you’re calling me names!

1225
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,260
I’ll smash your head, Shao Yang!

1226
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,275
Darling!

1227
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:41,020
- I’ll strangle you to death!
- Darling!

1228
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,980
Darling! Stop!

1229
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,940
I’ll whack you!

1230
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,220
You mean the two of us,

1231
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:48,980
you and I

1232
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,580
are going to be parents?

1233
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,220
Physician Wang took my pulse

1234
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,900
and said I was over four weeks pregnant.

1235
00:44:58,575 --> 00:44:59,460
I’m going to be a father!

1236
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,620
Me! A father!

1237
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,300
I’m going to be a father, Su!

1238
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,420
We’re having a baby, darling!

1239
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:05,940
Why are you so overjoyed

1240
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,060
at my pregnancy?

1241
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,140
It’s our baby!

1242
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,420
How could I not be happy?

1243
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,500
I had a dream the other day

1244
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,660
that an immortal

1245
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,340
gave me koi fish.

1246
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,740
That explains it now.

1247
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,700
This baby is a gift from heaven.

1248
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,260
No wonder Mother asked me

1249
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,100
if I had unusual dreams

1250
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,780
about fruits

1251
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,300
or animals.

1252
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,180
But you were the one

1253
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,740
having the baby dream.

1254
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,980
Su, you know what?

1255
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:33,900
I’ve decided on the name

1256
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,140
of our baby.

1257
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,580
It’s Cao Nianci.

1258
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,380
Nianci?

1259
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,180
Whether it’s a boy or a girl,

1260
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,620
I want our child to be

1261
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,060
as tolerant and kind as you

1262
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:46,820
as the name suggests.

1263
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,140
Take a good look.

1264
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,075
Read it carefully!

1265
00:46:06,075 --> 00:46:06,575
Yes.

1266
00:46:06,575 --> 00:46:07,615
Is there anyone you like?

1267
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:08,580
If not,

1268
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,860
I’ll find more for you.

1269
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,780
Mother, I don’t get it.

1270
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,180
What must I get married anyway?

1271
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,220
Look at Miss Zhang.

1272
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,420
Without her,

1273
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,260
I’d be the laughing stock

1274
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,380
in the city.

1275
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,260
That’s not true.

1276
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,580
Just because Shao Yang is bad

1277
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,740
doesn’t mean

1278
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,540
there aren’t good men out there.

1279
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,300
I’ve handpicked them for you.

1280
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,700
Take another look.

1281
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,180
Mother, wasn’t it strange

1282
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,380
that Miaorong spoke highly of Shao Yang

1283
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,300
and she urged you

1284
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,740
to marry me to him?

1285
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,300
Did she not know his true colors?

1286
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:50,780
You have a point.

1287
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,460
When you put it like that,

1288
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,660
it does seem weird.

1289
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,500
Hadn’t Miss Zhang popped out,

1290
00:46:57,325 --> 00:46:58,380
I could’ve

1291
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,580
ruined your life.

1292
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,275
Yes.

1293
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:05,780
Who is it?

1294
00:47:05,975 --> 00:47:06,600
Madam,

1295
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,260
I’m here to pay respects.

1296
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:09,780
We were just talking about her

1297
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,620
and there she is.

1298
00:47:10,825 --> 00:47:11,425
Well,

1299
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,420
I need to confront her.

1300
00:47:13,975 --> 00:47:14,940
Wait, Mother!

1301
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,220
What... what do you have on her?

1302
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,340
You have no proof.

1303
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,620
If she said she didn’t know,

1304
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,980
could you refute her?

1305
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:23,380
Never mind.

1306
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,540
I’ll just ignore her.

1307
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,740
Go back.

1308
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,580
From now on,

1309
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,180
you don’t need to come again.

1310
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,780
I don’t deserve your visit.

1311
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:36,980
Madam,

1312
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,580
I won’t take up your time then.

1313
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,180
Good day.

1314
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:47,250
(Keep Good Moral Character)

1315
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,100
Madam,

1316
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,620
Her Grace is here to pay respects.

1317
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:52,925
Her Grace is here.

1318
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,340
Coming!

1319
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:58,750
There you are.

1320
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,740
So good to see you!

1321
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:00,275
Dongdong.

1322
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,260
Mother.

1323
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:01,940
How are you?

1324
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:02,500
I’m good.

1325
00:48:02,575 --> 00:48:03,220
Come on in.

1326
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:03,780
We’re waiting for you.

1327
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,325
Come.
