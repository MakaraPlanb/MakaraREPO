Report!

Bad news! Update from the front!

29
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,450
Previsions Troops were captured

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,250
on their way to the encampment.

31
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,440
Heavy Armor Troops suffered
heavy causalities in the ambush!

32
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,360
Breathe!

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,279
One, two, three!

34
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,360
Disinfect his wound.

35
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,199
You’re fine.

36
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,919
Go get water now!

37
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,399
I got you.

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,600
I need food!

39
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,199
Have some.

40
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,000
Supervisor Li.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,800
You take it from here.

42
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,679
Go easy.

43
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,720
What’s up?

44
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,080
Regent Zhao gathered his troops

45
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,160
to attack the enemies at night

46
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,639
to get revenge for our losses.

47
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,600
When did they leave?

48
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,679
Over an hour ago.

49
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,520
Hang in there!

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,320
Where are you going?

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,240
Qing Tai is too treacherous and scheming

52
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,520
for Zhao Xiao to battle.

53
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,639
Mass our men to go with me.

54
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,039
And ask Mr. Jin

55
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,000
for backup.

56
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,425
You could get killed

57
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:36,600
before getting Zhao Xiao out.

58
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,759
I can’t sit on my hands

59
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,960
while our soldiers die for nothing!

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,325
I have to give it a shot

61
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,525
no matter what!

62
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,275
I’m not going to thank you for this.

63
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,359
Come!

64
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,040
Zhao Xiao,

65
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,799
this is it for us.

66
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,000
From now on,

67
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:53,650
you and I

68
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,925
- are even.
- Li Qian!

69
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,040
Are you alright, Your Grace?

70
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,700
I can’t be at ease.

71
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,950
I have a bad feeling.

72
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:24,200
You’ve been holding on to that frame

73
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,239
and doing needlework all day.

74
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,480
You could use some rest and relaxation.

75
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,200
Don’t worry. Nothing will happen.

76
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,000
I hope so.

77
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,119
Hurry up!

78
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,250
Mu’an’s reinforcements are on the way.

79
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:51,275
Stab those who can still breathe.

80
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,800
Take away all their weapons.

81
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,480
This area is clear.

82
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:11,799
No survivors.

83
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:26,519
Father! Father! Father!

84
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,399
- Dongdong!
- Father!

85
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:28,000
Father!

86
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,600
Be careful!

87
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,440
What happened?

88
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,559
Mr. Jin...

89
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,075
Mr. Jin arrived late.

90
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:32,975
What?

91
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,559
Xuanjia Battalion...

92
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:35,599
Xuanjia Battalion...

93
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,479
What about them?

94
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,919
What happened?

95
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,650
Say it!

96
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,679
They were all killed.

97
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:46,760
What?

98
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,919
All killed?

99
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,239
Li Qian is highly skilled.
I’m sure he’s fine.

100
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,320
Master, Madam, Your Grace,

101
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,575
General Yun Lin asked to see you
and said it’s urgent.

102
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,025
- Master...
- Send him in.

103
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,200
Commandment Li.

104
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,559
Yun Lin, you serve in Xuanjia Battalion.

105
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,799
They weren’t killed.

106
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,239
Li Qian is still alive, right?

107
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:20,080
The enemies stabbed all our men again

108
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,440
just to be safe after the battle.

109
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,039
I survived by pure luck.

110
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,760
And I looked everywhere

111
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,599
without seeing

112
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,640
Supervisor Li or Regent Zhao’s body.

113
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,359
They didn’t return to the camp either.

114
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,239
No body? Then Qian must still be alive!

115
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,599
Yun Lin,

116
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,799
please take me to find him!

117
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,719
With more help,

118
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,425
we can turn the battlefield upside down

119
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:45,760
and get him back.

120
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,520
That’s why I’m here.

121
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,525
Did you hear that, Uncle Li?

122
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,200
Qian must be out there somewhere

123
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,640
waiting for our rescue.

124
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,960
Uncle Li,

125
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,479
give me as many people as you have.

126
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,359
I promise

127
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,960
that I will

128
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,000
bring Qian back intact.

129
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,320
Sure.

130
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:10,080
Father,

131
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,280
I know Li Qian.

132
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,239
He wouldn’t still be there
waiting for death.

133
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,200
General Yun didn’t find him

134
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,880
because he had already left.

135
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,840
The most dangerous place

136
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,960
can be the safest.

137
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:21,919
On that note,

138
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,239
my guess is that he went to

139
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:25,679
Yunyang in Yongqing.

140
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,880
We should go there.

141
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,599
You’re indeed different, Your Grace.

142
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,719
Yunyang? Seriously?

143
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,799
I admire you for being shockingly calm,

144
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,559
but have you considered our feelings?

145
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,520
Your Grace, you’re probably too lofty

146
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,450
to care about Qian’s safety,

147
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,050
but we do!

148
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,679
He was last seen at the battlefield,

149
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,559
so we should start from there.

150
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,559
Yunyang is the capital of Yongqing.

151
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:50,799
Why on earth

152
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,640
would he go into enemy territory?

153
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,599
Li Qian is my husband.

154
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,719
I know him well and I trust him.

155
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,159
Our priority is to find him.

156
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,719
If tears could get him back,

157
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,239
I’d let them run like floods.

158
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,719
If you’re eager to find him as we are,

159
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,760
why are you drawing us to Yunyang?

160
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,679
That could be a total waste of time

161
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,119
holding us back from locating Qian.

162
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:15,799
He could be in danger as we speak...

163
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,039
Well,

164
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,559
Miaorong,

165
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:22,359
you and Yun Lin go find Li Qian

166
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,080
with my men.

167
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,679
Thank you, Uncle Li.

168
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:26,960
He’ll be back safe and sound.

169
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,559
I give you my word.

170
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,239
Let’s go.

171
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,599
Good day.

172
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,039
Your Grace,

173
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:37,760
Miaorong and the others will find him.

174
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,359
My son is always tough.

175
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:41,440
I don’t think

176
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,559
he’d die that easily.

177
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,960
Xiao...

178
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,239
died in Jinxi? How’s that possible?

179
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,880
It’s been confirmed.

180
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,799
Young Master misjudged the situation.

181
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,000
Xuanjia Battalion was wiped out.

182
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,440
Go to Jinxi

183
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,520
and get to the bottom of it!

184
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,479
I demand to see him

185
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,440
or his...

186
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,320
I...

187
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:16,599
I understand.

188
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:19,280
I, Zhao Zhong,
will bring Young Master back!

189
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,919
Useless! A bunch of idiots!

190
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:28,725
With so many troops at the border,

191
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,440
none of them could win a battle!

192
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,080
Please be appeased, Your Majesty.

193
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,880
They served our state

194
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,000
at the cost of their lives.

195
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,400
Look,

196
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,039
Young Master Zhao and Commandery Prince

197
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,359
were both killed on duty.

198
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,119
They died

199
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,320
for us.

200
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,280
I...

201
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,320
shall reward them for their sacrifices.

202
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,559
Go

203
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,440
tell everything
to Grand Empress Dowager.

204
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,080
That’ll be too much
for Her Highness to handle.

205
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:11,559
Still, she needs to know.

206
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,200
After all,

207
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,679
Baoning needs support
from her family now.

208
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:20,239
Yes.

209
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,200
Is that true?

210
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,520
Jin Haitao’s report is sitting
on His Majesty’s table.

211
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,359
I wouldn’t dare to lie.

212
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Fangling,

213
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,719
send our people to Bingzhou

214
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,440
to gather everything they can find.

215
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:44,679
I want Baoning back immediately!

216
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,559
Baoning.

217
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,359
Dongdong?

218
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,479
It’s late. Where were you?

219
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,000
I went to the camp to ask around.

220
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,200
But

221
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,440
there’s still no news about Qian.

222
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,840
Regent Zhao went missing, too.

223
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,960
I’m sure Qian is still alive.

224
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:14,850
Me too.

225
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,719
Are you leaving to find him?

226
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,440
I’ll be straight with you.

227
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,919
He wasn’t in the camp

228
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,119
or on the battlefield,

229
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,760
which only means one thing.

230
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,239
He must be in Yongqing,

231
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,280
so I’m going to Yunyang.

232
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,599
Alone?

233
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,640
If others knew,

234
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,559
they wouldn’t let me go.

235
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,960
There’s no time to lose.

236
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
I must go.

237
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,200
Hey,

238
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,359
take me with you.

239
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:43,719
Give that to me.

240
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:46,559
Let’s go.

241
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,475
(Li’s Mansion)

242
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,239
Sir, Madam, thanks for your hospitality,

243
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,159
but I’m here

244
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,400
with Grand Empress Dowager’s edict

245
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,159
and I really hope to see Her Grace.

246
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,280
Please

247
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,239
let Her Grace out now.

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,075
- Well...
- She...

249
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:17,800
Yes?

250
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,640
She’s... still in bed.

251
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:26,354
Oh.

252
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:29,559
Eunuch Zhang.

253
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,880
Her Grace isn’t too well lately.

254
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,039
You can leave a message to me.

255
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,520
I’ll convey it to her.

256
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,280
Good to see you, Miss Qingke.

257
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,840
I’ll be honest with you then.

258
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:53,100
Her Highness is aware of the bad news

259
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
and she’s concerned about Her Grace

260
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,960
and wants her back in the palace.

261
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,080
I thank Her Highness
on behalf of Her Grace,

262
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,559
but the situation isn’t that bad.

263
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,760
Commandery Prince is missing.

264
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,960
He might still be alive for all we know.

265
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,400
You know how much he means to Her Grace.

266
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,679
She’s not going anywhere
until he comes back.

267
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,440
So she won’t leave with you.

268
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,719
Missing is so much better than dead.

269
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,925
Commandery Prince is blessed.

270
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:26,080
I’m certain that he’ll be fine.

271
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,950
Her Grace is too worried to eat properly

272
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,150
which makes her weak.

273
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,350
I’m afraid she can’t be here.

274
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,520
I trust you and tell you
about her condition.

275
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,050
I understand.

276
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,840
Her Highness’s concern would grow

277
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,799
if she learned about that.

278
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,775
Don’t worry, Miss Qingke.

279
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,159
It’s bad enough
that I can’t help with anything.

280
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,320
All I can do is to keep

281
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,440
unnecessary news from Her Highness

282
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,799
who’s feeling bad enough already.

283
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,679
Miss Qingke,

284
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,919
please take good care of Her Grace.

285
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,200
Sir, Madam,

286
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,959
I’m going back

287
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,925
to report to Her Highness

288
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:10,400
that Commandery Prince isn’t dead

289
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,719
and Her Grace is fine.

290
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,000
Thank you.

291
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,450
- Thank you, Eunuch Zhang.
- Appreciated.

292
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,640
Let me show you out.

293
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,365
Please, Eunuch Zhang.

294
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,275
Thank you so much for everything.

295
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:22,200
This...

296
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,880
Just a little something. Please take it.

297
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,920
Thank you!

298
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,920
You did us a huge favor!

299
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:31,239
If Her Highness learned about the truth,

300
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,680
our family would be doomed!

301
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,000
Her Grace wouldn’t want
Her Highness to worry,

302
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:39,425
so I covered for her.

303
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,050
I know.

304
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,040
Now...

305
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,040
I just hope

306
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,839
she’ll come back soon safe and sound.

307
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:48,239
- She will.
- If she’s back alive,

308
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,000
everything will be fine.

309
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
If... if not...

310
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,520
I’ll go with her!

311
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,920
Please don’t say that!

312
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,439
She will come back!

313
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:03,199
I know she will.

314
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:06,375
(Yunyang City)

315
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,479
Finally, we’ve arrived!

316
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,319
Thank heaven!

317
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,640
Go.

318
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:12,719
Show me your pass.

319
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,160
We lost it when fleeing our home.

320
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
No pass, no entry!

321
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,239
Go away!

322
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,075
Are you alright?

323
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:22,000
He’s too sick!

324
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,599
Yes.

325
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,239
Can’t he let them in?

326
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,040
Let them in.

327
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,439
A little sympathy here!

328
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,839
My boss is severely ill.

329
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,079
Let us in,

330
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,359
or would you rather

331
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,280
see him die here?

332
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,079
Poor soul! Without the war,

333
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,199
we wouldn’t have
fled our home and came here.

334
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,319
Right. Don’t you have a heart?

335
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,439
How could you do this?

336
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:39,599
Off you go.

337
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Show him the pass.

338
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,950
You’re a genius.

339
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,000
Your fake illness got us in so easily.

340
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,920
You aren’t faking it?

341
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,959
Come here.

342
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,800
Have some water.

343
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,800
Look at you.

344
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,800
You’re well-cared for and fragile.

345
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:15,550
I shouldn’t have let you come.

346
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,675
He’s my husband. I must come.

347
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,280
What now?

348
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,900
I can’t afford to lose you

349
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:27,199
before finding Qian.

350
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,599
Let me take a break and I’ll be fine.

351
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,750
I’ll go pick up some food

352
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,425
and gather information.

353
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:40,920
Sure.

354
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:47,760
We can sit for a few more minutes,

355
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,040
(Announcement)

356
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,119
and go back on the road.

357
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:51,280
Baoning,

358
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:52,560
come here.

359
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:54,900
I’ve asked around.

360
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:57,675
They say most of the injured
are in the Reserve Area.

361
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,000
Could Qian be there?

362
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,000
It’s possible.

363
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,475
But that place is huge
and heavily guarded.

364
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,599
Not everyone can get in.

365
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,880
What to do?

366
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:10,825
Move! Step aside!

367
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,750
Go away!

368
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,275
What the...?

369
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:16,855
Let them be.

370
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:23,959
(Army Recruiting)

371
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:24,439
Let’s go.

372
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:26,275
(Weapon Battalion is recruiting.)

373
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,075
(Those of you ready to
serve the state are welcome.)

374
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:33,000
Read it. What’s it about?

375
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,479
They’re recruiting.

376
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:34,319
I have an idea.

377
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,119
Recruiting soldiers?

378
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:11,800
What to do?

379
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,640
No sign of him on the battlefield

380
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,119
or in the villages along the way.

381
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,975
Qian,

382
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,560
did you really go to Yunyang?

383
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,040
Miss Gao,

384
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,160
I’ve started to think
Her Grace is right.

385
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:38,800
Stand straight!

386
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,560
As members of the Weapon Battalion,

387
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,560
you must be extremely careful!

388
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,375
One mistake

389
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,479
and the weapon you made is ruined,

390
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,880
the rest of us will have to suffer, too,

391
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,479
understand?

392
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,125
Commander, it’s him!

393
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,319
What are you doing?

394
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,959
Who are you to lecture new members?

395
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:05,025
Look what crap you made!

396
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:07,150
Your crossbow is terrible!

397
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,325
The arrow aimed at the enemy

398
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:11,225
hit our own man.

399
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,175
And here you are having them

400
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
mass-produce such trash

401
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,760
for us to deliver.

402
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:20,400
Do you want all of us

403
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,225
to be killed?

404
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:23,239
My...

405
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:25,925
My bow was fine.

406
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,400
It was them.

407
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:28,760
They botched them up.

408
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:29,575
Ask them about it!

409
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:31,300
This is the prototype you made.

410
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,680
I’m going to stand there

411
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,725
and see if you can shoot me with it.

412
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,850
They have such a craftsman here, too.

413
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:40,760
I need to win his trust

414
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,239
to be on the inside.

415
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,275
The high-ups kept rushing us.

416
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,150
This is the best I could do.

417
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,650
You’re useless

418
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,475
and overconfident!

419
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,225
I could’ve asked for an extension,

420
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:05,680
but you gave them your word
without thinking.

421
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:06,599
We’re supposed to deliver

422
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,575
this batch of crossbows in three days.

423
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:11,319
Now tell me,

424
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,640
if we turn in this batch of bows,

425
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,150
how am I going to explain myself?

426
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:19,280
Just say

427
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,719
the workers and handymen made a mistake.

428
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,000
Kill them to make things go away.

429
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,359
We’ve got tons of new blood anyway.

430
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,520
Is that your plan all along

431
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,400
that let others die for your mistake?

432
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,160
Bastard!

433
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,319
Sorry.

434
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,160
I didn’t know it’d be so off.

435
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,640
I... I didn’t mean to shoot you.

436
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,920
That’s fine.

437
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,880
A quick death would be too easy on him.

438
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,719
I feel sorry

439
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:52,199
for the rest of my people

440
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,680
that they’ll have to die for an idiot.

441
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,850
How could I gain his trust

442
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,020
without making weapons
for the enemies?

443
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:04,414
Can I have a try here?

444
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,475
But I want something in return.

445
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,800
If it works,

446
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:09,119
I want to be your apprentice.

447
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,719
No problem.

448
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,439
That newbie

449
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:36,640
bit off more than he could chew, too.

450
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,160
He took the job

451
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:39,880
without knowing his limits.

452
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,680
How long have you been with me?

453
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,000
Three years.

454
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,119
Those three years

455
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,880
didn’t make you step forward

456
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,000
when the crossbow needed to be fixed.

457
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,959
At least, he has the courage to try.

458
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,520
That’s way above your level already.

459
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,479
As for the result,

460
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,880
it’s up to heaven.

461
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,500
If you took me in as your apprentice,

462
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,199
I’d learn a lot

463
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,880
and be able to help you now.

464
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,119
Rujia,

465
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,760
certain things can’t be forced.

466
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,680
I would’ve done so long ago

467
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,239
if you had such talent.

468
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,400
What have you found?

469
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,719
The low accuracy

470
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:33,359
is mostly because of the scope,

471
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,319
but the deviation is too big.

472
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:36,439
Adjusting the scope alone

473
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:37,719
is of little use.

474
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,959
I suggest we deepen the flight groove,

475
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:41,800
fit the bow into it,

476
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,599
aim with the adjusted scope

477
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:45,280
and keep the bow tip fixed.

478
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,920
That way,
the accuracy will be about right.

479
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:48,175
I see.

480
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:51,239
Deepen the flight groove
and keep the tip fixed.

481
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,160
The bows will still look almost the same

482
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,760
only with great accuracy.

483
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:56,560
Good.

484
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,640
We’ll be able to

485
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,719
deliver the crossbows on time.

486
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,850
The deepened flight groove
improves the accuracy

487
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,825
but increases the resistance
and shortens the range.

488
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,079
They still can’t harm our people.

489
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:11,760
Son,

490
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,839
what’s your name?

491
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,725
Call me Aning.

492
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,199
Would you like

493
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,719
to be my apprentice?

494
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,079
That’d be my honor, Master.

495
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,560
Have a look!

496
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,520
They’re hot!

497
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,900
Freshly baked!

498
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,920
Take a look!

499
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,479
Here you are.

500
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,079
Thank you.

501
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:42,160
Come.

502
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:46,160
Take a seat.

503
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,719
How did it go?

504
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Did you find Qian’s trace?

505
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,560
As a new face in the Weapon Battalion,

506
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,680
I couldn’t snoop around.

507
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,880
But if Qian is really in the city,

508
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:59,920
the Reserve Area is his best hideout.

509
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:01,239
We’ll find him sooner or later.

510
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:05,280
Can’t I go with you?

511
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,160
I can’t

512
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,800
leave you there alone

513
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,959
with a bunch of men.

514
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:10,959
You better not.

515
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,439
With you outside,

516
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,839
if anything happens on the inside,

517
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,319
we can work together from both sides.

518
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,560
Be very careful.

519
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,400
I will.

520
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,119
Right now, I’m the apprentice

521
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,319
of the Commander
of the Weapon Battalion.

522
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,239
I’ll see what I can do.

523
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,225
Alright.

524
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,119
Rujia,

525
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,599
you’re such a loser

526
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,560
that you don’t get to

527
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,119
call Commander Siqin “Master”

528
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,040
after being his lackey for three years.

529
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,280
But look at him.

530
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,800
He succeeded right after he came

531
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:45,239
and gained access

532
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:46,280
to Commander Siqin’s arsenal.

533
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,239
That’s true.

534
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,400
Now,

535
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,520
he’s exploiting his status

536
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,959
to hang around

537
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,880
and lay back all day.

538
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,560
As envious as you are,

539
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,000
he doesn’t even talk to us

540
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,839
as if

541
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:04,319
we can bite or something.

542
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,479
I know, right?

543
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,520
If he thinks he’s above us,

544
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:10,560
we should send him a message.

545
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,439
Li Chian, Li Chian,

546
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:14,400
get up and work!

547
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,000
Li Chian!

548
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,040
Wake up! Back to work!

549
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,119
Leave me alone!

550
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,280
Stand up.

551
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,719
Who’s Li Qian?

552
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,160
- Mr. Aning.
- Mr. Aning.

553
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,725
I... I’m Li Chian.

554
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,560
C-H-I-A-N.

555
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,359
I’m so sorry, Mr. Aning.

556
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,280
I stayed up too late last night,

557
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,560
- Fine. Whatever.
- so I...

558
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,959
Please spare me!

559
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:36,680
Get up.

560
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,599
That was close!

561
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,719
Why didn’t you wake me up?

562
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:39,959
I tried,

563
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:40,800
but you ignored me.

564
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:41,560
But...

565
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:45,599
Zhao, don’t slack off.

566
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,079
Mr. Aning is here for inspection.

567
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,280
Don’t get caught.

568
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,599
Mr. Aning?

569
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,479
You probably don’t know.

570
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:53,359
He’s short but talented

571
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:55,079
and Commander Siqin’s new apprentice

572
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,400
and new favorite.

573
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,950
I doubt a big shot man like him

574
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,520
would pay attention to us handymen.

575
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,760
Forget it.

576
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,880
Let him be. Let’s go back to work.

577
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,959
Come on. Let’s go.

578
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,359
He’s rude.

579
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,359
Are you sure?

580
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
I give you my word.

581
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,680
Trust me, a small bite

582
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,119
will make him cry

583
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,650
and storm out, naked.

584
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
Good. If it works,

585
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,239
your help won’t be forgotten.

586
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:30,760
No big deal.

587
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,800
No. This isn’t the right time or place

588
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:09,599
to play the hero.

589
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:19,599
Go away! Go away!

590
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,479
Stay away from me!

591
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:25,560
Bao... Baoning?

592
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:31,640
Baoning!

593
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,000
What are you doing here?

594
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:34,199
Zhao Xiao!

595
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,239
Is that a venomous snake?

596
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,520
No.

597
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:41,599
It’s a sand snake.

598
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,825
Oh.

599
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,040
So what brings you here?

600
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,839
To look for Li Qian...

601
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,280
and you.

602
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,680
If you’re here,

603
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,400
so is he, right?

604
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,680
Why is he

605
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,560
always between you and me?

606
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,119
Can’t it just be the two of us?

607
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:11,439
Zhao Xiao.

608
00:31:11,825 --> 00:31:12,400
Yes?

609
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,319
I... I...

610
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,880
I’m not sure.

611
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,359
There wasn’t his body out there.

612
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,439
He didn’t return to Bingzhou either.

613
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,680
He was there to save you.

614
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
Yun Lin said you two
fought to the end together.

615
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,839
You made it out alive and where is he?

616
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,680
Baoning,

617
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,839
calm down.

618
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,719
He was still alive

619
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:34,040
when I came out of the coma.

620
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,319
Later,

621
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,760
we got separated.

622
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:39,500
Which means...

623
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,079
he is still alive, right?

624
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,880
If so, I will find him!

625
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,100
Zhao Xiao, I need your help.

626
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,719
Anything you need.

627
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,160
Thank you.

628
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:59,560
See you next time.

629
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:00,800
Have a nice day.

630
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,239
Roast suckling pigs! Hot and juicy!

631
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,840
Sir,

632
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,599
how much is it?

633
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,025
Would you like some, Miss?

634
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:08,700
Yes.

635
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,780
- Do you want more meat
- Stop.

636
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,930
or meat with bones?

637
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:11,650
More meat.

638
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,359
I see. The front leg is perfect.

639
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:14,850
Hold on. It’s still undercooked.

640
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,280
I’ll give you a nice cut once it’s done.

641
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,160
Give me a minute.

642
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:21,359
Hi,

643
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,125
An!

644
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:23,199
What a nice surprise!

645
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,079
What are you doing here?

646
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,950
I replenished my stock from Wuyan

647
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,640
and was about to rest for a few days

648
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,520
before selling it to Mu’an.

649
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,000
And you? Why are you here?

650
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,239
Truth be told,

651
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:35,925
I’m looking for a missing person.

652
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,640
You’re in my place.

653
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,160
I’ll help you

654
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:41,880
find whoever that is.

655
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,100
Thanks. I’ll be counting on you then.

656
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,700
Sure.

657
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,600
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

658
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,975
(Rest after Victory)
Salak! Check it out!

659
00:32:49,975 --> 00:32:51,975
You won’t see it anywhere else.

660
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:54,239
- All done!
- Wow!

661
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:54,959
- Let’s go.
- Look!

662
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,800
How is it polished?

663
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,675
It looks perfect, isn’t it?

664
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:01,760
Here you are.

665
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:03,700
Wow!

666
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,920
Good job! Impressive!

667
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,280
Baoning, he threw the snake in!

668
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,760
I’ll teach him a lesson.

669
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:09,319
Let him go.

670
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:09,959
Well done!

671
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,239
We’re in their territory.

672
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:12,520
Given who we are now,

673
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:13,680
better stay away from trouble.

674
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:14,880
We have a bigger fish to fry.

675
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:17,640
Baoning,

676
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:20,160
you’d never suck it up before.

677
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:21,719
Be that as it may,

678
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:23,000
- my priority is to find Li Qian.
- Here you are.

679
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:25,800
That man again! You only care about him.

680
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,150
What’s so good about him anyway?

681
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,560
He’s my husband

682
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,880
and the best in my eyes.

683
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:34,525
Zhao Xiao,

684
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,079
you can stay out of this.

685
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:36,959
I wouldn’t blame you.

686
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,760
And you could blow your cover anytime.

687
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:41,280
I’ll find him myself.

688
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,719
Baoning, it’s not that I refuse to help,

689
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:46,119
but you’ve been looking almost all day

690
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,520
in the sun without having any water.

691
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,925
I’m worried about you.

692
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,719
How about we find a place to sit

693
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:52,599
and have something to eat first?

694
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:56,900
Sure.

695
00:34:01,975 --> 00:34:02,875
You must be thirsty.

696
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:04,975
Here you are.

697
00:34:06,975 --> 00:34:07,975
This one is great.

698
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:15,100
Baoning.

699
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,820
Where could Li Qian be?

700
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,951
I... I have no clue.

701
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,479
Alright. Let’s keep looking.

702
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,961
Wait!

703
00:34:32,475 --> 00:34:33,000
Don’t move!

704
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:44,550
Baoning,

705
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,280
how I wish

706
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,360
time would stop at this moment

707
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:50,560
when there’s just you and me.

708
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,080
Why do I smell medicine?

709
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,840
Are you injured?

710
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,950
I used herbs

711
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,400
for that snake bite, remember?

712
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:08,560
The scent isn’t from raw herbs

713
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,950
but more like some decoction.

714
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,719
I’m sure it’s the herb.

715
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,199
I know what I used.

716
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,199
My memory can’t be wrong.

717
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,000
Let’s keep looking for Li Qian.

718
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,400
Fine.

719
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,840
Dongzhi, no luck
after looking twice in the city.

720
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:33,439
Let’s go out and check.

721
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,840
I picked

722
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,520
a relatively docile horse for you,

723
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:37,800
but this breed

724
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,919
can’t be fully tamed.

725
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:42,375
No worries, though. I’m here.

726
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,760
You’re in good hands.

727
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,399
Give me your hand.

728
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:47,080
I’ll help you mount it.

729
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,639
Does he think I can’t ride?

730
00:35:58,919 --> 00:36:00,550
You’re safe. Don’t worry.

731
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,350
I got the reins.

732
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:05,239
Sit still and nothing will happen.

733
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,479
Noted.

734
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,560
What’s wrong?

735
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:21,800
What’s going on?

736
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,400
You’ll be fine, Dongzhi.

737
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:29,760
It’s alright.

738
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,425
You’ve got skills.

739
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,919
I’m here to protect you.

740
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,525
This isn’t a good idea.

741
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,439
Let me down.

742
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:43,760
I’m done riding it.

743
00:36:44,725 --> 00:36:45,320
Sure.

744
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,199
Come.

745
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:52,719
You fooled me!

746
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,320
Fine. Just wait!

747
00:37:21,425 --> 00:37:23,879
We’ve circled outside the city

748
00:37:23,879 --> 00:37:26,280
without finding any trace,

749
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,120
but still, thank you, Qing An.

750
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,760
I’m feeling less stressed.

751
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,600
I should thank you, too.

752
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:38,320
Your pure joy

753
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:40,639
has made my day, too.

754
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,916
An, let’s continue.

755
00:37:59,825 --> 00:38:00,475
Let’s go back.

756
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,439
There you are!

757
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,479
Is this a dream?

758
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,410
I thought I’d never see you again.

759
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:50,840
He’s still alive.

760
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:53,479
He’s too young to die here.

761
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:57,199
This area is clear.

762
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
No survivors.

763
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,120
Li Qian!

764
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,879
Stop!

765
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,639
Which battalion are you in?

766
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:11,120
I’m asking you! Are you dumb?

767
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:15,159
Say it! Who’s your commander?

768
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:18,014
Or you’ll be treated as spies!

769
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,840
They’re members of the Weapon Battalion.

770
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,875
The cart for the injured is here.
Stop wandering!

771
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,679
Come with me.

772
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,280
Let’s go back!

773
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,199
Go back!

774
00:41:50,600 --> 00:42:02,375
(Yunyang City)

775
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:04,800
- Commander.
- Commander.

776
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,520
Forging iron, making a fire,
drawing, building,

777
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,850
which one can you do?

778
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,679
None of it, I’m afraid.

779
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,919
Run errands then. Stay in there for now.

780
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,679
Li Qian,

781
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,879
I’ve done my best to save you.

782
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,080
Whether you’ll survive or not

783
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:08,800
is up to your fate.

784
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:16,875
Baoning,

785
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,639
you’re always pampered.

786
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,520
I can’t imagine how much you suffered

787
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,439
coming all the way here.

788
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,040
Promise me

789
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,600
that whatever happens in the future,

790
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,320
just stay at home and wait for me.

791
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,750
It won’t happen again.

792
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,525
You, too, promise me

793
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,525
that you won’t get wounded
like this again.

794
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,075
You’re burning up.

795
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,439
Zhao Xiao!

796
00:43:56,919 --> 00:43:58,600
It’s one thing that you hid him from me.

797
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,080
But he’s heavily wounded.

798
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,040
Why didn’t you have him treated?

799
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,479
Did you want him dead?

800
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,399
If I did,

801
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,280
I wouldn’t have carried him
out of those corpses.

802
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,280
You made the wrong decision

803
00:44:12,879 --> 00:44:13,760
that got him in this bed.

804
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:16,639
You’re right.

805
00:44:17,479 --> 00:44:18,450
It’s all my fault.

806
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,439
I can’t do anything right.

807
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:26,959
Are you alright?

808
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:32,700
Baoning,

809
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,959
it’s hard to get proper treatment here.

810
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:38,159
We were living on Zhao Xiao’s wage

811
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,280
as a handyman
to barely support ourselves.

812
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,439
Don’t blame him.

813
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:46,800
I’ll cure you

814
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,080
no matter what it takes.

815
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:52,800
Seeing you here,

816
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:55,600
I’m more than half cured already.

817
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,125
Take it slow.

818
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:18,840
Get some rest after breakfast.

819
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,150
I’ll go to see my master

820
00:45:22,399 --> 00:45:23,639
and come back at noon.

821
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,100
I’m done.

822
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:32,725
Already?

823
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:35,959
Are you alright? Is it the wound again?

824
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:37,199
I...

825
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,639
I...

826
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,719
What is it?

827
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:49,719
Zhao Xiao,

828
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,760
uh...

829
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:52,800
starting today, you don’t need to work.

830
00:45:52,879 --> 00:45:54,159
I’ll ask for leave for you.

831
00:45:54,399 --> 00:45:55,760
In the meantime,
please take good care of him.

832
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,950
What are you doing?

833
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,040
Taking care of him as you asked.

834
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:11,520
I patted his wound by accident.

835
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:13,946
You did that on purpose, didn’t you?

836
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:15,700
Enough.

837
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,125
Just go. I’ll look after him.

838
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:22,199
What now?

839
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:24,125
You... Out! Now!

840
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:26,800
How do you feel?

841
00:46:27,475 --> 00:46:28,050
Baoning...

842
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,520
Do you want more food?

843
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:38,475
Yes.

844
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,725
Who is it?

845
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,850
Thief! Catch the thief!

846
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,120
Catch the thief!

847
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,560
- What’s going on?
- He took my herbs!

848
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,879
- Catch him! Go!
- My herbs!

849
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:27,950
Young Master!

850
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,679
Come!

851
00:47:37,959 --> 00:47:38,575
Go!

852
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:41,375
Young Master.

853
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,900
The enemies have been drawn away.

854
00:47:45,959 --> 00:47:46,600
Young Master,

855
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,475
I’m so glad you’re fine!

856
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,919
Marquis asked us to look for you.

857
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:54,919
The city is heavily guarded.

858
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,000
Our men can only wait outside.

859
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,840
When Yongqing’s troops returned,

860
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,760
the security was loose,

861
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:04,120
but now, it’s severely tightened.

862
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:06,439
I need to get
Commandery Princess Jia’nan out, too,

863
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
so you must get the pass.

864
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,879
What’s she doing here?

865
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,439
Relax.

866
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,600
I can handle this.

867
00:48:24,439 --> 00:48:25,520
Common herbs

868
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,719
are ineffective.

869
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:28,679
Your wound is aggravated.

870
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,040
It must stop.

871
00:48:31,399 --> 00:48:32,080
Where are you going?

872
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,560
To get more herbs.

873
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,700
Whatever it takes,

874
00:48:36,399 --> 00:48:37,399
I’ll get them for you.

875
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,199
Baoning, look what I brought back.

876
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:45,425
What are they?

877
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,000
Herbs?

878
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,350
They’re the finest.

879
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,775
Where did you get them?

880
00:48:58,159 --> 00:48:59,080
That you don’t need to know.

881
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,280
I only hope you can forgive me

882
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,439
for withholding Li Qian’s whereabouts.

883
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:06,879
Young Master!

884
00:49:07,439 --> 00:49:08,950
You two went way back

885
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,879
and chose to live and die together.

886
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,325
He saved you and you didn’t abandon him.

887
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:16,639
Thank you for all these herbs.

888
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,760
About...

889
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:24,479
what I said earlier, I didn’t mean it.

890
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,800
Don’t take it to heart.

891
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:26,750
I know.

892
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,120
Alright. I’m...

893
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,675
going to ask the physician
about these herbs.

894
00:49:31,775 --> 00:49:32,959
You stay with him. I’ll go.
