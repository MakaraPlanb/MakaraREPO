Long live Your Majesty.

You may rise.

33
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,720
It’s over.

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,520
Stand up.

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,520
Commandery Princess Jia’nan

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,920
defended the throne

37
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,840
and helped the state.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,440
She’s titled Princess Jia’nan,
and paid as a prince,

39
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,480
with one thousand hectares of fertile farmlands
and ten thousand taels of gold.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
Li Qian

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,640
is young and brave.
He guarded the emperor.

42
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,600
He’s titled Lord Lintong,

43
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,800
and will take charge of Jinxi Army.

44
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,480
Zuo Yiming will be
the first-level official

45
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,560
as the Grand Guardian
of the Crown Prince.

46
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,440
The former Commandant
of Bingzhou, Li Changqing,

47
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,880
will stay in the capital as Commander-in-chief.

48
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,600
His title of nobility can be inherited.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,840
Jin Xiao

50
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,120
made contributions
to defending the state.

51
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,800
He’s now the deputy commander

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,040
of third level.

53
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,200
Commandant of the North Yang Jun

54
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,000
helped rescue the capital city.

55
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,200
He’s awarded
with a thousand taels of gold.

56
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,400
Respect this.

57
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

58
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,360
The capital has been settled.
The new emperor took the throne.

59
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,480
Meritorious officials
were promoted and awarded.

60
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,520
Don’t forget what the Archduke
and his son have done

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,760
behind the victory.

62
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,640
Now, they’re hunting the enemy down

63
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,680
with their armies.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,320
We don’t know how they’re doing now.

65
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,440
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

66
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,080
Good news came this morning.

67
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,680
The Archduke has repelled
Yongqing armies.

68
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,400
Good, good.

69
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,960
This is the best news

70
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,880
I’ve ever heard in recent days.

71
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,160
The invasion of Yongqing was put down.

72
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,040
We have been awarded or punished
as we deserve.

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,600
Only one man is waiting
to be dealt with.

74
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,400
Guilty minister Zhao Xiao is summoned.

75
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,840
I’m Zhao Xiao.

76
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,160
I know I made a huge mistake.

77
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,640
I come to ask for punishment
from His Majesty.

78
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,720
Marquis Jinghai Zhao Kuan transferred
army provisions without permission

79
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,760
so that Nanmin was lost.

80
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,120
Many soldiers and civilians
were killed or wounded.

81
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,200
To save his father,
Zhao Xiao deserted his post

82
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,920
so that enemy troops came farther
and Yunlin Pass was lost, too.

83
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,000
According to laws,

84
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,120
we should deprive him
of the marquis title,

85
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,600
make him a civilian,

86
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,080
and exile him to the north.

87
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,720
Mr. Wang, this is too severe.

88
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Deserting his post is a capital crime.

89
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,840
But we always rule our state
with filial piety.

90
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,880
Marquis Jinghai misjudged in the war

91
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,120
and was stuck in danger.

92
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,480
As his son,

93
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,080
Zhao Xiao went to Nanmin

94
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,680
and helped his father.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,360
It’s natural.

96
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,320
If Zhao Xiao is deprived
of the marquis title

97
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
and exiled to the north,

98
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,000
it’ll be against the filial piety

99
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,880
and will disturb people in Nanmin.

100
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,000
You make sense, Your Grace.

101
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,520
But laws are laws.

102
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,000
Personal feelings don’t count.

103
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,280
Marquis Jinghai fought the war
till the end

104
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,640
and died for our state.

105
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,760
He was indeed heroic.

106
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,360
Once he was deprived of an accusation,

107
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,280
people will be disturbed
and they will gossip.

108
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
The new emperor just took the throne.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,400
Zhao Min came from Nanmin
to ask for punishment.

110
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,120
To express the kindness of the court,

111
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,680
why not redeem him with his achievements

112
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,520
and let him go?

113
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,560
I’ll take full responsibility

114
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,720
for the crime I’ve committed.

115
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,040
When Marquis Jinghai was alive,

116
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,640
he made a brilliant military success.

117
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,520
Now, he’s dead for our state.

118
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,320
Even if you don’t care for yourself,

119
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,920
you should defend the honor

120
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,840
of your family and your father.

121
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,200
I expect your wise decision, Your Majesty.

122
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,640
Your Majesty, it’s up to you.

123
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Lord Lintong made a good point.

124
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,880
It’s kind of you, my lord.

125
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,200
I admire that.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,280
Marquis Jinghai died for our state.

127
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,440
His title can be preserved.

128
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,360
His son Zhao Xiao made a huge mistake.

129
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,240
Unless he’s severely punished,

130
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,360
he may not convince our people.

131
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,200
Now that Princess Jia’nan
and Lord Lintong intercede for him,

132
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,800
he won’t be exiled.

133
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,640
But he must be punished.

134
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,480
Flog him 30 times

135
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,560
to defend our national prestige.

136
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,480
Do it now.

137
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,200
Everything is finally done in the Palace.

138
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,840
We can go back home together.

139
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,520
Walk slowly.

140
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
It’s been such a long time.
but you’re still angry with me?

141
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,720
Let’s see how I will
deal with you back home.

142
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,160
Why is it you?

143
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,560
Come on, my lord.

144
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,680
We’re friends.

145
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
Go away!

146
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,120
All right. I’ll stop kidding.

147
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,600
What happened
between Commandery Princess Jia’nan...

148
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,000
I mean Princess Jia’nan.

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What happened between you two?

150
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,080
You echoed each other in the court.

151
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,320
Why are you quarreling out here?

152
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,600
Are you feeling unfair

153
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,040
because she’s promoted as Princess Jia’nan

154
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,400
and is superior to you?

155
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,200
This is our own business.

156
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,240
Don’t interfere.

157
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,240
I’m asking for your own good.

158
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,920
I know what you’re angry with.

159
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,520
You are

160
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,640
just angry with Princess Jia’nan

161
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,920
because she didn’t tell you

162
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,880
before she helped the deceased emperor.

163
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,240
I get it. I get everything.

164
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,440
But some advice for you.

165
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,320
Don’t hurt yourself

166
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,480
just to defend your dignity.

167
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,560
Are you done?

168
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,360
Don’t follow up.

169
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,320
Go.

170
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,000
- Miss.
- Miss.

171
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,920
Qing An, go.

172
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,200
- Miss.
- Miss.

173
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,880
Come on.

174
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,920
Leave it to me.

175
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,760
Show me your wrist.

176
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,200
Dongdong.

177
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,960
- You’ve been away for days.
- Aunt.

178
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,480
Everyone in the charity house missed you.

179
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,920
Aunt, are you feeling better?

180
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,000
Thanks to Princess Jia’nan
and the Li Family,

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,080
I’m much better.

182
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,720
That’s fine, then.

183
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,840
You had a long trip.

184
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,520
Have some hot tea to warm yourself up.

185
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,040
All right.

186
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,960
Qing An.

187
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,080
Qing An.

188
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,360
She’s Qin Yu.

189
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,800
She’s a refuge in the charity house.

190
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,440
She does some needlework here now.

191
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Aunt, he’s Qing An.

192
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,640
He’s my friend.

193
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,320
He was wounded accidentally.

194
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,560
So, he has a mental problem.

195
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,240
I took him back to take care of him.

196
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Don’t mind.

197
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,760
I won’t mind.

198
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,240
I live in the charity house for a long time.

199
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,080
Dongdong, thank you

200
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,880
for letting me settle down here.

201
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,400
Your friend is a poor man.

202
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,160
I’ll take care of him for you.

203
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Thank you, Aunt.

204
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,400
Miss.

205
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,320
Buy this...

206
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,680
Buy everything on this list.

207
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,520
- Yes.
- Be quick.

208
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,280
It won’t hurt. It won’t.

209
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,960
It won’t hurt.

210
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
I’m all right.

211
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,920
Go.

212
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,200
Come on. Hold it.

213
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,360
All right.

214
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,840
What are you...?

215
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,080
Forget it.

216
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,960
Freeze.

217
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,120
Freeze.

218
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,840
Look at the flower.

219
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,680
You should do it this way.

220
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,880
What are you doing?

221
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,200
It hurts.

222
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,960
It doesn’t hurt.

223
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,000
It doesn’t.

224
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,120
You’re hungry.

225
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,200
You’ll like this.

226
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,720
I don’t eat raw fish.

227
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,560
Go to that room

228
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,560
and fetch me the dessert.

229
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,840
I want that.

230
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:05,880
All right.

231
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,760
Be right there.

232
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,280
This is the whole story.

233
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,040
When we were escaping in the field,

234
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,680
we had to eat raw food
for physical strength.

235
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,160
I didn’t expect him to misunderstand it.

236
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,720
A couple of years ago,

237
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,720
I saved an injured cat.

238
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,920
After the cat recovered,

239
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,680
it caught a mouse every day

240
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,760
and brought it to my house.

241
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,440
To the cat,

242
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,280
the mouse was the best gift
it could give me.

243
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,800
It wanted me to be happy.

244
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,080
So, it pleased me with the best it could do.

245
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Qing An is doing this to you, too.

246
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,320
Because you’re nice to him,

247
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,960
he wants to repay you
with everything he has.

248
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,600
I can tell that

249
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,600
he likes you.

250
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,400
Eat it.

251
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,120
Be seated.

252
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,240
(Li’s Mansion)

253
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,640
He’s shutting me out?

254
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,680
Will he not talk to me again?

255
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,080
If you ignore me, I’ll ignore you, too.

256
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,800
Why must I go
because you want me to leave?

257
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,800
I won’t leave.

258
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,440
I’ll see what you can do.

259
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,600
Why are you still up so late?

260
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,800
(Green, green the reed,
dew and frost gleam)

261
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,720
It’s bad for your eyes
to write by candlelight

262
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,400
Let me get you some tea.

263
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,000
Here.

264
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,400
Wei Shu said you were too busy

265
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,240
to have dinner.

266
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,160
Here’s some dessert.

267
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,960
Taste it.

268
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,760
Are you still angry with me?

269
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,000
I know I was wrong.

270
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,520
I...

271
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,640
I’ll go reflect on myself, all right?

272
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,280
Fine. I’ll go.

273
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,240
Mosquito.

274
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,960
- You!
- There was a mosquito.

275
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,320
I know

276
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,760
you’re angry
because I came to the capital alone.

277
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:42,880
You’re also angry

278
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,080
because I didn’t tell you before I came.

279
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,880
But I had an emergency.

280
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,240
When the deceased emperor gave me
his testamentary edict,

281
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,920
I had the responsibility to take.

282
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,280
Even if I weren’t a Commandery Princess,

283
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,000
but a very weak civilian,

284
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,880
I would have to do that.

285
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,320
Besides,

286
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,960
I was also worried about Grandmother.

287
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,040
You have so many excuses.

288
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,760
You’re very weak,

289
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
but always try to be brave.

290
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,320
I...

291
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,800
I’ll go stand there.

292
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,240
Stop.

293
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,560
Did I ask you to stand there?

294
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,760
Tell me.

295
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,800
Am I unreasonable?

296
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,520
You only left me a letter
before you came to the capital.

297
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,240
The trip was dangerous.

298
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,720
Have you thought about my feelings?

299
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,680
I was in Yunlin Pass,

300
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,560
far away for you.

301
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,680
If you were hurt during your trip,

302
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,840
what would I do?

303
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,440
Besides,

304
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,440
the deceased emperor
and empress dowager died,

305
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,520
but you didn’t tell me.

306
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,680
You took care of that alone.

307
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,560
By doing that,

308
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,000
you were torturing me, you know?

309
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,640
All right. All right.

310
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,640
I’m sorry.

311
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,520
When I left you a letter
and came to the capital,

312
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,840
I didn’t think too much.

313
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,520
I just didn’t want

314
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,520
to get your family involved
with the deceased emperor.

315
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,520
You!

316
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,640
Listen to me.

317
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,160
When I was little,

318
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,280
my parents’ death hurt me a lot.

319
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,040
Grandmother always protects me.

320
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,520
But what if

321
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,720
she dies someday?

322
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,440
What can I do, then?

323
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,160
If I put all my hope

324
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,000
in the protection of someone else,

325
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,720
what if

326
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,160
he leaves me?

327
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,840
How will I face the difficulty alone?

328
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,160
So, since I was little, I’ve told myself

329
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,440
to learn to be independent

330
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,240
and survive in difficulty.

331
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,880
I thought

332
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,680
I would rely on myself.

333
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,120
I didn’t know you would be so angry.

334
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,360
Look at me.

335
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,760
Baoning, you’re my wife.

336
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,120
We’re married

337
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,960
and we’re a family
that can rely on each other.

338
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,640
So, I don’t want you

339
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,200
to always be so strong.

340
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,960
Give me a chance sometimes.

341
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,360
Try to rely on me.

342
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
Just try it.

343
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,440
Will you?

344
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,800
Come on, Your Grace,

345
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,760
you’re decisive in big issues.

346
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,400
Let’s start with small issues.

347
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,640
Isn’t it all right?

348
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,160
I’ll listen to you for small issues.

349
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,000
You agreed so quickly?

350
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,880
Grand Mentor Xiong died for our state.

351
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,720
We can finally leave the Palace now.

352
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,520
When we have time,

353
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,560
go worship him with me.

354
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,520
I’ll think about that.

355
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,400
Go with me.

356
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,000
All right.

357
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,720
It’s almost done.

358
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,000
Spit it out.

359
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,360
Quickly!

360
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,760
Qing An,

361
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,800
spit it out. Quickly.

362
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,640
Come on. Spit it out.

363
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,680
Why didn’t you spit out the bone?

364
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,400
It’ll hurt your stomach.

365
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,520
Qing An, stay here and don’t move.

366
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,480
I’ll be right back.

367
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,600
Who are you?

368
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,840
It’s me, Miss Li.

369
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,680
Your Highness.

370
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,680
Siqin.

371
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,280
Be seated first.

372
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,720
Even if they don’t have the same mother,

373
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,560
at least,

374
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,720
they have the same father.

375
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,080
Why could Qing Tai be so cruel

376
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,000
and hurt his younger brother like this?

377
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,920
Siqin,

378
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,080
where were you lately?

379
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,880
Since Qing Tai held power,

380
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,120
increased taxes,

381
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,160
and recruited soldiers,

382
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,440
civilians have been destitute

383
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,720
and suffering unspeakably.

384
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,680
If it goes on,

385
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,720
the state our deceased emperor built

386
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,920
will collapse and be destroyed.

387
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,640
I thought the Second Prince was dead.

388
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
Then I had planned

389
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,240
to have a life-and-death battle
with Qing Tai.

390
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,280
Unexpectedly,

391
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,880
when hunting Qing Tai down,

392
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,600
I found out that
His Highness was still alive.

393
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,440
Then I came all the way to you.

394
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,360
Now, no one can save Yongqing,

395
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,120
but His Highness.

396
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,880
You want him to save Yongqing?

397
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,760
But it’s already his luck

398
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,920
to be alive.

399
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,080
Eat it.

400
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,000
Yummy.

401
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,680
All right. Sit still.

402
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,840
Good boy.

403
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,600
Siqin,

404
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,600
can we get him back to normal?

405
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,400
Qing Tai has a capable minion,

406
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,320
named Wu Man.

407
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,360
He’s good at hypnosis.

408
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,200
If I guess correctly,

409
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,720
His Highness is behaving like this,

410
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,520
just because of Wu Man.

411
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,920
Will Qing An be cured

412
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,120
when we catch Wu Man?

413
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,880
Wu Man is sly and scheming.

414
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,520
It’s not easy to catch him.

415
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,240
Even if we catch him,

416
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,000
he won’t cure His Highness

417
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,120
for his relationship with Qing Tai!

418
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,440
No matter what,

419
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,640
I’ll try to cure you.

420
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,280
Be very careful.

421
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:06,880
All right.

422
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,160
Natural disasters keep coming.

423
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,960
It took us great trouble to get the rice.

424
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,520
Shanhu.

425
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,600
Dongdong.

426
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:15,840
Qing An.

427
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,120
Shanhu, there you are.

428
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,040
Qing An,

429
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
you don’t remember me?

430
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,360
I’m Dong Shanhu.

431
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:26,720
Qing An.

432
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,320
Come on.

433
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,800
It’s okay.

434
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:33,880
Here.

435
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,440
Thank you.

436
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,800
Thank you.

437
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,960
So, he has forgotten everything?

438
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,400
Shanhu,

439
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,720
you don’t need to be nervous.

440
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,240
He’s in a special condition now.

441
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,160
He doesn’t understand whatever you say.

442
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,320
What did the doctor say?

443
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,480
I consulted some doctors.

444
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,800
But they said he couldn’t be cured.

445
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,680
I’ve been doing business for years

446
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,200
and I know some skillful doctors.

447
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,720
If you don’t mind,

448
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,640
I’ll recommend them to you.

449
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,360
That’s good.

450
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,720
Thank you, Shanhu.

451
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,080
If Qing An is cured,

452
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,960
my family will greatly repay you.

453
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,960
Dongdong.

454
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,080
Come on. Be seated.

455
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,720
We’re friends

456
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,440
and you don’t need to say that.

457
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,040
I’m in Bingzhou,

458
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,840
but I’ve heard
about the situation in the capital.

459
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,680
Your family is no longer

460
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,120
what you used to be.

461
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,400
Many people even dream

462
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
to help you.

463
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,920
Shanhu, others may not understand you,

464
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
but I know you.

465
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,080
You defend the good and hate the bad.

466
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,200
If you don’t get on with my family,

467
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
however powerful we are,

468
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,480
you won’t help us.

469
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,800
Fine. Fine.

470
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,760
I’ll stop joking.

471
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,640
Our state has gone through such a disaster.

472
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,520
Now, everything is recovering.

473
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,920
It’s good luck for our people.

474
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,400
Dongdong,

475
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,720
you came back from the capital.

476
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,080
Do you have anything interesting
to tell me?

477
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,400
Anything interesting?

478
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,800
What would you like to know?

479
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,520
Nothing.

480
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,640
I’m just curious about the court.

481
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,160
When the new emperor took the throne,

482
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,320
officials were awarded
and punished accordingly.

483
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,320
It’s always a tradition.

484
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,800
What...?

485
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,880
What about Jin Xiao?

486
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,560
Shanhu,

487
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,400
are you curious
about the court or Jin Xiao?

488
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,520
I’m just asking.

489
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Jin Xiao is doing great now.

490
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,160
He’s the deputy commander in the capital.

491
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,400
The third level.

492
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,520
He’ll certainly accomplish great deeds.

493
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,200
I didn’t expect him

494
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,880
to do such a good job.

495
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,600
However, he’s in the capital...

496
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,920
(Marquis Jinghai’s Mansion)

497
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,800
My lord, we arrived
at Marquis Jinghai’s mansion.

498
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,560
Aren’t we going
to Grand Mentor Xiong’s mansion?

499
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,560
This is the best healing power in my camp.

500
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,600
It’s very effective for wounds.

501
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,720
Take it.

502
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,160
You didn’t tell me about it.

503
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,280
But Zhao Xiao helped you many times.

504
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,480
If you don’t repay him,

505
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,320
you won’t stop worrying about him.

506
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,160
Thank you.

507
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,440
Shouldn’t you do something?

508
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,600
Fine.

509
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,280
Go ahead.

510
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,800
Get out!

511
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,040
I don’t need you!

512
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,760
Get out!

513
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,400
I said, get out!

514
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,320
Can’t you understand?

515
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,720
Why... why did you come?

516
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,240
You’re badly wounded?

517
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,360
Thanks to you, Your Grace,

518
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I’m still alive.

519
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,000
Your father died for our state.

520
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,760
I feel sad.

521
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,280
I didn’t expect so many accidents

522
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,720
to happen in only a few days.

523
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,720
I know you’re sad.

524
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,520
I won’t try to convince you

525
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,280
to stop hating.

526
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,000
I just want to tell you that

527
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,440
if you live with hatred in your heart,

528
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,000
you’ll be suffering alone.

529
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,440
I believe your father

530
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,000
doesn’t want his only son
to abandon himself

531
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,160
though he’s in heaven now.

532
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,080
Rest for recuperation.

533
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,280
I’ll leave you alone.

534
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,400
Baoning.

535
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,560
Have you thought about it?

536
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,760
Li Qian married you,

537
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,600
just for the promotion he’s got now.

538
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,440
He...

539
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,160
So what?

540
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,080
I wanted to marry him.

541
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,280
Besides, he’s not that kind of man.

542
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,760
Fine.

543
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,680
Hope you won’t

544
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,560
ever regret it.

545
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,240
It turns out to be a new store.

546
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,440
Sir,

547
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,440
how much is this?

548
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,520
Sir,

549
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,120
how much is this?

550
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,640
This is made

551
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,200
of mulberry silk and cotton silk.

552
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,640
It’s very expensive.

553
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,320
Ordinary girls

554
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,400
can’t afford it.

555
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,200
Be careful!

556
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,320
Don’t damage it.

557
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,640
It can be damaged by touching?

558
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,440
It’s for special guests.

559
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,840
Ordinary girls can’t afford it.

560
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,080
Sir,

561
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,440
you’re new in Bingzhou, aren’t you?

562
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Why don’t you ask around?

563
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,640
In the business circle of Bingzhou,

564
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,120
no one can be the best, but her.

565
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,880
The silk she’s holding

566
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,360
and...

567
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,520
And the three rows there.

568
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,560
I’ll take it all.

569
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,160
I’ll give it to this girl,

570
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,680
as my investment for a fortune.

571
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,120
Look.

572
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,760
I’m so sorry

573
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,240
that I didn’t recognize you.

574
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,160
Browse around.

575
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,000
I’ll get the silk packed for you.

576
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,760
I’ll be right back.

577
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,840
Don’t bother.

578
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,560
Wait. Wait.

579
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,920
Why are you here?

580
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,360
Were you focusing on the silk

581
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,760
or wasn’t I eye-catching?

582
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,840
I followed you all the way into the store,

583
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,160
but you didn’t see me.

584
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
According to Dongdong,

585
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,240
you’re now the deputy commander

586
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,480
of third level.

587
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,480
You’re supposed to work in the capital.

588
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,320
Why are you here?

589
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,720
Under the command of His Majesty,

590
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,760
I came back for the handover
of military affairs with my father.

591
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,920
By the way,

592
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,360
I came to say goodbye to you.

593
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,080
I’ll have to stay in the capital
for quite a long time

594
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,080
and can’t come back.

595
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,600
By the way,

596
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,840
some days ago,

597
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,480
I saw this abacus made of rosewood.

598
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,880
I don’t know why,

599
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,040
but it reminded me of you.

600
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,800
Then I bought it.

601
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,760
A going-away present, I guess.

602
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,360
Keep it as a souvenir.

603
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,920
Maybe when you see this,

604
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,880
you can think of me.

605
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,199
You underestimated me.

606
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,159
You don’t like it?

607
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,520
Sorry for this.

608
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,760
Wait.

609
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,239
I mean

610
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,080
in the capital,

611
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,760
there are also my stores.

612
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,159
You can’t come back.

613
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,800
But I can go there for you.

614
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:28,719
What...?

615
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,520
What about the abacus?

616
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,080
It’s a gift for me.

617
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,600
What? Are you trying to take it back?

618
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,840
(Li’s Mansion)

619
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,560
You’re leaving for Bingzhou so soon?

620
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,280
Father, Mother,

621
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,840
Li Qian and I have done the responsibilities

622
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,280
as officials and children.

623
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,719
The court

624
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,560
has awarded us accordingly.

625
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,000
We should take our posts.

626
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,280
So, we plan to go back to Bingzhou.

627
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,520
But this is too sudden.

628
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,160
Aren’t you the regent princess?

629
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,400
The deceased emperor
made me the regent princess.

630
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
But I have no reason to stay here.

631
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,880
The emperor has a good teacher

632
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,920
and loyal officials who help him.

633
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,320
They’ll accompany him as he grows up.

634
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,000
I’m a princess.

635
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,800
But I’ve married the lord in Bingzhou.

636
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,240
I have a special identity.

637
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,760
If I stay,

638
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,320
I’ll give them an excuse to complain.

639
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,120
Yeah.

640
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,720
Baoning is right.

641
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,120
Now that she’s the wife
of the lord in Bingzhou,

642
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,960
she shouldn’t stay in the capital

643
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,560
Here. Have some tea, Father.

644
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,960
You both make sense.

645
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,280
We should all obey rules.

646
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,120
Go back to Bingzhou, then.

647
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Baoning,

648
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,920
I also agree

649
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,080
when you’re going back to Bingzhou.

650
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,040
But there’s one thing.

651
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,360
Could you do something

652
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
to transfer Dongdong to the capital, too?

653
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,120
Think about it.

654
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,160
Your father was just transferred
to work in the capital.

655
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,920
But you’re leaving soon.

656
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,240
When Dongdong isn’t here,

657
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,720
your father will be

658
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,280
very lonely.

659
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,400
When we were in Bingzhou,

660
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,800
Dongdong also stayed in the military camp
most of the time.

661
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,600
What’s wrong with you?

662
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,960
Why must you get her to us?

663
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,680
You...

664
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,640
She’s my daughter.

665
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,680
I want to see her every day, all right?

666
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,720
I think you just want to marry her

667
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,080
to a bigwig in the capital.

668
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,280
What?

669
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
Why are you pinching me?

670
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,520
I pinch you?

671
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,120
Why do you always let me down?

672
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,560
Your Grace,

673
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,040
could you punish him?

674
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,160
What a shrew you are!

675
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,520
We’re a couple.

676
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,680
Don’t you know?

677
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,320
How dare you ask Her Grace
to punish your husband!

678
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,160
What’s wrong with you?

679
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,840
You know what, Li Changqing?

680
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,520
I hate you most

681
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,320
for calling me shrew!

682
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,160
You know what?

683
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,840
I won’t be a couple with you.

684
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,760
I won’t.

685
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,880
- Come on.
- I’ll ask Her Grace to punish you.

686
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,640
Stop fighting. Stop.

687
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,360
- Go away.
- Father.

688
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
You’re a shrew!

689
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,440
Master,

690
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,440
don’t call me a shrew again.

691
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,240
I’ll listen to you for anything else.

692
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,520
All right.

693
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,880
Luckily, they’ll stay in the capital.

694
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,560
Luckily, we’re going back to Bingzhou.

695
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,080
Why do we have so many new things?

696
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,040
These things

697
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,000
will be taken with us

698
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,040
when we leave for Bingzhou.

699
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,520
In case I don’t have enough time,

700
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,240
I’m getting packed in advance.

701
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,320
Look, Your Grace.

702
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,280
Some are awards from the Palace.

703
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,720
Some are gifts from officials.

704
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,080
Those over there
are from your grandmother

705
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,920
and Township Mistress Qinghui.

706
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,720
Fine.

707
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,440
Let’s take away
what you’re holding and the gifts

708
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,240
from Grandmother and Su.

709
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,280
Leave the rest here.

710
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,800
Maybe we’ll use them when we’re back.

711
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:50,800
Fine.

712
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,400
It looks like
Grand Mentor Xiong’s handwriting.

713
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,320
You don’t remember, Your Grace?

714
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,960
After Mr. Xiong died,

715
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,200
you and Lord Li visited his family.

716
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,200
Before you left,

717
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,000
Mrs. Xiong gave these things to you,

718
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,080
saying they’re what Mr. Xiong left you.

719
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,340
(The long-lost Book of Supreme Weapons
was made by weapon master Zhang Zeshi.)

719
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,320
I once wrote to Grand Mentor Xiong,

720
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,000
asking about The Book of Supreme Weapons.

721
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,360
I didn’t expect him to remember that

722
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,400
even if he was busy with political affairs.

723
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,360
But before he sent the letter back to me,

724
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,520
he died for our state.

725
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,560
In his letter, he said

726
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,640
the long-lost Book of Supreme Weapons

727
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,520
was made by weapon master Zhang Zeshi.

728
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,520
Many years ago,

729
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,840
he settled down in the countryside
and then disappeared.

730
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,880
Speaking of it,

731
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,920
let me show you something.

732
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,600
Be careful. Be careful.

733
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,520
Be very careful.

734
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,160
I used it once
when I was in danger in Bingzhou.

735
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,400
It looks weird,

736
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,640
but it has a great killing power.

737
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,800
Such a supreme weapon

738
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,480
has never been heard of or seen.

739
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,000
But it’s not completely manufactured.

740
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,240
It hurts people as well as the user.

741
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,440
So, after I used it once,

742
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,800
I’ve never used it again.

743
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,920
I didn’t expect to make it

744
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,120
only based on a design drawing.

745
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,440
Looks like I underestimated your wisdom.

746
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,000
I’m very wise.

747
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,880
I’m thinking about how to complete it.

748
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,640
I feel I haven’t found
the most important step.

749
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,360
Baoning,

750
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,720
you have to understand that

751
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,360
the precious stone lands
its innocent possessor in jail.

752
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,240
Once greedy men know how awesome it is,

753
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,880
there’ll be endless trouble.

754
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,720
We must keep it very secret.

755
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,040
After it’s done,

756
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:09,960
let’s go back

757
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,760
and continue to be a carefree couple.

758
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,480
But...

759
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,640
But what?

760
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,880
You’re worried
about Grand Empress Dowager?

761
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,080
I want to accompany her more often.

762
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,880
After we’re back in Bingzhou,

763
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,160
I wonder when I can see her again.

764
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,800
No problem.

765
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,320
Lately, go to the Palace often
and accompany her.

766
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,880
(East Sleeping Chamber)

767
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,200
Chow.

768
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,000
You had three chows in a row.

769
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,360
Can we get a card or not?

770
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,720
Baoning has quite good luck today.

771
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,080
Not only today.

772
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,960
Recently, Her Grace has got

773
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,640
all the good luck.

774
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,840
She manages her family well

775
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,360
and helps with political affairs.

776
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,560
Speaking of Princess Jia’nan,

777
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,760
everyone gives a thumbs-up.

778
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,120
They praise Her Grace

779
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,800
for being gorgeous and intelligent.

780
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,040
Gorgeous and intelligent.

781
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,440
She’s just a naughty girl.

782
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,960
Look.

783
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,000
After such a short time,

784
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,480
she has won all the chips

785
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,760
from us.

786
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,840
I think you’re just jealous

787
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,720
because I win money from you.

788
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,640
Well,

789
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,480
when the deceased emperor
married Empress Han,

790
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,360
and I was picking
another husband for Baoning,

791
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,600
I didn’t think highly of Li Qian.

792
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,920
It now seems that

793
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,120
Li Qian is from a humble family,

794
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,400
but he’s talented and excellent.

795
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,640
He’s made such achievements
in only a few years.

796
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,040
What a big surprise!

797
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,880
In the court,

798
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,680
not many officials can be
as talented and decisive

799
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,160
as Lord Lintong.

800
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,400
Most importantly,
he can protect Baoning forever.

801
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,520
When I die,

802
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,160
I’ll rest in peace.

803
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,360
What are you talking about?

804
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,920
You’ll live up to a hundred years

805
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,200
and always accompany me.

806
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,720
All right. All right.

807
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,760
I’m a tortoise with a long life.

808
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,720
I’ll live

809
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,320
until you have children

810
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,080
and enjoy the happiness of a family union.

811
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,480
Physician Tian felt the pulse
of Her Grace yesterday,

812
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,560
saying Her Grace was getting much better

813
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,280
after the recuperation over the past years.

814
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,880
What good news!

815
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,120
Good.

816
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,160
When you give birth
to a great-grandson for me,

817
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,960
I’ll be satisfied.

818
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,560
Stop. Stop.

819
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,160
Why are you talking about that?

820
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,120
I win.

821
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,520
Look. Look.

822
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:46,920
Come on.

823
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,480
Look at her.

824
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:47,880
Come on. Quickly.

825
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,080
What a naughty girl!

826
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,760
- Naughty girl.
- Give it to me.

827
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,920
- Here it is.
- Naughty girl.

828
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,000
Then you should...

829
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,520
The Empress Dowager is rushing
to Qinzheng Hall.

830
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,280
What a greedy woman!

831
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,240
Have the officials arrived?

832
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,560
Yes.

833
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,880
They’re waiting for His Majesty
in Qinzheng Hall.

834
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,320
Wait for him?

835
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,680
Why?

836
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,960
He’s a boy who can’t even read all words.

837
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,280
I’ll have full authority

838
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,560
for all kinds of political affairs, won’t I?

839
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,280
You make sense, Your Highness.

840
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,160
Our state

841
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,880
will have to count on you, Your Highness.

842
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,960
Greetings, Your Highness.

843
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,600
What do you come for, Stewardess Meng?

844
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,680
Under the command
of Grand Empress Dowager,

845
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,640
I’ve brought you a decree.

846
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,800
Your Highness,

847
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,920
please kneel and listen.

848
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,719
(Decree)

849
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,440
Grand Empress Dowager commands that

850
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,960
the Empress Dowager is pregnant

851
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,080
and should be tired.

852
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,520
From this day on,

853
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,080
she shall stay in Cining Palace
to prevent miscarriage.

854
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,080
For the safety concern
of Empress Dowager and her baby,

855
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,640
eight midwives will be dispatched

856
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,080
to serve her

857
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,240
until she gives birth to the baby

858
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,400
for the royal family.

859
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,160
Your Highness,

860
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,320
take the decree.

861
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,120
Your Highness,

862
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,720
you’re pregnant and shouldn’t be angry.

863
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,640
How can I just let it go?

864
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,680
After all the trouble,

865
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,880
I’m already the Empress Dowager

866
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,560
who’s second to the emperor only.

867
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,560
But Grand Empress Dowager still

868
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,600
takes charge of everything in the Palace.

869
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,800
Even Jiang Baoning

870
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,520
is more widely supported than me.

871
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,040
In the court,

872
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,800
who can I count on?

873
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:44,880
Your Highness,

874
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,160
your son is the one you can count on.

875
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,560
You’d better think positively.

876
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,920
But even when Yi was dying,

877
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,200
he only cared for Jiang Baoning.

878
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,960
You ask me to think positively?

879
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,680
But can you think positively?

880
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,080
I’m crystal clear

881
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,320
about what you did in the Li Family.

882
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,800
Don’t you hate them?

883
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,320
Your Highness,

884
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,360
I’ve forgotten

885
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,440
what happened in the past.

886
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,160
Coward!

887
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,320
Then think about

888
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,560
your boyfriend Li Lin

889
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,960
and your poor maid.

890
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,480
Do you want them

891
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,880
to be humiliated again as they were before?

892
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,800
Stop beating him

893
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,120
Stop!

894
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:44,880
Stop!

895
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:45,880
Lin.

896
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,480
What are you doing?

897
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,280
Run!

898
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,000
Stop!

899
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

900
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,560
I can’t repay your kindness.

901
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,160
Miaorong,

902
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,680
stand up.

903
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,280
I came to repay you.

904
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,560
Come out.

905
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,760
Miss.

906
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,400
Miss.

907
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,080
Guanju?

908
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,760
Stand up.

909
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,040
Guanju,

910
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,520
why are you here?

911
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,160
It took Her Highness great trouble

912
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,120
to get back Guanju.

913
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,080
Miaorong,

914
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,480
I know

915
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,640
you’ve spent all your savings

916
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,400
on curing the refugees.

917
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,280
But think about it.

918
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,560
Instead of helping strangers here,

919
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,040
why not care about those beside you?

920
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,560
Li Lin and Guanju.

921
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,320
They’re living a poor life with you.

922
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,000
I don’t think

923
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,600
this is what you want.

924
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,760
Please tell me what to do, Your Highness.

925
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,840
Go to the Palace with me.

926
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,680
When I’m there,

927
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,120
you’ll live a good life.

928
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,280
No one will dare to bully Li Lin again.

929
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,480
When you save enough money,

930
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,600
leave the Palace
and live a good life with him.

931
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,320
Your Highness,

932
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,720
I’ll be at your service.

933
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,640
Come on, Miaorong.

934

to do this mission, but you.
