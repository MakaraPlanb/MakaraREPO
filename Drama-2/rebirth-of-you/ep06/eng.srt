Li Qian.

28
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,839
Wasn’t your shift
from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM?

29
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,319
Why do you come back now?

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,680
My good sister.

31
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:09,000
There was some business in the palace.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,360
I was delayed.

33
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:13,320
What kept you there all night?

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,759
You don’t know.

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,679
Empress Dowager Cao will
hold a birthday banquet.

36
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,399
There are many things to attend to.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,880
Empress Dowager Cao?

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,080
But you are just a bodyguard.

39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,759
Alright.

40
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,880
If anything, tell me
after I have some sleep.

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,759
I’m tired.

42
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:27,199
OK.

43
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,750
(Sincere and Honest)
Go to rest then.

44
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,250
Um.

45
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,559
Have a good rest.

46
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:38,011
(Pure and Gracious)

47
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:44,240
Grandmother.

48
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,160
Baoning.

49
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,119
You must’ve suffered last night
in the Introspection Chamber.

50
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,600
Come and sit.

51
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:53,160
I got Fangling

52
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,520
make your favorite dishes

53
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,000
in the kitchen.

54
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,839
Hurry. Have some.

55
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,960
I didn’t think

56
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:08,000
you’d frame a District Princess.

57
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,119
That Lord Jian’s granddaughter

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,600
didn’t learn good things,

59
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,700
but some bad tricks.

60
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,300
Um.

61
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,600
I’ve ordered her to move from there

62
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,279
back to Lord Jian’s mansion.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,039
She shall no longer study with you.

64
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,639
Baoning.

65
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,759
It’s your birthday today.

66
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,880
Stewardess Meng prepared you a banquet.

67
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:36,240
Tell Yi to come tonight.

68
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,399
It is

69
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,360
also the date when your parents died.

70
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,320
Go to the ancestral temple

71
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,119
and burn incense for them.

72
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,279
And talk to them.

73
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:53,979
Um.

74
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:04,630
(Virtue and Respect)

75
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,960
Father. Mother.

76
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,760
Rest in peace.

77
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,559
I’m doing well with my grandmother.

78
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,975
(Virtue and Respect)

79
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,950
(Three Abodes of the East)

80
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,575
Hey.

81
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,480
Your Grace.

82
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,279
A female physician came to the capital

83
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,200
from Jinxi.

84
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,000
Even Minister Wang asked her
for treatment.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,119
Grand Empress Dowager heard
and summoned her.

86
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:42,239
She can prescribe some medicine for you.

87
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:44,040
She’s now waiting for you

88
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
to come back.

89
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,450
She must’ve been waiting for a while.

90
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:46,975
Yeah.

91
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,425
(Three Abodes of the East)

92
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,519
Are you from Jinxi?

93
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,559
Your Grace.

94
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,480
How is it? Is the capital fun?

95
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,959
It’s better than Jinxi for sure.

96
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,640
But the hometown feels more cordial.

97
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:05,825
Hey.

98
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,959
Do your people eat noodles with garlic?

99
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,839
You even know that.

100
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
I learned from a book.

101
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,325
Come.

102
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:18,975
Um.

103
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,679
This ointment smells like

104
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,519
the one I made for Qian.

105
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,679
Your Grace.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,760
The ointment on you is special.

107
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,200
It’s from my friend
for sprain treatment.

108
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,196
Oh.

109
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,519
I’ve been a physician for years,

110
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,720
but I’ve never smelled
anything like this.

111
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:02,775
Your Grace.

112
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,399
Can I have a look?

113
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,480
OK.

114
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,200
Qingke. Go get it.

115
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,700
Um.

116
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
It’s really the one I made for Qian.

117
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,399
So, the friend Qian mentioned

118
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,920
is Princess Jia’nan.

119
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:34,679
This ointment smells really special.

120
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,359
I smelled,

121
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:38,279
but I can’t tell its ingredients.

122
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,320
Your Grace.

123
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:44,679
I’ve learned about your condition.

124
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,000
I’m going to the royal physicians

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,519
and make a prescription.

126
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:48,920
When they review it,

127
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,959
the medicine will be made.

128
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:51,250
OK.

129
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,500
Qingke.

130
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,025
Um.

131
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:53,776
Reward her with silver.

132
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:54,400
Yes.

133
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,119
Your Grace.

134
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:59,880
I... I don’t want silver.

135
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,600
I’d like to ask you for a favor.

136
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,525
Go ahead.

137
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:13,959
Li Qian, the son of Li Changqing,
Commandant of Bingzhou,

138
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:16,480
is a third-rank armed guard.

139
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:20,279
I hope you can promote him.

140
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,559
You know little about the harem.

141
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,880
How can Her Grace promote
a bodyguard?

142
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,559
Who is he to you?

143
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,679
Why do you help him like this?

144
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:37,320
We grew up together.

145
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,359
Is he your brother?

146
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,880
How come you grew up together?

147
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,880
Is it a prenatal betrothal?

148
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
I can do nothing to help him.

149
00:07:59,279 --> 00:07:59,900
Qingke.

150
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:01,600
Reward her with silver.

151
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,200
Yes.

152
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,640
Go throw it.

153
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,079
Yes, Your Grace.

154
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,679
I’m gonna throw it.

155
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,279
No, maybe later.

156
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,559
It’s my birthday.

157
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,000
Grandmother is waiting for me.

158
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:28,725
Let’s go.

159
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,679
Yes.

160
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,640
Mother is punishing Baoning

161
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,599
in the name of that.

162
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,640
She’s reluctant

163
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,919
to let her be my queen.

164
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,640
Don’t be angry, Your Majesty.

165
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,359
Your health matters.

166
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,350
(Qinzheng Hall)

167
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,000
(Qinzheng Hall)
Well.

168
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,919
The maid arranged by Mother

169
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,440
might have known something.

170
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,679
Find a chance and get rid of her.

171
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,440
Don’t let me see her again.

172
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

173
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:07,080
(East Warmth Chamber)
How time flies.

174
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,200
The day Baoning came to the palace

175
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,400
was like yesterday.

176
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,239
Tell me.

177
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:16,880
What do you want for your birthday?

178
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,280
I’ll give you anything.

179
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,119
I wanna go to Empress Dowager’s banquet.

180
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:26,520
You just got punished.

181
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,000
Now you want to celebrate her birthday.

182
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,559
It is the Empress Dowager’s birthday.

183
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,599
You are an elder.

184
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,400
It’s fine if you won’t go.

185
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,359
But I...

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,599
I will be the queen.

187
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,840
I should show manners
before her.

188
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,559
And she just punished me.

189
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:45,080
If I don’t go to her birthday,

190
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:47,039
I cannot get along with her
in the future.

191
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,760
Yi, you heard that?

192
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,479
Baoning is so reasonable

193
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:52,799
and thoughtful.

194
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,159
She will definitely

195
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,280
be a good queen leading the harem.

196
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,760
Okay. Okay.

197
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,280
You can go if you want.

198
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,559
Grandmother.

199
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,039
In that case,

200
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,200
I’ll go to the Longevity Hill

201
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,599
with Baoning tomorrow.

202
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,000
I can take care of her.

203
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,359
You maid, what are you doing?

204
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,599
Song Xianyi?

205
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,479
Your Grace, please save me.

206
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:34,039
His Majesty

207
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,359
(Three Abodes of the East)
has a child with Fang Yiru

208
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,760
who was a maid before.

209
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,960
I got to know it coincidentally.

210
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,159
Now His Majesty can’t tolerate me.

211
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,200
Your Grace.

212
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:45,039
Only you can save me now.

213
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,000
Why don’t you go to Empress Dowager?

214
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,640
After all, she’s His Majesty’s mother.

215
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,080
It’s a disgrace to the royal family.

216
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,320
She won’t allow others
to know it either.

217
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,760
Are you sure

218
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,679
it’s His Majesty’s child?

219
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:01,760
Yes, I’m sure.

220
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,039
He wrote letters to Fang.

221
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,799
There was his seal on them.

222
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,440
I have one right here.

223
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,799
I’ve been taking it with me.

224
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,559
I may believe you for the time being.

225
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,599
Keep this letter well.

226
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:28,119
It’s the only thing
that can keep you alive.

227
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,280
Your Grace.

228
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,599
As long as I can live,

229
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,479
I’ll do anything for you.

230
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,280
This thing is big.

231
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:37,840
I must think it over.

232
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,479
I thought I could take advantage of

233
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,359
Fang Yiru’s matter,

234
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,440
yet Song Xianyi has known it as well.

235
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,479
My plan is disrupted.

236
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,919
Get out of my way! You wanna die?

237
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,280
Sir, please show me the pass.

238
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,675
(The Jin family’s eldest son in Jinxi,
Jin Xiao)

239
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,599
What pass?

240
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,440
I didn’t take it.

241
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,400
Get away. Get away.

242
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,799
Empress Dowager’s birthday is coming.

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,760
No entry if you can’t identify yourself.

244
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,280
Do you know the Jin family in Jinxi?

245
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,159
I’m the eldest son of the Jin family.

246
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,119
I come here

247
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,960
for celebrating
Empress Dowager Cao’s birthday.

248
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,479
No pass, no entry.

249
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,960
Please go back, sir.

250
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,200
You bonehead.

251
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,080
I’m warning you.

252
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,400
I’ve been riding for days.

253
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,719
I’m both hungry and thirsty.

254
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,799
Get out of my way,

255
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,200
or I’ll kill you.

256
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:29,799
Take him.

257
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,840
You...!

258
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,599
Stop it!

259
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,479
Li Qian.

260
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,919
I’m Li Qian, the Third-Rank Armed Guard

261
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,599
conferred by Empress Dowager.

262
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,080
He is really the son of Jin Haitao,

263
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,280
the commander
of Suibian Brigade in Jinxi.

264
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,919
He comes for Her Highness’s birthday

265
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,200
on behalf of the Jin family.

266
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,359
Could you let him in

267
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,200
for my sake?

268
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,000
Are you Mr. Li

269
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,239
who saved Her Highness with bare hands?

270
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,000
Since you can guarantee it,

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,840
I’ll let him go.

272
00:12:59,275 --> 00:12:59,844
Pass.

273
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,159
Thanks.

274
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,960
You’re good, Li Qian.

275
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,280
You just came days earlier than me.

276
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,440
Are you already an officer?

277
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,880
Let’s go.

278
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:07,679
Go.

279
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,119
Sure. Let’s go.

280
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:12,420
Come on.

281
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,159
Have some drinks and meat.

282
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,599
Take it as a reception.

283
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,400
Li.

284
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,799
We both come for
Empress Dowager Cao’s birthday,

285
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,719
yet you look like a host.

286
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,320
You are the third-rank guard now.

287
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,880
You’ve changed indeed.

288
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,599
Are you implying something?

289
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,440
I won’t pay

290
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,760
for the drinks and meat.

291
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,520
Sounds like I can’t afford it.

292
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,000
Come on. Eat as you please.

293
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,919
I can even

294
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,799
buy this restaurant as a gift for you.

295
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,280
Put it away quickly.

296
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:45,719
This is the capital.

297
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,479
There are nobles everywhere.

298
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:48,760
It’s not like Jinxi.

299
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,799
Sounds like I’m not a noble.

300
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,919
Look.

301
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,640
You don’t need to get me a reception.

302
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,320
Take this

303
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,479
as a celebration of your promotion.

304
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,039
Today, we won’t go back until drunk.

305
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:01,940
Cheers.

306
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:13,799
Qian.

307
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,640
I’ve packed your luggage up.

308
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,544
Leave these trivial matters
to me afterwards.

309
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:23,359
You also said they were
just trivial matters.

310
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,200
Qian.

311
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,119
Be very careful

312
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,840
on your way to the Longevity Hill.

313
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,575
Um.

314
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,400
Well, Qian.

315
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,039
How is your friend who got sprained?

316
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:40,200
I believe she’s fine

317
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,280
after using your medicine.

318
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:56,119
Is your friend Princess Jia’nan?

319
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,280
How did you know?

320
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,440
That day, Grand Empress Dowager
summoned me for treatment.

321
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:04,760
I saw the ointment coincidentally

322
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,840
and I knew it.

323
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:06,525
Oh.

324
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,760
Qian.

325
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:12,119
You work in the palace now.

326
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,440
Looks like you are close to her.

327
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:18,200
That princess did help me a lot.

328
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:19,080
And

329
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,880
she’s different from what I thought.

330
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:22,640
Whatever,

331
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,039
she’s a princess.

332
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:27,760
The Li family is too humble.

333
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,159
Alright.

334
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,359
It’s getting late.

335
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:31,400
I’ve packed up.

336
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,440
Go back to rest now.

337
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,200
I’m leaving for the Longevity Hill

338
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,520
tomorrow morning.

339
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,200
Alright.

340
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,375
Go to bed early.

341
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:38,900
Um.

342
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:54,975
(Gate of Divine Might)

343
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:56,320
All set?

344
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,960
Get the carriages ready!

345
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,039
Wait.

346
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,919
Is this His Majesty’s carriage?

347
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:04,919
Yes, my lady.

348
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,520
It’s all set.

349
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,039
His Majesty will take
this carriage with you.

350
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,599
Looks like you have to take another one.

351
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:15,039
Never mind.

352
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,719
I have no mood to argue with you.

353
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:40,225
(Radiant Cloud)

354
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,479
Li Qian

355
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,080
is supposed to have arrived at this inn.

356
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,320
That lady should’ve come along.

357
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,559
Forget him.

358
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,056
Li Qian?

359
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:10,719
Really?

360
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,880
It’s really you.

361
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,199
Why are you here?

362
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,280
That should be my question.

363
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,439
You don’t have to come here

364
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:36,280
for the birthday.

365
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,160
Why do you come?

366
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,000
Are you afraid

367
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,760
Empress Dowager would distrust us

368
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,839
if our family turns against her?

369
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:47,280
To win her full trust,

370
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,239
you must offend
the Jiang family thoroughly.

371
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:49,839
Only this way

372
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,000
will Empress Dowager Cao thinks

373
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,920
you can merely rely on her in the court.

374
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
That’s why I come.

375
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,479
Since you come to help me,

376
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,599
do you have any good ideas?

377
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:07,400
No good ideas.

378
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,040
But wait a moment.

379
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,200
Oh.

380
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:19,959
My things don’t need upgrading.

381
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,000
And this ointment.

382
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,520
I wonder where it came from.

383
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,280
I won’t use it.

384
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,760
No...

385
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,280
- That’s all.
- I...

386
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,000
Leave.

387
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:33,434
But...

388
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,560
What’s wrong again?

389
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:47,560
It’s so hot,

390
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,959
and my residence hasn’t yet
been arranged.

391
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,439
Who is in charge here?

392
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:54,439
Eunuch Min who serves Her Highness.

393
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:57,475
Xiaoman.

394
00:18:57,475 --> 00:18:58,119
Your Grace.

395
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,119
Call Min Zhou here.

396
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,239
Your Grace.

397
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:16,719
I’m Min Xi, the Document Manager here.

398
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,319
I wanted Min Zhou,

399
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,760
yet you got me
an Eighth-Rank Document Manager.

400
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:24,439
I’ve been waiting for long

401
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,760
and got such a person.

402
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,680
Are you trying to

403
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,560
humiliate me?

404
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,525
Your Grace.

405
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,719
Eunuch Min... He accompanied
Her Highness

406
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:34,599
to the Dehui Hall.

407
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,680
I told you to get me
the person in charge.

408
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,520
Look at you.

409
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,760
You got me

410
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,359
someone who knows nothing.

411
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,280
Go tell His Majesty

412
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:46,880
that Min Zhou doesn’t obey my order.

413
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,839
I’m gonna punish him.

414
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,359
He’d better not speak up for him.

415
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,439
Or he will feel sorry.

416
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:53,599
Yes, Your Grace.

417
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,959
Your Grace, I’m taking him away now.

418
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,920
Go.

419
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,520
Your Grace.

420
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,040
Eunuch Min really doesn’t have time.

421
00:19:58,175 --> 00:19:59,800
- How about I go to look for him again?
- Move.

422
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,319
Move.

423
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,160
Your Grace! Your Grace!

424
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,560
How did you do that?

425
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,199
Not to mention His Majesty.

426
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,319
Even it’s Her Highness,

427
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,719
as long as it’s not about politics,

428
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,680
no one dares to disobey her.

429
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,600
Eunuch Liu.

430
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,280
I barely serve here.

431
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,719
I didn’t know the rules
and offended her.

432
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,500
I’m going to find him now.

433
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,439
It’s not the road to that pavilion.

434
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,719
Aren’t we going back to the princess?

435
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,000
I’m going to tell His Majesty.

436
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:36,560
His Majesty will speak up for me

437
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,319
for the sake that

438
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,479
I serve the Empress Dowager.

439
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,760
Maybe Her Grace won’t be angry.

440
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,119
It’s been deployed
at the Tempe of Gratitude.

441
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,800
The Waterfowl Ships
at the bottom of the lake

442
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:56,760
will go ashore from here.

443
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,450
Um.

444
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,239
Your Majesty.

445
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:02,959
Min Zhou asks for audience.

446
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,800
It’s said
that he offended Princess Jia’nan.

447
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,040
Princess Jia’nan?

448
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:09,319
Call him here.

449
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:10,369
Yes.

450
00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:21,959
Your Majesty.

451
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,760
Your Majesty, please save me.

452
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:27,959
You serve the Empress Dowager,

453
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:29,719
but how dare you trespass here?

454
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,079
You bastard.

455
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:34,400
You failed to look after the princess.

456
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:35,719
What’s the use of you?

457
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,920
Your Majesty.

458
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,719
I know

459
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:41,400
my sin is unforgivable.

460
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:43,560
Empress Dowager’s birthday
is around the corner.

461
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,599
Please ask Her Grace

462
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,599
to punish me after the birthday banquet.

463
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,680
Please allow me to share the bliss.

464
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
Your Majesty.

465
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,839
You dare say the Empress Dowager...

466
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,640
Your Majesty.

467
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,479
Lord Min offended the princess.

468
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,040
It’s unforgivable indeed.

469
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,119
But Lord Min did make sense.

470
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,199
Her Highness’s birthday is coming.

471
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,800
No blood shall be shed.

472
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,640
It’s not late to punish him

473
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,640
after Her Highness’s birthday.

474
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:09,319
Your Majesty.

475
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,839
You will not die,

476
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,880
but you must be punished.

477
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,520
You shall apologize
to Princess Jia’nan today.

478
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,560
Or else,

479
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,959
even though it’s my mother’s
birthday tomorrow,

480
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,560
you will not be spared.

481
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

482
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:43,040
I’m privileged to see you, Your Grace.

483
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,520
Your Grace.

484
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,800
It was my fault just now.

485
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:57,880
His majesty asked me to apologize
and make up to you.

486
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,239
I’m willing to accept any punishment

487
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,640
as long as it makes you pleased.

488
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,959
Has my residence been arranged?

489
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,760
To assure your comfort,

490
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,839
all the residences in Longevity Hill

491
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,040
are decorated according to

492
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,680
Your Grace’s bedroom in the palace.

493
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,520
Your Grace,

494
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,920
you’ve come at short notice.

495
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:21,479
We’re still cleaning up
the Qingshou House.

496
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:25,000
Please have a rest for a while
in the pavilion.

497
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,000
I’d like to stay in Qingshan House.

498
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,880
I lived in there before.

499
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,920
The location and scenery are nice.

500
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,560
Your Grace.

501
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:39,319
Qingshan House
is close to the opera stage.

502
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,839
We’ll have it cleaned out

503
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:43,000
for the Internal and
External Titled Madams

504
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,239
to apply makeup and rest.

505
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,000
If you live in there,

506
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,319
it will break the rules

507
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,079
and destroy the tradition.

508
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,439
Do you come to apologize

509
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:54,319
or to upset me?

510
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:57,000
Do I need your permission
to choose my residence?

511
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:00,079
Throw him in the lake.

512
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,599
Your Grace.

513
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:04,239
Your Grace. Your Grace!

514
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,599
Your Grace. Spare me. Your Grace!

515
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,680
Your Grace. Spare me!

516
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,160
Your Grace! Your Grace!

517
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Your Grace. Spare me! Your Grace.

518
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,439
Your Grace. Please spare me!

519
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:17,119
Li Qian, you’re quick.

520
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:19,359
Your Grace. Spare me. Spare me!

521
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,479
Come to help.

522
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:35,599
Come to help.
Someone fell into the water.

523
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,280
Help!

524
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,040
What’s happening?

525
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,439
- Hurry! Help him.
- Help!

526
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:39,760
It’s Lord Min.

527
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,160
Lord Min fell into the water.

528
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,719
Help me.

529
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,280
- Lord Min.
- Lord Min.

530
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,199
Lord Min.

531
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,439
- Get a blanket.
- Yes.

532
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,520
Your Grace.

533
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,359
How’s Lord Min…

534
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:13,280
Lord Min, you’re awake.

535
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:15,880
What on earth is going on?

536
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,920
It’s Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

537
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:20,119
Lord Min offended her.

538
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,520
She asked her men

539
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,400
to throw him in the lake.

540
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,239
He won’t die.

541
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,280
But, after all, he is aged.

542
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:30,239
Take him to the hospital.

543
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:31,880
Yes. Yes.

544
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:44,199
I’m privileged to see Your Grace.

545
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,520
I know I saved the man
who deserved to be punished.

546
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Please show mercy and forgive me.

547
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,760
I’m Li Qian, Imperial Guard.

548
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,400
Please show mercy and forgive me.

549
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:26,000
Young Master.

550
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,560
Young Master.

551
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,119
Her Grace left.

552
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,560
Why are you still kneeling?

553
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,520
I offended Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

554
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,680
I can’t just get up and leave.

555
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,640
If there’re no officials of high rank

556
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,359
who would ask her to spare me,

557
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,640
I’m afraid I’ll end up

558
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,680
like Lord Min.

559
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:45,880
Young Master.

560
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,199
Where can we find

561
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:48,719
a high-ranking official now?

562
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,839
Commander of the Imperial Guards,
Cao Guozhu.

563
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:53,675
Okay.

564
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,479
I’m going to visit Lord Cao now.

565
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,079
Lord Min, I’m going to
ask for the doctor now.

566
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:05,750
Well,

567
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,760
you send some men

568
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,119
to clean up Qingshan House
as soon as possible.

569
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,719
So Her Grace can stay in there.

570
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:16,599
Then find a side hall.

571
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,400
It’s better to be close to the stage.

572
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,199
Her Grace and titled Madams

573
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:25,040
can fix their make-up

574
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,959
and rest in there.

575
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,800
Lord Min.

576
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,239
Is it appropriate?

577
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,439
As long as Her Grace is pleased,

578
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:34,680
nothing matters.

579
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,560
Go. Hurry up.

580
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,119
Yes.

581
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,640
Mr. Cao.

582
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,439
Please help my young master.

583
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:45,400
What’s wrong?

584
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,560
We were patrolling near Qingxin Lake

585
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,239
when we saw Lord Min
fell into the water.

586
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,000
Seeing he was almost drowned,

587
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,640
Young Master jumped in the lake
and saved him.

588
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,560
But only after he saved him,

589
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,920
did he know Min was punished

590
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,920
by Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

591
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:00,959
Now Young Master
is kneeling by the lake

592
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:01,839
and dares not get up.

593
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Min Zhou is

594
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,880
a favorite with the Empress Dowager.

595
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:17,400
I must tell the Empress Dowager first.

596
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,484
Come on.

597
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,079
Go to Dehui Hall with me.

598
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:21,750
Yes.

599
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,150
(Dehui Hall)

600
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:30,800
You wait here outside.

601
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,875
Yes.

602
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,179
Your Highness.

603
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,839
Why are you in such a hurry?

604
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:37,650
Your Highness.

605
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:40,160
Min Zhou offended
Commandery Princess Jia’nan,

606
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,079
and was thrown in the lake by her men.

607
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,839
Li Qian also offended the princess

608
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,160
for saving Min Zhou.

609
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,239
He’s now kneeling by the lake.

610
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,125
Now,

611
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:49,839
you’re our only prop.

612
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,040
Please help him.

613
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:57,000
Commandery Princess Jia’nan
was angry with me.

614
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,880
Min Zhou was just her punching bag.

615
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,839
I’m troubled over
winning over the Li Family.

616
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,680
Why don’t I take this opportunity
to do them a favor?

617
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,079
What do you say?

618
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:10,760
Yes. Your Highness.

619
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,425
Then, I’ll…

620
00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:11,975
Well,

621
00:29:12,225 --> 00:29:12,850
no hurry.

622
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:17,760
I’m tired from
reading the memorials to the throne.

623
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:21,640
Why don’t you have tea with me?

624
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,000
We can have a talk.

625
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,000
Yes.

626
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,680
We’ll let them know

627
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,439
who is the real prop.

628
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,880
You’re getting smarter.

629
00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:35,479
Hurry.

630
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,325
Hurry up.

631
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,359
- Min is quite sensible.
- Your Grace.

632
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,359
- They’re still moving out the things
- Hurry up. Be quick.

633
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,439
used for resting other titled women.

634
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:46,439
But the house should’ve been cleaned up.

635
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:47,760
Good.

636
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,920
I heard the Princess had just
punished a third-rank guard.

637
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:05,319
Why nobody steps in?

638
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,040
He’s been kneeling for two hours.

639
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,560
His knees must hurt like hell.

640
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,520
I heard he’s been promoted
by the Empress Dowager.

641
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,319
Why doesn’t Lord Cao step in?

642
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,839
If he keeps kneeling like this,

643
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,079
his legs are going to be disabled.

644
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:28,150
Li Qian.

645
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,959
I didn’t expect that Princess Jia’nan

646
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,280
was so grumpy.

647
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,560
The Empress Dowager knows about it.

648
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,079
She said you were wronged.

649
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,160
Her Highness has sent someone

650
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,319
to Princess Jia’nan

651
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,079
to put in a good word for you.

652
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,920
Come on. Get up.

653
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,125
Be careful.

654
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,560
The Jiang Family is such a bully.

655
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,920
Sooner or later,

656
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,239
I’ll teach them a lesson.

657
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,119
Shut up.

658
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,800
We’re at the Longevity Hill.

659
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:55,600
Come.

660
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:19,359
Li Qian.

661
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,280
Have you got into the habit of
climbing through my window?

662
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,920
I thought you were waiting for me

663
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
with the window open.

664
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,640
Put it down.

665
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,300
(Secret Crossbow Strategy)
Who are you to eat it?

666
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,560
Don’t flatter yourself.

667
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,450
Your Grace.

668
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,439
I didn’t abuse the confidence
you’ve placed in me.

669
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,119
I’ve won Cao Guozhu’s trust.

670
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,079
That’s all you want to say?

671
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:48,575
Yeah.

672
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:52,319
Shouldn’t I tell you

673
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,439
so that you can rest assured?

674
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,760
OK. I get it.

675
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,629
Leave.

676
00:31:59,325 --> 00:31:59,925
Yeah.

677
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:02,625
Hey.

678
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:11,000
I know your knee hurt.

679
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:12,719
Apply it to the wound.

680
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,760
You’re clumsy-handed.

681
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,560
After returning to the capital,

682
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:21,400
ask your little wife to do it.

683
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,520
I have neither a wife nor a concubine.

684
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:31,119
What do you mean by that?

685
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,000
Isn’t Miss Gao, who checked my pulse,

686
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,760
your intended wife?

687
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,359
Of course not.

688
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:43,640
She is the niece
of my father’s military counsellor.

689
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,680
Her parents were both dead
since she was a child.

690
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,400
She lives in our house
with her uncle since then.

691
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,040
She is my sworn sister.

692
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:51,850
Oh.

693
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,040
I see.

694
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,359
Take a seat.

695
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,050
What?

696
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,920
Take a seat.

697
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:00,675
Yes.

698
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:08,680
You were hurt because of me.

699
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,280
I’ll condescend to

700
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,359
apply the unguent for you.

701
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,560
No, don’t bother.

702
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,479
Sit down.

703
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,680
The ice dew made in the kitchen
of Longevity Hill

704
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,400
is really nice.

705
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,439
Your Grace.

706
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:37,599
It surely isn’t made in here.

707
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,239
The Grand Empress Dowager
specially let us

708
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:40,560
bring it from the palace.

709
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,160
Why haven’t I tasted it in the palace?

710
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,680
It’s a new dessert.

711
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,839
Her Highness likes it.

712
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,280
So she asked us to take some for you.

713
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
Although it’s called ice dew,

714
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,079
it’s cooked with warm supplementation.

715
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:56,800
Your Grace.

716
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,439
His majesty let me bring her to you.

717
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:00,839
In the next few days,

718
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,199
you stay here to serve Her Grace.

719
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,760
Yes, sir.

720
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:05,700
Your Grace,

721
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,920
His Majesty still needs me.

722
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,679
I must excuse myself now.

723
00:34:10,075 --> 00:34:10,700
Oh.

724
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,199
You can live in the wing-room
of the Qingshan House.

725
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,400
Yes.

726
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,800
Thank you, Your Grace.

727
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,600
You may leave now.

728
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,919
Yes.

729
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,439
I’ve managed to

730
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:40,080
ask His Majesty for you this time.

731
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:41,025
And you may

732
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:42,919
at least stay here
till after the birthday party.

733
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
But even I can protect you for a while,

734
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,600
I can’t protect you forever.

735
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,159
Please help me, Your Grace.

736
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,520
I don’t want to die.

737
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:58,479
It seems that this is the only way.

738
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:01,320
You go to tell
the Empress Dowager about it.

739
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:04,150
But Her Highness

740
00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:06,879
wouldn’t care for a servant’s life.

741
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,760
Her Highness gives you to
His Majesty as a concubine.

742
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,159
She owns you.

743
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,199
Fang Yiru is owned by His Majesty.

744
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,919
If you tell Her Highness about it,

745
00:35:15,919 --> 00:35:16,639
she wouldn’t want

746
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,159
Fang to go back to the palace.

747
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,439
But after the baby is born,

748
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,000
it will need a status.

749
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:23,760
Yes.

750
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,840
The eldest son of the Emperor

751
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,399
needs a justifiable mother.

752
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,800
So,

753
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,600
you go and beg Her Highness

754
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,919
to let you be the nominal mother
of the eldest son.

755
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,000
With that status, His Majesty
dares not touch you.

756
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,120
Thank you for your advice.

757
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:43,520
It’s a risky move to help Song Xianyi.

758
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,520
Besides,

759
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,959
although Li Qian has won the trust
of Empress Dowager Cao,

760
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,320
to secure a smooth transition,

761
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,600
Fang is the key person.

762
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,479
How dare the Emperor

763
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:56,479
write private letters to a maid

764
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,879
and keep her outside the palace?

765
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,919
What is he thinking?

766
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:02,360
Your Highness.

767
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,959
I recommend myself to raise
the eldest son of the Emperor.

768
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,560
I pledge allegiance to Your Highness.

769
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:11,360
Why should I trust you

770
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:13,760
and let you be the nurturer

771
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,399
of the unborn prince?

772
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:17,800
With a humble birth,

773
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,080
I can be the Emperor’s concubine

774
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,800
only because of Your Highness’s favor.

775
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:24,159
I’m infertile.

776
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:26,399
I will never have my own children.

777
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,959
It’s also for Your Highness’s sake that

778
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:32,199
I raise the eldest son of His Majesty.

779
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,320
I will never agree

780
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,479
the Emperor to bring the maid
back to the palace.

781
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:45,399
You seem to be the best person

782
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,360
to raise the eldest son right now.

783
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,840
Whatever.

784
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,280
I’ll make an exception

785
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:58,560
and promote you from Lady-in-Waiting
to Talent Lady.

786
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,919
It makes the whole thing
right and proper.

787
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,399
Thank you, Your Highness.

788
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,040
Well, you may leave now.

789
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:09,075
Yes.

790
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,439
Your Highness,
what else can I do?

791
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:16,360
Send some top masters

792
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,719
to take Fang Yiru to me.

793
00:37:18,775 --> 00:37:19,325
Yes.

794
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:49,840
Your Grace, what’re you doing here?

795
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,560
Are you alone in the room?

796
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,280
Yes, I’m alone.

797
00:37:56,919 --> 00:37:58,199
Come in, so we can talk.

798
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:09,500
Where is she?

799
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:16,520
How did you get in?

800
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,080
You didn’t make any noise
climbing through the window.

801
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,080
You just said you’re alone.

802
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,760
Why do I get in through the window?

803
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,840
I can get in through the door.

804
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,919
It sounds reasonable.

805
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,040
So, what can I do for you?

806
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,120
My uncle asked me to tell you,

807
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:38,360
on the night of the operation,

808
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,520
when the lanterns
outside Cao Guozhu’s house

809
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,840
become six-linked-pearl lanterns,

810
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,040
it means he’s been eradicated.

811
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,360
You can take action, then.

812
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:47,959
But Cao is the commander
of Longevity Hill.

813
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:50,399
It’s not easy to kill him.

814
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,159
The Machinist Contest was organized

815
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,959
by the master of the Mechanism Pavilion
at the request of His Majesty.

816
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,840
The contest levels were set to

817
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,280
help the master solve the problem

818
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,760
of the Waterfowl Ship.

819
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,840
The ship is built to

820
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,159
help them sneak in from the lake

821
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,280
when the birthday banquet is held,

822
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:07,719
so they’ll get the opportunity
to kill Cao.

823
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,150
Oh.

824
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
I get it.

825
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:12,625
Um.

826
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:18,975
Hey,

827
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,280
help me to deliver this.

828
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:27,959
It takes a night to return to the
capital spurring on the flying horse.

829
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,439
My family has our own carrier pigeons.

830
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:30,919
We can use a pigeon.

831
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,199
Empress Dowager Cao knows about

832
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,760
the thing between
His Majesty and Fang Yiru.

833
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,320
Before His Majesty regains power,

834
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,479
we must make sure that Fang

835
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:37,679
arrives at Longevity Hill safely

836
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,360
on the night of the operation.

837
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,080
You know, it’s very important.

838
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,239
You must make sure it’s delivered.

839
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:43,196
Yeah.

840
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,479
- Rest assured.
- Li.

841
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,280
Li.

842
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:49,120
Li.

843
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:51,610
Li.

844
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:58,479
He’s not on duty.

845
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,879
Where the hell has he been?

846
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,399
Well,

847
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,479
I said what I have to say.

848
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,000
And,

849
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,159
the gilding ball,

850
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:26,000
I want it now.

851
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,800
Since you’ve done hard work on
improving it, I reluctantly accept it.

852
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,325
Wait for a second.

853
00:40:37,325 --> 00:40:37,900
Here.

854
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,760
Hey, Your Grace.

855
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:48,400
Um?

856
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,679
There’s no one outside.

857
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,000
Why do you climb through the window?

858
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,399
Just go out through the door.

859
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,320
You needn’t remind me.

860
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,280
You must come back alive.

861
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:17,040
Don’t worry, Your Grace.

862
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,800
I will come back alive.

863
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:25,225
(Oil Shop)

864
00:41:37,825 --> 00:41:38,719
Abortion prevention medicine.

865
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:08,075
(Thousand Buddha Hall)

866
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:28,040
The Empress Dowager arrives.

867
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,399
Mother, I wish you boundless fortune.

868
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,840
May you live forever.

869
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,439
We wish Your Highness a long life.

870
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,520
My beloved deputies, as you were.

871
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

872
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:59,600
For Your Highness’s birthday banquet,

873
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,159
I specially asked craftsmen
to made a precious vase

874
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:04,479
as a present.

875
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,280
I wish Your Highness a good fortune

876
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,879
and enjoy a flourished country.

877
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:13,479
Show me the vase.

878
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,399
Dragon pattern.

879
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,150
Mother,

880
00:43:47,439 --> 00:43:49,000
the vase is delicate.

881
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,159
It looks like Mr. Zhang really

882
00:43:52,879 --> 00:43:54,280
put a lot of thought
into your birthday banquet.

883
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,399
Mr. Zhang, thank you.

884
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,399
I’m honored, Your Highness.

885
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,600
Today, taking advantage of
my birthday banquet,

886
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:07,280
I have an announcement.

887
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,639
The emperor has ascended the throne
for a long time.

888
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:14,679
You’ve also advised me many times

889
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,639
that we should
appoint the empress early,

890
00:44:19,399 --> 00:44:22,560
so that she would give birth to heirs

891
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:24,320
to inherit the throne.

892
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,520
