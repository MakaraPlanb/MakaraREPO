Where’s Qian?

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,600
Him?

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,520
He’s there to pay respects
to Grand Empress Dowager.

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,120
I knew it!

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,040
He’s still obsessed with Jiang Baoning!

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,680
Li Changqing!

33
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:23,500
What?

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,840
I have to get it off my chest!

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,400
You know what?

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,880
The meal can wait.

37
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,000
We need to talk.

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,000
Isn’t it true

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,080
that Grand Empress Dowager

40
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,600
treated Princess

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,440
and our son well?

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,120
He’s obligated

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,240
to pay his respects

44
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,840
at her memorial service.

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,400
You can’t blame him for that.

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,480
Cuihua,

47
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,760
it’s not that

48
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,560
he can’t go.

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
I know.

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,280
You just don’t want him to see Princess

51
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,680
because you’re still
holding a grudge, right?

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,880
Her family owes us.

53
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,520
Darling,

54
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,680
I’ve tried

55
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,000
to reason with you

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,880
in front of Qian last time.

57
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,680
Clearly, nothing I say

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,600
will change your mind.

59
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,920
In that case,

60
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,920
if Qian and Princess break up for real

61
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,120
and cut all ties,

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,760
will you let go

63
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,080
of the past?

64
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,800
No way!

65
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
That’s what I’m saying.

66
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,600
Their breakup won’t
make you feel better.

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,520
But you don’t want them
to be together, either.

68
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,040
Are you going to
live in the past forever?

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,760
The bottom line is

70
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,080
my son can’t be with

71
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,440
our mortal enemy’s daughter!

72
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,880
You have a point.

73
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,360
But you’ve seen

74
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,480
how lost and heartbroken he was

75
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,720
when he and Princess were separated

76
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,440
over the past few days.

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,360
I feel bad for him.

78
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,080
Don’t you? You’re his father!

79
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,920
Would you rather see

80
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,200
his life be ruined like that?

81
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,279
Darling,

82
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Zhang Xiuhe is gone.

83
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,400
Whatever happened in the past,

84
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,000
truth will prevail eventually.

85
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,240
If the Jiang Family were really guilty,

86
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,240
Qian would have behaved with integrity

87
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,800
and had the gut to tell you.

88
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,960
You always say he’s just like you.

89
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,120
Can’t you trust him for once?

90
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,360
Besides,

91
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,240
if someone else is the real culprit,

92
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,250
then we’re all wrong about Princess.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
Even so,

94
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,400
she’s tolerant enough

95
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,600
to forgive us.

96
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,080
Does that give you a sense of closure?

97
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,520
Fine. All right.

98
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,720
Anyway,

99
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,800
a thorough investigation is needed.

100
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,560
We’ll see if the Jiang Family

101
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,120
is proved innocent.

102
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,440
Li Changqing!

103
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,520
Have I been talking to a stone
for so long?

104
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,880
Were you even listening to me?

105
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,680
I know

106
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
they’re good kids.

107
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,520
Exactly!

108
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,640
They really are.

109
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
You need to have faith in

110
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,400
Qian and Princess

111
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,880
that they’ll work things out.

112
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,960
Time will heal old wounds.

113
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,840
I hate to see you

114
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,280
bending the brow over this every day.

115
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,440
All I want

116
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,280
is for you to be happy.

117
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,680
Please?

118
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,680
You two, over there.

119
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,160
Yes.

120
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,760
You guys, this way.

121
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

122
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,000
And you.

123
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Yes. Right there.

124
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,240
- Yes.
- Yes.

125
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,480
Focus and be on full alert.

126
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,360
Keep the following rules in mind.

127
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,560
We’ve had men on guard outside.

128
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,280
Stewardess Meng is with them now.

129
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,600
Last night’s incident
won’t happen again.

130
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,200
Luckily, Marquis Jinghai
was here to help.

131
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,720
Lord Xin comes to pay respects.

132
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,160
Let him in.

133
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,160
He ought to mourn
for the loss of a senior.

134
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,080
Yes.

135
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,920
What are you doing here?

136
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,360
Get out!

137
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,880
Baoning,

138
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,560
I can explain.

139
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,720
I wish to pay respects to Her Highness.

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,120
That’s all.

141
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,560
You shouldn’t be here.

142
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,760
Go away!

143
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,560
- Baoning!
- Out!

144
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,360
- Hear me out...
- Now!

145
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,900
I’ll go.

146
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,560
- Get out now!
- I will. I’m leaving.

147
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:15,025
Baoning!

148
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:15,680
- Baoning!
- Your Highness!

149
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,760
Please don’t come ever again, Lord Xin.

150
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,080
You’ll only make Princess uncomfortable.

151
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,120
You’d better leave, Lord Xin.

152
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,040
Baoning is having a mental breakdown.

153
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,920
You should stay away from her for now.

154
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,240
Take Princess back to her room.

155
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,360
Call in the physician.

156
00:08:35,175 --> 00:08:35,919
Baoning...

157
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:51,150
(Li’s Mansion)

158
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,800
Young Master.

159
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,200
Young Master.

160
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,175
Yes?

161
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,880
What have you found?

162
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,520
Chief Physician who examined
Her Highness’s body

163
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,560
has retired.

164
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,040
I was told
he had left the capital overnight

165
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,880
without saying goodbye
to any of his colleagues.

166
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,600
No one knows about his whereabouts.

167
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,800
What did other physicians say?

168
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,480
Young Master,

169
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,960
according to the rules,

170
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,120
only Chief Physician
can do the examination.

171
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,160
Other physicians were there

172
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,920
only as assistants.

173
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,720
When I checked with them,

174
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
they said Chief Physician

175
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,840
followed the standard procedure.

176
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,960
Nothing struck them as odd.

177
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,720
They couldn’t say

178
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,040
if his diagnosis was accurate, though.

179
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,560
What about the medical service
and prescription records?

180
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,840
They’ve been reviewed

181
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
but nothing sticks out.

182
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,760
However, Chief Physician

183
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,600
did leave with

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,080
his private record.

185
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,040
Her Highness seemed fine

186
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,840
when I left yesterday.

187
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
How come...?

188
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,800
Chief Physician insisted

189
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,160
that she died of a heart attack
induced by rage

190
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,240
and he disappeared

191
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
only a day later after her death

192
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,120
with his private record.

193
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,200
That doesn’t make sense.

194
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,880
What do you want me to do, Young Master?

195
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
Bring him to me at all costs.

196
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,320
I need to question him.

197
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,240
Yes.

198
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,920
- Go away!
- Baoning!

199
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,920
- Out!
- Hear me out...

200
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,550
- Now!
- I’ll go. I’m leaving.

201
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,560
Baoning!

202
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,600
- Your Highness!
- Baoning!

203
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,465
I have to see her.

204
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,270
Here it is, Your Highness.

205
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,440
I have to remind you again

206
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,120
that if you take this,

207
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:06,445
you’ll lose your baby.

208
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,355
You’re finally awake, Baoning!

209
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,070
Give her the medicine.

210
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,575
Oh.

211
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,080
What is it? It stinks.

212
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,320
Baoning,

213
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,200
it’s to prevent miscarriage.

214
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,450
What?

215
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,880
Congratulations! You’re pregnant.

216
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,080
If Her Highness knew,

217
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,000
she’d be thrilled!

218
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,120
Are you sure?

219
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,760
Yes, Your Highness.

220
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,400
You’re two months pregnant.

221
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Your grief and fatigue

222
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,840
have affected the baby

223
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,960
but medication can help with that.

224
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,080
Take the medicine now, Your Highness.

225
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,400
A new member will join us next year.

226
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,480
That’s right, Your Highness.

227
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,520
I’ve prepared candied fruit.

228
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,880
Take it now.

229
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,120
Baoning, it’s getting cold.

230
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,020
You can go except for the physician.

231
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,520
Give me medicine for abortion.

232
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,800
What...?

233
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,400
Yes.

234
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,520
How far is she pregnant?

235
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,400
Uh...

236
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,480
Almost two months, my lord.

237
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,960
How dare you!

238
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,920
If anything happens to Baoning,

239
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,240
there will be dire consequences!

240
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,240
Stop!

241
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,920
He was following my order.

242
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,840
Baoning...

243
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,680
What do you mean?

244
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,360
It’s our baby, Baoning!

245
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,600
I know

246
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
there are unresolved issues between us,

247
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,920
but this baby
might be a gift from heaven.

248
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,520
It’s here

249
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,200
to help bring us back together.

250
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,120
How could you be so cruel?

251
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,360
I should ask you that.

252
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,880
How did we end up like this?

253
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,480
I’ve made it clear.

254
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,400
It’s done.

255
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
We’re over.

256
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,360
Just go.

257
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,160
What happened in this room

258
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,080
stays in this room.

259
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,880
Yes. I understand.

260
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,320
Your Highness.

261
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,280
Something big happened
at Shoukang Palace last night.

262
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,560
What could it be?

263
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,920
I heard

264
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,495
Princess Jia’nan was given medicine
for her baby.

265
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,120
What?

266
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,960
She’s pregnant?

267
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,680
Followed by medicine for abortion.

268
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:36,800
Did she have it?

269
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,000
I asked the physician about it

270
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,800
but got nothing.

271
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,520
Well, someone did see Lord Xin

272
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,320
storm off from there.

273
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,800
So the baby must’ve been gone.

274
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,080
Your Highness,

275
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,360
they’re breaking up just as we expected.

276
00:15:56,575 --> 00:15:58,775
Let’s go pay Gao Miaorong a visit.

277
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,720
It’s time for her to step in.

278
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,480
She’s strong

279
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,960
and treated well.

280
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,120
A full recovery can be expected.

281
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,200
Very well. You may leave.

282
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,080
Yes.

283
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,000
I owe you

284
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,960
more than I could repay, Your Highness.

285
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,680
You want to pay me back?

286
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,120
There’s a chance coming your way.

287
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,480
Can you do me a small favor?

288
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,600
May I ask

289
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,600
what that is?

290
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,880
Come closer.

291
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,400
Your Highness,

292
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,280
that... that’s a capital crime!

293
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,440
Relax.

294
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,480
I’ve paved the way from top to bottom.

295
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,800
The rest is easy.

296
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,360
No one will notice anything

297
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,480
or use it against you.

298
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,400
But...

299
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Is there a problem?

300
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,600
Or you don’t want to help me?

301
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,400
I...

302
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:52,440
Greetings.

303
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,800
Please.

304
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Who are you?

305
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,080
Imperial Hospital had us
decoct herbs for Princess.

306
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,240
Wrong place.

307
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,360
Here isn’t the decocting room.

308
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,320
Follow me.

309
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Don’t wander around.

310
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,320
Yes.

311
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,280
(East Warmth Chamber)
Who’s on duty outside?

312
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,240
(East Warmth Chamber)
Someone must stay

313
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,440
(East Warmth Chamber)
when Princess is away.

314
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,840
How come they left you alone?

315
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,040
What are they doing?

316
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,200
I know, right?

317
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,225
Please, Marquis.

318
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:30,880
I heard Princess Jia’nan fainted
during mourning yesterday.

319
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,400
How is she now?

320
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,480
She was overwhelmed
and weakened by grief.

321
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,760
Medication will help her recover soon.

322
00:19:42,325 --> 00:19:44,125
Show me her medical service record.

323
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,280
That...

324
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,280
Why?

325
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,880
Can’t I look at it?

326
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,440
Did you prescribe the wrong medicine?

327
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,000
I wouldn’t dare, Marquis.

328
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,120
Please.

329
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,200
The physician was called in last night.

330
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,840
Twice in one day?

331
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,360
Are you sure she’s fine?

332
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,400
(Princess Jia’nan’s Medical Record)

333
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,080
Why is there nothing about last night?

334
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,240
How was her pulse?

335
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,960
What was she prescribed with?

336
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,600
I’m sorry, Marquis.

337
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,560
Her Highness ordered me

338
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,360
not to tell anyone.

339
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,560
Marquis,

340
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
this is Imperial Hospital’s
prescription record.

341
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,120
(Princess Jia’nan’s Medical Record)
Chuanxiong, astragalus, Dodder Seed.

342
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,200
All to prevent miscarriage.

343
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,080
Musk, saffron crocus, curcuma zedoaria

344
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,650
are for abortion.

345
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,425
(Three Abodes of the East)

346
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,800
Does she have no appetite?

347
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,010
Baoning,

348
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,680
I brought you longan from Nanmin,

349
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,720
our most famous product

350
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,840
and the best for nourishing.

351
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,720
It tastes sweet and pleasant.

352
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,840
Try it.

353
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,320
This is too kind of you,

354
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,040
but I can’t eat anything right now.

355
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:14,150
Baoning,

356
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,720
I understand you’re sad,

357
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,640
but your health matters the most.

358
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,520
You need to eat no matter what.

359
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,225
Here.

360
00:22:25,275 --> 00:22:25,840
Just taste it.

361
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,320
Give it to me.

362
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,880
Longan is nutritious,

363
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
but can promote blood circulation

364
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,320
which might lead to miscarriage.

365
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,800
You’re safe because you aren’t pregnant.

366
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,000
Just eat as much as you can.

367
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,520
The sweet scent makes me hungry.

368
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,720
Marquis,

369
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,640
would you mind asking Qingke
to bring me tea?

370
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,475
No problem.

371
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,080
You emptied the bowl, Baoning?

372
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:46,925
Yes.

373
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,720
It’s sweet and tasty.

374
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,560
Liu Xiaoman can have more

375
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,800
and make the soup for you anytime.

376
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,120
Thank you, Marquis.

377
00:23:56,025 --> 00:23:56,725
See you.

378
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,240
If there’s one thing I know
about Marquis Jinghai,

379
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
that is, he cares a lot about you.

380
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,880
You know what this is?

381
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,160
It’s longan.

382
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,440
Did he get wind of your condition

383
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,880
and use it to test you?

384
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,320
Never mind.

385
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,520
There’s no secret in the palace.

386
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,560
It’s like a wake-up call, though,

387
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,160
that Han Tongxin,

388
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,880
Zhao Xiao

389
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,960
and many others here

390
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,480
can’t wait for me to fall.

391
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,120
That’s not going to happen!

392
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,120
I’m glad you’ve finally come around.

393
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,800
What are you talking about?

394
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,360
Life goes on regardless, right?

395
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,000
Go get me some food.

396
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,400
I’ll be right back.

397
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,975
(I’ve agreed to their divorce...)

398
00:24:59,975 --> 00:25:02,300
(Grand Empress Dowager’s Edict)

399
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,900
This is it!

400
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,150
Your Highness,

401
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,400
forging an edict is a felony.

402
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,120
Please think twice.

403
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
Miaorong,

404
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,960
I’m not forging anything.

405
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,160
Grand Empress Dowager gave Li Qian

406
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,920
a Letter of Divorce on the day she died

407
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,400
and he tore it into pieces.

408
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,000
Apparently,

409
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,560
she wanted them

410
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,680
to break up.

411
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,160
And now,

412
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,360
I’m simply helping her

413
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,400
finish what she started.

414
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,560
Your Highness,

415
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,280
the handwriting can give you away.

416
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,320
It wasn’t easy.

417
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:56,725
(Grand Empress Dowager’s Edict)

418
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,840
But I managed to get hold of

419
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,480
the original handwritten file.

420
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,680
Look,

421
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,160
I had them

422
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,840
copy it word by word

423
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,000
to make this new one.

424
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,920
No one

425
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,120
can tell the difference.

426
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,240
We should

427
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,640
make it public now.

428
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,120
Grand Empress Dowager’s tablet

429
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,920
will be enshrined in

430
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,040
the Imperial Ancestral Hall soon.

431
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,640
Officials will be there to pay respects.

432
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,160
The edict

433
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,760
can be brought up in a subtle way

434
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,880
in front of everyone

435
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
to generate maximum impact.

436
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,240
You’re thorough, Your Highness.

437
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,000
But...

438
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,160
Miaorong,

439
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,800
you did a good job.

440
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,160
Baihe.

441
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,680
Yes.

442
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,000
I know you miss Li Lin and can’t wait to

443
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,600
go outside to see him.

444
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,120
I’ll allow it.

445
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,240
You can be out for three days.

446
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

447
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:43,920
Off you go.

448
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,000
(Changsheng Gambling House)
Get out!

449
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,700
- Stop! I haven’t finished!
- Go!

450
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,880
Get out of here!

451
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:55,225
Out!

452
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:00,880
Sir,

453
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,360
(Gambling)
give me one tael of silver.

454
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,520
One more round

455
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
and I’ll win enough to pay you back.

456
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,760
Just go! Get lost!

457
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,360
Sorry,

458
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,560
pay upfront or leave.

459
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,160
You can always come back

460
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,200
when you have money again.

461
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,720
- Go back.
- Get out of here! Go away!

462
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,720
Bah!

463
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,720
Take a look.

464
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,320
Her Highness gave you three days off?

465
00:28:33,175 --> 00:28:33,750
Yes.

466
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,520
Eat up.

467
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,000
They’re all your favorites.

468
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,960
I’m not hungry,

469
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,360
but thank you for cooking everything.

470
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,640
What’s wrong?

471
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Is something bothering you?

472
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,600
Is it about your work in the palace?

473
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,800
Whenever I ask you about it,

474
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,400
you always say you’re fine,

475
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,400
but clearly, you aren’t.

476
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,600
Miaorong,

477
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,360
I’ve been waiting for you to open up.

478
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,320
You can trust me more, you know?

479
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
You know all too well about me.

480
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,680
What I’ve done for Her Highness

481
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,920
has got me knee-deep in trouble

482
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:23,600
but...

483
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,760
but I have no way out.

484
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,920
I don’t know what to do.

485
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,120
Is it that bad?

486
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,880
If so, you can quit.

487
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,920
Come back and I’ll support you.

488
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,560
Her Highness’s power is one thing

489
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,520
and she saved your life,

490
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,920
brought Guanju back

491
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,520
and gave me a job.

492
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,120
I owe her

493
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,840
too much.

494
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,000
The thought of leaving

495
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
makes me feel guilty.

496
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,840
I don’t know much about what you do,

497
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,160
but she set you up first

498
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,360
by bogging you down in the mud.

499
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,320
You shouldn’t bear any guilt.

500
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,880
Besides,

501
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,040
you’ve said she’s too powerful.

502
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,480
She’s fine without you.

503
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,000
There’s no need to give us a hard time.

504
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,320
You have a point.

505
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,400
I’ll resign once I get back.

506
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,240
Now, can you

507
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,760
enjoy the meal?

508
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,011
No way would I

509
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,875
miss out on your cooking.

510
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,400
Here.

511
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,600
Miss, Young Master,

512
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,400
a rascal barged in!

513
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,880
Let go!

514
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,160
You hear me?

515
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,920
He broke in just now

516
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,880
asking for money

517
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,640
and tried to hit us when we stopped him.

518
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,150
Guards subdued him

519
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,050
and tied him up,

520
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,080
awaiting your order.

521
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,280
You know who I am?

522
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
Untie me now!

523
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,680
It’s you!

524
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,440
Lin!

525
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,360
Stop!

526
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,800
Stop hitting him!

527
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,680
Lin!

528
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,875
You’re dead!

529
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,320
I’ve done nothing to you.

530
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,160
Why do you keep harassing me?

531
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,700
I don’t have a problem with you,

532
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,500
but...

533
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,600
Enough of your nonsense!

534
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,440
Let me go

535
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,125
or talk to my men’s fists!

536
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,575
I’m serious!

537
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,760
I see.

538
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,925
Guanju.

539
00:31:45,925 --> 00:31:46,475
Yes.

540
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:47,325
Report him to the authority.

541
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,800
If he doesn’t want to talk to us,

542
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,440
maybe he’ll say it under torture.

543
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,320
Pay officers there

544
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,000
- to make sure he’ll rot in jail
- No, no, no!

545
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,040
in case he gets back at us.

546
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,880
Yes.

547
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,840
Stop! Don’t go!

548
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,280
I’ll say it.

549
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,880
Don’t do it. I’ll tell you everything.

550
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,280
I promise.

551
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,600
See? It’s that house over there.

552
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,960
Don’t make a mistake.

553
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,120
Break in with your men at 1:15 PM.

554
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
Don’t be late.

555
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,040
Understood.

556
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,480
Once your people show up,

557
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,240
I’ll pretend to lose

558
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,960
and leave right away.

559
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,200
Rest assured.

560
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,320
Your money

561
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,200
will be worth it.

562
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,160
That’s the whole truth.

563
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,760
Please don’t report me!

564
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,000
I gambled all my money away

565
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,320
and I thought

566
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,440
I could get some from you.

567
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,240
I didn’t know you had so many guards.

568
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,920
I swear

569
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,200
I’ll get out of your sight

570
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,880
as soon as you let me go.

571
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,720
You’ll never see me again.

572
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,440
Please?

573
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,680
Get up!

574
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,280
Thank you. Thank you very much.

575
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:52,800
You may leave.

576
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,560
Yes.

577
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,840
Miaorong...

578
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,840
Her Highness,

579
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:09,960
no,

580
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,080
Han Tongxin has been

581
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,880
plotting against me the whole time.

582
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,880
I thought she was our savior

583
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,920
but I was holding the candle
to the devil.

584
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,800
She’s awfully evil and ruthless.

585
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,000
Miaorong,

586
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,840
let’s pack up

587
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,400
and leave now.

588
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,840
Not yet.

589
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,600
I have one last thing

590
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,560
to do.

591
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,160
Miaorong,

592
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,320
it’s too risky to go back in there.

593
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,280
Hear me out, Lin.

594
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,200
I’ve decided to get out of her control

595
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,840
and stop working for her.

596
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,000
But I need to right a wrong

597
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,200
I caused

598
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,960
so that I can leave with no regrets.

599
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,680
That’s not an excuse to buy time.

600
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
I swear.

601
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,200
I trust you

602
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
to make your own judgment.

603
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,240
But I want you to know

604
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,840
that I’m right behind you

605
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,560
no matter when

606
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,600
or what.

607
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,120
Thank you, Lin!

608
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:40,040
Marquis.

609
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,800
It’s me.

610
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,199
What brings you here?

611
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,600
Rise.

612
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,320
Marquis.

613
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,800
What is it? Say it.

614
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,480
I’ve found something

615
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,920
you need.

616
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,200
Really?

617
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,720
I tried to search Li’s Mansion for clues

618
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,160
but got stopped by their steward.

619
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,040
That man

620
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,360
was unusually skilled

621
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,320
with bizarre moves.

622
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,640
I believe

623
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,080
The Book of Supreme Weapons is there.

624
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,360
Is that why you came

625
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,360
all the way from Bingzhou?

626
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,920
Marquis,

627
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,840
there’s one story about the past

628
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,400
that will definitely intrigue you.

629
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,080
What story?

630
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,160
It’s sensitive. I...

631
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,440
Spill it out. Name your price.

632
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,640
We all live

633
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,680
to gain fame and wealth.

634
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,120
I used to be

635
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,120
Empress Dowager Cao’s hidden weapon.

636
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,760
When she died for our nation,

637
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,200
I pledged allegiance
to Empress Dowager Han

638
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,760
who only treated me

639
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,480
as a lookout and messenger.

640
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,480
Right now, only you

641
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,120
can be called a hero.

642
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,760
And only a hero

643
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
deserves weapons like me.

644
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,000
I hope once you rise to the top,

645
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,520
I can climb up the ladder, too.

646
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,760
I didn’t see this coming.

647
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,840
Well then,

648
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,600
I need proof of loyalty.

649
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,520
Of course.

650
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,920
Marquis,

651
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,440
it’s about the Li Village Massacre.

652
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,000
The fire back then was...

653
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,520
That’s all.

654
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,280
Marquis,

655
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,040
that’s what really happened.

656
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,680
I see.

657
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,720
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

658
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,160
I ran into a survivor

659
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,400
in Bingzhou days ago.

660
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,920
Her name is Qin Yu.

661
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,440
She’s insane

662
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,480
but as long as she stays
at Li’s shelter,

663
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,040
there’s a chance that
they find out the truth from her.

664
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,720
Li Qian can’t know that.

665
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,280
I understand.

666
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,040
I know how serious this matter is.

667
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,720
That’s why I’m here.

668
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,640
You can trust me, Marquis.

669
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,200
Your wish is my demand.

670
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,240
I’ll do anything for you.

671
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,240
I can assure you

672
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,760
that I’m fair to my people.

673
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,040
They’ll get what they deserve.

674
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,680
Found it, Marquis.

675
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,520
Go ahead.

676
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,120
Now, he’s one of us.

677
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,120
Yes.

678
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,600
Marquis,

679
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,800
it’s confirmed

680
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,840
that Li Qian went to see
Grand Empress Dowager

681
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,040
the day before she passed away.

682
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,360
She poured out vials of wrath on him,

683
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,680
so loud that servants all heard it.

684
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,680
That explains it!

685
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,440
Very well.

686
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,560
Let’s end things once and for all.

687
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,560
Once Li Qian is gone,

688
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,360
no one will hold me back.

689
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,920
I want you to return to Bingzhou

690
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,200
to tie up the loose end.

691
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,400
You know what to do, right?

692
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,080
Consider it done.

693
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,320
I’m on my way.

694
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:22,475
(Li’s Mansion)

695
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,760
You may go in, Miss Gao.

696
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,040
Qian,

697
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
I need to talk to you in private.

698
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,560
It’s urgent.

699
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,680
Just say whatever it is here.

700
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,040
It’s fine.

701
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,280
It’s important.

702
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,720
You told the guard

703
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,720
it was about Baoning.

704
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,760
If so, Wei Shu can hear it.

705
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,560
Qian,

706
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,080
Han Tongxin asked me to steal the seal

707
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,200
to forge Grand Empress Dowager’s edict

708
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,640
to have Jiang Baoning divorce you.

709
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,480
Why are you telling me about it now?

710
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,080
I didn’t know until yesterday

711
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,360
that she tricked me
into going to the palace

712
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,240
and to repay her for her help, I...

713
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,360
I was forced to do tons of evil deeds.

714
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,400
I can’t be on her side

715
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,960
to work for her anymore

716
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,560
or afford to

717
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,240
take the consequences
of stealing the seal

718
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,640
and forging Her Highness’s edict.

719
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,840
I wish to atone for what I’ve done
before leaving,

720
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,320
so I’m here to ask you
to thwart her plan.

721
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,040
Also,

722
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,480
there’s one more thing you should know.

723
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,600
You didn’t cause Her Highness’s death.

724
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,600
She was taking strong medicine

725
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,680
for months

726
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,600
which was slightly toxic

727
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,400
but good for enriching energy.

728
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,280
Proper use of it
would prolong patients’ life,

729
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,720
but Her Highness

730
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,000
overdosed on it

731
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,560
for a long time,

732
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,160
resulting in the collapse and death.

733
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,360
How did you know that?

734
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,920
Han Tongxin asked me
to break your marriage.

735
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,400
I saw that medicine

736
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,360
at the Imperial Hospital that day

737
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,960
and asked the physician

738
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,120
how often Her Highness took it.

739
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,520
Based on that, I knew she was dying.

740
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,520
Then Han Tongxin had someone summon you

741
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,300
in Her Highness’s name

742
00:40:56,525 --> 00:40:58,650
so that you’d be there

743
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,600
which made you the one to blame

744
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,040
when she died right after you left.

745
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,040
And she bought Chief Physician over

746
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,040
to mislead everyone into thinking

747
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,680
Her Highness died because of you.

748
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,400
Qian,

749
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,480
I know you don’t believe me.

750
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,240
Just check if her seal is still there,

751
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,400
then you’ll know.

752
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,040
I have three days off.

753
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,496
I’ll come again

754
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:29,450
before going back to the palace.

755
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,825
I hope you’ll have the answer

756
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,775
by then.

757
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,240
Do you believe what she said?

758
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,480
Do you?

759
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,440
She said all that with certainty

760
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,800
and enough details

761
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,880
that can be corroborated.

762
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,880
It’s likely to be true.

763
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,075
But given her stained record,

764
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,250
she’s untrustworthy.

765
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,040
She and Han Tongxin

766
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,960
could’ve gotten the story straight

767
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,440
to set us up.

768
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,400
That’s possible.

769
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,280
Young Master,

770
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,080
what’s your plan?

771
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,520
Gao Miaorong is right about one thing.

772
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,760
We can find out

773
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,320
if Her Highness’s seal is lost.

774
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,920
Young Master,

775
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,600
are you sure about this?

776
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,200
Hurry up and search!

777
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,040
Who is that?

778
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,360
Is anyone there?

779
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,360
Who is it?

780
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,280
Guards!

781
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,200
Come here!

782
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,200
Help!

783
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,400
Not here.

784
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,480
Let’s go!

785
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,350
(Three Abodes of the East)

786
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,240
(Three Abodes of the East)

787
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,200
Can’t he stop

788
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,800
pissing Princess off?

789
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,080
I tried to stop him

790
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,280
but he wouldn’t listen.

791
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,110
Is this the last straw?

792
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,500
I guess.

793
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,200
Good grief!

794
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,800
Things are bad enough between them.

795
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,960
How worse can it be?

796
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,560
What were you doing out there?

797
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,400
Given the tension between us

798
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,160
and no sign of the seal,

799
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,960
I’d better not bring it up to upset her.

800
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,640
I came to check on you.

801
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,120
I caught you

802
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,880
outside Grandmother’s room.

803
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,080
It was too dark.

804
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,800
I got lost.

805
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,600
You got into my room
through the window that day

806
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,920
like you had done it hundreds of times.

807
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,600
Baoning, I...

808
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,640
Just stop.

809
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,960
I’m sick of your endless lies.

810
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,280
I don’t care what you’re up to.

811
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,480
Anyway, I’ve said enough to you.

812
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,840
There’s nothing else to say.

813
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,720
With two murders between us,

814
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,440
do you think we can still be together?

815
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,600
Baoning, look,

816
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,840
- Her Highness’s death...
- Enough!

817
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,520
You... I can’t breathe!

818
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,680
Could you leave me alone,

819
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,680
please?

820
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,040
Baoning...

821
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,160
Go away!

822
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,360
Fine. Yes. I’m going.

823
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,040
Out!

824
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:29,760
Yes.

825
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,080
- Ms. Qin.
- Yes?

826
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,080
I found a homeless senior over there

827
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,120
with a broken leg.

828
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,320
He needs your help.

829
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,160
Where is he?

830
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,200
At the end of the lane.

831
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,880
Do you remember me?

832
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,310
I let you go 20 years ago,

833
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:17,835
but not again.

834
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,160
It’s him!

835
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,080
It’s him!

836
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,320
That murderer who burned down
the Li Village!

837
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,560
Are you all right?

838
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,440
Did you get hurt?

839
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,175
(Zhenning Gate)

840
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,080
Miss,

841
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,720
you’re safe.

842
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,960
Have some desserts and hot tea.

843
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,080
Where do you live?

844
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,560
Where are your parents?

845
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,320
I...

846
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,400
Do you know your name?

847
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,440
I...

848
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:23,275
I...

849
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,850
It’s fine if you don’t remember.
Don’t push yourself.

850
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,280
You can stay here.

851
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:27,970
I’ll take good care of you.

852
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,480
By the way,

853
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,160
I’m Qing De,

854
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,400
the King of Yongqing.

855
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,160
If you don’t remember your name,

856
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,600
I can give you a new one.

857
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,400
How about

858
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,560
Qin Yu?

859
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,720
Do you like the name “Qin Yu”?

860
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,520
An!

861
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,200
- An!
- Aunt Qin!

862
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,640
Aunt Qin,

863
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,000
you’re finally awake!

864
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,960
How do you feel?

865
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,640
An!

866
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,000
An!

867
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:17,800
An!

868
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,960
My son!

869
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,160
I’ve finally found you!

870
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,760
What?

871
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,960
An,

872
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:34,640
I...

873
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,440
I’m your mother!

874
00:49:42,475 --> 00:49:45,350
(Li’s Mansion)

875
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,440
Qian,

876
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,400
I’m going back to the palace later.

877
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,400
Have you made your decision?

878
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,440
Things didn’t go well
at Shoukang Palace, did they?

879
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,680
Qian,

880
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,200
we’re running out of time.

881
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,320
Han Tongxin is going to
announce the edict

882
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,520
when Her Highness’s tablet
is moved into the Ancestral Hall.

883
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,080
There’s no time to think.

884
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,640
Qian,

885
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,480
these are title deeds for land

886
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,600
Lin and I have bought
in the capital over the years

887
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,600
and receipts of all the property
we pawned.

888
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,360
I’m giving them to you

889
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,160
as a pledge.

890
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,760
Baoning wouldn’t want to see me again.

891
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,120
I understand

892
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:08,970
your difficulty.

893
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,480
Our conversation never happened.

894
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,120
I’ll go talk to her.

895
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,640
I failed as a mother.

896
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,120
I abandoned you

897
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,000
when you were little.

898
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:39,305
Back then,

899
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,000
you couldn’t even reach the table.

900
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,560
After all these years,

901
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:50,520
you’ve grown so big

902
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,280
and taller than me.

903
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,240
An,

904
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,160
how have you been

905
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,720
over the years?

906
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,080
Qing An,

907
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,480
didn’t you come all the way to Mu’an

908
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,480
to find your mother?

909
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,680
Now that you’ve finally reunited,

910
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,120
don’t you have anything to say

911
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,240
instead of being silent?

912
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,400
I...

913
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,280
I’m not sure

914
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,680
if this is a dream.

915
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,480
Are you really my mother?

916
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,240
The first time we met,

917
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,040
I found you oddly familiar.

918
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,840
But I only had a vague memory then

919
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,760
and I didn’t even know who I was.

920
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,440
Now,

921
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,040
I remember things in the past.

922
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,880
Son,

923
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,160
you look a lot like your father.

924
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,440
Speaking of which,

925
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,480
how is he?

926
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,560
I’m afraid he’s passed away.

927
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,160
I failed too many people.

928
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,000
Why did you leave us in the first place?

929
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,440
It all goes back to over 20 years ago.

930
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,920
My real name is Zhang Yuqing.

931
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,720
I was a disciple of Master of Weaponry,
Zhang Zeshi.

932
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,840
He spent his whole life

933
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,880
on The Book of Supreme Weapons

934
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,080
and gave it to his other disciple,
Zhang Xiuhe

935
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,040
before retiring to the countryside.

936
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,720
Then his three disciples
went separate paths.

937
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,600
The eldest one, Jiang Zhenying,
was of noble birth

938
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,400
who returned to work in the capital.

939
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,280
Zhang Xiuhe

940
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,280
went missing
with The Book of Supreme Weapons.

941
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,480
Archduke and my aunt

942
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,200
used to study with you?

943
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,920
You know them?

944
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,280
Archduke was my sister-in-law’s father

945
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,240
and Zhang Xiuhe

946
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,880
was my elder brother’s birth mother.

947
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,560
Unfortunately,

948
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,560
both of them have left.

949
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,080
Hearing that Xiuhe
was married off to the Li Village,

950
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,160
the three of us

951
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,320
decided to have a reunion there.

952
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,800
None of us knew

953
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,480
it’d lead to a catastrophe.

954
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,640
Where are you going, Zhenying?

955
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,360
Back to the capital.

956
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,080
The three of us have just met.

957
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,120
Why are you leaving so soon?

958
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,000
Xiuhe made dinner.

959
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Eat with us before you go.

960
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,120
I can’t!

961
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,080
I’m too mad!

962
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,920
Xiuhe is too stubborn

963
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,120
to listen to reason.

964
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,680
How could she not know

965
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,880
what she has would get her in trouble?

966
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,080
The Book of Supreme Weapons

967
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,320
could only do her

968
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,720
harm instead of good!

969
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,160
I asked her to destroy it

970
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,560
and focus on her family,

971
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,160
but she called me nosy!

972
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,760
Zhenying...

973
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,680
You just

974
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,120
take care.

975
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,760
I’m off.

976
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,840
Those hotheads!

977
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,960
Neither of them

978
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,160
has changed at all.

979
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,280
Fire! Fire!

980
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,440
Help!

981
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,680
Xiuhe!

982
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,000
Xiuhe!

983
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,840
Xiuhe!

984
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,720
Xiuhe!

985
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,160
The package is secure.

986
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,200
(The Book of Supreme Weapons)

987
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,982
Someone is still alive.

988
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,625
I’ll take care of that.

989
00:58:12,925 --> 00:58:13,520
Follow me!

990
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,040
Go!

991
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,640
The whole village was in flames.

992
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,040
I was terrified.

993
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,080
Mother,

994
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,440
I’m here.

995
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,800
It’s over.

996
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,400
Aunt Qin,

997
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,960
are you sure Archduke

998
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,360
didn’t set the village on fire?

999
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,320
He arrived alone.

1000
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,400
And when he left,

1001
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,840
everything was fine.

1002
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,840
Do you know who did it?

1003
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,440
Help!

1004
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,920
Help!

1005
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,240
No sign of her.

1006
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:48,600
Didn’t see her.

1007
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,320
Split up and search.

1008
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,400
We must find her.

1009
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:51,080
Go!

1010
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

1011
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,000
Hurry up!

1012
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,320
We need to report back quickly.

1013
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:18,960
Yes.

1014
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,760
Don’t kill me!

1015
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,880
Please!

1016
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,120
Don’t do it!

1017
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,080
I was traumatized

1018
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,875
by that fire

1019
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:08,125
and lost my memory.

1020
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,360
Qing De saved me and married me

1021
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,440
but his wife refused to accept me.

1022
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,920
One day, when he went out,

1023
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,400
she scared me with fire again

1024
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,280
and I totally lost it.

1025
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,480
Then she set a merchant on

1026
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,680
to take me out of Yongqing,

1027
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,280
proving that I eloped with someone else

1028
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,920
to make Qing De give me up.

1029
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,160
Mother,

1030
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,360
you suffered too much.

1031
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,240
Our reunion

1032
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,400
makes all my suffering

1033
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,080
worth it.

1034
01:01:59,040 --> 01:01:59,840
Mother...

1035
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,375
(Three Abodes of the East)

1036
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:20,920
What do we know?

1037
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,000
Your Highness,

1038
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,640
it’s true that the seal is gone.

1039
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,680
Han Tongxin!

1040
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,630
How dare she steal

1041
01:02:30,825 --> 01:02:32,905
Grandmother’s seal right after she left!

1042
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,480
Whether Li Qian and I divorce or not

1043
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,080
is none of her business.

1044
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,040
Exactly.

1045
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,520
Your Highness, if you need me,

1046
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,880
I’ll help you.

1047
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:47,960
You?

1048
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,560
You brought me information

1049
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,640
and offered your help.

1050
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,200
What do you want in return?

1051
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,360
You’re wise, Your Highness.

1052
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,920
I hope I’ll be pardoned
for stealing the seal.

1053
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,320
After everything is over,

1054
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,520
please escort Lin and me

1055
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,680
to leave the city.

1056
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,240
We’d like to

1057
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,200
start over as ordinary people

1058
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,360
and live a happy life
in the countryside.

1059
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,200
If that’s what you want,

1060
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,920
sure, no problem.

1061
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

1062
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,960
First, go to the Imperial Hospital

1063
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,040
and tell them you’re making incense
for Empress Dowager.

1064
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,680
I’d like some Soothing Incense.

1065
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:52,425
Sure.

1066
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,560
Yes. Give me a minute.

1067
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,680
Ask for common Soothing Incense first

1068
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,040
and then say you also need ambergris.

1069
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,800
Here you are.

1070
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,560
I want some ambergris, too.

1071
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,280
Ambergris?

1072
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,960
It’s rare and expensive

1073
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,920
and can’t be given away
without permission.

1074
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,160
Meanwhile,

1075
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,400
you need to throw a fit

1076
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,600
to make him remember you.

1077
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,040
Go, go, go!

1078
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:21,640
Please calm down.

1079
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,720
I don’t mean to upset you.

1080
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,880
It’s just that ambergris is a rarity.

1081
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,520
Here it is.

1082
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,360
Uh...

1083
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,080
Then

1084
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,400
make common Soothing Incense

1085
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,920
plus a tad of ambergris.

1086
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,840
Once you finish, give it to Han Tongxin

1087
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,680
and burn it in her room

1088
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,040
