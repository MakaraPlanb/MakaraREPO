I left the door unlatched

38
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:25,839
The fire is to

39
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:28,119
teach Jiang Baoning a lesson.

I’ve got the best doctors.

120
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,440

a special health condition,

121
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,519

know her body better.

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,559

00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,320
Leave us.

132
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,279

Baoning.

134
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,200
I was so scared.

135
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,880
Sorry about that, Grandmother.

136
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,799
Thanks to the son of Marquis Jinghai.

137
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,679
Hadn’t he saved you,

138
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,160
I couldn’t imagine...

139
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,920
Master Zhao saved me?

140
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,160
Yes.

141
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,000
Thank you, Master Zhao.

142
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,480
So it was only a hallucination.

143
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,559
I knew you were a good man.

144
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,480
Your betrothal

145
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,440
is known to the Empress Dowager.

146
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:27,480

Thank you for approving it,
Your Highness.

148
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,679
I have to do it,

149
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,119
or it’d be too late.

150
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,600
What was I thinking?

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,839
She’s going to get married.

152
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,350
Hey,

153
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,919
when I was rescued,

154
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,280
was I carrying a book?

155
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,559
No.

156
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,719
You were carrying nothing.

157
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,039
The fire was so big

158
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,559
that Treasure House was
burned to the ground.

159
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,200
Even if there was a book,

160
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,599
I’m afraid it would have
been burned to ashes.

161
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:52,719
The Book of Supreme Weapons
has been burned to ashes.

162
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,840
What am I going to say to Li Qian?

163
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,840
Please rest well, Your Grace.

164
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,850
I’ll leave you be.

165
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,500
Okay.

166
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,880
Baoning took a trip to Longevity Hill,

167
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,960
but what was Zhao Xiao doing there?

168
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,000
Calm down, Your Majesty.

169
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,080
Her Grace

170
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,200
only met the son
of Marquis Jinghai twice,

171
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,039
while you and she
have been close since childhood.

172
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,440
I simply can’t stand

173
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,200
him being around Baoning.

174
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,760
I’m impressed by my son.

175
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:38,359
The Grand Empress Dowager betrothed
Commandery Princess Jia’nan to him.

176
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,679
(Marquis Jinghai, Zhao Kuan)
Their marriage shall

177
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,200
go a long way toward Nanmin.

178
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,280
Yes.

179
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,640
If your son marries
Commandery Princess Jia’nan,

180
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,719
he’ll have a bright future.

181
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,679
Li, something happened.

182
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,599
What happened?

183
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,599
What’s the fuss?

184
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,000
Min Xi is dead.

185
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:17,039
Your Highness,

186
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,719
Empress Dowager is ready for you.

187
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,080
On the day the First Prince
of Yongqing State came,

188
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,640
Min Xi provoked him.

189
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,640
The Prince let him off at the time

190
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,559
on account of the Empress Dowager.

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,559
Now it looks like
he didn’t really let it slide.

192
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,640
It’s outrageous that

193
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,280
those Yongqing people do
whatever they like here in Mu’an.

194
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:43,400
I’ll let the Empress Dowager know.

195
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,599
Keep it to yourself for now.

196
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,679
Okay.

197
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,239
Please. Please.

198
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:56,840
Today’s banquet is held

199
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,840
to welcome

200
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,719
Qing Tai, the First Prince of Yongqing
who came a long way from his home state.

201
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:05,159
His Majesty arrives.

202
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,919
Greetings, Mother.

203
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,719
Greetings.

204
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,799
A seat for His Majesty.

205
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,960
What did you come to Longevity Hill for?

206
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,640
I was told that Grandmother and Baoning

207
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,000
took a trip to Longevity Hill,

208
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,239
so I thought,

209
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:44,320
“How boring the palace is”,

210
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,400
and I came to have fun with everybody.

211
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,640
I see.

212
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:51,919
You came at a good time, Your Majesty.

213
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,760
I have a request

214
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,559
for you and Her Highness.

215
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,200
The Commandery Princess Jia’nan of Mu’an

216
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,679
is pretty and smart.

217
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:06,400
She’s eligible

218
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,760
and unmarried.

219
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,520
I would like to propose to her

220
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:13,320
to build a better relationship
between our two states.

221
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:18,520
Thank you for

222
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,440
adoring Princess Jia’nan,

223
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,039
however, unfortunately,

224
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,599
I have made

225
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,559
the decision of
betrothing Princess Jia’nan

226
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,719
to the son of Marquis Jinghai.

227
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:32,225
Huh?

228
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,159
I’ve stayed here for many days,

229
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,080
how come I never heard of it?

230
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,080
We’re a state of ceremonies.

231
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,719
The imperial edict

232
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,200
of this matter of great importance

233
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,840
needs to be announced on an auspicious day
chosen by the Astrology Office.

234
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,080
The etiquette has to be respected.

235
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,200
So there’s no
formal betrothal yet, then.

236
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,880
In this case,

237
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:54,280
how about a fair competition?

238
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,840
Let us compete.

239
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,039
If you win,

240
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:06,960
you can have

241
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,530
Princess Jia’nan.

242
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,125
Hey.

243
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:16,877
Go and ask her.

244
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,440
If you refuse,

245
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,239
then don’t blame me
for harming our relationship.

246
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,239
Baoning,

247
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,559
(Fortune Brings Prosperity)
do you really want to marry Zhao Xiao?

248
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,080
I just don’t want
to displease Grandmother.

249
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,479
But...

250
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:46,000
Your Grace, Your Grace.

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,799
Bad news.

252
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,840
Bad news.

253
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,640
Prince Qing Tai of Yongqing State said

254
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,719
he means to marry you.

255
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,225
What?

256
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:54,719
Hasn’t the Empress Dowager

257
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,640
betrothed Her Grace to
the son of Marquis Jinghai?

258
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,159
Prince Qing Tai said

259
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,520
since the imperial edict
hasn’t been announced,

260
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,479
the betrothal is not in effect.

261
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,880
Baoning, let’s go and
ask Grand Empress Dowager

262
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,000
for help.

263
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,239
Grandmother is too old for shock.

264
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,719
So...

265
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,760
I see you’re here,
so His Majesty came, too, right?

266
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,320
Yes, His Majesty just arrived.

267
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:17,440
That’ll do.

268
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,840
His Majesty won’t agree to it.

269
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:20,239
Perhaps

270
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,520
he’s able to chuck this
Yongqing prince out of our state.

271
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,275
(Fortune Brings Prosperity)

272
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,719
Emperor,

273
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,760
what’s your opinion?

274
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:31,159
This matter concerns

275
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:34,080
the relationship between our two states.

276
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:40,791
Her Highness has a point.

277
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,450
Yes.

278
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:45,575
(Dehui Hall)

279
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:51,000
Well then, let there be

280
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,479
a match between Prince Qing Tai and
Zhao Xiao, the son of Marquis Jinghai.

281
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:56,200
The winner

282
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,119
gets to marry
Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

283
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,280
Qing Tai is a sinister fellow,

284
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:20,200
I mustn’t let Her Grace marry him.

285
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,320
Young Master,

286
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,599
Qing Tai is an excellent duelist.

287
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,359
He’s the No. 1
fighter in Yongqing State.

288
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,039
Duels in Yongqing are all about
steadiness, accuracy, and ruthlessness.

289
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
You’ll most likely be injured

290
00:15:37,575 --> 00:15:38,760
in head-to-head combat.

291
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,719
If you dodge his attacks
with your footwork

292
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,200
and fight him acrobatically,

293
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,760
you may stand a better chance.

294
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,559
Thank you, Li.

295
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:56,905
Young Master.

296
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:01,960
Qing Tai is a cruel man.

297
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:04,305
Her Grace

298
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,660
mustn’t marry him no matter what.

299
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,300
Okay.

300
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,425
(Thousand Buddha Hall)

301
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,599
Don’t worry, my lord.

302
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,479
Young Master is a supreme fighter.

303
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,199
He’ll

304
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,079
teach this rude
Yongqing prince a good lesson.

305
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:20,875
(Thousand Buddha Hall)

306
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,319
Greetings, Your Highness.

307
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,719
Greetings, Your Majesty.

308
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,800
You came at the right time.

309
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,839
Would you like to watch the fight?

310
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,719
Time’s up.

311
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,479
Their punches and kicks

312
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,800
are equally good.

313
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,000
How about a match on the horseback?

314
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,479
We all know that
Yongqing steeds are the best.

315
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,280
Are you intentionally trying to
make the match unfair?

316
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,520
Your Majesty,

317
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,760
Mu’an State was
founded on the horseback, too.

318
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,119
What? Are you afraid?

319
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,479
Pass down my order.

320
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,479
Since it’s a draw,

321
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,079
let there be a horse race,

322
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,199
and we’ll have a winner.

323
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

324
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:49,599
Young Master,

325
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,520
Yongqing horses have a strong body

326
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,800
and sturdy legs.

327
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,599
They’re tough and good at charging.

328
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,760
Also, you have to watch out for

329
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,880
the horse-ramming technique of Yongqing.

330
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,719
Okay.

331
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,239
The armor weighs at least 25 kilograms,

332
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,160
how do you fight with this on?

333
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,520
Easy.

334
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,560
Young Master, are you okay?

335
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,560
That punch was a critical hit.

336
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,479
I’m fine. Don’t worry.

337
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,000
Young Master!

338
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,800
Are you okay, Young Master?

339
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,520
Young Master. Remove the armor.

340
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,959
Come, hold him.

341
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,079
Be careful.

342
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,920
That punch seemed like nothing,

343
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,239
but it’s actually hurt
your internal organs.

344
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,680
Get out of my way.

345
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,160
I need to go to the arena.

346
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,199
Come on.

347
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:45,920
Look at you.

348
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,000
Are you seriously going to fight?

349
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,800
Are you going to fight Qing Tai
by spitting blood at him?

350
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,079
I can’t watch Baoning

351
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,040
marry Qing Tai.

352
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,160
Even if I’ll puke blood to death,

353
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:55,439
I just can’t.

354
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:18,680
(Thousand Buddha Hall)

355
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,839
The Empress Dowager has given the order.

356
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:24,439
The horse race begins now.

357
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,920
Within the time it takes for
one incense stick to burn out,

358
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,680
the first one who gets the golden trophy

359
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,040
is the winner.

360
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,160
The horse race

361
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,079
begins now.

362
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,520
Baoning, would you like
to come and watch?

363
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,479
Your Majesty.

364
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,719
Son!

365
00:22:46,842 --> 00:22:49,225
(Shun’an Gate)

366
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:52,520
Young Master!

367
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,560
The incense stick burns out.
Time is up.

368
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,520
The son of Marquis Jinghai wins.

369
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,920
Now that we have a winner,

370
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,640
you are supposed to betroth the
princess to the winner, Your Majesty.

371
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,520
Pass down my order.

372
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,680
The son of Marquis Jinghai wins.

373
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,479
Some days later, I will

374
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:59,839
betroth the son of Marquis Jinghai
to Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

375
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:03,280
The son of Marquis Jinghai is granted
the title of Fiancé of Princess Jia’nan.

376
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:04,959
Yes, Your Majesty.

377
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,400
It is the Emperor’s oral edict that

378
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:14,160
the son of Marquis Jinghai is granted
the title of Fiancé of Princess Jia’nan.

379
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,079
They will be betrothed some days later.

380
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

381
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,560
Great, Master Zhao won.

382
00:25:23,825 --> 00:25:25,319
Baoning, you don’t need to marry

383
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,760
the First Prince of Yongqing.

384
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,430
Those eyes.

385
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
What eyes?

386
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:38,319
I may be mistaken.

387
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,760
Qing Tai is useless!

388
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:47,760
He almost had the trophy,

389
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,719
but Zhao Xiao took it!

390
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,239
He’s good for nothing!

391
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,239
The hit that Master Zhao made in midair

392
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,040
feels as if he was possessed
by some phantom.

393
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,079
Possessed by some phantom?

394
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,800
Zhao Xiao is

395
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,800
but a silver-spoon patrician,

396
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,239
how come, all of a sudden,

397
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:13,199
he acts like a top martial artist?

398
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,439
I heard that

399
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,359
people can be forced to
unleash their potential

400
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:18,439
in a desperate situation.

401
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:20,199
Maybe

402
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,479
the son of Marquis Jinghai

403
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,800
genuinely loves Princess Jia’nan.

404
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,839
I still

405
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:29,959
find this thing suspicious.

406
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,520
The son of Marquis Jinghai seized
the chance to catch the golden trophy,

407
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:34,680
and won.

408
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,359
He risked his life

409
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,439
for Baoning.

410
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,439
Fortunately, nothing went wrong.

411
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,439
Fangling,

412
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:46,839
fetch me the supreme
medicine for knife-cuts.

413
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:47,959
Yes, Your Highness.

414
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,839
Baoning,

415
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,880
it’s not the first time

416
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,119
the son of Marquis Jinghai
gets injured for you.

417
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:05,119
He’s willing to risk his life for you,

418
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,119
so you need to be nice to him, too.

419
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,959
Go, hand the medicine to him.

420
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,025
Okay.

421
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,680
Why are you staring at me?

422
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,359
Baoning, there’s
something wrong with you.

423
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,880
What’s wrong with me?

424
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,199
During the match
between Master Zhao and Qing Tai,

425
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:34,280
you weren’t nervous.

426
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,160
And you didn’t seem happy

427
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,520
about Master Zhao’s victory.

428
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,760
Do you actually
care about your fiancé or not?

429
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,119
Of course, I care about him.

430
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,680
You think I can’t tell?

431
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,199
Well, you keep
prevaricating if you like.

432
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:48,839
Since you aren’t willing to
tell the truth,

433
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,520
I’ll get off your back.

434
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,839
But

435
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,280
if someday, you wish to talk,

436
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,839
remember, I’m always there.

437
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,375
Okay. Let’s go.

438
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,040
Li,

439
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,520
thank you for your aid.

440
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,959
I promise

441
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:07,520
I’ll return the favor to you.

442
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,880
Young Master.

443
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:16,199
Young Master, please. It’s my pleasure.

444
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,680
As long as you and Her Grace

445
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:23,359
enjoy a long-lasting and happy marriage,

446
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,319
my injury

447
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,719
is nothing.

448
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,000
Thank you, Li.

449
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:32,839
That was him.

450
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:35,920
Where is Baoning?

451
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,680
Baoning, where are you going?

452
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,479
Baoning, wait.

453
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:47,959
Greetings, Your Grace.

454
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,199
Uh, Master Zhao is injured.

455
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,680
I’m going to treat his injury.

456
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:54,615
Wait.

457
00:28:58,719 --> 00:28:59,439
Use this.

458
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,319
The best medicine for knife-cuts
that the palace can offer.

459
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:05,280
Okay. Your Grace, my lady,

460
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,239
I need to go.

461
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,439
Baoning, are you okay?

462
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:20,599
He could have just joined in the race

463
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,280
fair and square, right?

464
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,760
Pretending to be Zhao Xiao
was such a cowardly move.

465
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,839
So do we need to report it to

466
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,520
the Grand Empress Dowager
and the Empress Dowager?

467
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,359
If it gets spread out,

468
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,239
I’m afraid it’ll cause friction
between the two states.

469
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:41,800
You know, I can tell that

470
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,400
Li Qian loves you,

471
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:49,319
or he wouldn’t risk his life

472
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:50,959
preventing you from
marrying the Yongqing prince.

473
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,079
Baoning,

474
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,199
do you have feelings for him, too?

475
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,280
So what?

476
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:05,439
He’s still a coward.

477
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,000
Are you really willing to

478
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,560
marry the son of Marquis Jinghai?

479
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:25,839
Why do you stop?

480
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,520
Continue the patrol.

481
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:27,760
Yes.

482
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,750
Hey.

483
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,079
You’re injured.

484
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,400
Injured, you know?

485
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:38,280
A big hole in your chest

486
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:39,479
is not serious enough?

487
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,119
Ordinary people with this injury

488
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,400
would be lying in the bed
writing their last words.

489
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,280
Look at you,

490
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,719
still patrolling as if nothing happened.

491
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,280
If I’m absent from duty for no reason,

492
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,839
someone will notice.

493
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,079
Only by acting normally

494
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,479
can the whole show be flawless.

495
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,239
Hey, no one asked you to be a hero.

496
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:03,599
Li! Li! Li!

497
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,439
Are you really going to race with him?

498
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:17,000
I always think you’re a smart guy.

499
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,199
How come you did such a stupid thing?

500
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,920
You risked your life

501
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,359
fighting to make sure Master Zhao

502
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:23,719
marries the Commandery Princess.

503
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,079
It’s none of your business.

504
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:26,119
You gain nothing in it.

505
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,760
Yes, I admit that I envy Master Zhao,

506
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,560
but I’d rather it’s
Zhao Xiao who marries her

507
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,680
than Qing Tai.

508
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But what about you?

509
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,119
Would Commandery Princess even

510
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,400
say “thank you” for what you have done?

511
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,359
No more conversation.
Let’s get back to the patrol.

512
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,280
You’re hopeless.

513
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,119
Qingke,

514
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:32,760
deliver the best medicine for wounds

515
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,920
to Guard Li.

516
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,239
Yes, Your Grace.

517
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:56,280
The music is called Moon Out.

518
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,560
I thought the music was long lost,

519
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,520
it’s amazing that
I’m once again listening to it

520
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,560
here in Her Grace’s yard.

521
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,239
This was Marchioness Zhao’s
favorite music.

522
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,040
You always listened to it
when growing up.

523
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:10,800
Too bad, after she passed away,

524
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,880
you didn’t have a chance
to listen to it again.

525
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,560
Zhao Zhong,

526
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:22,439
hurry,

527
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,119
go fetch the zither in my room.

528
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,640
Yes.

529
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,000
Young Master, are you going to
gift the zither to Princess Jia’nan?

530
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,719
Who else in this world

531
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,239
is worthy of the zither?

532
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,599
Yes.

533
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:51,280
Moonlight is bright, she is gorgeous.

534
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:54,479
Her graceful silhouette
touches my heart.

535
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,119
I wonder

536
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,359
who is on your mind, Baoning?

537
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,680
Master Zhao, why are you here?

538
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,359
Your injury...

539
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,119
It seems heavy,

540
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,319
but it didn’t hurt my bone,

541
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:07,199
so I’m okay.

542
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:08,600
I didn’t want you to be worried,

543
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,360
so I came to let you know.

544
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,959
It’s my luck that I get to

545
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:14,120
listen to your heavenly music.

546
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,560
I have this old zither

547
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,959
that I think is worthy of your music.

548
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,879
Your Grace, the zither
has a name, Jiaotong.

549
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,919
It was a heritage left
by Marchioness Zhao.

550
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
Young Master treasures it

551
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,800
and never showed it to anybody.

552
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:29,159
Take it.

553
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,919
Since you value it so much,

554
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,639
you’d better keep it, Master Zhao.

555
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,000
I would hate to take
someone’s family treasure for my own.

556
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,000
Baoning,

557
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,000
ever since I met you,

558
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,639
my treasure

559
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,280
has no longer been the zither.

560
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:50,639
Baoning,

561
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,600
as I gift the zither to you,

562
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,280
I give my heart to you.

563
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,600
After we get married,

564
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,159
the zither will play harmonious music.

565
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,800
I will cherish you for
the rest of my life.

566
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
Qingke?

567
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,040
What is she sneaking off to do

568
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,439
on her own?

569
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:23,520
You take the snacks to Her Highness.

570
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,439
Yes.

571
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:39,647
(The Book of Supreme Weapons)

572
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,879
It’s so carefully and thoroughly drawn,

573
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,729
I thought I could
find clues about Mother.

574
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,639
But it turns to be nothing.

575
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,840
It looks like Princess Jia’nan

576
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,000
is the best owner of the book.

577
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,399
Jin Xiao,

578
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,320
what’s the rush?

579
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,280
I saw it with my own eyes.

580
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,919
It can’t be mistaken.

581
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,560
How come his chest is wounded?

582
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,399
It is exactly the same spot where

583
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,760
Zhao Xiao was wounded.

584
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,280
Baihe,

585
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,600
you go to Zhao Xiao’s place

586
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:41,199
and check his wound.

587
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,560
Yes, Your Highness.

588
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,879
Your Highness.

589
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,520
His place is guarded
by the Nanmin soldiers.

590
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,040
It’s so well guarded,

591
00:37:57,479 --> 00:37:58,719
I couldn’t go in.

592
00:37:58,919 --> 00:38:00,120
Useless.

593
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:01,879
However,

594
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,879
a servant came out
to dump the medicine dregs,

595
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:05,800
and I have collected some.

596
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,040
I showed them to a doctor.

597
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,080
The doctor said

598
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:11,879
the medicine is for blood circulation.

599
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,600
It’s meant to cure the internal injury.

600
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,879
The key to treating a flesh wound
is to stop the bleeding,

601
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,719
while promoting blood circulation
is how you cure an internal injury.

602
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,040
The two kinds of
medicine are contradictory

603
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:21,760
and mustn’t be mixed.

604
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:24,639
Your Highness,

605
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:27,360
it appears the racer that day

606
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:28,719
was Li Qian.

607
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,399
God favors me.

608
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,760
Jiang Baoning has no choice

609
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,800
but to marry Qing Tai after all.

610
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,919
Do you still wish

611
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:08,719
Commandery Princess Jia’nan
to marry you?

612
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,639
What if I do?

613
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,919
Well,

614
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:18,056
I have a big surprise for you.

615
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,919
Please lean in.

616
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,879
For real?

617
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,919
I wish Baoning didn’t
have to go to Nanmin

618
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:14,639
and could stay here with me.

619
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,120
That would be nice.

620
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,320
What...

621
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:31,280
Don’t you think it’s rude,
Prince Qing Tai?

622
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,159
It’s you who are the rude ones.

623
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:37,000
I’m here to ask you.

624
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,879
Was it you who said it

625
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,719
in the hall that

626
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,080
Zhao Xiao and I were to have a match

627
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:46,840
and the winner got to
marry Commandery Princess Jia’nan?

628
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,199
Yes, it was me.

629
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,959
If so,

630
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,080
why did another person race with me
in Zhao Xiao’s place unannounced?

631
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,600
I have to say, Mu’an State

632
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,239
is completely nasty

633
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:58,959
and shameless.

634
00:40:59,399 --> 00:41:01,679
Xiao, is it true?

635
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,679
Prince Qing Tai, you lost the race

636
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:10,560
before our eyes.

637
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,159
What?

638
00:41:12,879 --> 00:41:14,280
Do Yongqing folks

639
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,479
refuse to admit defeat?

640
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,879
Let me question you, Prince Qing Tai.

641
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,959
You accuse the son
of Marquis Jinghai of playing tricks,

642
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:25,040
do you have any evidence?

643
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,560
On that day,

644
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,199
I injured the left side of
his chest right in front of you.

645
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:31,479
Take off your clothes

646
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:33,760
and show us the injury.

647
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,520
Zhao Xiao,

648
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:41,040
is Prince Qing Tai telling the truth?

649
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,719
Answer His Majesty.

650
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,280
Tell the truth!

651
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,919
You can’t afford to deceive the emperor.

652
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,919
Your Majesty,

653
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:06,679
it is true that it wasn’t me

654
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,679
in the race,

655
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
but a soldier of mine.

656
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,919
How dare you play
such a dirty trick on me?

657
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:17,598
It’s unforgivable!

658
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,879
However,

659
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,399
I am a reasonable person.

660
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:31,080
As long as

661
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,760
Commandery Princess
Jia’nan is betrothed to me today,

662
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,360
I can let it all slide.

663
00:42:36,775 --> 00:42:37,439
You...!

664
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,159
Insolent!

665
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,800
It looks like you refuse.

666
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:44,320
Well, in that case,

667
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:48,040
200,000 Yongqing riders

668
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,199
trampling over your city

669
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,800
will be how I get even with you.

670
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,360
How dare you threaten me.

671
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:57,879
Mu’an soldiers are great warriors!

672
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,159
We aren’t afraid
of a small state like Yongqing.

673
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,040
What are you doing?

674
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,239
His Majesty has declared war.

675
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,280
I apply to fight.

676
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,439
Kneel!

677
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,800
Your Majesty.

678
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,919
My son is young and hot-headed.

679
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:18,639
The conflict between
him and Prince Qing Tai

680
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,320
is because he’s competitive.

681
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:21,760
He’s just eager for victory.

682
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,679
Please forgive him.

683
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:24,919
Father.

684
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:26,239
You idiot!

685
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:28,040
Do you want to be

686
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,360
a sinner known by later generations as
the starter of war between two states?

687
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,879
Behave yourself!

688
00:43:37,399 --> 00:43:38,760
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

689
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:39,959
Think about the greater good.

690
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,479
Think about our people.

691
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,120
Emperor,

692
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,399
you do need to think twice.

693
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,639
You!

694
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:52,159
Are you forcing Baoning

695
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,600
to be married to Yongqing State?

696
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:56,360
You!

697
00:43:59,120 --> 00:43:59,879
Your Highness!

698
00:44:00,075 --> 00:44:00,919
Grandmother!

699
00:44:00,919 --> 00:44:01,959
- Grandmother!
- Mother!

700
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:02,919
Hurry!

701
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,150
- Mother!
- Grandmother!

702
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,800
Your Highness!

703
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,560
- Are you okay?
- Your Highness!

704
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,719
Your Highness!

705
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:08,399
Your Highness!

706
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:09,800
Be careful.

707
00:44:16,175 --> 00:44:17,879
The Grand Empress Dowager is unwell.

708
00:44:18,175 --> 00:44:19,479
The betrothal between

709
00:44:19,479 --> 00:44:21,159
the son of Marquis Jinghai
and Commandery Princess Jia’nan

710
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,360
is canceled.

711
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:24,439
As for the rest,

712
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,119
we’ll discuss it later.

713
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

714
00:44:33,925 --> 00:44:36,693
(Renshou Hall)

715
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:44,080
Listen,

716
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,919
get Dr. Tian to Qingshan House.

717
00:44:45,919 --> 00:44:46,719
Yes, Your Grace.

718
00:44:50,075 --> 00:44:50,959
Your Highness?

719
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:54,600
I faked it in an emergency.

720
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:57,639
How could I watch them

721
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:00,120
marry you to Yongqing State?

722
00:45:00,919 --> 00:45:02,360
No need for a doctor.

723
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,199
Let’s hurry back to Qingshan House.

724
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:05,399
I was so scared.

725
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:27,679
I think Her Grace is at
Renshou Hall at the moment.

726
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,600
How come you have
the Book of Supreme Weapons?

727
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,399
During the fire,

728
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,439
the book was left
outside Treasure House.

729
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,040
I picked it up and kept it for you.

730
00:46:17,479 --> 00:46:19,000
So it was you who saved me
that day, wasn’t it?

731
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,239
When I led the soldiers there,

732
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:21,479
Master Zhao had already rescued you.

733
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:22,719
You liar!

734
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:25,120
The book had been on me all the time.

735
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,239
If you weren’t the first one
who found me,

736
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:27,479
you wouldn’t have it.

737
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,840
You’d been searching for
the book, hadn’t you?

738
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,280
Why do you give it back to me?

739
00:46:35,439 --> 00:46:38,159
I figured it could be put to good use

740
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,159
as your belonging.

741
00:46:42,879 --> 00:46:43,679
Let me ask you another question.

742
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,679
What happened to Zhao Xiao’s injury?

743
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,199
A moment ago, Qing Tai

744
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:50,479

I was thinking

747
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,959
I couldn’t let you marry
someone from somewhere far away,

748
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:07,760
much less Yongqing State.

749
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:10,040
Answer me.

750
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,719
You were the one in the race,

751
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,719
and you were the one who saved my life.

752
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,360
How do you think of me?

753
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,879
If I say,

754
00:47:31,959 --> 00:47:33,239
I love you,

755
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:38,479
will you take me
somewhere far away from here?

756
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,399
Sorry, Your Grace.

757
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:02,239
