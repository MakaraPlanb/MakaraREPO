=Episode 24=

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,360
I strictly followed
Your Highness’s instructions.

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,080
None of us in Shoukang Palace
informed Her Grace.

29
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,760
That’s strange.

30
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,320
Is it, Your Majesty?

31
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,920
Your Majesty, when I came out
of Shoukang Palace,

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
I heard Stewardess Meng
talked to the maids

33
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,080
about Her Highness’s instructions

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,480
that no one is allowed to tell
the princess about her illness,

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,920
lest she would be worried.

36
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,680
Send someone to Bingzhou

37
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,560
and tell Commandery Princess Jia’nan

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,800
that the Grand Empress Dowager
is seriously ill.

39
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,440
Her fate is unknown.

40
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,240
Yes.

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,840
Baoning, it’s so difficult for me

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,480
to see you now.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don’t blame her.

44
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,760
There are many people in the palace,

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,680
it’s inevitable that the news leaks.

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,080
It’s good, though.
Baoning seldom comes back.

47
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,800
When I get free time,

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,360
I can spend more time with you

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
and Baoning.

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,760
Li Qian has military tasks

51
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,920
and comes a little late.

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,320
But he’s coming soon.

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
Grandmother needs a rest.

54
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,360
I won’t waste Your Majesty’s time
to accompany us.

55
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,800
Tomorrow,

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,120
I’ll accompany you with Li Qian.

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
Good. Good.

58
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,120
Your Majesty, you have a lot to do
in the court.

59
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,280
Just go to work.

60
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,960
Don’t worry about me.

61
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,840
I’ll leave you alone, then.

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,080
Let the guard of Gate of Divine Might

63
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,160
find an excuse to keep Li Qian out.

64
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

65
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,900
(Li’s Mansion)

66
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,800
I know you like this.

67
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,375
Yeah.

68
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,680
Don’t just eat fish.

69
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,200
Try something else.

70
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,720
Here, try some of this.

71
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,680
This tastes good.

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,240
How do you like it?

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,800
You have some, too.

74
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,920
Child,

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,720
how can you just eat one of the dishes?

76
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,600
I kept telling you,
don’t be fussy about your food.

77
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,160
It’s not good for your health.

78
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,680
Do you know how worried I was

79
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,880
when you were not at home?

80
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,000
I was thinking, when you come home,

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,800
I must cook lots of
your favorite dishes.

82
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,400
Mother,

83
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,600
would you take your nose
out of my business?

84
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,040
How can I do that?

85
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,240
You’re my baby girl.

86
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,240
Do you know how worried I was

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,480
when you sneaked away from home?

88
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,000
I haven’t blamed you,

89
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,480
yet you’re impatient with me.

90
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,720
Honestly!

91
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,320
Let me ask you.

92
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
You sneaked away from home

93
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,920
and made the whole family
worry about you.

94
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,480
Don’t you feel guilty?

95
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,480
Because you discipline me

96
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,080
and restrain me all the time.

97
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,240
You force me to get married.

98
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,160
You don’t let me do anything.

99
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,640
That’s why I ran away from home.

100
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,440
It’s my fault, then?

101
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,600
Everything I do is for your good.

102
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,080
Now you’re blaming me?

103
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,040
Fine.

104
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,280
From now on,

105
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,480
I won’t mind your business again.

106
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,280
Do whatever you like.

107
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,320
I’ll never mind you again.

108
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,950
Are you satisfied?

109
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,760
Mother, you must keep your words.

110
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:21,485
I…

111
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,450
You…

112
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,600
You should behave like a girl.

113
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,975
It doesn’t look good to brandish
swords and spears all day long.

114
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:40,868
(Clear Sky and Gentle Breeze)

115
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,920
Did I have a hallucination?

116
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,320
She’s really leaving me alone?

117
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,440
Mother, I’m back.

118
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,350
Mother.

119
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,920
Mother, Baoning said

120
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,720
she would let me
take over the Charity House.

121
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,040
There’re many people
in need of help.

122
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,154
Um.

123
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,080
Do you agree?

124
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,840
It doesn’t matter if I agree or not.

125
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,480
It’s your own decision.

126
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:52,125
I…

127
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,600
Oh.

128
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,725
So…

129
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,600
Mother.

130
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,000
Well…

131
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,640
I’m finished.

132
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,640
She’s really angry with me now.

133
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,520
She didn’t even talk to me.

134
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,760
Will Madam come to the garden today?

135
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,840
I don’t know.

136
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:33,250
Um.

137
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,840
I’m dressed in the way she likes it,

138
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,000
yet she ignores me.

139
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,040
Couldn’t she be smoothed down?

140
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,125
By the way,

141
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,760
how’s Grandmother’s condition
in the beginning?

142
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,800
It was a sudden onset.

143
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,640
But after Chief Physician Tian
checked on her,

144
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,000
she could get up that night.

145
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,040
Why did I hear that she was

146
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,000
seriously ill when I was in Bingzhou?

147
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,120
How could it be possible?

148
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,320
How dare the messenger talk nonsense?

149
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,480
It must be my good cousin.

150
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,320
How could His Majesty be so obsessive?

151
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,720
Your ladyship,
it’s time to take medicine.

152
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,000
Are you feeling unwell?

153
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,675
It’s nothing.

154
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,280
Her ladyship goes to the palace every day
to wait upon the Grand Empress Dowager.

155
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,640
Being afraid she might be
infected with morbid qi,

156
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,920
Lord Cao specially asked us

157
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,280
to bring her herb soup.

158
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,000
Are you hiding something from me?

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,920
Are you sick?

160
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,560
I’m not sick.

161
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,680
Actually,

162
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
I was pregnant a few days ago,

163
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,920
but I had a miscarriage

164
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,040
because of an accident.

165
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,840
Maybe it was my fate that

166
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,400
I couldn’t bring it to the world.

167
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,640
Baoning, don’t worry.

168
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,160
I’m all right now.

169
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,280
I believe we’ll have

170
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,240
a baby again.

171
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,840
Definitely.

172
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:52,480
Your Majesty.

173
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,600
Why’re you still waiting for me?

174
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,320
I’m surprised that

175
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,600
you come back so soon.

176
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,680
Why don’t you stay longer
with your cousin?

177
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,080
You’ve got many informers.

178
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,640
Her Highness has been ill for a while.

179
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,040
Why weren’t you anxious

180
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,600
to visit her?

181
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,560
As soon as Jiang Baoning came,

182
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,320
you became anxious.

183
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,680
Did you call Jiang Baoning
to the palace?

184
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,560
What if I did?

185
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,760
Do I need your approval

186
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,200
to do anything?

187
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,480
Instead of meddling in my business,

188
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,640
you’d better manage the harem well

189
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,400
and prepare for the birthday ceremony,

190
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,440
Master of the Harem.

191
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

192
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,560
I’ll prepare

193
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,680
a grand royal birthday ceremony

194
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
and let you see

195
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,200
if I’m in the same league

196
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
as your beloved cousin.

197
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,240
Your Grace.

198
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,400
Your Grace. It’s late.

199
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
It’s time to go to bed.

200
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,080
Let’s wait a little longer.

201
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,200
The curfew begins soon.

202
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,880
I don’t think we’ll meet
Commandery Prince today.

203
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,240
It’s late, yet Li Qian hasn’t arrived.

204
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,200
What happened to him?

205
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,800
Wei Shu.

206
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,040
Your Grace, what can I do for you?

207
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,400
Go to the Gate of Divine Might
and inquire about Li Qian.

208
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,375
Yes.

209
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,360
You’re worrying overmuch.

210
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,760
What could possibly happen to him?

211
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,720
Who’s it?

212
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,440
Superintendent of Border Battalion,
Li Qian.

213
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,320
I’ll take it from here.

214
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,800
Mr. Li, you don’t serve in the palace.

215
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,920
As a superintendent, you have no right
to walk freely in the palace.

216
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,440
I’m afraid we can’t let you in.

217
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
I was supposed to come with
Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

218
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,040
I’m late because of military affairs.

219
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,520
Things took place unexpectedly.

220
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,240
Could you make an exception
in my favor?

221
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,640
Sorry, we can’t.

222
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,320
The Gate of Divine Might is
the main entrance to the palace.

223
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,080
We can’t make exceptions randomly.

224
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,760
How dare you!

225
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,200
Mr. Li is the Commandery Prince.

226
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,400
How dare you be so rude to him?

227
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,400
He must have a pass no matter who he is.

228
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,600
You…

229
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,225
Wei Shu.

230
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,100
What?

231
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,200
Can’t we have a word outside the gate?

232
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,280
Of course you can.

233
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,000
I just want to remind you,

234
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,560
the curfew begins soon.

235
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,160
How’s the Grand Empress Dowager?

236
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,520
Her condition is stable and
she can get up now.

237
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,800
When you return, tell the princess

238
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,560
I’ve arrived. Don’t let her worry.

239
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,440
If she wants to see me,
I’ll be staying in Li’s Mansion.

240
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,640
Young Master,
don’t you go in the palace?

241
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,520
You should go now.

242
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,680
Yes.

243
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,200
Your Grace,
Commandery Prince has been shut out.

244
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,480
How dare they?

245
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,800
Let’s go to see.

246
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,040
Hey, Your Grace.

247
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,440
The curfew has already begun.

248
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
The gate must have been locked.

249
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,120
Young Master has left.

250
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,880
He asked me to tell you he’s safe.

251
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,720
If you want to see him,
he stays at Li’s Mansion.

252
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,280
He must be upset.

253
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:47,025
(Li’s Mansion)

254
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,920
Dongdong is old enough.

255
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,600
She is already a big girl now.

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,280
She knows

257
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,160
what she says and does now.

258
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,200
What did she do?

259
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,840
She knows how to help her sister-in-law
manage the Charity House.

260
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,440
She also knows to dress up as a lady.

261
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,200
She knows everything.

262
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,200
She doesn’t need me anymore.

263
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,920
I don’t understand you.

264
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,880
Really.

265
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,320
You always scolded her
for being childish before.

266
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,920
Now she grew up,

267
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,880
and you start to complain of
yourself not being needed.

268
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,680
You’re really strange.

269
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,080
Just sleep.

270
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,080
Why on earth did I talk about

271
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,480
a mother’s thoughts with you?

272
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,800
You would only upset me.

273
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:45,750
(Shoukang Palace)

274
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,000
Your Grace.

275
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,280
Her Highness’s pulse is stable.

276
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,160
She is now recovering.

277
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,840
I’ll prescribe a prescription
to nourish her vitality

278
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,880
and build up her health.

279
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,840
Go to collect your reward.

280
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,120
Thank you, Your Grace.

281
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,760
Baoning, as soon as you come,

282
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,275
I’m well.

283
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Don’t make fun of me.

284
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,920
Why didn’t your husband come?

285
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,120
I’ll bring him tomorrow.

286
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,000
Tomorrow?

287
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,600
Yeah.

288
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,225
Did you have a quarrel?

289
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,880
With me by your side,
why do you always think of him?

290
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,760
Young Master.

291
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,240
Young Master, the Grand Empress Dowager
has just recovered.

292
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,560
Her Grace is waiting upon her.

293
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,760
She’ll come later.

294
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,840
I got it.

295
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,350
(East Market)

296
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,160
The guards at the Gate of Divine Might

297
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,840
were audacious in the extreme.

298
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,480
They dare shut out Commandery Prince.

299
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,280
Mr. Li is an important person
in Bingzhou,

300
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,520
yet he was shut out of the palace.

301
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,280
It’s so humiliating.

302
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,480
Do you think…

303
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,920
I would be angry if it was me.

304
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,480
That would be strange
if he’s not angry.

305
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,359
I don’t think so.

306
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,240
Your Grace, if you go to Bingzhou
with Mr. Li,

307
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,960
only to find you are shut out
by his servants

308
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
and can’t go in his mansion,

309
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,040
will you be angry?

310
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,800
You still have to
grant one of my wishes.

311
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,760
Do you remember?

312
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,325
Sure.

313
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,760
I want you to do it now.

314
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,160
Shoot.

315
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,720
Can you stop being angry with me?

316
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,480
I know you’re usually
easy to get along with,

317
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,400
but you’re actually proud.

318
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,000
You were humiliated
at the gate of the palace.

319
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,760
It must not be a pleasant feeling.

320
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,440
It was all my fault.

321
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,800
I left in a hurry
and didn’t consider thoroughly.

322
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,920
If I left you a waist tag

323
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,160
or asked Grandmother
for verbal instruction,

324
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,800
it wouldn’t happen.

325
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,375
Come here.

326
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,840
Have you cooled down?

327
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,560
I wasn’t angry.

328
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,250
Ah?

329
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,120
Who said I was angry with you?

330
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,800
I should give him a beating.

331
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,480
Then why didn’t you
go to the palace during the day?

332
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
You made me worried.

333
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,880
A guard stopped the Commandery Prince
at the main gate of the palace.

334
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,360
If it was at the instigation
of the Emperor,

335
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,400
I don’t want to

336
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,000
complicate matters while you’re

337
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,960
worried about Grandmother.

338
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,920
If it was not,

339
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,080
I do serve in Bingzhou.

340
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,960
My official rank doesn’t give me
the right to walk freely in the palace.

341
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,560
They were right.

342
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,400
People are watching you in the palace.

343
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,560
If I made a show of authority
in your name,

344
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,920
it would give them an excuse.

345
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,360
It all simmers down to the truth

346
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,120
that I’ve married a princess.

347
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,720
I feel guilty for you.

348
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,480
Since you think for me all the time,

349
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,840
I must repay you, mustn’t I?

350
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,280
It’s difficult to sustain
a royal marriage.

351
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,920
I promise you...

352
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,200
I promise...

353
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,550
your honor will increase
when your son is born.

354
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,950
What did you say?

355
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,640
I won’t say it again.

356
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,840
Well,

357
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,880
aren’t you still
in need of recuperation?

358
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,320
A chief physician in the palace
examined me.

359
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,880
The prescription Aunt gave me
works well.

360
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,800
Really?

361
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,720
If you keep asking me,

362
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,725
I’ll take back my words.

363
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,880
Madam, see you next time.

364
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,640
I promise,

365
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,040
I’ll inform you

366
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,760
when new goods come in.

367
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,196
Good. Thank you.

368
00:21:01,196 --> 00:21:01,725
Yeah.

369
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,200
- Goodbye.
- Yeah.

370
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,240
Madam, see you next time.

371
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,725
Sir,

372
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,640
she never left empty handed
every time she came.

373
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,560
What happened today?

374
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,120
- Care for nothing but money.
- Maybe

375
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,080
she’s in a bad mood.

376
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,200
- OK.
- Go inside.

377
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,960
Get back to work.

378
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,640
Go.

379
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,840
You must exchange it for me.

380
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,200
I said I wouldn’t.

381
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,840
No, you’re dishonest!

382
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,240
The hairpin I sold you was exactly
the same as the one I have.

383
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,640
You say they’re different.

384
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,400
Why should I believe you?

385
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,560
How could they be the same?

386
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,280
No return. No exchange.

387
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,200
Dongdong.

388
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:32,960
Mother.

389
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,360
What happened?

390
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,640
What’re you doing here?

391
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,560
Did you ask for your mother’s help?

392
00:21:37,675 --> 00:21:38,360
Tell you what,

393
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,400
it doesn’t help even if
you ask all your family to come.

394
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,920
I said no exchange.

395
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,440
Shut up.

396
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,000
You…

397
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:44,275
- Tell me what happened.
- Mother.

398
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:45,440
Look at the hairpin in his hand.

399
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
I paid for it,

400
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,240
not expecting him to take another one

401
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,720
out of his bag for me.

402
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,680
They’re different in workmanship.

403
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,600
I asked him for that one.

404
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,480
He wouldn’t give me.

405
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,275
Take this.

406
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,640
Dongdong,

407
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,950
it’s obviously not of the same quality.

408
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,520
Yes. He wouldn’t exchange it.

409
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,680
How can you lie about it?

410
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,200
You can only have the one you bought.

411
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,080
No exchange.

412
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,360
It’s my rule.

413
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,680
Fine. Listen carefully, everyone,

414
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,360
no exchange.

415
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,360
Let me ask you,

416
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,360
if I give you counterfeit money

417
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,920
and tell you I’m not responsible,

418
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,840
will you swallow grievances in silence?

419
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,040
Yes. Yeah.

420
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,720
Yes.

421
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,360
She’s right.

422
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:21,875
Yes.

423
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,800
Here. Look carefully, everyone.

424
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,520
- This hairpin
- Give me back.

425
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,880
is the one
he uses to attract customers.

426
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,200
- This is the defective one
- I…

427
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,680
- he tricked my daughter into buying.
- Who tricked you?

428
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,200
- Yeah.
- They’re exactly the same.

429
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
Are they of the same style?

430
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,080
Who would buy that?
Did you hear me?

431
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,960
People say big shops
shortchange customers.

432
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,360
Yours is just a small stall.

433
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,960
How dare you
shortchange customers openly?

434
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,720
And you dare shortchange my daughter.

435
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,960
- Exactly.
- Tell you what,

436
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,240
the most important thing
in doing business is integrity.

437
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
If you don’t

438
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,280
return me the money today,

439
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,680
believe it or not,

440
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,280
I won’t let you set up the stall again.

441
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,520
I’ll ruin your business.

442
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,800
I’ll kick you out of the street.

443
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,200
Right.

444
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,280
- Money.
- Money.

445
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,040
You... you make me fearful.

446
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:03,075
Wait.

447
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,880
I don’t want the money back.

448
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,600
I want the hairpin in his hand.

449
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,000
Of course we want the money back.

450
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,080
As for the hairpin,

451
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,520
I’ll take it, too,

452
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,760
in case you’ll

453
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,920
make more defective ones

454
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,600
to cheat people.

455
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,520
- Right.
- Exactly.

456
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,280
- Yes. Right.
- Everyone, look at this face.

457
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,250
Remember it.

458
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
You must see clearly.

459
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,640
- Dishonest trader.
- Profiteering merchant.

460
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,680
How can you do business by cheating?

461
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,500
- Really?
- You’ve gone too far.

462
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,960
Mother, you’re awesome.

463
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,400
He had gone too far just now.

464
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,120
How did you do that?

465
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,000
- You made him so mad.
- Shut up.

466
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,150
You didn’t know

467
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,800
how fearful I was

468
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,000
just now.

469
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,625
Mother.

470
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,680
You wicked girl.

471
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,680
I used to beg you

472
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,280
to come out shopping with me.

473
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,640
You just ignored me.

474
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,920
- I…
- What did you think today?

475
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,480
Come out to buy a hairpin?

476
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,975
Forget the hairpin.

477
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,120
I don’t blame you for buying it.

478
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,350
But you don’t know

479
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,800
how to deal with
the stallholder at all.

480
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,720
You were fooled easily.

481
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,000
You blamed me
for meddling in your business.

482
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,480
Was there anyone
who cared about you just now?

483
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,840
Did any of the onlookers
stand out for you?

484
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,600
If I hadn’t run into you,

485
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,600
you

486
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,440
would surely get bullied.

487
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,640
The run leaves me out of breath.

488
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,760
Do you know how worried I am?

489
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,120
How can you smile?

490
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,680
Mother.

491
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,400
What?

492
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,320
Don’t you think I’m right?

493
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,880
You begin to talk to me.

494
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,560
Get knotted!
I don’t want to talk to you at all.

495
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,450
Mother. Mother.

496
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,120
I... The other day,

497
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,040
I went too far to say those words

498
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,000
and made you upset.

499
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,320
See you next time.

500
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,560
I know I was wrong.

501
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,500
Snacks.

502
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,200
Do you know?

503
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,200
Yeah.

504
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,320
You won’t annoy me again?

505
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,400
Mother.

506
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,960
Now what?

507
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,360
I bought the hairpin for you.

508
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,120
What? You…

509
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,800
Did you buy the hairpin for me?

510
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:19,775
Yeah.

511
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,900
I loved it at first glance.

512
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,520
I thought you would
look good wearing it.

513
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,080
Dongdong, it’s sweet of you
to buy the hairpin for me.

514
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
I must look good wearing it.

515
00:25:36,975 --> 00:25:37,575
Yeah.

516
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,760
Mother.

517
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:41,280
Um…

518
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,925
The other day,

519
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,240
I said those words

520
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,200
wasn’t because I didn’t want you
to mind my business.

521
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,840
I’d like you to do that.

522
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,375
But sometimes it just upset me

523
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,920
when you don’t listen to me.

524
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,800
I grew up now.

525
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,640
I have my own thoughts sometimes.

526
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,040
I hope we can exchange our minds.

527
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,280
I hope you can believe me.

528
00:26:09,675 --> 00:26:10,379
Come again.

529
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,480
Good girl.

530
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,400
My daughter grew up.

531
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,600
I believe you.

532
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,600
No.

533
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,720
When... when have you

534
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
changed back into this outfit?

535
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,000
I wore dresses to please you.

536
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,160
I didn’t want you

537
00:26:41,425 --> 00:26:43,480
- to be mad at me.
- Since you know it makes me happy,

538
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,000
why have you changed back?

539
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:45,600
I...

540
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,080
I like you to dress like that.

541
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
You look so nice in beautiful dresses.

542
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,975
Didn’t we agree that

543
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,680
we should exchange our minds

544
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,360
on what I wear and what I do?

545
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,120
I won’t exchange minds with you.

546
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,160
Look at your dark clothes.

547
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,171
- Look at your hairstyle.
- Don’t worry.

548
00:26:59,171 --> 00:27:00,080
Enough, mother.

549
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,880
- It hasn’t been easy for me.
- Calm down, mother.

550
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,200
- I go about begging for help
- I... no...

551
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,520
- to find you…
- I... I’m not…

552
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,800
- I’m always worried about you.
- I…

553
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,000
What should you do?

554
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,480
Your father cares for nothing.

555
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,560
Mother, enough.

556
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,750
Let’s go home.

557
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,920
Change your clothes when we get home.

558
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,450
Yeah.

559
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,160
Wear what I tell you to.

560
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,775
Sure.

561
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:23,300
(East Market)

562
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,825
Who is it?

563
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,120
Commandery Princess Jia’nan
and Commandery Prince.

564
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,240
Your Grace,

565
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,640
you can go in, of course.

566
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,760
But Mr. Li doesn’t have a pass.

567
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,240
I’m sorry.

568
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,960
Now you see,

569
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,800
my husband is with me.

570
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,520
Please don’t
make things difficult for me.

571
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,480
I’m doing as I was ordered.

572
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,280
You should listen to my orders, too,

573
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
shouldn’t you?

574
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,920
Of course.

575
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,240
Li Qian, the Superintendent,

576
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,920
is my husband.

577
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,240
I am his pass.

578
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,200
I don’t care who has
given you the orders,

579
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,240
if you shut him out again,

580
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,825
you’ll get punished. Do you understand?

581
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,840
Yes. Yes.

582
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,960
I was rude last night.

583
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,150
Please forgive me, Mr. Li.

584
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,200
Never mind.

585
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,960
What should we do?

586
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,280
How do we explain it to His Majesty?

587
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,880
Are you a fool?

588
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,520
Who do you think
Commandery Princess Jia’nan is?

589
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,480
We can’t afford to offend her.

590
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,680
I feel like
I’m a donkey in a lion’s hide.

591
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,760
How so?

592
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,680
I think I was too gentle to him.

593
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,800
No, next time I’ll help you
to vent your spleen.

594
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,200
Cool down.

595
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,560
I appreciate

596
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,480
your kindness.

597
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,200
I come late for some reason.

598
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,520
I hope Grandmother will excuse me.

599
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,320
You’re busy with official duties,
yet you’re still thinking about me.

600
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,040
It’s good that you come.

601
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
Grandmother, how do you feel today?

602
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,640
Much better.

603
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,120
Maybe it’s because

604
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,240
I haven’t seen you for a long time.

605
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,440
As soon as I see you today,

606
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,320
I’m so pleased that I get well.

607
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,440
OK, I won’t leave the palace, then.

608
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
I’ll stay with you.

609
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,920
You should ask for
your husband’s permission.

610
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,120
I don’t want you to stay with me.

611
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,280
I look forward to seeing
my great grandson.

612
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,520
I cannot bear to leave you.

613
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,160
Baoning is still
in need of recuperation.

614
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,040
Grandmother, don’t worry about that.

615
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:28,025
Um.

616
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,880
You left in a hurry.

617
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,880
Don’t stay in the palace for long.

618
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,040
Baoning, go back
with your husband to Bingzhou earlier.

619
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,120
His Majesty arrives.

620
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,720
I sent for him.

621
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,360
Grandmother.

622
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,400
Your Majesty.

623
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,280
I was telling Baoning,

624
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,360
the guards at the Gate of Divine Might

625
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,320
should be disciplined.

626
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,800
Baoning came to

627
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,200
visit me with her husband,

628
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,560
not expecting he was shut out.

629
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,960
Your Majesty, don’t you think

630
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,720
they were intended to despise me?

631
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,840
Stand up.

632
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,120
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Yes.

633
00:30:16,575 --> 00:30:17,200
Grandmother.

634
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,800
You’re right.

635
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,560
I will have them disciplined.

636
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,300
Um.

637
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,480
Baoning.

638
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:25,175
Yes.

639
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,400
I get well now.

640
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,200
You leave the palace
and go back with your husband today.

641
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,900
Baoning, sit down.

642
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,320
Grandmother, Baoning has just come back.

643
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,960
Why don’t you let her
stay for a few more days?

644
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,560
She can accompany you for longer.

645
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,040
Baoning is married into the Li family.

646
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,680
She doesn’t belong to the palace
any more.

647
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,360
It’s not appropriate for her
to live in the palace.

648
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,920
Moreover, don’t some people think

649
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,360
it’s against the rules that
she brings her husband?

650
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,600
In that case,
you should return to Bingzhou early,

651
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,920
lest it gives people excuses.

652
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,760
Grandmother, you’re right.

653
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,160
We’d better leave now.

654
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,680
So long, Your Highness.

655
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,520
So long, Your Majesty.

656
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,000
Goodbye.

657
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,250
Um.

658
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,325
(Gate of Divine Might)

659
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,400
I ask both of you to come

660
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,360
to have a cut-and-dried talk.

661
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,320
How’s the preparation

662
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,280
of the Birthday Ceremony going?

663
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,280
Your Highness.

664
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,560
Are you still comparing prices?

665
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,520
Yes.

666
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,400
Show me the

667
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,080
comparison records.

668
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,450
Yes.

669
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,375
(Self-cultivation
for Long-term Stability)

670
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,440
Have all the merchants

671
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,320
and price comparison of every item

672
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,000
been recorded?

673
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,680
Yes, Your Highness.

674
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:49,000
Your Highness, you…

675
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,000
The Ministry of Rites
neglects its duty.

676
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,000
The comparison records
vanished all of a sudden

677
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,840
due to improper safekeeping.

678
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,280
If someone presents a memorial
of complaint to the throne…

679
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,080
I…

680
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,520
How will you explain to His Majesty?

681
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,560
Please show mercy!

682
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,840
I can let it pass.

683
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,120
But I have a question.

684
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,160
Can you start purchasing now?

685
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,080
Sure. Sure.

686
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,760
I’ll start now.

687
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,240
Your Highness,

688
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,000
I just remembered

689
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,520
I have an important thing to do with
the Imperial Household Department.

690
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,200
Please excuse me.

691
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,160
Sir, what’s the hurry?

692
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,960
Aren’t your department
checking the stock?

693
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,080
What’s the important thing
that needs you to deal with yourself?

694
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,280
I... No, I…

695
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,840
Greetings, Your Highness.

696
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:21,275
Um.

697
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,159
You may rise.

698
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:31,104
Your Highness.

699
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,560
Please answer.

700
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,480
Can you start to
allocate the utensils now?

701
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,639
I... I am at your disposal.

702
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,560
She’s got quite a few tricks.

703
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,440
What’s the use of you all?

704
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,400
You can’t even tell a lie.

705
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,560
What’s the point of supporting you?

706
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,680
Your Majesty, please calm down.

707
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,200
It was our fault.

708
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
Please forgive us.

709
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,680
What should we do now?

710
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,480
What else can you do?

711
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,040
Just do what you should do.

712
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,480
Dismiss.

713
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,920
- Yes. Your Majesty.
- Yes. Your Majesty.

714
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,375
Du Sheng. Du Sheng.

715
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,960
Go to check my private treasury

716
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,480
and find out how much silver I have.

717
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,480
Private…

718
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,000
Use it for disaster relief.

719
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,280
Private treasury?

720
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,160
Your Majesty…

721
00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:48,840
Cut the crap. Just go.

722
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,800
Your Grace, how’s the
Grand Empress Dowager’s condition?

723
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,520
She has recovered.

724
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,560
Here, eat while it’s warm.

725
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,400
Good then.

726
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,560
Darling,

727
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,920
what’s wrong?

728
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,920
Have some food.

729
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,320
I have no appetite.

730
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,840
Why didn’t I see Dongdong?

731
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
Where has she been?

732
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,400
Forget about her.

733
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,960
Since Dongdong

734
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,160
started to help in the Charity House,

735
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,440
we’ve barely seen her every day.

736
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,175
I don’t know

737
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,760
when she could get married.

738
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,440
Mother, look.

739
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,600
Isn’t it the pair of red agate earrings

740
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,800
I lost in Li’s Mansion

741
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,200
in the capital?

742
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,775
Yeah.

743
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,480
Thank goodness.

744
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,360
Baoning, you’re so considerate.

745
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,080
How did you find them?

746
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,040
Did you make a detour

747
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,480
to the mansion just to find them?

748
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,560
Mother, Baoning and I spent the night

749
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,825
there yesterday.

750
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:05,750
Ah?

751
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,280
Really?

752
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,075
Why...

753
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,950
why did you spend the night there?

754
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,160
You’re embarrassing them.

755
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,480
Go to ask

756
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
the cooks

757
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,480
to cook more nourishing soup

758
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,120
that prevents miscarriage for Her Grace.

759
00:37:23,425 --> 00:37:24,475
Oh.

760
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,400
Qian, your trip to the capital

761
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,560
was a great harvest.

762
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:32,225
Yeah.

763
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,500
Surely it was.

764
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,160
Please excuse me.

765
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,960
She is shy.

766
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,425
That’s a great harvest.

767
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:43,100
Yeah.

768
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,575
Are you tired?

769
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,200
OK, go to register there,

770
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,325
then you can have a rest.

771
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:50,960
Yeah. Okay.

772
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,880
Are you alone?

773
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,450
Yes.

774
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,600
OK, go to register there.

775
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,240
- OK.
- Go ahead.

776
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,050
Put it here.

777
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,320
Aunt, are you alone?

778
00:37:58,325 --> 00:37:58,825
Here.

779
00:37:59,300 --> 00:37:59,900
Thanks.

780
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:00,590
Give him a hand.

781
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,480
- Give me this.
- Give him a hand.

782
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,400
Go ahead, Aunt.

783
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,525
Have you been well fed recently?

784
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,475
Yes.

785
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,880
Fire, fire!

786
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
Someone help! Put out the fire!

787
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,560
What’s up?

788
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,280
Aunt, what’s wrong?

789
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,480
The fire won’t burn you.

790
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,840
- It’s just a bonfire to boil water.
- Put it out. Put it out.

791
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,120
Put it out.

792
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Come on, don’t be afraid.

793
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,960
Come on, let me help you.

794
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,475
Fire.

795
00:38:35,475 --> 00:38:37,050
Shall we go and have a rest?

796
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,120
Fire.

797
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,725
Let’s go.

798
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,480
Is there something wrong with her?

799
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,120
She was just fine.

800
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,000
Look at her.

801
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,880
Since the establishment
of the Charity House,

802
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,400
Young Master’s reputation
has been rising day by day.

803
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,150
Yeah.

804
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,600
The disaster victims that
crowd into Bingzhou

805
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,080
not only get a shelter,

806
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,680
but also make a living

807
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,480
with the help of the Charity House.

808
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,760
Strong men work in the fields.

809
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,280
Women have sewing work.

810
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,725
In that aspect,

811
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,720
the Li family have solved

812
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,600
a difficult problem
for the imperial court.

813
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,080
Of course.

814
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,440
Commandery Princess Jia’nan has made
great contributions

815
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,650
in Young Master’s achievements.

816
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,300
Yeah.

817
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,440
She has done

818
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,520
a decent thing.

819
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,280
First, she has helped the victims.

820
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,240
Second, she has won public praise.

821
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,640
The most estimable thing is

822
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,160
she has attributed

823
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,760
all her credit to Qian.

824
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,720
Sure.

825
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,960
Qian is so lucky

826
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,240
to have such a good wife.

827
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,560
He has won glory for our ancestors.

828
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,400
Ultimately, it’s because
you’ve brought him up properly.

829
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,480
You have a good son

830
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,080
and a good daughter-in-law.

831
00:39:41,175 --> 00:39:41,925
Um.

832
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,400
I heard Uncle wants to see me.

833
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,025
Um.

834
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,880
Do you know the establishment

835
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
of the Charity House?

836
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,480
Her Grace cherished great
righteousness to relieve the victims.

837
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,080
Such an achievement

838
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,800
has been spread all over the city.

839
00:39:56,925 --> 00:39:57,575
Yeah.

840
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,560
Since the establishment of
the Charity House,

841
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,040
the respectable squires and merchants

842
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
have made generous donations.

843
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,080
People think

844
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,280
the Charity House
is founded by our family.

845
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,280
But we know clearly

846
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,840
the start-up fund

847
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,240
was allotted by Her Grace

848
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,160
from her dowry.

849
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,720
Her Grace is dedicated
to the people.

850
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,800
As her father-in-law,
I can’t just look on and do nothing.

851
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,520
So I want you

852
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,840
to withdraw all the silver

853
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,400
that I gave you for the need of turnover

854
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,000
from the bank.

855
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,320
Buy some rice and cotton

856
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,640
and send those to the Charity House.

857
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,400
Winter is coming.

858
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,640
To spend this winter,

859
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,520
they need 5,000 dans of rice

860
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,720
and 4,000 jins of cotton at least.

861
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,280
You have connections and many friends.

862
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,720
I’ll put you in charge of it.

863
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,240
Moreover, you should help more

864
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,600
with the things in the Charity House.

865
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,320
Don’t let Her Grace work too hard.

866
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,720
I will live up to your trust.

867
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:03,000
Um.

868
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,720
I put all the silver
into the underground bank.

869
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,480
I’m afraid I can’t withdraw a penny now.

870
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,680
Miaorong,

871
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,120
Uncle gave me the money
for the need of turnover.

872
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,280
Now he wants me to use it

873
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,360
to purchase supplies
for the Charity House.

874
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,600
If the supplies can’t be in place,

875
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,240
when Uncle questions me,

876
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,120
neither you nor I
can bear the responsibility.

877
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,200
I thought it was more important.

878
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,240
You just need it for disaster relief.

879
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,800
I remember

880
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,920
you have some spare money.

881
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,320
Why don’t you use that first?

882
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,920
As soon as I withdraw the money,

883
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,600
I’ll fill the gap for you.

884
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,920
I’m afraid it doesn’t work.

885
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,680
Uncle asked me to purchase

886
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,600
4,000 jins of cotton
and 5,000 dans of rice.

887
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,880
If there’s short weight,

888
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,600
Uncle must hold me accountable.

889
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,360
There’s a well-doer surnamed Zhou
in the neighboring county

890
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,800
who has hoarded over
10,000 dans of moldy rice.

891
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,320
I heard by paying him a little money,
he’ll let your workers

892
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,040
move the rice out.

893
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,640
For the victims,

894
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,360
it’s hard enough

895
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,840
to have a hot meal.

896
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,280
Moldy rice just tastes not that good.

897
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,080
They can still be well fed.

898
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:25,440
Cotton

899
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,480
isn’t a problem at all.

900
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,720
We can mix some sand in it.

901
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,680
Nobody will find it out

902
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,520
without looking carefully.

903
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,600
How can I do that?

904
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,880
If someone finds it out…

905
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,240
If both of us don’t say,

906
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,080
no one will find out.

907
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,600
Lin, I know I’ve got you

908
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,200
into trouble.

909
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,200
If you’re afraid

910
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,320
to take the responsibility,

911
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,040
I’m going to see Uncle Li now

912
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,680
and take all the blame myself.

913
00:42:59,225 --> 00:42:59,800
Hey.

914
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,400
I’ll do something about it.

915
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,520
I’ll help you to make up

916
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,400
the deficit as soon as possible.

917
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,360
Chuan.

918
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,640
Chuan. What’s wrong?

919
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,120
Chuan. What’s wrong?

920
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,440
Chuan.

921
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,640
Chuan. Wake up. Chuan.

922
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,240
What happened to him?

923
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:36,920
Chuan.

924
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,375
Chuan.

925
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,875
- Chuan.
- Chuan. Chuan.

926
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,040
What happened?

927
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,360
My son has felt unwell
in the stomach

928
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,960
since last night.

929
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,600
I thought something he ate

930
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,520
caused him an upset stomach.

931
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,320
Just now,

932
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,160
he suddenly vomited and sweated a lot

933
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,840
before he passed out.

934
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,640
- Chuan.
- Poor kid.

935
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,120
Did he eat something unclean?

936
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,000
I got it.

937
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:02,560
- Chuan.
- It must be the rice we recently eat.

938
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,560
Wake up, Chuan.

939
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,360
As you say so,

940
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,120
- I also think there’s something wrong.
- Chuan, wake up.

941
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,640
The rice isn’t so fresh as before.

942
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,600
It has a musty smell, too.

943
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,040
Chuan.

944
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,360
Chuan.

945
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,240
Why is your body so cold, Chuan?

946
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,760
Chuan.

947
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,240
Yes.

948
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,325
Son.

949
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,680
He’s not breathing.

950
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,040
Chuan!

951
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,640
Baoning. Baoning. Baoning.

952
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,880
Something’s wrong.

953
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,560
What’s up?

954
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,375
People died in the Charity House.

955
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,280
What’s going on?

956
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,640
A child called Chuan

957
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,440
had eaten moldy rice porridge

958
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,920
that caused diarrhea and sickness.

959
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,680
When I rushed there with the doctor,

960
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,080
he already died.

961
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,440
The doctor said,
under normal circumstances,

962
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,200
moldy rice only causes
diarrhea and vomiting.

963
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,400
But it will kill those who have

964
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,160
gastrointestinal problems.

965
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,320
How did moldy rice
get in the Charity House?

966
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,040
I don’t know, either.

967
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,360
I’m afraid someone
would make an issue of it,

968
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,880
so I lose no time coming to inform you.

969
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:02,925
Well,

970
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,840
you go to the Charity House
as soon as possible

971
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,480
to confirm

972
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,680
if there is really moldy rice.

973
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,300
Yes.

974
00:45:16,025 --> 00:45:16,575
Yes.

975
00:45:21,475 --> 00:45:23,275
A life for a life. Debts must be paid.

976
00:45:23,275 --> 00:45:23,950
A little child died.

977
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:25,900
How can you hide in the house
and shut the door on us?

978
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,475
My poor son.

979
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:30,760
- Give me back my son.
- Come out. Come out!

980
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,360
- Quiet, quiet, quiet
- Come out!

981
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,360
Everyone, be quiet.

982
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,280
Listen to me.

983
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,680
Folks,

984
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,080
let’s decide which side is right.

985
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,360
The poor child

986
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,600
was less than six years old.

987
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,160
He died under the persecution
of the Charity House.

988
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,760
Come out!

989
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,720
Quiet, quiet.

990
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,720
Do you know the Charity House

991
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,800
is funded by Commandery Princess Jia’nan

992
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,560
of the Li Family?

993
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,040
Outwardly,

994
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,000
the Charity House

995
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,640
offers the victims a place
to eat and live.

996
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,050
- But in fact,
- My poor child.

997
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,320
she accumulated wealth
and filled her own pockets

998
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,425
in the name of the House.

999
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,080
She only took out a small part
to help the victims.

1000
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,840
To save money,

1001
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,160
she purchased moldy rice
in large quantities,

1002
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,200
which killed Chuan
who had a bad stomach.

1003
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:16,225
A life for a life!

1004
00:46:16,225 --> 00:46:17,525
- Enough. Enough.
- A life for a life!

1005
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,040
Everybody, calm down.

1006
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,720
Let’s have a talk.

1007
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,000
Give me back my son.

1008
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,040
Go. Let’s go.

1009
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,650
Madam.

1010
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,240
You must give us an explanation.

1011
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,000
Calm down, everyone.

1012
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,320
Madam,

1013
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,240
we understand your pain
of losing your son.

1014
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,120
But every injustice has its perpetrator.

1015
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,960
It has nothing to do with our madam.

1016
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,520
Really.

1017
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,680
The one who deserves to be attacked

1018
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,040
is the initiator of evil.

1019
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,080
No. No.

1020
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,560
- I don’t care about the initiator.
- Give me back my son.

1021
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,320
All I know is the thing

1022
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,200
has a lot to do with your family.

1023
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,240
- You’re a family.
- I…

1024
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,600
You can shield each other.

1025
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,720
Our lives are worthless.

1026
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,400
Even though it’s true,

1027
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,120
they can’t treat us like animals,

1028
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:55,760
right?

1029
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,920
Yes. That’s right.

1030
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,760
Throw!

1031
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,200
You... you’re absolutely lawless.

1032
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,120
A life for a life.

1033
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,240
You’re lawless.

1034
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:03,840
Madam.

1035
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,800
Stop it!

1036
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,425
Stop! Stop!

1037
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,960
Are you all right, Mother?

1038
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:11,520
Your Grace, what’s the matter?

1039
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,440
- You don’t stay at home as we ask.
- They’re of the same batch.

1040
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,840
You insist on
establishing the Charity House.

1041
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,880
Great.

1042
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,440
Now people died.

1043
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,360
The victims make trouble at our door.

1044
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,240
Tell me,

1045
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,240
don’t you have to find a way
to solve the problem?

1046
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,160
I don’t care.

1047
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,760
If it continues,

1048
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,425
people would think
someone from our family died.

1049
00:47:26,425 --> 00:47:27,680
Murderer, give us an explanation.

1050
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,280
- Madam, anger is harmful to health.
- We can’t just let them go.

1051
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,280
- Take care of yourself.
- A life for a life.

1052
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,280
Enough.

1053
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,520
- Your Grace, see for yourself.
- A life for a life.

1054
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,362
They’re making a terrible scene.

1055
00:47:34,362 --> 00:47:35,040
A life for a life.

1056
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,080
Even though you want to
earn a reputation,

1057
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,840
you should think of the family.

1058
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,760
You’ve got Madam in trouble.

1059
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,240
Even Qian’s name is blackened.

1060
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,360
Don’t try to get away with it.

1061
00:47:43,775 --> 00:47:44,700
Don’t let them get away.

1062
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,325
Before the truth is found out...

1063
00:47:46,325 --> 00:47:47,075
Don’t let them get away.

1064
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,520
...don’t try to blame it on me.

1065
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,680
Give us an explanation.

1066
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,240
A life for a life. A life for a life.

1067
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,520
Yes. A life for a life.

1068
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,720
A life for a life.

1069
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,680
Folks,

1070
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,080
I’m so sorry

1071
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,480
something like that happened.

1072
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,720
Though apologies won’t
bring the dead back to life,

1073
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,840
I sincerely

1074
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,440
apologize to you.

1075
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,480
The only purpose of the Li Family
to establish the Charity House

1076
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,160
is to offer people

1077
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,400
who don’t have clothes and food

1078
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,440
a place to live.

1079
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,840
I already know about the moldy rice.

1080
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,480
I’ve sent someone to investigate it.

1081
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,280
I hope you can give me a few days.

1082
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,880
I promise to give you

1083
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,840
a satisfactory explanation.

1084
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,960
No.

1085
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,640
A life for a life.

1086
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,480
No.

1087
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,640
- Life for life.
- Stop. Stop.

1088
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,440
What’s the point of
all the sweet words?

1089
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,000
After the victims eat moldy rice,

1090
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,160
they begin to vomit
and have watery stools.

1091
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,920
Their health gets much worse.

1092
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,160
With poor health,

1093
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,120
they can’t work.

1094
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,040
Without work, they can’t make money.

1095
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,160
Without money,

1096
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,280
they don’t get enough food.

1097
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,920
Tell me, what will you do with it?

1098
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,025
Yeah, what will you do with it?

1099
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,880
Don’t worry, everyone.

1100
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,600
Later,

1101
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,400
we’ll make a list.

1102
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,520
All the people who ate moldy rice

1103
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,640
and haven’t recovered

1104
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,960
don’t have to work.

1105
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,840
We don’t believe you.

1106
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,840
We don’t believe you.

1107
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,360
Your Grace.

1108
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,480
Your original intention of establishing
the Charity House may be good.

1109
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,400
But can you have a little conscience

1110
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,600
over the widows of the soldiers

1111
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,280
that died in the battle?

1112
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,720
Yes. She’s right.

1113
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,280
Yes. She’s right.

1114
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:12,840
They don’t treat us like humans.

1115
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,055
Yes, we’re bullied
because we have no relationship.

1116
00:49:14,055 --> 00:49:14,850
How can you treat us so badly?

1117
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:15,400
Yes.

1118
00:49:16,325 --> 00:49:17,100
Look at this.

1119
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,160
What’s this?

1120
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,200
Inside the cotton-padded clothes
distributed by the Charity House,

1121
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,920
half is sand.

1122
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,925
How can they give out such things?

1123
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,200
If we wear the clothes

1124
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,080
made of such cotton,

1125
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,520
won’t we freeze to death in winter?

1126
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,320
Yes. We will freeze to death.

1127
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,240
Give us an explanation.

1128
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,280
Yes. Give us an explanation.

1129
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,680
- We want an explanation.
- Do you try to kill us?

1130
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,800
We want an explanation.

1131
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,800
Either moldy rice

1132
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,400
or cotton mixed with sand,

1133
00:49:43,825 --> 00:49:44,640
until today,

1134
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,120
I’ve never heard of that.

1135
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,600
But as the founder,

1136
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,840
when such an accident happened,

1137
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,400
I won’t keep out of the affair.

1138
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:52,390
Go ahead.

1139
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:52,950
Yes.

1140
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,960
Chuan died suddenly.

1141
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,360
I know exactly how you feel.

1142
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,280
Losing children at the old age

1143
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,680
is the greatest pain in the world.

1144
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,120
Other people will be as sad as you.

1145
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,680
But I hope you can give me a few days.

1146
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,160
I won’t let Chuan
hold a grievance after death.

1147
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,375
Silver.

1148
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,400
- This is silver.
- So much silver.

1149
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,800
Look, so much silver.

1150
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,800
Get a coffin for your son.

1151
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,120
Lay him to rest.

1152
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,600
I hope you can be my witnesses.

1153
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,840
Here are 5,000 taels of silver.

1154
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,680
It will be used to purchase
rice and cotton.

1155
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,840
If this happens again,

1156
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,640
I’ll take all the responsibilities.

1157
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,640
We can rest assured, then.

1158
00:50:50,325 --> 00:50:50,975
Yes.

1159
00:50:51,225 --> 00:50:52,275
You must keep your word.

1160
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,200
Right.

1161
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,920
You are a smart guy.

1162
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,680
You know what to do.

1163
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,320
Wait to see a good play.

1164
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,640
Folks, did you hear her?

1165
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,640
Her Grace shows mercy

1166
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,920
and gives us silver.

1167
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,080
Folks, grab the silver.

1168
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,320
Hurry.

1169
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,320
Don’t snatch.

1170
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:13,975
- Don’t snatch.
- There will be nothing left later.

1171
00:51:13,975 --> 00:51:15,040
- Don’t snatch.
- Don’t snatch, everyone.

1172
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,800
Unruly people.

1173
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,600
- We’ve spent so much money…
- What are you doing? Don’t snatch.

1174
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,520
Slow down there.

1175
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,160
Don’t snatch.

1176
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,040
Don’t snatch.

1177
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:23,920
Your Grace, be careful.

1178
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:24,800
Step back.

1179
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,920
- Hurry.
- Step back.

1180
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,800
Step back. Step back.

1181
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,520
Whoever takes the lead
in making trouble

1182
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,800
will be arrested.
