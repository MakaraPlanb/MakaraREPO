Yes.

29
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,839
Don’t fight for long.

30
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:41,360
Fight a quick battle.

31
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes.

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,520
(Bingzhou City)

33
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,600
Hurry. Close up!

34
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,800
Get your bows and arrows ready.
Make your best defensive efforts.

35
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:30,080
Young Master.

36
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,000
Are you the warrior
from the Marquis’s Mansion?

37
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,960
Young Master.

38
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,119
Please go back to Nanmin
to help His Highness.

39
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:44,440
What happened?

40
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:48,399
The military pay His Highness gave you

41
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,559
should’ve been used
to suppress the pirates.

42
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,160
In former years,
they attacked us in winter.

43
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,240
We didn’t expect that

44
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,399
they would come early this year.

45
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,520
They’ve committed all kinds
of crimes against the fishermen.

46
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,600
We can’t suppress them any longer.

47
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,399
What about my father?

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,960
His Highness…

49
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,119
His Highness is seriously injured.

50
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,679
He will not live long.

51
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:21,760
What?

52
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:27,959
Li.

53
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,519
The enemies from Yongqing State
bore down menacingly.

54
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,519
I thought they were tough.

55
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,480
But they’re nothing more than this.

56
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,399
Did they try to break the defense
of the city with so few people?

57
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,119
Unusual things

58
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,359
indicate a scheme.

59
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,279
The enemies were easily defeated

60
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,359
because their reinforcements
haven’t arrived yet.

61
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,160
Jin Xiao, I’m worried about Qing…

62
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,880
What’re you worried about?

63
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,440
Rest assured.

64
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,399
I think they just made a wrong decision.

65
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,320
Report!

66
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:56,959
Emergency news.

67
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,160
Zhao Xiao, commander of Yunlin Pass,

68
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,480
left his resignation
and deserted his post.

69
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,399
He’s gone to Nanmin.

70
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,160
Yunlin Pass requests
emergency reinforcements.

71
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:04,959
No.

72
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,600
The enemies’ reinforcements

73
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,119
must seize the chance
to break through the pass.

74
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,320
Reinforce the pass now.

75
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:12,600
Is Zhao Xiao a pig?

76
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,000
(Jiang’s Mansion)

77
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:22,119
May my country be prosperous
and the people at peace.

78
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:24,359
May my family be safe.

79
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,399
May my husband have a sound return.

80
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:30,320
Your Grace.

81
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,320
Madam has settled down.

82
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,440
Fortunately, it’s our own manor.

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,480
It is cleaned often.

84
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,359
It’s no trouble to settle down.

85
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,799
The enemies from Yongqing are furious.

86
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:42,079
The war has become stalemated.

87
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,200
I’m afraid the situation is turbulent.

88
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,760
Tell the housekeeper

89
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:49,079
to send more servants
to guard the manor.

90
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,920
Yes.

91
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,720
Your Grace, be careful.

92
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,040
Your hand…

93
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,519
Don’t worry.

94
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,720
I’ve finally made some progress
after a long time of thinking.

95
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,920
But I keep feeling
I’ve missed a key step.

96
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,000
The army of Yongqing
broke through Yunlin Pass

97
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,239
and launched surprise attacks
all the way,

98
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,799
(Qing State Yunyang Bingzhou Yunlin)
heading towards the capital of Mu’an.

99
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,760
(Capital of Mu’an)
The pirates are on a rampage in Nanmin.

100
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,720
(Capital of Mu’an)
The smoke of gunpowder is all over Mu’an.

101
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,679
The capital is in danger.

102
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,040
Mr. Wang.

103
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,839
The enemies have
broken through Yunlin Pass

104
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,000
from Jinxi Left Road.

105
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,320
They’re marching directly
towards the capital.

106
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,279
Though Jinxi Right Road

107
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,239
is guarded by Li Changqing and his son,

108
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:43,079
there’re only 50,000 troops
stationed in Bingzhou

109
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,119
and it’s hard enough for them

110
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,600
to protect the city.

111
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,119
Yongqing State launched
a massive invasion

112
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,519
without any sign.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,279
The Ministry of War
is short of provisions and funds.

114
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,760
Militaries all over the country are
asking for emergency help

115
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:57,880
and urging the imperial court
to send reinforcements.

116
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,399
His Majesty ordered Archduke
to send all his family troops

117
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,959
to reinforce.

118
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,440
In the end, there’re no troops
guarding the capital.

119
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,679
His Majesty is really…

120
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,279
Your Majesty.

121
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,320
What?

122
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,799
Are you going to ask me
for troops and provisions, too?

123
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,799
You’re all useless.

124
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,640
Get lost.

125
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,679
Go.

126
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,239
Your Majesty.

127
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,600
Yiru.

128
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,440
Why did you leave Longevity Hill?

129
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:07,640
Your Majesty.

130
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:11,079
Xi and I miss you day and night.

131
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:12,399
I know

132
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,239
it’s the most difficult time for you.

133
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:16,839
I must come to see you

134
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,799
even if I have to risk my life.

135
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:29,880
Xi.

136
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,640
I still have Xi.

137
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,640
Hurry. Hurry.

138
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,239
Hey, you.

139
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,119
Hurry. Go.

140
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,080
Someone help.

141
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,359
Hurry.

142
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,799
I found them.

143
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,919
Go.

144
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,880
In the back.

145
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,400
Qing An.

146
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,000
I’m going to distract them.

147
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,719
As soon as the enemies leave,

148
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,280
you find a way to transfer the folks.

149
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

150
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,799
Who’s there? Stop!

151
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:20,719
Arrows!

152
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,440
Qian.

153
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,000
Dongzhi.

154
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,200
Qian, I’ll go there and have a look.

155
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,119
Boss,

156
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,679
our main forces have marched towards
the capital of Mu’an.

157
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,479
There’re not many troops left here.

158
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,159
Retreat.

159
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:07,000
Retreat.

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,719
- Retreat.
- Retreat.

161
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:15,320
Li.

162
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,280
What should we do next?

163
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,320
Lock down the city.

164
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,520
Clear the remnant enemies.

165
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,799
Reinforce the capital immediately.

166
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,320
Yes.

167
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,760
Go.

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,479
Go.

169
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,320
Lord Cao, I’m sorry.

170
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,719
The armies of Yongqing have
invaded us on a large scale.

171
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,119
The palace is no safer than the outside.

172
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,640
I feel worried about
you being alone here.

173
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,559
I’d better find a safe place for you

174
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,159
before I join the imperial guards.

175
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,479
Darling, you must be very careful.

176
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,640
I’m really worried about
Her Highness’s health.

177
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,440
Su, don’t worry too much.

178
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,840
Her Grace is very intelligent.

179
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,119
They’ll be safe.

180
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,760
Open the door.

181
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:53,719
Coming.

182
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:54,559
I’m starving.

183
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,239
(Eternal Peace and Prosperity)
Get me food and drink quickly.

184
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,760
Hurry.

185
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:58,919
Yes, yes.

186
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,320
We’ll bring you food and drink.

187
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,719
Just stay away from the gate.

188
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
I’ll have the food sent to you.

189
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:03,520
Hurry up.

190
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,799
Open the door.

191
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,760
Open the door now!

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,080
What should we do?

193
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,919
Those who can protect us
all went to war.

194
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:11,599
Only we weak people are left behind.

195
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,559
Misfortune dropped from Heaven.

196
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,599
The mansion of generals

197
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,200
is harassed by some bandits…

198
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,719
Listen.

199
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,559
Open the door!

200
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,159
Don’t come in.

201
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,359
Go away.

202
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:24,880
You, you…

203
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,520
They look like rich people.

204
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,159
Bros,

205
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:32,119
we’re making a fortune.

206
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,719
Qingke.

207
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,320
Hand over
your valuable property quickly!

208
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,840
Shut up.

209
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,400
Hand it over.

210
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,919
Madam.

211
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,880
You bandits, stop talking nonsense.

212
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,880
Tell you what,

213
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,760
this is Commandery Princess Jia’nan’s
mansion.

214
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,840
How dare you run wild!

215
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,440
If it were the princess’s mansion,

216
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,000
we would be the emperors.

217
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,559
Go.

218
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,760
Go.

219
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,239
Get back to the house.

220
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,840
Madam, hurry.

221
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,119
Close the door.

222
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,719
Anyone who doesn’t want to die, get out!

223
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,679
Go, let’s go.

224
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:36,880
Your Grace,
what should we do with the body?

225
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,599
Hang it outside the mansion

226
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,599
as a warning.

227
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,039
Go ahead.

228
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,599
Your Grace, your hand…

229
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,320
This thing is too powerful

230
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:58,760
with many uncertainties.

231
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,440
It may hurt others and ourselves.

232
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,159
Find a place to put it away.

233
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,719
If it’s found by those
who harbor evil designs,

234
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,880
we’ll be in big trouble.

235
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:22,679
There.

236
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,239
Yiru.

237
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,559
You’re so nice to me.

238
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,119
The Empress has arrived.

239
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

240
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,280
You vixen.

241
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,359
You try every means
to seduce His Majesty.

242
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,280
How dare you be so unbridled
in front of me!

243
00:14:59,520 --> 00:14:59,840
You…

244
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,400
You slapped me because of this vixen?

245
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,679
I not only dare to slap you,

246
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,280
but also dare to abolish you.

247
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:08,880
I... I’ll kill her.

248
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,280
You...

249
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,799
Your Majesty,

250
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,520
are you really so cruel to me?

251
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,359
The Empress Dowager has arrived.

252
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,520
How dare you!

253
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,520
Don’t you have any manners?

254
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,440
This is no time for you

255
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,559
to be jealous of each other.

256
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:57,679
Greetings, Mother.

257
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,679
Yi.

258
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,359
You feel unwell.

259
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,000
Don’t stand on ceremony.

260
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,760
Don’t worry, Mother.

261
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,760
I’m in good health.

262
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,840
I’ll attend the imperial court session
tomorrow morning.

263
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,119
Someone come here.

264
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,200
Take the consort back to Longevity Hill.

265
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,119
Your Majesty.

266
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:24,200
Your Majesty.

267
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,719
Your Majesty, help me!

268
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,559
Your Majesty!

269
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,239
Your Majesty, help me!

270
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,479
You’re dismissed.

271
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:56,960
You have grown up.

272
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:02,119
It’s time for you to learn

273
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,160
how to govern a country

274
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,439
and how to be a good emperor.

275
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,760
In the past years,

276
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,000
I’ve been working day and night
for the country.

277
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,640
Now it’s time for me to retire.

278
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,079
I want nothing now

279
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,000
except for spending more time with Xi

280
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,479
and bring him up well.

281
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,040
It’s my only wish.

282
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,599
Yi.

283
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,640
You must take good care of yourself.

284
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,040
Do you get it?

285
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,800
I have only one request.

286
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:09,839
I hope you can be a wise monarch

287
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,040
and don’t disappoint the people
of our country.

288
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:33,680
Your Majesty!

289
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:34,680
Your Majesty.

290
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,359
You must take care of yourself,
Your Majesty.

291
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:37,640
Come on.

292
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,119
Sit.

293
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,359
Du Sheng.

294
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,000
What should I do?

295
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,079
Your Majesty,

296
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,760
pull yourself together.

297
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,479
We still have Jinxi Army

298
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,719
and Beiji Army.

299
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,880
As long as they return to the capital,

300
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,520
our country will be
safe and secure again.

301
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:09,719
Jinxi.

302
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,599
Baoning.

303
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:20,880
Du Sheng.

304
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,079
Send Commandery Princess Jia’nan

305
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,119
the edict at top speed.

306
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,280
It’s Young Master.

307
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,680
Young Master is back.

308
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:38,760
Young Master.

309
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,400
No.

310
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,520
Father.

311
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,920
I’m an unfilial son.

312
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,239
I came back late.

313
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,880
Young Master.

314
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:08,800
It was a hard fight.

315
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,520
The pirates were as many as locusts.

316
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,160
His Highness resisted till death.

317
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:17,040
He would rather die
than take a step back.

318
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:22,000
Now nearly all the clansmen
of the Zhao Family have sacrificed.

319
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,839
Why didn’t you ask
the imperial court for help?

320
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,199
His Highness feared the appropriation
of military pay was discovered

321
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,239
and your future would be affected.

322
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:37,760
But the enemies far outnumbered us.

323
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,199
Later we had to ask for reinforcements.

324
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,439
At that time, the Yongqing State
launched an invasion.

325
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:45,800
The imperial court had no troops

326
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,839
to reinforce us.

327
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,760
Father.

328
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,439
Father.

329
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,719
It’s my fault.

330
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,719
It’s all my fault.

331
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:59,439
I’m back to ask for punishment.

332
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,160
Why don’t you get up
and give me a beating?

333
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,359
Father.

334
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:05,839
Father.

335
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,359
Father.

336
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,199
Young Master.

337
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,280
Restrain your grief, Young Master.

338
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:15,920
Restrain your grief.

339
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,160
Father.

340
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,199
I didn’t listen to you.

341
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,160
Now I have to face the consequence.

342
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,280
Father.

343
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,479
Young Master.

344
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,719
Father, rest assured.

345
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:58,280
I won’t let our clansmen
die for nothing.

346
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,479
Miaorong.

347
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:16,680
Lin.

348
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,760
Miaorong, you’ve worked hard.

349
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,800
Try this.

350
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,359
Come here.

351
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,040
Don’t you think
they make a great couple?

352
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,560
Sure.

353
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,319
Girl.

354
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,760
When are you getting married?

355
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Yeah.

356
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,040
You’re old enough.

357
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,119
Why don’t you fix a date?

358
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,000
Remember to

359
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,479
invite us to your wedding banquet,

360
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,640
so that we can have a blast together.

361
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,319
Right.

362
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:52,760
Have a blast together.

363
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,640
Don’t talk nonsense.

364
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,280
Look.

365
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:54,959
Miaorong.

366
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:55,920
She’s shy.

367
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:56,959
Don’t get upset.

368
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:00,439
Run!

369
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:03,160
The soldiers of Yongqing come! Run!

370
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,160
Hurry!

371
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,760
Run!

372
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,079
Let’s go.

373
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,040
Come on.

374
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:51,959
(Auspicious and Propitious)
Who is it?

375
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,239
Who is it?

376
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,400
Stop knocking.

377
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,280
Who is it?

378
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,880
This is the private residence
of Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

379
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:00,800
Are you sick of living?

380
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,199
Eunuch Du, what brings you here?

381
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,880
Eunuch Liu, take me to the princess.

382
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,359
All right.

383
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,319
Your Grace.

384
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,800
His Majesty entrusts you with
the national affairs after his death.

385
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,439
Are my grandmother and
people of the Archduke’s Mansion fine?

386
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,560
The situation
is still calm in the capital.

387
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,959
But the enemies are marching
towards there.

388
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:24,640
They’ve broken several defenses.

389
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,319
His Majesty worried
that the disaster was impending,

390
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,199
so he asked me to send you the edict.

391
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,479
Your Grace.

392
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,520
The only person
His Majesty can trust now

393
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,400
is you.

394
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
He is being stupid.

395
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:39,400
The situation may take a favorable turn.

396
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,359
He doesn’t have to
make the testamentary edict now.

397
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,280
There are things that you don’t know.

398
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,640
Yongqing waged war on us.

399
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,119
Pirates are on a rampage in Nanmin.

400
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,959
His Majesty is seriously ill.

401
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:50,239
He’s fully occupied.

402
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
I appoint Commandery Princess Jia’nan
to supervise national affairs

403
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,119
and assist the presumptive heir,
Zhao Xi,

404
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:06,040
as well as preserve the peace
for our people.

405
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,239
That way, I will have no regrets.

406
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,280
What nonsense is this?

407
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,319
You’re not dead, Zhao Yi.

408
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,760
Someone come.

409
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,599
Prepare a carriage.
I’m going to the capital.

410
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:45,959
Qing An.

411
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:47,239
Qing An.

412
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,520
Qing An.

413
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:57,680
Qing An, come out.

414
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:58,439
Be quick.

415
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,719
Hurry up.

416
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:02,959
- Stop!
- Stop!

417
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,400
Go ahead.

418
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,719
We’ve been waiting for you.

419
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,599
Step back.

420
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:27,479
Qing An, get her!

421
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,760
Qing An, kill her!

422
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:43,959
Qing An.

423
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,400
I told you to kill her!

424
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,599
Kill her!

425
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,040
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

426
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:19,880
Come on.

427
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,479
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

428
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,239
Kill her! Kill her!

429
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:33,839
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

430
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:34,800
Qing An.

431
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,680
If you can’t do it,

432
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,000
we’ll do it for you.

433
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,079
Let’s go.

434
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:11,560
Hurry.

435
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:14,479
Make way. Make way.

436
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:19,719
Hurry.

437
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:25,680
Hurry.

438
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,320
(Yunlin Pass)

439
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,000
Here.

440
00:28:37,661 --> 00:28:38,481
Be careful.

441
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,400
Don’t worry.

442
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,880
It will be all right.

443
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,160
I’ve dressed the wound.

444
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,680
It will heal in a few days.

445
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,560
Don’t worry.

446
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,800
You will be all right.

447
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,400
Be careful.

448
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,160
Li.

449
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:56,119
Bingzhou City is closely guarded.
It won’t be in imminent danger.

450
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,599
But after Yunlin Pass
was broken through,

451
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,959
the main forces of the enemy

452
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:01,239
have been marching towards
the capital without a break.

453
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,199
They drive ahead without
considering the consequences.

454
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:04,479
What do they want to do?

455
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,160
Here. Cloth. Dress the wound.

456
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,319
As for that,

457
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,880
I think Qing Tai is
coming after His Majesty.

458
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:15,800
Young Master.

459
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,439
The princess received an imperial edict.

460
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,040
She is heading for the capital.

461
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,920
What?

462
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,800
Young Master, wait.

463
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,560
There’s more news.

464
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,319
The princess received
more than one imperial edict.

465
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,199
Your Grace.

466
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,599
The trip is dangerous
and we left in a hurry.

467
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,680
Should we send someone
to tell the prince?

468
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,079
No.

469
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,719
I’ve left him a letter.

470
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,439
Besides, he’s facing a formidable enemy.

471
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,199
I don’t want to distract him.

472
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,239
But if the fake edict

473
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:57,040
is seen through…

474
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,000
Your Grace, there’s one more thing.

475
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,640
What is it?

476
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,400
Please forgive my rudeness.

477
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:24,560
Your Grace.

478
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,000
I don’t know what it is, either.

479
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:29,640
His Majesty sealed it himself

480
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,079
and attached it to my back.

481
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,079
He even thought of

482
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:38,199
passing the throne to a distant uncle

483
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:39,000
supposed the First Prince died.

484
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,520
How stupid!

485
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,880
Knowing the situation is critical,

486
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,560
why didn’t he write an edict
calling in troops to save him?

487
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,160
It’s doesn’t matter
who inherits the throne.

488
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,800
This is an edict calling in troops
to save the emperor.

489
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,359
Sure enough, you’re the best

490
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,040
at imitating His Majesty’s handwriting.

491
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,719
If the edict is found to be fake,

492
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,719
I’ll take all the responsibilities.

493
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,280
I won’t let the enemies

494
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,319
destroy my country.

495
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,839
I will always be with Your Grace.

496
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,560
Xiaoman.

497
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,160
You go at top speed

498
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:19,640
to send the edict

499
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,400
to Yang Jun, Commandant of Beiji.

500
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,040
Ask him to lead his troops
to press forward day and night

501
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,199
to rescue the capital.

502
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,719
Father.

503
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,560
The situation is not optimistic.

504
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,959
Report.

505
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,239
Troops of Yongqing
have gathered outside the city.

506
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:44,319
I’m afraid the city gate would be
broken through in a few days.

507
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:19,400
(Zhennan Gate)

508
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:34,880
Mr. Xiong.

509
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:36,959
Your Grace.

510
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,280
Young Master.

511
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,520
Have you inspected the capital gate

512
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,839
and Gate of Divine Might?

513
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:45,479
How’re Mr. Wang and Mr. Zuo doing?

514
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,920
The troops of the Jiang Family
have been sent all over the country.

515
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
The capital can only rely on your guard.

516
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,520
When the country is in danger,

517
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,640
every man is responsible.

518
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,439
To go through the difficult pass,

519
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,479
I’m willing to charge at the head
of my men.

520
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,160
You’re definitely an honorable man

521
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,119
and a pillar of the state.

522
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:14,880
Now the elite troops
of the imperial guards

523
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,439
have all been transferred
to guard the capital gate.

524
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,719
Only after the situation in Jinxi
and Nanmin settles down,

525
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:20,800
could feudal officials

526
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,000
reinforce the capital.

527
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,599
Before that,

528
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:28,040
we’ll die to guard the city.

529
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:42,040
Anyone?

530
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,359
Is anyone here?

531
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,199
Anyone? I want water.

532
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,760
Baoning,

533
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,719
can I see you again?

534
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:34,560
Your Grace.

535
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,360
Why don’t you get a bit more rest?

536
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:38,239
We don’t have time. Hurry up.

537
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:41,199
Who is it?

538
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,120
Young Lady.

539
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:45,120
Dongdong.

540
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,040
Baoning.

541
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:46,840
Let’s go.

542
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,639
Baoning.

543
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,840
It’s great to meet you.

544
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,399
Baoning, why are you here?

545
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,080
How do you know I’m here?

546
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:56,639
No, it’s dangerous here.

547
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,000
What if my brother knows?

548
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,840
- No. You must return to Bingzhou now.
- Fine. Fine.

549
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,000
Slow down. Slow down.

550
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,199
Young Lady,

551
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,760
shouldn’t you be in Yunlin?

552
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,959
Why are you here?

553
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,120
Come.

554
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,959
What happened to him?

555
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,399
Siqin came to tell me the other day…

556
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,159
Qing An...

557
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:25,840
I thought he was dead.

558
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,439
But I don’t know what he’d been through.

559
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,000
He’s become a man who even takes orders

560
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,320
to kill me.

561
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:36,800
Fortunately,

562
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,520
he didn’t kill me in the end.

563
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,679
Baoning.

564
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:44,719
He still cares about me.

565
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,080
Dongdong.

566
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,080
Don’t cry.

567
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,520
Don’t cry.

568
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,560
Baoning.

569
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:03,159
I must have him cured.

570
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,360
Before that,
please don’t tell our family.

571
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,239
Your Majesty.

572
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:27,040
Even though the soldiers of Mu’an
defend their capital tenaciously,

573
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,479
in another day,

574
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,679
we’ll break through the gate.

575
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,479
After taking Zhao Yi’s head

576
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,679
and his treasure, we should leave
as soon as possible.

577
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,320
Otherwise, once the enemy
sets up the defense at the passes

578
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,520
and sends armies from all directions
to rescue the capital,

579
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:46,639
there will be no way back for us.

580
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Wu, you worry too much.

581
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,560
Your Majesty.

582
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:56,399
Didn’t you see the people of Mu’an?

583
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:59,040
Do you think they can fight against me?

584
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,199
Your Majesty.

585
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,000
We have no foundation in Mu’an.

586
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,840
The conditions of their people
are different from ours.

587
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:06,399
Force alone

588
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:08,800
can hardly bring them into obedience.

589
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,520
Even if you ascend the throne,

590
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,320
their people

591
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,520
may rebel under the banner of
eliminating foreign enemies.

592
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:16,719
I think

593
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:18,639
after capturing their emperor,
we should take the long view.

594
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,800
I’ve made up my mind!

595
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,280
No further discussion.

596
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,199
Come.

597
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,199
Tomorrow, let’s branch out
into two columns.

598
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,719
You go to the Longevity Hill
to capture Empress Dowager Cao.

599
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:38,639
I’m going to storm into their palace.

600
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:53,199
Why don’t you tell me the truth?

601
00:37:54,879 --> 00:37:55,639
Your Majesty.

602
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,199
You are blessed by gods.

603
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,840
Don’t worry too much.

604
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:10,159
I... I’ll make

605
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,520
a new prescription for Your Majesty.

606
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:19,080
Enough.

607
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,760
Don’t fool me with your medicine soup.

608
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,360
I know well about my health.

609
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:32,439
May Your Majesty be healthy.

610
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:34,679
May Your Majesty be healthy.

611
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:38,639
You may leave.

612
00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:41,919
May Your Majesty be healthy.

613
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:03,520
I’m alone now.

614
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:15,600
Come this way.

615
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,840
Mr. Xiong.

616
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,679
The gate’s been broken through.

617
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:24,439
There’s no point
in defending it till death.

618
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:25,639
Leave with me.

619
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:27,280
Leave if you want.

620
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,000
I’ll defend Zhennan Gate
till my last breath!

621
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,800
(Zhennan Gate)

622
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Kill them! Kill!

623
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,719
Retreat.

624
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:24,199
Kill them! Kill them all!

625
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:26,320
- Go.
- Retreat.

626
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,000
Retreat quickly.

627
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,679
Come on!

628
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,399
Mr. Xiong!

629
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,439
You’re unaware of your own limitation.

630
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,679
Report!

631
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,199
Report!

632
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,679
Zhennan Gate has been broken through.

633
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,120
Mr. Xiong died for the country.

634
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,080
Mr. Xiong.

635
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,040
Send my orders.

636
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:31,439
Take strict precautions
and defend to the last.

637
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:32,080
Yes!

638
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,280
Lyu, go with me to protect His Majesty.

639
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:36,959
Yes!

640
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:40,919
Mr. Wang.

641
00:41:40,919 --> 00:41:41,560
Mr. Jiang.

642
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:42,919
I’ll leave it to you.

643
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,600
Mr. Jiang!

644
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,919
Mr. Wang, what should we do?

645
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:56,520
What should we do?

646
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,600
Why do you ask me?

647
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,320
I’m not the general. You are!

648
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,399
Even if we die,

649
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:10,439
Gate of Divine Might

650
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:12,879
mustn’t be broken through in my guard.

651
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,919
Listen carefully!

652
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,520
No retreat is allowed!

653
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:21,159
If anyone dares to
defy the military order,

654
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:24,040
I’ll behead him!

655
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,439
Yes!

656
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:28,679
Dongdong.

657
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:30,560
The capital is not far ahead.

658
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,280
I’m going to Longevity Hill first

659
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,679
to make arrangements for
Empress Dowager Cao and Zhao Xi.

660
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,439
Then,

661
00:42:34,439 --> 00:42:35,800
I’ll meet you at Shoukang Palace.

662
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:37,439
You and Qing An must be careful.

663
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:37,959
All right.

664
00:42:38,479 --> 00:42:39,320
Don’t worry, Baoning.

665
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:43,360
See you, then.

666
00:42:43,439 --> 00:42:44,040
Take care.

667
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:54,280
Come.

668
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,840
Success or failure
hinges on this one action.

669
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:09,120
Qing An, you have to make it.

670
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,000
Brat, do you want to die?

671
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,639
Treacherous brats.

672
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:39,159
They don’t want to live, do they?

673
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,439
Eunuch Li,

674
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,239
the soldiers of Yongqing are coming.

675
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,639
Who cares about this?

676
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,040
Yes, you are right.

677
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,639
Let’s go to find the Empress Dowager.

678
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,919
Let go of me.

679
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360
Be quiet.

680
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,120
Your Highness.

681
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:22,239
Come with us.

682
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,239
Who are you?

683
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:29,000
How dare you command me?

684
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,320
I’m the Empress Dowager of Mu’an.

685
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:35,159
Not to mention bandits like you,

686
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:38,000
even our Emperor

687
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:43,199
must pay me the highest respect
by kowtowing.

688
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,159
Your Highness, don’t you know

689
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,760
your precious emperor

690
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,919
is at the point of death?

691
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,679
Mu’an is on a firm basis.

692
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,679
An emperor’s death

693
00:45:07,399 --> 00:45:11,800
won’t ruin the country.

694
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:17,760
I won’t talk glibly with you again.

695
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:18,959
Someone.

696
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:19,399
Yes.

697
00:45:19,959 --> 00:45:20,560
Take her away.

698
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:21,120
Yes!

699
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,639
Step back!

700
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:36,760
Your Highness.

701
00:45:37,959 --> 00:45:39,239
I treat you with all sincerity.

702
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,560
Why do you bring about
your own destruction?

703
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:46,800
I’m the supreme
Empress Dowager of Mu’an.

704
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:49,760
How can I be humiliated by you?

705
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,760
Someone.

706
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,320
Yes.

707
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,120
Take her away.

708
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:26,760
Yes.

709
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,280
Let’s go.

710
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,400
(Buddha’s Grace Illuminates as Sunshine)

711
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:40,719
Kill them! Kill!

712
00:47:51,879 --> 00:47:55,399
Kill! Kill them all!

713
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,360
Your Grace.

714
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,600
The soldiers of Yongqing
must have been here.

715
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,000
Go to the Empress Dowager’s
sleeping chamber.

716
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,080
Your Grace, we’ve looked
all over the chamber,

717
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,080
without finding the Empress Dowager
and the First Prince.

718
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:34,679
Your Grace,
they’re not in the garden, either.

719
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,280
The Empress Dowager’s Buddha chapel.

720
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:42,520
Go.

721
00:49:54,399 --> 00:49:54,919
Qing An.

722
00:49:55,479 --> 00:49:56,919
Listen to me carefully.

723
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:02,520
When you arrive there,

724
00:50:02,919 --> 00:50:05,840
find a way to give this to Qing Tai.

725
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,080
You must be careful about your safety.

726
00:50:08,479 --> 00:50:09,760
On hearing my whistle,

727
00:50:09,919 --> 00:50:10,959
just come back without

728
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:12,040
any hesitation.

729
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,560
Got it?

730
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:21,639
Go ahead.

731
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:36,600
There.

732
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,040
Su.

733
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,320
How is the Grand Empress Dowager?

734
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,840
What’s going on outside?

735
00:51:07,479 --> 00:51:08,439
Zhennan Gate has been broken through.

736
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,479
Xiong Yipei died for the country.

737
00:51:11,719 --> 00:51:13,080
Although the imperial guards
are resisting the enemy,

738
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,239
it’s only a matter of time
before the inner court is seized.

739
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,320
Your Grace. Young Master.

740
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,600
How’s Longevity Hill?

741
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,800
Our men can’t get out.

742
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,360
We haven’t heard from
Longevity Hill yet.

743
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:26,919
I wish the reinforcements
will arrive as soon as possible.

744
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,000
Lyu.

745
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,719
I’ll protect the Grand Empress Dowager.

746
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:32,520
Take your men to protect His Majesty.

747
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:33,879
Yes.

748
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:35,600
Your Grace. Young Master.

749
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,760
I’ll go with you.

750
00:51:37,479 --> 00:51:38,919
You don’t have to go.

751
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,239
Why don’t you stay here

752
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:41,520
and keep Su accompany?

753
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:44,879
Mother, don’t worry about me.

754
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,919
It concerns the survival of our country.

755
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:49,040
He wants to do his part.

756
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,360
Su, you…

757
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,760
The children have grown up.

758
00:51:52,919 --> 00:51:54,000
Let them make their own decisions.

759
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,800
I’ll be here waiting for you.

760
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:06,760
All right.

761
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,360

Get up, please.

763
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,120
Do you know where
the Empress Dowager has gone?

764
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,320
Your Grace,

765
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,719

died of protecting the First Prince.

767
00:52:41,479 --> 00:52:43,600
The detestable enemies

768
00:52:43,879 --> 00:52:47,919
even took
the Empress Dowager’s body away.

769
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,040
Xi,

770
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,679
