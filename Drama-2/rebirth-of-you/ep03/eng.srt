Baoning.

00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,360
Qingke, Wendie, give us some space.

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,590
(Warm Breeze and Pleasant View)
Baoning and I need to talk.

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
(Warm Breeze and Pleasant View)
Yes, my lady.

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,110
Why are you in disguise, Baoning?

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,240
Where were you?

34
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,360
Something fun was going on outside,

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,750
so I sneaked out.

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,000
You’d always let me know.

37
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,880
Why not this time?

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,030
And you’ve been sneaky lately.

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,080
What exactly did you do?

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,360
Nothing special.

41
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,030
Baoning,

42
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,670
since we first met at eight,

43
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,160
we’ve been like sisters.

44
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,440
I know you all too well.

45
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,750
You can’t fool me.

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,880
Fine, just keep it to yourself.

47
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,800
I won’t come here

48
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,240
and be a bother again.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,960
Wait.

50
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,880
It’s better that you’re out of the loop.

51
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,160
If you still think of me as your sister,

52
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,470
then tell me

53
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,160
what you’re working on.

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,600
I can be of help,

55
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,630
you know?

56
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,260
(Funing Hall Prescription Record)

57
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,750
Funing Hall Prescription Record?

58
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,240
Where did you get it?

59
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,880
I sneaked into the Imperial Hospital
and made a copy.

60
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,360
(Eunuch Chazhan)
Zhao Yi said

61
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,520
(Maid Xiao Rongniang)
Fang Yiru, a maid at the Funing Hall died,

62
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,320
but I swear I saw her alive

63
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,880
outside the palace just a few days ago.

64
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,910
That didn’t make sense,

65
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,030
so I visited the Imperial Hospital
to dig out her prescription

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,030
but found nothing

67
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,720
except that...

68
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,360
Xiao Rongniang’s record.

69
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,240
She got the finest
abortion prevention medicine.

70
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
Abortion prevention medicine?

71
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,880
I was wondering

72
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,720
who that medicine was really for.

73
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,160
When I saw Xiao Rongniang,

74
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,600
she showed no sign of pregnancy.

75
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,080
And she left the palace six months ago.

76
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,110
All that could only mean one thing,

77
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,600
that is, His Majesty asked Fang Yiru

78
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,630
to pretend to be her
to get that medicine.

79
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,550
And then

80
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,830
he faked Fang Yiru’s death

81
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,360
to get her out secretly for the baby.

82
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,270
But

83
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,910
I wouldn’t know that for sure
until I saw her.

84
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,520
Baoning,

85
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,030
even if His Majesty
manages to keep this baby,

86
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,510
Empress Dowager Cao’s attitude aside,

87
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,920
Court of the Imperial Clan
would never put

88
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,270
a mysterious baby’s name
in the royal genealogy

89
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,480
for the sake of the imperial bloodline.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,760
Even when you become the Empress,

91
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,390
that child

92
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,950
won’t pose a threat to you.

93
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,670
I’m not marrying Zhao Yi!

94
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,790
You two are childhood sweethearts.

95
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,440
The court and the harem

96
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,350
have both agreed that you,
the lineal daughter of the Jiang’s,

97
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,830
are the best candidate for the position.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,200
We grew up together.

99
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,390
That’s why I cannot marry him.

100
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,350
He gave me all these things

101
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,510
whether I liked them or not.

102
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,350
I feel I’m already imprisoned

103
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,110
before anything happens.

104
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,830
And the marriage

105
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,670
will only make things worse.

106
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,200
But Grand Empress Dowager

107
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,270
has always been
in favor of this marriage.

108
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,440
Grandmother believed Zhao Yi

109
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,720
truly loved me.

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,920
But if she found out

111
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,920
he already had a love child with a maid,

112
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,510
she’d never marry me to him.

113
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,040
Baoning,

114
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,390
I couldn’t do much about my life,

115
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,040
but

116
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,350
I’ll do anything in my power

117
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
to ensure your happiness.

118
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,550
Listen, you have to burn

119
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,830
this copy

120
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,350
in case it falls into the wrong hands.

121
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,640
Keep everything in your mind.

122
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,720
I will.

123
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,440
Check over there.

124
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,040
Yes.

125
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,000
Have you seen

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,270
an opal bead about this big?

127
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,670
Sorry, Young Master.

128
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,950
I don’t recall seeing one.

129
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,950
Is everything alright?

130
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,880
Mr. Zhang!

131
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,270
I’m surprised to see you in the palace.

132
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,600
Mr. Zhao,

133
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,110
I meant to ask you that.

134
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,760
My father is Marquis Jinghai,
Commandant of Nanmin.

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,390
I was invited to attend
Empress Dowager’s birthday celebration.

136
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,670
Just now, when I was about to
pay respects to Her Highness,

137
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,000
an opal bead of mine went missing.

138
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,550
So, Mr. Zhang,

139
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,270
you must be a palace guard.

140
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,390
Long story.

141
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,640
I’m Commandant of Bingzhou,
Li Changqing’s son,

142
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,440
Li Qian.

143
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,670
“Zhang Qian” was my pseudonym

144
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,390
for the Machinist Contest

145
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,720
to avoid identity controversy.

146
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,390
Later, when I went at my father’s order

147
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,880
to offer Empress Dowager
birthday congratulations,

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,440
Her Highness was kind enough

149
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,040
to appoint me third-level armed guard.

150
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,350
So your real name is Li Qian.

151
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,790
How about we catch up over drinks

152
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,760
when you’re off-duty later?

153
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,760
The second house on Sanli Lane

154
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,200
is my residence in the capital.

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,670
We have to take a rain check,

156
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,950
but my door is always open to you.

157
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,320
I’ll treat you to good food and drinks.

158
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,160
Deal.

159
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,670
I’ll visit you some other day.

160
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,790
Please excuse me.

161
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,830
Am I having more gray hair?

162
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,270
I’m not getting any younger, am I?

163
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,920
You’re always young, Your Highness.

164
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,760
It’s just that you’re burdened

165
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,160
with state affairs.

166
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,000
Lately, court officials

167
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,480
keep chanting that the flood in Zhejiang

168
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,670
and the drought in Sichuan

169
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,830
are heaven’s alerts

170
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,950
because the Emperor

171
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,670
has yet to take over the reins of power
or have any successors.

172
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,600
It’s time for him
to take responsibility for the state.

173
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,950
Aren’t they blatantly

174
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,550
asking me to hand over the throne?

175
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,270
Your Highness,

176
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,070
she’s here.

177
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,440
I, Song Xianyi,
pay respects to you, Your Highness.

178
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,160
Are you aware

179
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,790
why you’re summoned here?

180
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,000
I am, Your Highness.

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,400
I’m too weak and humble

182
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
to give birth to His Majesty’s children,

183
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,030
but you’re kind enough to keep me.

184
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,030
I’ll attend to His Majesty’s every need.

185
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,790
We see

186
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,840
tons of smart or pretty girls

187
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,400
come and go in here,

188
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,640
but those who know the limits

189
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,080
are very few.

190
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,590
I swear my loyalty to you,
Your Highness.

191
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,960
Min Zhou,

192
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,760
take her to the Funing Hall.

193
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,470
Yes, Your Highness.

194
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,320
Where did it go?

195
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,760
Look here.

196
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,880
Yes.

197
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,030
What are you looking for?

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,150
Young Master Zhao?

199
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,590
What are you doing here?

200
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,280
I should ask you that.

201
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,000
Wait.

202
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,470
You don’t

203
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,230
look like a maid.

204
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,110
You’re sharp.

205
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,520
The truth is

206
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,150
I’m Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

207
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,960
I sneaked out

208
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,550
for the Machinist Contest

209
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,280
and couldn’t risk exposing my identity.

210
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,590
I knew something was off about you

211
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,400
but I never expected

212
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,760
to run into Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

213
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,470
Don’t. Please rise.

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,590
So,

215
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,550
what are you looking for?

216
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,590
I lost the opal bead on my jade pendant.

217
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,200
The bead itself isn’t too valuable,

218
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,710
but it belonged to my late mother.

219
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,790
What does your bead look like?

220
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,280
It’s shiny and dazzling.

221
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,550
A dazzling bead?

222
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,080
I...

223
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,790
think I know where it is.

224
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,760
Follow me.

225
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,030
Let’s go.

226
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,440
Young Master Zhao, carry me up.

227
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,080
Are you sure? It’s too high.

228
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,230
Come on! Hurry!

229
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,670
But how did my bead

230
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,350
end up in a crow’s nest?

231
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,880
Be careful.

232
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,080
Careful, Your Grace.

233
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,200
Slowly.

234
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,880
Be careful.

235
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,200
Is it up there?

236
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,440
Young Master.

237
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,790
Are you alright, Your Grace?

238
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,320
I’m fine.

239
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,760
Young Master Zhao.

240
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,790
Li Qian,

241
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,790
thank you for your timely help.

242
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,280
Look at us.

243
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,440
We first met each other

244
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,200
at the Machinist Contest

245
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,960
and here we are in the palace.

246
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,230
What a small world!

247
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,280
Is this your bead?

248
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,000
You really found it!

249
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,840
That crow loves shiny objects.

250
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,230
It once snatched away

251
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,350
Bai Su’s earrings,

252
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,550
and must’ve done the same

253
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,670
to your bead.

254
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,520
Thank you so much, Your Grace.

255
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,880
You’re welcome.

256
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,590
You also helped me a lot out there.

257
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,640
Your Grace!

258
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,790
Your Grace.

259
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,550
There you are.

260
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,760
His Majesty is in the Shoukang Palace.

261
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,000
Grand Empress Dowager asks to see you.

262
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,150
I see.

263
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,960
I should go.

264
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,150
Your Grace,

265
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,080
am I going to see you again?

266
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,030
Whenever you’re in the palace,

267
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,880
come to Three Abodes of the East
in the Shoukang Palace.

268
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,760
I will.

269
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,520
Put the nest back.

270
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,400
Yes, Your Grace.

271
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,670
Who’d know

272
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,030
Miss Jiang

273
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,590
would turn out to be a princess?

274
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,200
I know. Me neither.

275
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,280
She’s fun

276
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,320
regardless of her identity.

277
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,880
- Grandmother.
- I promise.

278
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,790
Baoning! Sit with us.

279
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,760
I’m exhausted.

280
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,880
Is she your new maid, Grandmother?

281
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,910
No.

282
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,670
Empress Dowager assigned her
to the Funing Hall.

283
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,350
Song Xianyi, wait outside.

284
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,230
You aren’t needed here.

285
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

286
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,880
What is Empress Dowager up to?

287
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,590
Mother stuffed that woman

288
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,030
into my hall as a lady-in-waiting,

289
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,080
but Baoning is the only girl I love.

290
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,880
As for that maid,

291
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,110
she can stay and clean the yard.

292
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,320
I know you’re loyal to Baoning, Yi.

293
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,280
Your mother handpicked

294
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,470
that girl for you.

295
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,590
You should go and thank her.

296
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,320
Did you check on her

297
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,400
after that attempted assassination?

298
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,710
I did.

299
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,760
The assassin was killed on the spot

300
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,230
and Mother remained safe.

301
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,760
Baoning,

302
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,350
they’ve sent me some Luban Locks.

303
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,640
Would you like to take a look?

304
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,590
Not interested.

305
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,200
Aren’t those locks your favorites?

306
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,080
Grand Mentor Xiong has given me
too much homework.

307
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,710
I have no time.

308
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,080
She’s still a child.

309
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,350
Commandery Princess Jia’nan!

310
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,910
Your Grace,

311
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,280
I wonder if you could do me a favor.

312
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,670
Like what?

313
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,910
I borrowed a peacock feather
gold thread cape

314
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,230
from someone

315
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,910
but tore it by accident.

316
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,710
I’m thinking

317
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,550
maybe you know of
some embroidery shop in town

318
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,350
where it can be fixed.

319
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,520
How could we have knowledge

320
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,790
of such a place outside the palace?

321
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,470
Tailoring Service

322
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,200
is to mend all our outfits.

323
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,710
I’m afraid we don’t...

324
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,790
I know one.

325
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,640
Do you have the cape with you?

326
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
I didn’t bring it

327
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,840
because I’m on duty today.

328
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,790
Alright.

329
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,880
Get it ready

330
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,790
tomorrow at 2:00 PM.

331
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,110
I’ll have my stewardess

332
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,440
pick it up from you.

333
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,880
Thank you, Your Grace.

334
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,150
I’ll be waiting for her tomorrow

335
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,030
at Qingshi Lane.

336
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,470
Baoning!

337
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,910
Greetings, Your Majesty.

338
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,080
Rise.

339
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,710
Thank you, Your Majesty.

340
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,230
Are you new?

341
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,760
I don’t remember seeing you before.

342
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,760
Your Majesty,

343
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,790
I’m Li Qian,

344
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,470
the son of Commandant of Bingzhou.

345
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,200
Empress Dowager recently promoted me

346
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,840
to third-level armed Imperial Guard.

347
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,790
Baoning, do you know him?

348
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,590
How could I cross paths
with a humble guard?

349
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,670
He’s a new face,

350
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,960
so I stopped and asked him.

351
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,230
Turns out, he was the one
who saved Empress Dowager.

352
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,200
Your Majesty, Your Grace,

353
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,670
I have to continue the patrol.

354
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,880
Good day.

355
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,230
Baoning,

356
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,350
they’ve set the table
at the Imperial Garden.

357
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,080
Would you care to dine with me?

358
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,400
Here we go.

359
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:31,760
Your Majesty,

360
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,880
it’s a lovely day.

361
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,960
Do you mind if I join you two?

362
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:48,740
(Efficient and Harmonious)

363
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,200
Your Grace.

364
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,880
I was expecting to see your stewardess.

365
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,110
What brings you here?

366
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,400
You knew I’d come.

367
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,640
Let’s go.

368
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,350
Is it funny?

369
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,680
You figured I’d be here

370
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,760
but you didn’t even bring a stool.

371
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,400
Get on it.

372
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,000
You saw it through

373
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
that mending my cape was only an excuse.

374
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,230
Why did you still come?

375
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,400
Weren’t you afraid it’d be a trap?

376
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,830
You had leverage on me

377
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,190
but kept it to yourself

378
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,590
and came straight to me.

379
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,000
Clearly, you want something from me.

380
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,070
Why should I be afraid?

381
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,880
You’re indeed insightful.

382
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,400
So, what do you want?

383
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,920
I want The Book of Supreme Weapons.

384
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,880
Too bad,

385
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,400
that one

386
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,920
from the Machinist Contest is fake.

387
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,000
But if anyone
had access to the real copy,

388
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,640
that’d be me.

389
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,920
Do you mean it’s in the palace?

390
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,950
Let’s cut a deal.

391
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,880
I have a task for you.

392
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,950
Get it done

393
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,000
and the real book is yours.

394
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,070
Sounds fair.

395
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,280
What’s the task?

396
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,160
Find a person for me,

397
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,280
a former maid at the Funing Hall,

398
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,470
Fang Yiru.

399
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,590
I need to know if she’s alive.

400
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,110
If she is,

401
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,950
give me her whereabouts.

402
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,040
I’ll have my people get into it

403
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,280
and let you know

404
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,760
if anything turns up.

405
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,980
(East Warmth Chamber)

406
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,950
The reigning Emperor

407
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,400
is obsessed with Baoning.

408
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
His two predecessors
were also loyal to their love.

409
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,920
They’re a rarity!

410
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,000
I’ll take that.

411
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,230
I won!

412
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,160
She’s in luck

413
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,920
and on a winning streak.

414
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,400
Good.

415
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,110
Stewardess Meng,

416
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,710
that’s yours.

417
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,800
Greetings, Your Highness.

418
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,430
Baoning,

419
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,830
what did you bring us this time?

420
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,590
It’s a hand-cranking fan I made.

421
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,880
Do you have the ice cubes?

422
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,110
Yes, Your Grace.

423
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,110
I’ll put them in.

424
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,190
You’re into such machines

425
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,920
just like the late emperor.

426
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,000
Grandmother,

427
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,040
I heard he had

428
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,230
The Book of Supreme Weapons.
Do you know anything about it?

429
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,310
The Book of...

430
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,230
Yes, I remember it.

431
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,640
Back then, Empress Dowager Cao

432
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,190
learned that he wanted that book

433
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,950
and managed to get it for him.

434
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,070
As a result, she won his heart over

435
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,190
and secured her position in the harem.

436
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,280
I see.

437
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,430
Let’s play.

438
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,590
Your turn. Come on.

439
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,360
(Efficient and Harmonious)
Take a look!

440
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,460
Fresh flowers!

441
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,580
Flowers!

442
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,560
Cheap and fresh!

443
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,400
Bai Su.

444
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,920
(Bai Su’s Mother)
You grew up with Princess in the palace

445
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,040
and you’ve turned 18 this year.

446
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,710
It’s time for you to get married.

447
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,000
Marquis Jin’an’s son, Cai Yuan,

448
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,880
is a nice and well-educated young man.

449
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,190
Would you like

450
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,640
your father to set you two up?

451
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,560
I’m asking you.

452
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,280
Why bother?

453
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,520
My marriage

454
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,950
is up to you anyway.

455
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,760
Take it slow.

456
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,350
You don’t act like a princess at all.

457
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,470
Are you sure she’s there?

458
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,070
Locating a maid

459
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,800
is child’s play.

460
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,070
Use this.

461
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,710
I meant to give you my handkerchief,

462
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,310
but that’d be too intimate.

463
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,590
Sir.

464
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,560
She’s one of us.

465
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,110
Have a seat.

466
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,070
Sir, Miss,

467
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,280
the one in that house

468
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,190
is good-looking

469
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,190
and she’s showing,

470
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,070
probably in her second trimester.

471
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,520
She’s showing already?

472
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,110
Is she there alone?

473
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,190
She’s with two maids

474
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,680
and four guards.

475
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,760
The four of them

476
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,400
are watching the walls
and the yard all day

477
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,110
in case of any infiltration.

478
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,280
I have to see for myself.

479
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,680
What’s inside?

480
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,400
I bet this place is Fang Yiru’s hideout.

481
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,430
I’m going in!

482
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,040
Why did you stop me?

483
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,400
Your Grace,

484
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,640
a maid from the Funing Hall

485
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,350
is pregnant

486
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,430
and staying in a guarded residence.

487
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,950
What’s the explanation for that?

488
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,070
You’ve connected the dots?

489
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,070
His Majesty is
having a secret love child.

490
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,400
Why are you sticking your nose into it?

491
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,710
He and I are childhood sweethearts.

492
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,280
He promised he’d only love me forever.

493
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,880
Besides, Grandmother already

494
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,640
betrothed me to him a few days ago.

495
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,590
All we need is Empress Dowager’s edict
to make it official.

496
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,520
But now,

497
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,310
a maid could be bearing his child.

498
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,520
I wouldn’t believe that

499
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,520
until I see it with my own eyes.

500
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:47,880
But we’re dealing with

501
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,920
a highly sensitive matter

502
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,880
involving His Majesty.

503
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,400
If I help you,

504
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,470
our whole family might be at risk.

505
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,520
You’re worrying too much!

506
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,280
I am the Empress-to-be, remember?

507
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,880
That woman is merely a humble maid.

508
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,230
Should anything happen,
I would take full responsibility.

509
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,680
Come on! Don’t you want that book?

510
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,190
Your wish is my command.

511
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,710
So, do you have any ideas to get me in?

512
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,230
That place is guarded.

513
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,190
We need a thorough plan

514
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,280
to get inside.

515
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,470
We can say she’s having an affair

516
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,680
and drag her out.

517
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,160
There’re only a handful of people there.

518
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,190
They won’t be too big a problem

519
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,230
except for those guards.

520
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,160
They must be so highly skilled

521
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,470
that His Majesty entrusts
that maid to them.

522
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,950
Your plan

523
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,520
would only spook them

524
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,920
and escalate the situation.

525
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,680
We can set the place on fire.

526
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,760
We can’t do that!

527
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,520
If the fire started to spread,

528
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,680
Offices of the Five Wards

529
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,350
would all arrive immediately.

530
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,430
I think I got something...

531
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,950
What are you doing?

532
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,040
Fire!

533
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:21,800
Fire!

534
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,830
- Let’s go!
- Fire!

535
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,880
Fire!

536
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,710
Fire! It’s on fire!

537
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,000
Fire!

538
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,190
- Go, go, go!
- Put out the fire!

539
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,590
Put it out!

540
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,710
Hurry!

541
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,000
Go, go, go!

542
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,040
That’s Fang Yiru.

543
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,430
Get water here! Now!

544
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,920
Come here! Over here!

545
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,880
- Yes!
- More water! Come on!

546
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,880
Got it.

547
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,470
If it comes to Grandmother’s ears

548
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,000
that Zhao Yi has a secret child,

549
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,430
she’ll definitely cancel our marriage.

550
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,800
But I can’t simply

551
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
lay the facts in front of her.

552
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,560
Your Grace.

553
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,310
Your Grace!

554
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,800
Don’t you think

555
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,280
that’s a reckless move?

556
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,920
- Come on!
- Coming!

557
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,070
It’s working, isn’t it?

558
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,560
You said it yourself

559
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,590
that place is guarded

560
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,590
by trained soldiers.

561
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,560
They’d fight the fire right away.

562
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,000
It’s a small yard.

563
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,680
No one will get hurt.

564
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
She’s really something.

565
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,070
She’s special.

566
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,680
We’ve arrived, sir.

567
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,520
Your Grace...

568
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,040
Thanks for everything.

569
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,160
Are you leaving already?

570
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,760
Oh, that book, right?

571
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,400
I’ll give it to you.

572
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,560
You have my word.

573
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,350
Grandmother told me

574
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,470
Empress Dowager
had given it to the late emperor.

575
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,920
She must’ve taken it back

576
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,040
after his death.

577
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,430
It won’t be easy to track it down

578
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,430
but I’ll find a way

579
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,160
to get to her

580
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,110
to obtain that book for you.

581
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,190
Thank you, Your Grace.

582
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,230
Don’t mention it.

583
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,110
You’re right, Grandmother.

584
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,760
Grandmother!

585
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,310
Baoning.

586
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,280
What’s the rush, Grandmother?

587
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,110
There’s good news of course.

588
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,680
You’ll find out in a minute.

589
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,710
My respects, Mother.

590
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,040
Have a seat.

591
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,190
Thank you, Mother.

592
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,560
My respects, Your Highness.

593
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,400
Greetings, Mother.

594
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,070
I’m here

595
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,230
to discuss Yi’s marriage with you.

596
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
I understand.

597
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,160
Mother,

598
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,710
the Emperor still hasn’t recovered

599
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,800
from the previous drowning accident.

600
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,470
I thought we should wait

601
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,830
until he made a full recovery.

602
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,680
Also, I’m too busy with state affairs

603
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,000
to spare time for his marriage.

604
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,430
In that case,

605
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,800
I’ll make the decision

606
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,560
for you

607
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,190
by marrying Baoning to Yi.

608
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,640
Mother,

609
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,800
the Emperor’s marriage

610
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,680
concerns the entire state.

611
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,160
We better not

612
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,830
make a hasty decision.

613
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,920
Thorough consideration is preferred.

614
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,560
He’s old enough to marry.

615
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,920
Actually, his marriage

616
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,190
is long overdue.

617
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,470
By postponing it again,

618
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,350
the public might speculate

619
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,400
if you have ulterior motives.

620
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,430
I wouldn’t dare, Mother.

621
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,470
You’re mistaking it.

622
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,000
Baoning is perfect for Yi

623
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,590
and Yi loves her dearly.

624
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,310
They make a wonderful couple.

625
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,160
I certainly

626
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,830
have no objections to their marriage.

627
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,000
Meanwhile,

628
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,680
my birthday is coming in ten days.

629
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:32,560
We can get into the details after that.

630
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,950
Enough is enough.

631
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,590
How much longer should we wait?

632
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,470
Mother,

633
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,430
Baoning’s birthday is in three days.

634
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,950
Can we announce the betrothal edict then

635
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,310
and make good things come in pairs?

636
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,920
Mother,

637
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,920
isn’t it correct

638
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,830
that Princess Yong’an died the same day?

639
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,070
Wouldn’t the announcement
be disrespectful to her?

640
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,680
Yong’an is Baoning’s mother.

641
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,880
She’d want

642
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,190
nothing more

643
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,950
than a good husband for her daughter.

644
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,800
You’re right, Mother.

645
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,520
Your Grace,

646
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,000
it’s going to rain for a while.

647
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,470
Let me go back to fetch the umbrella

648
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,400
for you.

649
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,760
Alright.

650
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,880
As much as we’re engaged,

651
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,640
the wedding can wait.

652
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,880
But Zhao Yi insists on rushing it.

653
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,880
Now that Empress Dowager
has signed off on it,

654
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,230
what else could I do?

655
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,950
You almost scared me to death!

656
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,800
I could punish you for that.

657
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,470
Why are you here alone, Your Grace?

658
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,880
Can’t I?

659
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,190
It’s safe.

660
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,310
If so,

661
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,470
why did you add enchanting incense

662
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,160
to this perfume ball?

663
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,520
That’s for bad men outside.

664
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,830
Give it back.

665
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,190
Try and grab it.

666
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,880
You haven’t changed a bit.

667
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,000
You even put on
the flexible chain and the thorn.

668
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,520
Now, it looks like

669
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,040
a real weapon, don’t you think?

670
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,280
Baoning.

671
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,920
Your maids are here, Your Grace.

672
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,310
I should go.

673
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,040
Good night.

674
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,950
Baoning.

675
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,520
Good evening, Bai Su.

676
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,900
(Gao Miaorong)

677
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,700
(Li’s Mansion)

678
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,400
You’re back, Qian!

679
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,000
Miaorong!

680
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,710
What are you doing in the capital?

681
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,110
I was waiting for you in Bingzhou,

682
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,190
and then I heard
you saved Empress Dowager Cao

683
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,110
and you were given
a post in the capital,

684
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,800
so I asked for your father’s approval

685
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,880
to come here.

686
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,620
(Learning to be Good is Difficult)

687
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,710
Sir, Miss Gao.

688
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,110
Every room in the mansion

689
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,470
has been scented by mugworts

690
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,920
as you asked.

691
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,430
Good. Thank you.

692
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,310
Qian,

693
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,160
the mansion remains in good condition,

694
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,110
but it was empty for too long

695
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,760
and it smelled damp.

696
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,160
I had them

697
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,110
use mugworts to dry the rooms.

698
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,560
I figured

699
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,920
busy men like you two

700
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,430
wouldn’t have time for chores.

701
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,040
That’s so thoughtful of you.

702
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,120
Thank you.

703
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,390
No problem.

704
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,080
By the way,

705
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,470
I also made lotus seed soup.

706
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,230
You should have some.

707
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,800
It’s good for your health.

708
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,360
Sir,

709
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,150
Miss Gao is sweet and caring.

710
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,520
Miaorong is like my sister.

711
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,870
We grew up together

712
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,470
and we’re closer than others.

713
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,710
Let’s go.

714
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,950
Greetings, Your Highness.

715
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,520
Tongxin pays respects to you,
Your Highness.

716
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,320
Rise.

717
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,500
(District Princess Qingyi Han Tongxin)

718
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,470
Thank you, Your Highness.

719
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,000
Do you like the palace, Tongxin?

720
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,320
I do.

721
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,360
I love

722
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,950
everything in here.

723
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,870
Would you like to move in

724
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,670
to keep the Emperor

725
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,600
and me company?

726
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,190
Tongxin,

727
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,950
Lord Jian and I need to talk.

728
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,280
Why don’t you

729
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,280
go and pay respects to the Emperor?

730
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,910
Yes, Your Highness.

731
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,630
Your Highness.

732
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,470
Commandery Princess Jia’nan
being the Empress

733
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,670
is already a done deal,

734
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,320
which will bring the Jiang’s

735
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,080
and the Emperor even closer.

736
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,280
Then you’ll have to
hand over the throne.

737
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,670
Under this circumstance,

738
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,710
I need to plant someone

739
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,280
close to the Emperor.

740
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,950
Your Highness, are you saying...?

741
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,560
I watched
District Princess Qingyi grow up

742
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,630
and she’s your granddaughter.

743
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:18,150
If I appoint her Noble Consort,

744
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,470
Grand Empress Dowager

745
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,710
will have to accept her.

746
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,280
I appreciate your kind offer,
Your Highness,

747
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,390
but Tongxin

748
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,040
is naughty and unruly

749
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,520
with little discipline at home.

750
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,230
A consort is way above her level.

751
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,670
She might not be
the right person for you.

752
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,120
You’re being too modest, Lord Jian.

753
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,670
She’s good enough.

754
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,840
Besides,

755
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,390
I wouldn’t have been able to

756
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,800
rule the state

757
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,950
without your support, right?

758
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,470
And the marriage alliance

759
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,000
will further strengthen our bond.

760
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,870
Your Highness, it’s...

761
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,630
Why?

762
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,630
You don’t like the idea of it?

763
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,740
(Qinzheng Hall)

764
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,520
Your Majesty,

765
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,560
in order to have more

766
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,710
cultivable land in our state,

767
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,670
we’ve been building irrigation works

768
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,360
and opening up wasteland vigorously,

769
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,710
including terraced fields,
wetland, sand and farmland.

770
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,000
Up to now,

771
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,630
our arable land has reached

772
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,430
over 3,125,200 hectares in total.

773
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,040
Is this the right way
to Cousin Yi’s Qinzheng Hall?

774
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,600
I’ve asked around.

775
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,670
It’s right ahead.

776
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,360
Double-check now

777
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,000
and see if I look alright.

778
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:50,080
You look perfect, my lady.

779
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,080
I’m sure His Majesty will like you.

780
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,080
Let’s go.

781
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,670
Isn’t that District Princess Qingyi?

782
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,840
Are they going to see His Majesty, too?

783
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,520
They’ve never come before.

784
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,360
Whatever.

785
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,860
(Qinzheng Hall)

786
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:12,760
Tell His Majesty

787
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,870
that I’m here to see him.

788
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,430
And you’re...?

789
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,000
I’m District Princess Qingyi,

790
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Lord Jian’s granddaughter

791
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,120
and His Majesty’s cousin.

792
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,190
My lady,

793
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,190
I’m afraid His Majesty is occupied.

794
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,390
Now isn’t a good time.

795
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,760
Empress Dowager
is handling state affairs.

796
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,910
What’s left for His Majesty to work on?

797
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,000
My lady,

798
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,320
you cannot

799
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,040
barge into His Majesty’s office.

800
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,670
Don’t lecture me, you lowlife eunuch!

801
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,950
My lady,

802
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,950
His Majesty is too busy

803
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,360
to be disturbed.

804
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,560
I came all the way into the palace.

805
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,390
I demand to see him

806
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,710
one way or another!

807
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
You can’t go in, my lady!

808
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,320
Bad cricket!

809
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,630
Why isn’t he listening to you?

810
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,280
Greetings, Your Majesty.

811
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,470
Is this what he’s busy with?

812
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,630
Cricket fighting?

813
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,120
Like that’s important.

814
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,320
Du Sheng,

815
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,630
I said

816
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,150
not to send anyone in, no?

817
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,080
I’m sorry. I...

818
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,080
Your Majesty,

819
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,080
I’m Tongxin. Do you remember me?

820
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,560
I first met you

821
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,950
at the Imperial Hunting Ground at 10.

822
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,670
Yes, I guess.

823
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,710
Your Majesty,

824
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,040
Empress Dowager summoned
me and my grandfather to the palace.

825
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,000
While they’re discussing state affairs,

826
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,040
I’m here to pay respects to you.

827
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,000
You...

828
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,710
Your Majesty,

829
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,320
she’s Lord Jian’s granddaughter,

830
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,630
District Princess Qingyi.

831
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,230
Baoning.

832
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,230
What brings you here?

833
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,040
Grandmother said
you’re still having a cold

834
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,040
and asked her kitchen

835
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,190
to make ginseng chicken soup.

836
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,430
It’ll make you sweat and feel better.

837
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,710
You’re into cricket fighting,
Your Majesty.

838
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,840
Who’s he?

839
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,840
A cricket fighting master

840
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,040
(Agriculture in Mu’an)
I hired from the outside.

841
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,120
Is there a problem?

842
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,280
This book is for administration.

843
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,840
Why is it in Zhao Yi’s place?

844
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,950
Hey, you, show me how to play it.

845
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,950
My lady,

846
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,150
please don’t poke the cricket.

847
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,190
That girl is Lord Jian’s granddaughter,

848
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,080
so she’s on Empress Dowager’s side.

849
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,600
She can’t see this book.

850
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,630
That girl is
as annoying as she could get.

851
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,390
A prank would be fun.

852
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,320
You’re doing good.

853
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,670
District Princess Qingyi,

854
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,630
is that a cricket

855
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,560
