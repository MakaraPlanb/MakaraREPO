27
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,119
What now?

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,279
Are you here to rub it in?

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,639
Compared with
Xuanjia Battalion’s heavy losses,

30
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:22,960
your broken rib is nothing.

31
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:25,240
They were lenient enough with you.

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,199
And no, I’m not here to rub it in,

33
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,559
but you need to know as a commander,

34
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,800
your men’s lives are in your hands.

35
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,399
Any decision you make

36
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,399
affects tens of thousands of them.

37
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,360
Don’t lecture me.

38
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,320
Xuanjia Battalion got hit the hardest.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,399
They should’ve
had their supplies first,

40
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,759
but they don’t even
have a winter coat yet.

41
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,440
How did that happen?

42
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,679
Are you asking me as Quartermaster?

43
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,119
I’ll see to it.

44
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:55,559
It’s none of your business.

45
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,639
Fine.

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,160
If you know what to do,

47
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:01,880
I’ll leave you alone.

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,440
Take care, Young Master Zhao.

49
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,399
We’re leaving.

50
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,360
How’s Her Grace’s arm?

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,039
Zhao Xiao,
this is my last and final warning.

52
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,559
Baoning is my wife.

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,679
Stay away from her.

54
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,080
I meant to remind you

55
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,039
that don’t leave her behind

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,479
or let her get hurt again.

57
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,479
Alright, alright.

58
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,000
We’re all friends

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,360
and we’ll see each other a lot.

60
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,600
No need to get hostile.

61
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,759
Li Qian, he’s still injured.

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,559
Just be nice.

63
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:31,919
Come on. Let’s go back.

64
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,839
Come. Just go.

65
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,639
Heavens! Young Master!

66
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,600
Your wound is still fresh.

67
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,960
You shouldn’t have come here.

68
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,000
Whatever you need,

69
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,440
just give me a shout

70
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,880
and I’ll be there.

71
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,320
Don’t sweet-talk me, Cai Shuang.

72
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:58,960
Let me ask you something.

73
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,360
Why hasn’t Xuanjia Battalion
received their supplies?

74
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:04,440
Young Master,

75
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,919
they’re drastically downsized,

76
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,000
thus being moved
to the bottom of the list.

77
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,399
Besides, what we have is limited.

78
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,800
There may or may not be

79
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,360
anything left

80
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,279
when it’s their turn.

81
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,959
The army is granted

82
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,359
300,000 tales of silver every year.

83
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,279
Is that much money

84
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,600
not enough to buy winter coats?

85
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,839
You’ve mistaken, Young Master!

86
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,640
It’s not my fault.

87
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:32,559
Look,

88
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,440
if we could get half

89
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,279
(Military Expenditure Account Book)
of that funding,

90
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,839
that’d be a good year.

91
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,519
You took away almost everything we had

92
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,399
for the last battle.

93
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,359
It’s not that I’m not doing my job,

94
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,720
but I don’t have any money or supplies.

95
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,119
All that...

96
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,399
All that is my fault!

97
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,399
300,000 tales!

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,640
Where could I get that much money?

99
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,040
Young Master!

100
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,119
I’m back.

101
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,000
What happened to you, Young Master?

102
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,920
Had a little accident. Nothing serious.

103
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,799
What...? What are these?

104
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,480
Marquis had me bring them to you.

105
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,040
He said

106
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,720
your rash attack

107
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,839
cost us tons of grains and supplies.

108
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,440
Without timely replenishment,

109
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,480
things could get worse.

110
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,799
Silver here

111
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,399
is to help you cover the losses.

112
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,320
Father!

113
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:55,519
Also,

114
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,440
other than all that silver,

115
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
provisions should we here soon.

116
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:00,399
I’ll go outside to wait for them.

117
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,799
Thanks to this money,

118
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:21,519
our men can survive this winter.

119
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,359
Young Master,

120
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,920
as much as it seems,

121
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,640
it’s only of expediency.

122
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,359
Even if we pull through this winter,

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,959
what about next spring?

124
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,760
One step at a time.

125
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,720
I have an idea

126
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,640
to earn more with what we have.

127
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,640
Then we’ll have enough to support us

128
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,519
through this winter and even next year.

129
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,880
What is it?

130
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,279
Tell me about it.

131
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:00,399
That’s it.

132
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,359
Will it work?

133
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,959
Of course.

134
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,959
We’ve been doing that all these years.

135
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,839
Or how did the entire army

136
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,359
live on insufficient funds for so long?

137
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:20,040
I see. I’m entrusting it to you.

138
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,880
If anything goes wrong,

139
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,359
you’ll be held accountable.

140
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,519
You can count on me, Young Master.

141
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,079
I’ll get it done.

142
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:30,750
(Money)

143
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:38,480
Accountant Cai.

144
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,480
What do you have for me this time?

145
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,000
It is

146
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,839
a big deal!

147
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,675
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)

148
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,480
Your husband is back

149
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,320
and he needs you now.

150
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,880
Give me a minute.

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,399
I’ll be with you after it’s done.

152
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:32,599
I need you now!

153
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,000
Do you want this?

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,520
Yes.

155
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,479
Come and get it.

156
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,239
Give it to me.

157
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:39,840
It’s almost done.

158
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,080
- What is this thing?
- Give me that.

159
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:43,239
Let me see.

160
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,100
Give it to me!

161
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,800
No!

162
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,640
Give it back!

163
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,559
Come and grab it!

164
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,479
- It’s mine!
- Let me see!

Your Grace!

166
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,760
Tell me everything about it.

167
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,400
Let me show you a treasure.

168
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,679
See this arrow here?

169
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,679
- Your Grace!
- It’s not like...

170
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,320
Need I remind you
what Grand Empress Dowager said?

171
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:03,280
What leverage

172
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,599
could a maid have?

174
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:14,320
More soup, Miss Gao?

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Give it to me.
I’ll bring it to Commandery Prince.

176
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,799

178

after a long day.

179
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,359
I’d rather not bother him.

180
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,679
Please give him my regards.

181
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,225
I will.

182
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,679
Why is she so nice all of a sudden?

183
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,799
Did she do anything to this soup?

184
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,599
Miss.

186
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,640
What?

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,239
Her Grace and Qian can’t sleep together?

190
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,400
Why?

191
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,599
Don’t get me started.

192
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,840
Apparently,
Grand Empress Dowager said that.

193
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,400
Qian is my only son.

194
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,200
Her Highness

195
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,039
can’t cut off our family line!

196
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:20,239
Uncle Li, calm down. Don’t be mad.

197
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,719
Unfortunately,

198
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,760
Her Grace is too weak.

199
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:25,559
But there’s...

200
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,679
Enough, Miaorong.

201
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,159
My husband and I will talk about it.

202
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
You may leave.

203
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,075
Yes.

204
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,520
What’s going on?

205
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,479
Let’s talk over there. Come.

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,640
Young Master,

207
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,520
may I speak to you in private?

208
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,640
It’s about the supplies.

209
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:05,320
Am I Quartermaster or you are?

210
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,919
Lacking supplies is no joke.

211
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:10,320
You can’t fix it alone.

212
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,320
I guess

213
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,239
we’ve already run out of grains.

214
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,575
Wrong move.

215
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,559
Young Master.

216
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,175
Go under.

217
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,000
We must do something fast.

218
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,280
The last thing we need is a mutiny.

219
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,400
Our family owns farmland in Jinxi

220
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,679
and I’ve gathered the yield this year.

221
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,840
- As long as...
- Li Qian,

222
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,719
do you think you’re so capable

223
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,000
that I can’t do anything

224
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:39,200
without you?

225
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,825
Good! Try again!

226
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,919
Of course not.

227
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,200
I’m doing what’s best for the troops.

228
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:47,760
How admirable that is!

229
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,550
Higher!

230
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,880
Am I dead

231
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,479
that you have to do all the work?

232
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,599
Gathering supplies is my responsibility.

233
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,200
I’ll take care of it.

234
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,159
You can’t risk our men’s life!

235
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,320
I won’t!

236
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:01,400
If you don’t believe me,

237
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,359
I’ll bet my life on it.

238
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:04,559
If the supplies

239
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,359
aren’t in place in a month,

240
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,960
my life is yours.

241
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:11,025
Don’t move.

242
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,275
Good!

243
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,119
Uncle.

244
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,479
Miaorong!

245
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,039
To what do I owe this pleasure?

246
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,799
Uncle,

247
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,359
I should’ve come more often.

248
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,159
It’s been a while
since these books saw the sun, right?

249
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,919
The ancient ones must be kept dry

250
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:36,559
or they’ll fall apart.

251
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,400
You used to be with me all day

252
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,400
and dry my books.

253
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,440
Then when you started to
follow Young Master Qian around,

254
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:45,520
those books were left behind.

255
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,960
Did you make
lotus seed sweet soup for me?

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,320
I miss

257
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,599
your cooking.

258
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,239
Uncle, your early years of service

259
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:03,359
out there under Uncle Li

260
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:06,239
has taken a toll on your health.

261
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,679
Lotus seed

262
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,559
can remove inner heat
and soothe your liver.

263
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,760
I’ll make that soup for you every day.

264
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,679
Thanks. You’re so sweet.

265
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,559
Speaking of which,

266
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,200
Uncle Li’s condition
must be similar to yours.

267
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:25,760
Uncle, do you know his taste?

268
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,640
I’ll bring him some soup, too.

269
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,640
Don’t.

270
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:30,159
Commandant Li

271
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,200
lives on meat and drinks.

272
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,719
Sweet soup

273
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,000
is really not his thing.

274
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:38,760
You can prepare some fine liquor

275
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,000
with herbs instead.

276
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,760
That way, he can drink

277
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,159
and stay healthy.

278
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,359
It’s win-win.

279
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,640
Good idea. I’ll take the books out.

280
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,250
Sure.

281
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,000
(Spring Plowing)

282
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,640
Uncle, you were careless

283
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:55,159
that you misplaced a file in the book.

284
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,350
(Letter of Betrothal:
Li Qian and Miaorong)

285
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,799
Letter of Betrothal
between me and Li Qian?

286
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,840
Oh, that?

287
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,440
That was scrawled when you were little.

288
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,599
One day, when Commandant

289
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,479
and I had too much to drink,

290
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:21,799
he somehow

291
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,359
wrote that.

292
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:26,400
It was long ago and we were both drunk.

293
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:27,960
It doesn’t count.

294
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:28,840
But...

295
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,159
But Uncle Li wrote it himself.

296
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,280
It’s right here. Of course it counts!

297
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,760
Miaorong,

298
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,200
I know how you feel
about Young Master Qian,

299
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,200
but he and Her Grace
have already married.

300
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,760
No way would he divorce her

301
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,840
to marry you, right?

302
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,840
Don’t be too stubborn.

303
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:50,320
No, he doesn’t have to divorce her

304
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,760
in order to marry me.

305
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,239
I can be his second wife.

306
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,159
Miaorong...

307
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,080
Uncle,

308
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
my parents left me when I was little.

309
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:10,119
It was you who raised me.

310
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:13,520
I see you

311
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:17,400
as my father.

312
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,840
If you

313
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:21,880
don’t help me,

314
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:24,119
who else will?

315
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,080
I’ve always loved Qian,

316
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:33,760
but he married Her Grace.

317
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:45,960
Uncle,

318
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,880
I wouldn’t ask for anything

319
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:51,840
if the betrothal didn’t exist,

320
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,320
but it does.

321
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,000
Uncle,

322
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:00,280
please

323
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,119
do me this favor!

324
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,840
I’m begging you!

325
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,640
Uncle!

326
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,479
Miaorong,

327
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,880
I’m not blessed with children

328
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,640
and I regard you

329
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:28,599
as my own daughter.

330
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,280
Fine.

331
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,320
I’ll do everything I can

332
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,960
for you.

333
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,159
Uncle!

334
00:17:00,825 --> 00:17:07,075
(Li’s Mansion)

335
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,319
Darling,

336
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,640
stop reading.

337
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,280
Let’s eat.

338
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,959
We have all your favorite food

339
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,719
and drinks.

340
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,150
Lovely!

341
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,875
Commandment Li.

342
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,839
Fuyu.

343
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,119
Perfect timing.

344
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,079
Come

345
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,040
and drink with me.

346
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,760
Not today, sir.

347
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,040
I’m here for something else.

348
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,319
I wonder

349
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,599
if you remember this.

350
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
What is it?

351
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,079
When did you write that, Darling?

352
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,359
Madam,

353
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,800
he did it when he was drunk.

354
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,760
Maybe he’s forgotten about it.

355
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,839
Your son has gotten married

356
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,560
with none other but a princess.

357
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,640
I should’ve let this betrothal slide,

358
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
but...

359
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,439
Sir,

360
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,839
I’ve been with you for years

361
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,640
without asking you for anything.

362
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,319
I only hope

363
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,359
you can keep your promise

364
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,760
and accept Miaorong
as your son’s second wife.

365
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,760
Fuyu,

366
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:32,000
I know Miaorong’s feelings for Qian,

367
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,839
but he’s already married Her Grace.

368
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,319
Having a second wife

369
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,599
is inappropriate.

370
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,839
How about this?

371
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:45,520
I’ll prepare
a huge amount of dowries for you.

372
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:46,880
If there’s anyone in Bingzhou,

373
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,880
no,

374
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,880
in entire Jinxi

375
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,160
that you like,

376
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,800
I’ll marry you to him.

377
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
How does that sound?

378
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,599
Master,

379
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:03,599
if it’s

380
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,680
really too much to ask,

381
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:11,640
I’ll let go of this betrothal.

382
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,400
- I know she’s understanding.
- Problem solved!

383
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,560
Indeed!

384
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,000
Miaorong is always considerate.

385
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,575
I know.

386
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:24,560
Alright.

387
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,560
Miaorong!

388
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,160
- What are you doing?
- Miaorong!

389
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,239
Put those scissors away!

390
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,760
Miaorong, what were you thinking?

391
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,400
Silly! How could you...?

392
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,560
How could you cut off your hair?

393
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:36,040
Madam,

394
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,839
Master,

395
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,400
if I can’t be Qian’s only wife,

396
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:46,439
I can be his second wife.

397
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:49,239
If I can’t be his second wife,

398
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,800
I can be his concubine.

399
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,280
If that still fails,

400
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,160
I can...

401
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,640
I can be his chamber maid.

402
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,079
Master, Madam,

403
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,640
if you’re marrying me to another man,

404
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,520
I...

405
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,119
I’d rather cut off my hair to be a nun.

406
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:10,839
That’s enough.

407
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,280
Don’t say that.

408
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,199
Fine. Alright.

409
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,479
You don’t have to marry anyone.

410
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,119
Cuihua,

411
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:18,119
take her to freshen up

412
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,959
and tell her not to do
anything stupid again.

413
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,439
Sure. I will.

414
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,520
Come on.

415
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,000
Fuyu,

416
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,719
I’ve never seen her

417
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,599
so fiery before.

418
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,640
Sir,

419
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,800
she’s the only family I have.

420
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Please grant her wish!

421
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,800
Luckily, you didn’t cut off too much.

422
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,239
Your hair still looks fine.

423
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,680
Miss,

424
00:21:01,075 --> 00:21:02,951
(Prosperity and Peace)
why did you hurt yourself?

425
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,719
As the saying goes,

426
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,599
no pain no gain.

427
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,040
But that hair doesn’t guarantee you

428
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:17,079
a spot in the West Courtyard.

429
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,719
The rest is on Uncle Li.

430
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:27,100
(Letter of Betrothal:
Li Qian and Miaorong)

431
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:31,280
Father,

432
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,719
what’s this?

433
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,160
Back then,

434
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,719
Gao Fuyu and I had approved

435
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,880
the marriage
between Li Qian and Miaorong,

436
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,599
but then you showed up.

437
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,920
I couldn’t say no to you,

438
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,680
so you became Li Qian’s wife.

439
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,319
Yet,

440
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,880
Miaorong got hurt.

441
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,359
That’s why

442
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,000
I came with her today

443
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,800
to straighten things up

444
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:04,640
and I hope you’ll be kind

445
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,079
and take her.

446
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,359
Take her?

447
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,000
Father, I don’t understand.

448
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,400
Miss Gao isn’t a gift.

449
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,560
She’s a person.

450
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:20,359
I can’t just take her.

451
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,199
I want her to keep you company.

452
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,400
As what exactly?

453
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,199
The betrothal was there before me.

454
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,040
According to the order,

455
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,040
I should step down

456
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:39,560
and fall behind her, right?

457
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:40,760
No, no, no!

458
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,199
I didn’t mean that.

459
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,640
Your Grace,

460
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:45,800
you’re a noble princess.

461
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:47,920
I wouldn’t dare to go above you.

462
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,119
Back in the capital,

463
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:51,920
I already told you

464
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,119
Qian means the world to me.

465
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:58,520
It’s fate

466
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,160
that he married you later,

467
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,199
not me.

468
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,959
I accept that,

469
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:08,040
but my feelings for him

470
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,199
have never changed.

471
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,880
I don’t need a title or whatnot

472
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,520
as long as

473
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,920
I can be with him.

474
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,839
I’m begging you, Your Grace!

475
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,640
Please let me stay.

476
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,439
Miaorong is being as humble as she can.

477
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,560
There’s no harm in keeping her, right?

478
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,199
She can be your maid,

479
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,319
or you can keep her

480
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,319
to decorate your room.

481
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:33,160
Yes, Your Grace.

482
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,359
I’ll attend to all your needs.

483
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,199
If you have a bad day,

484
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:39,359
vent all your anger on me.

485
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,000
Just don’t kick me out, please!

486
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:44,239
Alright. Get up.

487
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:45,520
Get up.

488
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,520
Her Grace is generous enough

489
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,920
to let you stay.

490
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,439
Take good care of her.

491
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:51,760
Go ahead.

492
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,880
I’ll take my leave.

493
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,760
Father!

494
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,560
What’s this really about?

495
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,680
Your Grace,

496
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,959
haven’t I made it clear?

497
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,599
Your Grace,

498
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,319
you and Li Qian
still haven’t gone all the way.

499
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,839
But our family can’t stop
at his generation.

500
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,880
I understand we can’t go against

501
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,319
Grand Empress Dowager’s edict.

502
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:23,959
So now,

503
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,079
Miaorong is here

504
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,520
to share your burden

505
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,959
and help carry on our family line.

506
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,479
Baoning.

507
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,199
What happened?

508
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,520
Open the door.

509
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,160
Baoning!

510
00:24:59,975 --> 00:25:00,550
Hey.

511
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,290
Yes?

512
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,760
What happened to her?

513
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,479
I have no idea.

514
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,160
This morning,

515
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,079
Master came with Miss Gao

516
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,520
to talk to Her Grace,

517
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,680
then she became like this.

518
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,839
My father was here?

519
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:13,450
Yes.

520
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,199
Father!

521
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,760
How could you do this?

522
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:33,400
Qian,

523
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,400
I wrote the Letter of Betrothal

524
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,760
and Fuyu begged me for Miaorong.

525
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,199
I mean,

526
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,119
you two grew up together

527
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,560
and she’s obsessed with you.

528
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:45,880
Besides,

529
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,800
you and Her Grace
still haven’t done it...

530
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,719
Father!

531
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,359
How dare you yell at me!

532
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,520
Listen,

533
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,839
a filial son
must carry on the family line.

534
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,800
And what you’re doing?

535
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:57,760
You’re unfilial!

536
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,719
Grand Empress Dowager was concerned

537
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,680
if Baoning was
strong enough to give birth,

538
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,839
so she asked us to hold it.

539
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,199
But it’s not like forever!

540
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:07,640
How could you

541
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,439
give me another woman

542
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,520
shortly after Baoning and I married?

543
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,319
If Her Highness finds out about that,

544
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,800
what should we tell her?

545
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,640
And, Father,

546
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,599
you’re widely respected.

547
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,319
If words got out

548
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,680
that you stuck your nose
into your son’s bedroom,

549
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,880
what would others think?

550
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,319
I don’t need another woman. I’m serious!

551
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,560
Fine! Whatever!

552
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,040
I won’t interfere again, alright?

553
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,079
Get out of here!

554
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:28,920
Leave me alone!

555
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:30,050
Go!

556
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,719
Baoning,

557
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,479
I’ve learned about everything.

558
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,680
Open the door.

559
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,680
If so,

560
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:59,079
then go ahead.

561
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,640
Where to?

562
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,520
To your study.

563
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,239
And do what?

564
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,040
I’ve had Miss Gao wait for you there.

565
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,760
Just go.

566
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:12,199
Do you mean it?

567
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,319
Go ahead.

568
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,239
That’s very generous of you.

569
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,880
I admire that.

570
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,680
Your effort

571
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,800
won’t be in vain.

572
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,920
I’ll stay the night in the study then.

573
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,479
Seriously?

574
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,199
He’s going for real?

575
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:52,375
(Night Falls and Wind Blows)

576
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Do you know

577
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,520
where Li Qian was last night?

578
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,359
In the study.

579
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:09,760
What about Miss Gao?

580
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,000
She was there, too.

581
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,359
No, wait!

582
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:25,560
That was a mistake.

583
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
I’ll take it back.

584
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,000
Sure. No problem.

585
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,750
Oh.

586
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:42,959
Greetings, Your Grace.

587
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,040
You’re up early.

588
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,040
You two seem to have had a good night.

589
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:50,599
Thanks to you,

590
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,719
I can enjoy her company.

591
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,119
I must be the luckiest man

592
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,760
to have married such a tolerant wife.

593
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,439
You’re welcome. I’m just doing my job.

594
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,640
Anyway, thanks for everything.

595
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,079
If there are more women to come,

596
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:12,719
I hope you’ll be as tolerant.

597
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,880
Of course.

598
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,359
Let’s continue the game.

599
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,640
You’re better than I thought.

600
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,319
We should play more often

601
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:25,479
in the future.

602
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:26,880
Your turn.

603
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,079
Wait for me, Your Grace!

604
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,280
Your Grace!

605
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,680
- I’m so pissed!
- Wait!

606
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:39,479
How could he do this to me?

607
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:40,680
To be fair,

608
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:43,199
it was you who...

609
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,160
What...? What did I do?

610
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,839
You asked him to go there.

611
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,280
So what if I did?

612
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,319
I only said that in a fit of rage!

613
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,479
How could he actually go?

614
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,640
Your Grace...

615
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,920
You’re a liar, aren’t you, Li Qian?

616
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,319
Everything you told me
is a lie, isn’t it?

617
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,959
How dare you!

618
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:28,839
How could you...?

619
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,800
That’s right.

620
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:33,880
What?

621
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,599
Seeing your husband with another woman,

622
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,800
you should be mad.

623
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,680
How could you push me away?

624
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,839
Are you breaking up with me?

625
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:44,560
Miss, you’re back.

626
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,000
How did it go in there?

627
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,880
Miaorong,

628
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,400
I can’t be with you

629
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,719
not because Baoning is a princess

630
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,199
but because I don’t think

631
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,079
there’s room
for someone else in my heart.

632
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,599
That Letter of Betrothal

633
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,719
won’t change anything.

634
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:08,560
I won’t marry you.

635
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,680
Qian,

636
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:20,040
why not?

637
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,160
I just want you.

638
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:25,479
You don’t need to marry me.

639
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,400
Why are you being so cruel to me?

640
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,359
I believe I’ve made it very clear.

641
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,599
Why?

642
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,160
Uncle Li said I could stay

643
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:43,040
and so did Her Grace.

644
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,119
How come you
of all people are saying no?

645
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,599
I don’t love you.

646
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:50,239
Keeping you would only ruin your life

647
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,079
and more importantly,

648
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,640
break Baoning’s heart.

649
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:57,400
Would it really?

650
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,680
She asked me to wait for you

651
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,280
and told you to come here.

652
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,719
All that was her idea!

653
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:04,359
How could she be heartbroken?

654
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,439
You don’t know her.

655
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,599
Baoning is that kind of girl

656
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,040
who acts like she doesn’t care

657
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,000
even if she’s mad or sad.

658
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,319
She’s silly.

659
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,640
Miaorong,

660
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,439
you should go back.

661
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,359
No, Qian!

662
00:32:31,025 --> 00:32:31,680
I...

663
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,280
I’m begging you! Please don’t let me go.

664
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,119
At least not tonight...

665
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,079
Are you sure you want to stay?

666
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,160
Yes.

667
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,359
Fine.

668
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:50,280
Do me a favor then.

669
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:52,680
So he asked you

670
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,040
to put on a show with him

671
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,520
in front of Her Grace?

672
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,119
I’ve plotted so many ways
to be with him,

673
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,760
but he turned me down.

674
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,839
He’s changed.

675
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,839
He wasn’t like that before.

676
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,640
He used to

677
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,040
let me have my way all the time.

678
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,719
Jiang Baoning!

679
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It’s all her fault!

680
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,640
Since they met,

681
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,920
everything has changed!

682
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,640
She ruined my life.

683
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:22,839
So all that was a show?

684
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,359
It wasn’t true?

685
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,280
Of course it wasn’t.

686
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,160
You set me off deliberately.

687
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,560
You started it first.

688
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,000
My liver hurts because of you.

689
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,079
Touch it.

690
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:36,920
That’s your heart.

691
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,079
Whatever.

692
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,079
My whole body

693
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:41,119
is in pain.

694
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:42,599
Baoning,

695
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,280
keep this in mind.

696
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,479
From now on,

697
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,959
you can hit me, yell at me

698
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,959
or blow off your steam whenever you want

699
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,719
just don’t

700
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,079
keep everything to yourself

701
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,000
or push me to someone else,

702
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,560
please?

703
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,040
You think I wanted to?

704
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:00,599
You should let me know

705
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,800
whenever you feel uncomfortable.

706
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,400
I’m your husband, no?

707
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,359
It’s my job

708
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,359
to do everything I can

709
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
to protect you.

710
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,439
You know how Miss Gao feels for you.

711
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:19,760
Why did she agree to work with you?

712
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:21,719
I’ve persuaded and warned her

713
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,360
and I’ve tried everything to reject her.

714
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,775
I know it’s kind of mean

715
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,919
but it’s for her sake.

716
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,879
I hope she’ll come around.

717
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,550
Mother, what are...?

718
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,560
These are

719
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,760
Xuan’s baby clothes

720
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,320
and shoes.

721
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:56,879
Look,

722
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,840
aren’t they cute?

723
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:03,320
And this one.

724
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,560
This rattle

725
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,840
was his favorite toy.

726
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,879
Every time

727
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:09,800
I played it,

728
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,199
he’d start to cackle.

729
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:15,520
Now that you’re his wife,

730
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:17,800
I want you

731
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:20,520
to keep them.

732
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:25,760
Here you are.

733
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,040
Our family has been declining

734
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,479
since Empress Dowager
moved to Longevity Hill.

735
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:36,479
I’m sorry

736
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,840
that you have to suffer with us.

737
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,439
Whether we’re powerful
or not doesn’t matter.

738
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,520
What matters to me

739
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,639
is you and Xuan’s happiness.

740
00:35:47,919 --> 00:35:49,679
Don’t worry, Mother.

741
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,639
We’ll be the happiest couple.

742
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,280
Good girl.

743
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:57,199
Your words

744
00:35:57,399 --> 00:35:58,639
are such a relief.

745
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,040
You spooked me, Xuan!

746
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,719
Let me

747
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,919
comb your hair.

748
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:30,600
Hey,

749
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:34,239
Mother gave me a few treasures earlier.

750
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,080
Treasures?

751
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,959
Everything valuable we had

752
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,919
was given to you as the betrothal gift.

753
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,520
What else is left?

754
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,919
Your baby clothes, shoes and toys.

755
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,840
They’re priceless to me.

756
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:58,360
So,

757
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,080
do you know

758
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,639
why Mother

759
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:04,439
passed all that baby stuff to you?

760
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:06,760
She wanted me to keep them.

761
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,040
Actually,

762
00:37:09,919 --> 00:37:12,520
she wants new babies in our family.

763
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,399
How about

764
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,280
we make them tonight?

765
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,199
Stop it!

766
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,520
Give up!

767
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,280
You can’t run away from me!

768
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,159
Go away!

769
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:29,360
Go easy on those drumsticks.

770
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,199
Try the other dishes I made.

771
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,800
I didn’t cook all that for myself!

772
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:38,120
I can’t believe you’re still eating!

773
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:39,320
Listen,

774
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:40,879
the food can wait.

775
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,800
You should

776
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:43,800
pay more attention to your marriage.

777
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:45,080
I’ve

778
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,199
hired a few matchmakers

779
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,719
to get to know

780
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,000
all those bachelors in Bingzhou.

781
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:53,479
When you’re done, go to my room.

782
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,159
Let’s find the best one for you.

783
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,639
I’m thinking

784
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,679
it should be someone like your brother

785
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,080
who’s firmly loyal to his wife

786
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,399
despite the temptation.

787
00:38:03,399 --> 00:38:04,080
I’m full.

788
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
Come back! You...

789
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,000
- Let her go.
- Dongzhi!

790
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,399
Li Changqing!

791
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,280
What?

792
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,120
You think you’re helping her?

793
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:21,280
No, you’re doing the opposite, you know?

794
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,040
Dongdong is still young.

795
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,600
She can pick from the crowd

796
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,719
to find a good man.

797
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:27,520
But when she gets older,

798
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:29,639
she’s to be picked

799
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,719
or left on the shelf.

800
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,679
She’s your daughter, too!

801
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:35,280
Would you rather see her

802
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,399
grow old and alone at home?

803
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,159
You’re exaggerating it!

804
00:38:40,287 --> 00:38:43,725
(Li’s Mansion)

805
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:44,760
Come.

806
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,600
Miss Dong was so thoughtful

807
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,040
that she specifically put aside

808
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,959
(Unifon)
this face-washing cream for Your Grace.

809
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:53,040
We can’t live without her.

810
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:53,959
Let’s go.

811
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:57,879
Hi, there.

812
00:38:58,479 --> 00:38:59,800
Where did you go?

813
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:01,560
We went shopping

814
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,280
and picked up a few things for Baoning.

815
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:05,080
Hey,

816
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,719
I’m home. No need to walk me in.

817
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,479
Just go.

818
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,040
Take care of her for me.

819
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,625
Sure.

820
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:20,840
Hey!

821
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,550
Yes?

822
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,560
You two are so sweet together!

823
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,399
I envy you.

824
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,199
I didn’t get to ask you.

825
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,879
How are things between you and Qing An?

826
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,280
What do you mean?

827
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:38,000
He lied to me about his identity.

828
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
How could I still trust him?

829
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,080
He must’ve had his reason.

830
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:45,520
Be that as it may,

831
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,159
it was still a lie.

832
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,879
You’re the one lying now.

833
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,199
If you hate him as you said,

834
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,719
why are you still wearing this ring?

835
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,320
My hatred is real.

836
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,919
It’s as much as the trust

837
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,439
I misplaced in him.

838
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:09,280
Miss,

839
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,520
you’ve been in the room for too long.

840
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:14,199
It’s bad for your health.

841
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Today is a nice day.

842
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,120
Why don’t we go out for a walk?

843
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,000
Go out

844
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,080
so they can laugh in my face?

845
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:22,199
Well,

846
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,520
everyone knows the betrothal

847
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:26,280
was the adults’ decision.

848
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,840
No one will judge you.

849
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,199
Don’t you know

850
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,399
people talk behind each other’s backs?

851
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:36,159
Miss Gao, you have a visitor.

852
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,919
You aren’t supposed to be here.

853
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,560
I have no other choice, Miss Gao.

854
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
You don’t go out.

855
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I can’t find you elsewhere but here.

856
00:41:00,399 --> 00:41:01,199
Miss Gao,

857
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:03,800
I’ve invested all my savings
in your money shop.

858
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,399
Right now, I’m almost broke.

859
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,439
That’s why I’m here.

860
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,520
Guanju, guard the door.

861
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,560
Don’t let anyone in.

862
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,550
Yes.

863
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,080
Mr. Shao,

864
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:20,800
I don’t have that much money now.

865
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:22,919
Are you not going to pay me back?

866
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:25,639
I don’t have money,

867
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,280
but there’s something better

868
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,520
for you.

869
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,639
I just

870
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,000
want my money back.

871
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:37,239
What a shame!

872
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,000
That thing

873
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,800
is worth a whole lot more.

874
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,959
What could it be?

875
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,959
Is there not even one good young man

876
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:48,280
in the entire city?

877
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,399
I paid a lot for these men’s profiles!

878
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:52,000
None of them stands out!

879
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,639
They aren’t worth the price.

880
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,719
Matchmakers gave you
the worst candidates

881
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,600
when there are
tons of better ones out there.

882
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,959
Others aside,

883
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,439
there’s this Mr. Shao I know

884
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:08,080
whose family is rich and powerful.

885
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,399
Their family fortune is unthinkable.

886
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,560
As the only son,

887
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,639
he’s the sole heir to all that.

888
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:17,600
Besides, he’s so charming

889
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,639
that girls are eager to marry him.

890
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,875
Is that true?

891
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:23,425
Yes.

892
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,439
Why didn’t you tell me earlier

893
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:28,479
about such a rare catch in the city?

894
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:31,719
Madam, I’ve only met him

895
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:33,919
a few times.

896
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,280
If you trust me,

897
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,719
I’ll set him up with Dongzhi later.

898
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:42,320
Of course I trust you.

899
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,479
Don’t wait any longer.

900
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:45,639
Set it up tomorrow.

901
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,000
Miaorong,

902
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,959
do everything you can
to help them together.

903
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:49,850
I will.

904
00:42:49,879 --> 00:42:50,959
You have my word, Madam.

905
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:03,239
Hi, there!

906
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,800
Thanks.

907
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,800
You must be Miss Li Dongzhi.

908
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,525
Coming.

909
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,719
Mr. Shao, right?

910
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:22,360
Yes.

911
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:23,639
Have a seat.

912
00:43:26,725 --> 00:43:27,800
Cheers!

913
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:28,925
Cheers!

914
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,280
As Commandant Li’s daughter,

915
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,239
Commandery Prince’s younger sister

916
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,080
and Commandery Princess’s sister-in-law,

917
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,560
you’re of noble birth

918
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,439
and unparalleled beauty.

919
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,439
It’s my great pleasure

920
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,840
to have finally met you.

921
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,520
I am who I am.

922
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,679
I don’t have that many identities.

923
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:58,600
Besides, our family rose from bandits.

924
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,959
That’s not noble at all.

925
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:06,800
Your brother’s marriage with Her Grace

926
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:09,479
has brought your family fame

927
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:10,959
and a spot in the nobility.

928
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:26,280
Are you alright, Miss Li?

929
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,675
I’m fine.

930
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:35,120
What’s that smell?

931
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:36,075
You mean this?

932
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,840
The smell is from the most popular
perfume powder in the capital.

933
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,520
It’s designed for men.

934
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:41,479
A tiny box of it

935
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:43,000
is worth ten taels of silver.

936
00:44:44,919 --> 00:44:46,360
There’s perfume powder for men?

937
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,439
Miss Li, that’s the new trend

938
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,120
in case you don’t know.

939
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:52,000
Rich young men like me

940
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:54,280
should always keep up with it.

941
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,479
Excellent.

942
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,620
Excuse me. I should go.

943
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:01,719
Miss Li!

944
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:03,560
Miss Li, wait!

945
00:45:03,725 --> 00:45:04,250
You...

946
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:04,800
Dongzhi!

947
00:45:06,919 --> 00:45:07,575
