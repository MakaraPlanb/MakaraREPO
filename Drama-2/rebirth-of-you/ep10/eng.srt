Baoning.

29
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,279
Are you still worried about my marriage?

30
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,559
Zhao Xiao was stupid.

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,800
How could he
let someone else play for him?

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,600
Never mind.

33
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:28,679
I’ll pick another man for you.

34
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,639
You can’t marry into Yongqing State.

35
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,969
I’m sorry, Grandma.

36
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,770
I’ve decided
to marry into Yongqing State.

37
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:49,559
You...

38
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,860
Baoning.

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,279
Do you know what you’re talking about?

40
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,039
If I tell you

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,520
I like you,

42
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,440
will you take me away from here?

43
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,360
Sorry, Your Grace.

44
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,679
Grandma.

45
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,759
I’m a Commandery Princess of Mu’an.

46
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,320
Why can’t I use my marriage
to exchange for the peace of Mu’an?

47
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,000
It doesn’t matter who I marry.

48
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,759
Yongqing State has a harsh climate.

49
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,240
It’s very different from life here.

50
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,399
You are a princess
who has been enjoying affluence.

51
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,839
How can you spend your life

52
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,759
with that brute, Qing Tai?

53
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,119
No, no, no.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,360
Grandma.

55
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,160
Look,

56
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,679
I’ve never left the capital before.

57
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,360
I heard

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,120
that Yongqing State

59
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:58,766
has beautiful scenery
and is rich in natural resources.

60
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,919
The girls there

61
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,600
don’t need to conform with
wifely submission and virtue.

62
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,279
How free would that be?

63
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,360
Do you really think so?

64
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,109
There’s no one worth marrying here.

65
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,625
I’ve decided to marry into Yongqing.

66
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:23,844
I’ll talk to Empress Dowager Cao.

67
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,050
No.

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,239
No.

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,200
My Baoning.

70
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,150
(The Book of Supreme Weapons)

71
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,040
If I tell you

72
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,040
I like you,

73
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:45,559
will you take me away from here?

74
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,040
Sorry, Your Grace.

75
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,920
You are such a coward.

76
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,170
Am I really a coward?

77
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:18,600
Bao... Baoning.

78
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,640
Let me ask you again.

79
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,290
Have you made up your mind?

80
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,279
Once the imperial decree is declared,

81
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,920
you can’t

82
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:33,225
regret anymore.

83
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,100
I’ve made up my mind.

84
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:48,000
Min Zhou.

85
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:49,119
Hold on.

86
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,861
Baoning.

87
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,320
Are you really willing to marry him?

88
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,000
I mean,

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,239
are the people in Mu’an

90
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,750
all so officious?

91
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,450
You...!

92
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:27,225
Get back.

93
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,669
I know what I’m doing.

94
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,920
Make the announcement.

95
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,901
Yes.

96
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,519
By the order of the Dowager Empress,

97
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,399
Commandery Princess Jia’nan
is intelligent, modest, and virtuous.

98
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,959
For the intergenerational friendship

99
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,399
between Mu’an and Yongqing,

100
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,559
she is willing to marry into
Yongqing State

101
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:02,720
and marry Qing Tai, the First Prince
of Yongqing on an auspicious day

102
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:05,000
to cement the border land.

103
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,159
Thank Your Majesty and Your Highness
for granting me a marriage.

104
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,320
All right.

105
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,040
Stop crying.

106
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,575
I’m getting married, not dying.

107
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,480
Your Grace, don’t talk nonsense.

108
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,679
Stop crying then.

109
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,519
You will marry into a place so far away.

110
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,200
There are many things to pack.

111
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,679
What do you want to bring?

112
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,760
I’ll pack them up for you
when I get back.

113
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,570
There is nothing I want to bring.

114
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,130
But I need to return the zither
to the son of Marquis Jinghai.

115
00:07:57,225 --> 00:07:58,785
Baoning, you want to see me?

116
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Are you...?

117
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:08,040
I believe

118
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:10,320
you’ll find a better person

119
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,440
to give this zither to one day.

120
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:19,359
Baoning.

121
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,000
Li Qian.

122
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:43,665
Master Zhao.

123
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,840
I don’t have any friends in the capital.

124
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,119
It’s been such a miserable day.

125
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:51,159
So,

126
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,000
I want to have a drink with you.

127
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,919
I never got a chance

128
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,599
to thank you

129
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,719
for helping me that day.

130
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,919
Well, together?

131
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,960
I...

132
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,520
I’m so useless.

133
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:17,400
If I were

134
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,569
a good fighter,

135
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,880
how would I lose Princess Jia’nan?

136
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,189
Even if you can fight, so what?

137
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
You know what?

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,039
The other day,

139
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,400
Her Grace sent me back the zither

140
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,400
I gave her.

141
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,919
She told me

142
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,039
to find someone better to marry.

143
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,679
Is there anyone in the world
who is better than her?

144
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:09,585
Baoning.

145
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,750
Baoning.

146
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:25,725
Master Li.

147
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:28,200
You’re back.

148
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:29,799
How is it going?

149
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,559
Miss Gao has arrived safely in Bingzhou.

150
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,359
The Guards of Li also
arrived in the Longevity Hill.

151
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,400
But I found

152
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,960
the activity of Yongqing’s army

153
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,359
on the outskirts on my way back.

154
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:46,446
Commandery Princess Jia’nan
is about to get married.

155
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,559
Nothing can go wrong right now.

156
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,400
Tell Jin Xiao

157
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,919
we’ll go back to the capital tomorrow.

158
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,520
Yes.

159
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:01,159
Master Li, be careful.

160
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,041
Move! Move!

161
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:04,840
- Move!
- Move!

162
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,400
(Anyuan Gate)

163
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:13,080
These people from Yongqing
are getting more arrogant.

164
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,440
Li, what should we do?

165
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,599
That was the military token
of Yongqing State.

166
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,125
Jin Xiao.

167
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,359
I need you to do me a favor.

168
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,799
Stay outside the courier station

169
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,239
and see how many Yongqing’s people

170
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,960
have been in and out these days.

171
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,039
It’s a sure thing

172
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,400
that Commandery Princess Jia’nan
will marry Qing Tai.

173
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,760
What else do you want to do?

174
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,440
Will you help me or not?

175
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,599
I will.

176
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,000
I’ll help you.

177
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
Go back to Bingzhou now

178
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:39,479
and tell my father

179
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,520
to keep tabs on

180
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,039
the deployment of Yongqing’s army
at the border these days.

181
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,039
Get him on it as soon as possible.

182
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:44,600
Yes.

183
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,799
- Li Qian. Don’t go nuts.
- Take a look.

184
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,320
We’ll know

185
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,746
if I’m going nuts.

186
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:56,635
Did you find anything?

187
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:59,316
The military token
is for commanding the armies.

188
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,211
Take a look.

189
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:04,919
(Marquis Dingbei’s Mansion)

190
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,559
Is it straight?

191
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:06,575
Let me see.

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,599
Okay.

193
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,975
(Unifon)

194
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,960
My precious sister.

195
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,280
I haven’t seen you for a few days.
You are getting more beautiful.

196
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,280
My mother

197
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,880
left the bracelet to me.

198
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:35,080
I can’t stay by your side from now on.

199
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,200
It will accompany you for me.

200
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,000
All right.

201
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,145
Baoning, thank you for helping me.

202
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:43,605
You don’t need to say that to me.

203
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:48,955
What will you do?

204
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,560
I know you don’t like Qing Tai.

205
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,239
So what?

206
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,239
This matter is of great importance,

207
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,799
and I’ve agreed to it.

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,599
But this is about your happiness.

209
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,200
My happiness?

210
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,701
When is my happiness ever in my hands?

211
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:10,159
Baoning, you taught me

212
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,879
to fight for my happiness.

213
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:15,799
I tried.

214
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:17,799
I failed.

215
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,599
Li Qian?

216
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,919
Look,

217
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,119
only one person being brave

218
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,640
is not enough for two people
to be together.

219
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,719
Su, are you finished?

220
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,440
The time has come.

221
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,039
Come on. Don’t be sad.

222
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,000
I’m happy enough

223
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,559
to marry you off in person
before I leave.

224
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,369
Come on.

225
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:52,320
Congratulations to Madam.

226
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:53,856
Thank you, Your Grace.

227
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,599
Go ahead, Su.

228
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:05,425
Find your happiness.

229
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,799
If I’m destined to miss happiness
in my life,

230
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,960
it’s good to see you

231
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,039
walk towards happiness.

232
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:27,080
Master Li.

233
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:28,960
It’s pigeon post from Bingzhou.

234
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,175
(Yongqing people
gather outside the capital,)

235
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:33,750
(20,000 in total disguised as
Mu’an people, looking suspicious)

236
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,679
Well, Qing Tai.

237
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,575
I knew he is up to something.

238
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:40,799
I need to enter the palace now.

239
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,520
Now?

240
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,200
Ah?

241
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,599
Well, are you going out?

242
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,760
Master Li is going to enter the palace.

243
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,919
This late? Why do you go to the palace?

244
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,039
Li.

245
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:51,080
You are the commander
of the Longevity Hill’s Imperial Guards.

246
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,080
I’m afraid it would be inconvenient
for you to enter the palace.

247
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
I can’t worry about that now.

248
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,719
I have something urgent
to tell Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

249
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,410
Li, look, be careful!

250
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,719
Your Grace.

251
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,159
I’ll get married tomorrow.

252
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,880
What are you doing here now?

253
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:33,359
Your Grace.

254
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:34,919
You can’t marry him.

255
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,280
I have something urgent to tell you.

256
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,479
Why not?

257
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,159
What do you want to say?

258
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,479
I’ve been keeping tabs
on Qing Tai these days.

259
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,760
The attendant Qing Tai sent back
to Yongqing to report the good news

260
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,719
was carrying a military token.

261
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,039
He wasn’t there to report good news,

262
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:51,080
but to deploy troops and horses.

263
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:53,919
According to a reliable source
from my father,

264
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,640
Yongqing has indeed deployed troops
at the Jinxi border.

265
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:58,880
I guess

266
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,440
they plan to break into the capital

267
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,359
when the bridal procession
opens the gate.

268
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,599
Their real purpose

269
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:04,799
is to attack Mu’an.

270
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,440
Marrying you is just a cover.

271
00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:12,095
How dare you!

272
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,400
That’s what you want to say?

273
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,159
You think this is your backyard?

274
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:17,880
Your Grace.

275
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:19,599
This matter is of great importance.

276
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:21,200
You can’t marry him tomorrow.

277
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,640
Do you have any proof?

278
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,200
It will be too late

279
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,200
after I get the evidence.

280
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,280
Without any evidence,

281
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:35,320
just because of your side of the story
and your suspicion,

282
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,760
you ask me to end the marriage
between the two countries.

283
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:38,919
It’s not playing house.

284
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,719
I don’t agree.

285
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,599
But you may become a hostage if you go.

286
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:43,000
Have you thought about your safety?

287
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:44,719
If you’re worried about my safety,

288
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:45,960
except to keep me from marrying him,

289
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,400
what else can you do?

290
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,479
What I said is true.

291
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,520
I’ll get the evidence as soon as I can.

292
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,479
I can’t take your word for it

293
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:02,760
regardless of the big picture.

294
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,400
I didn’t choose to marry him

295
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,880
for my own safety and happiness.

296
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,839
Since I marry him
for the common people,

297
00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:13,119
I have to be responsible for them.

298
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,160
You asked me that day

299
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,319
how I think of you in my heart.

300
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,680
I can answer you now.

301
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,280
Your safety and happiness are paramount.

302
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:41,839
I’m worried
that I can’t give you happiness,

303
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:43,520
so I’m a coward.

304
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,199
But if I can’t even keep you safe,

305
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:52,114
I’d rather be a hothead.

306
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:57,319
You guys, check that out.

307
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:03,155
No matter what,

308
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
I will protect you,

309
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,999
in my own way.

310
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,359
Li Qian?

311
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,280
What are you doing here?

312
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,275
Master Zhao.

313
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,160
Come in.

314
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,680
Master Zhao.

315
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,040
I’m here so late

316
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,680
because there is something very urgent

317
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,400
and I need your help.

318
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,199
What’s the matter?

319
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,625
I think Qing Tai is planning
to attack Mu’an.

320
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,680
Really?

321
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,400
Qing Tai is such a jerk.

322
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,760
I won’t let him get it.

323
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
I’m not entirely sure about it now,

324
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,599
but it concerns the safety of Mu’an.

325
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,239
When His Majesty learns about
what Yongqing is coveting,

326
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:08,880
it will be too late.

327
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,800
So I decided...

328
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,719
Say no more.

329
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,760
I’ll do my best
to help you in this matter.

330
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:13,959
Okay.

331
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,680
I’m relieved to hear that.

332
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,910
Master Zhao, do you have a map?

333
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,439
According to the military reports,

334
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,920
there are abnormal military movements
in these places in Yongqing.

335
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,760
As for Her Grace’s trip this time,

336
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:33,959
to avoid disturbing the people,

337
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,319
Yongqing State has decided
to leave from the Yunlin Pass.

338
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,719
The Yunlin Pass

339
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,119
is where the defense
is the weakest in Mu’an.

340
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,550
Okay.

341
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,375
Let’s act on the plan tomorrow.

342
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,000
Um.

343
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,599
Meet me at my mansion

344
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
at 7:30 tomorrow morning.

345
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,760
We will go to the North Gate.

346
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,479
Li Qian, you helped me again.

347
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:56,550
Master Zhao.

348
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,680
About Baoning,

349
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,479
there’s something else
I need to tell you.

350
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,575
You can tell me

351
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,079
after this is over.

352
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,680
I’ll see you at Li’s Mansion.

353
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:09,280
Okay.

354
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:23,000
Zhao Zhong! Zhao Zhong!

355
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,119
What do you need, Master Zhao?

356
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:32,439
Well,

357
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,079
get me all the good fighters

358
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:35,680
in the capital

359
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,400
to save the Princess with me tomorrow.

360
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,525
Ah?

361
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,880
Master Zhao.

362
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,479
Zhao Zhong.

363
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,479
If you still think of me
as your only master,

364
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,479
don’t ask anything.

365
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,760
Just do what I told you.

366
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:47,175
Oh.

367
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,525
Master.

368
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,000
Father.

369
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:56,920
What do you want to do?

370
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,160
I heard it all.

371
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:00,256
I...

372
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,500
I...

373
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,680
This is ridiculous.

374
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,760
How could you think of that?

375
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,479
Have you thought about

376
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:10,640
the possibility

377
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,800
that Li Qian’s conjecture is wrong,

378
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,599
and Qing Tai has no evil intentions?

379
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
What would that leave you to?

380
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:20,280
You will be kidnapping a princess,

381
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,040
not only
the Commandery Princess of Mu’an,

382
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
but also
the Princess Consort of Yongqing.

383
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,520
Once the two countries start a war,

384
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,199
you will be condemned
as a sinner of Mu’an through the ages!

385
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,280
Do you think
Nanmin Navy’s soldiers and generals

386
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:38,520
have lived too long

387
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,839
or do you think the head on my shoulder

388
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,599
is not falling fast enough?

389
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:43,625
Father.

390
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,439
If what Li Qian said is true,

391
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:46,520
and I don’t do anything about it,

392
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,959
it will put Baoning

393
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:49,119
into a dangerous situation.

394
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,719
How can I bear to do that?

395
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,199
Do you want to see the Nanmin Navy

396
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:55,199
and your father die

397
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:56,079
or do you want to see

398
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,800
your sweetheart die?

399
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:58,850
Take your choice.

400
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:00,760
Father, what am I supposed to choose?

401
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,000
Father!

402
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:09,839
Keep him here.

403
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,800
Don’t let him leave the room.

404
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

405
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,479
Father!

406
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,400
Father, just let me go to save Baoning!

407
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,000
Father!

408
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,825
(Li’s Mansion)

409
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:23,560
How is it?

410
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:28,800
The time is up.

411
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:29,675
Let’s go.

412
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:30,400
Master Li.

413
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,800
Are we not waiting for Master Zhao?

414
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,560
We are too weak on our side.

415
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,079
Qing Tai has more men and horses.

416
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:35,680
I’m afraid...

417
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,920
If he’s not here now,

418
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:38,280
he’s not gonna be here.

419
00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:39,065
Let’s go.

420
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:39,839
Yes.

421
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,425
Looks like

422
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:02,719
we are going to spend the night here.

423
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,450
Liu Xiaoman.

424
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:04,975
Ah.

425
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:06,359
Make some tea

426
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,880
and tell the cook to make a meal now.

427
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,450
Um.

428
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,439
Well,

429
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,040
I can’t go there?

430
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,160
Please go back to your carriage,
Your Grace.

431
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,319
Princess Jia’nan is tired
of sitting in the carriage.

432
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,319
She wants to take a walk.

433
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,920
Why does your First Prince have a tent,

434
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,599
and our Princess
can only live in a carriage?

435
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,520
Please go back to your carriage,
Your Grace.

436
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,319
Don’t push us too far!

437
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
All right, let’s go back.

438
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,479
That’s ridiculous.

439
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,000
Your Grace, you are
their Princess Consort,

440
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,119
not their prisoner.

441
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,599
How can they treat you like that?

442
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,880
There is something wrong.

443
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,880
Go get Lord Liu.

444
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,640
Tell him I have something to say.

445
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,400
Yes.

446
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,280
Lord Liu!

447
00:25:14,225 --> 00:25:14,920
Lord Liu!

448
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Lord Liu!
Her Grace wants to talk to you!

449
00:25:17,525 --> 00:25:18,645
Lord Liu!

450
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,719
I don’t know

451
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,839
if Lord Liu is deaf or what,

452
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,680
I called him so loudly
and he couldn’t hear me.

453
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,319
Someone used silver to cover his ears.

454
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,719
Of course he couldn’t hear you.

455
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,359
Your Grace, you are saying

456
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,760
he was bought off?

457
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:45,439
The meal should be ready.

458
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:46,439
Get Xiaoman here.

459
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:48,400
Yes.

460
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,959
What are you doing here?

461
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,560
Bros, you’ve been working hard.

462
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:07,920
There are some delicacies
from the palace of Mu’an.

463
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,800
Bros.

464
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:09,880
Have a try?

465
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,250
Oh.

466
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,680
Yummy.

467
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,920
It’s delicious.

468
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,160
Usually only His Majesty and Her Graces

469
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,079
are able to eat these.

470
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,239
Now the Princess is getting married,

471
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:24,000
she brought a lot.

472
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,839
There is a treat for us.

473
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:27,599
Take it.

474
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:32,599
Yongqing’s horses are great.

475
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,560
Our horses in Mu’an

476
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,880
are rarely so imposing.

477
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,280
I’ve never seen
such a strong horse in my life.

478
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,000
May I just touch it?

479
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:43,400
The people of Mu’an have seen nothing.

480
00:26:44,199 --> 00:26:44,800
You can touch it.

481
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,479
Don’t do anything else and no riding.

482
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,760
How dare I?

483
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:49,560
Go ahead.

484
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:50,680
Thank you.

485
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,439
Be careful.

486
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:56,279
Wow.

487
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,520
It’s on fire!

488
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,119
Hurry!

489
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,048
- Put out the fire!
- Fire!

490
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:01,800
Fire!

491
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:04,439
Fire! Put out the fire! Get water here!

492
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,839
Hurry!

493
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:07,920
Get water here!

494
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,800
Hurry!

495
00:27:11,275 --> 00:27:13,599
Hurry!

496
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,280
What’s the matter?

497
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,959
Where are the people?

498
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:15,760
Someone!

499
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,199
Hurry! Here!

500
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,560
Water! Hurry!

501
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,719
Your Grace,
your idea worked really well.

502
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:21,654
Hurry!

503
00:27:21,654 --> 00:27:22,599
Take this

504
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,959
and give it to the Grand Coordinator

505
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,079
at the nearest Jingtian Mansion.

506
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,880
Let him do something

507
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,450
to hold off the procession.

508
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,160
Water! Hurry!

509
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,119
Then ask him to tell it

510
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,199
- to the nearby Grand Coordinator.
- Hurry!

511
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:33,920
Wait, who do you still
care about the procession?

512
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,599
Let’s just escape

513
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,439
when the Yongqing people are in a mess.

514
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:38,119
They are good at tracking people down.

515
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:38,880
The few of us

516
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,079
- will be caught back soon.
- Hurry. The fire is spreading.

517
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,079
Just send it out now.

518
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,300
- Qingke and I will run separately.
- Here is the water.

519
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:43,880
Be quick!

520
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,520
They won’t catch us
if we run far away enough.

521
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,400
Bring people to save me
after you deliver the letter.

522
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:47,920
Okay.

523
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,189
It’s up to us now.

524
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:54,880
Um.

525
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,359
Let’s go.

526
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:06,325
Report.

527
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:07,200
The Princess Consort escaped!

528
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,719
This way.

529
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,520
Get her back now!

530
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,040
Yes!

531
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:10,479
- I need two people here.
- Let’s go!

532
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,880
You go over there.

533
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,450
Um.

534
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,359
Hurry, this way!

535
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,350
Let’s go!

536
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,040
Check it out over there!

537
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:43,199
Search carefully!

538
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:43,775
Yes!

539
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:44,425
Hurry!

540
00:28:54,225 --> 00:28:55,680
Hurry! Hurry!

541
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,760
Over there!

542
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:02,479
Hurry!

543
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,800
Where are you going, my princess?

544
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,319
You treat me like a prisoner.

545
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,560
What kind of princess am I?

546
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,959
Even I treat you like a prisoner,

547
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,560
you are still

548
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,050
capable of making such a mess.

549
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,471
I knew

550
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,920
it’s gonna be troublesome

551
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,520
to take you with me.

552
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:37,000
You will ruin my plan sooner or later.

553
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,680
In that case,

554
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,000
I can’t escape
and you’re not gonna let me go.

555
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,160
Why don’t you tell me your plan?

556
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,719
So I won’t be a fool.

557
00:29:47,675 --> 00:29:48,520
Your Grace.

558
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,175
You don’t need to know that.

559
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,800
I was going

560
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,880
to take you back and marry you

561
00:30:00,775 --> 00:30:03,175
considering your pretty face.

562
00:30:04,175 --> 00:30:05,976
But you’re too unruly.

563
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,760
You’re looking for death.

564
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:09,959
Don’t blame me then.

565
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:13,280
What do you want to do?

566
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:15,839
I’m a Commandery Princess to marry you.

567
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,119
A Commandery Princess?

568
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,359
Who knows you?

569
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,680
Among my attendants,

570
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,479
there are plenty of good
and obedient women.

571
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,920
I’ll just pick one.

572
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,880
If I say she is the Princess,

573
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,400
she will be the Princess.

574
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,199
As for you...

I can’t leave.

587
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,400
It concerns the relations
between the two countries.

588
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,959
If I leave now,

589
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,239
the responsibility
will rest with you alone.

590
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:50,599

- No matter how dangerous it is,

591
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:52,760
I’ll bear all the consequences

592
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,959

Master Zhao, you can’t leave.

599
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,000
Give it to Marquis Jinghai.

600
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:46,280
Tell him I’ve made my choice.

601
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:57,839
Where is he?

602
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:03,599
Father.

603
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,079
I’m not a good son.

604
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,239
I can’t let Baoning die.

605
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,640
From the day,

606
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:11,359
I’ll sever all relations with Nanmin

607
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,640
and bear all the responsibilities.

608
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,199
I won’t implicate Nanmin

609
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:16,239
or Father.

610
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,439
Unfilial.

611
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
What an unfilial son!

612
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,280
Hurry, get him back now!

613
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:22,760
Yes!

614
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:29,800
Master Zhao.

615
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:31,599
Looks like they’ve been away
for a while.

616
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,239
It’s such a mess here.

617
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:35,319
Seems that Her Grace has been rescued.

618
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,680
I think Li Qian took action first.

619
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,800
If Li Qian saved Her Grace,

620
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,520
they must be heading for Jinxi.

621
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,599
Just keep going in this direction,

622
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,640
we’re gonna find them.

623
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,880
I will bring Commandery Princess Jia’nan

624
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,000
back to the capital.

625
00:34:11,725 --> 00:34:12,800
Your Grace, you’re awake.

626
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,040
Don’t tell me

627
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:20,399
you changed my clothes for me.

628
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,900
When we arrived here,

629
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,360
you passed out.

630
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,639
Your sweat soaked the clothes.

631
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,959
You would get sick
if I let you sleep like that.

632
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,600
Thank you for saving me last night.

633
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,280
I said

634
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,959
I’ll protect you in my own way.

635
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,520
You mean,

636
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:48,439
not His Majesty,

637
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,199
not my grandma,

638
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,360
or not my uncle,

639
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,080
but you decided to save me?

640
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,000
Yes.

641
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:00,360
Well, you’re silly.

642
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,399
Do you know

643
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,560
what the consequences it can be
after you did it?

644
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,000
To save you from danger,

645
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,399
I can bear any consequences.

646
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,479
What’s more,

647
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:17,239
it’s different from the last time
when I did it for Master Zhao.

648
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:18,800
This time,

649
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,000
I’ll bear all the consequences

650
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:22,719
as Li Qian,

651
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,800
not anyone’s substitute.

652
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,840
Miss.

653
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,520
It’s freshly cooked millet porridge.

654
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,719
It’s still warm.

655
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,000
Thank you, Ma’am.

656
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:34,879
When we arrived here yesterday,

657
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,800
she kindly took us in.

658
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:38,239
She also

659
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,040
changed your clothes for you.

660
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,159
Then why did you...?

661
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,000
Thank you.

662
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:48,199
No big deal.

663
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,600
Drink it while it’s still hot.

664
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,719
I’ll get you something to eat.

665
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,760
You must be hungry.

666
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,479
We only have simple food
in the countryside.

667
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,520
Please don’t mind.

668
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,159
We won’t.

669
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:57,919
Thank you.

670
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,959
Your fancy outfit is too obvious.

671
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,399
To avoid the pursuers,

672
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:06,719
I had to do that.

673
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,159
Please don’t mind.

674
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,520
Where are we going next?

675
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,719
Where is the nearest government office?

676
00:36:13,725 --> 00:36:14,439
Yunzhong.

677
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,120
Then send me to Yunzhong.

678
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,919
After you send me there,

679
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:21,760
this will be no concern of yours.

680
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:27,840
Your Grace.

681
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,000
Have some porridge first.

682
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:32,479
We can only continue on our way
on a full stomach.

683
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,399
We need to hide from our pursuers,

684
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,320
so we might have to sleep rough.

685
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:44,080
Eat something first.

686
00:36:47,225 --> 00:36:47,825
Have this.

687
00:37:18,325 --> 00:37:19,360
Why don’t you get on the horse?

688
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:51,280
What are you doing?

689
00:38:16,025 --> 00:38:16,875
Li Qian.

690
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,639
Don’t be rude. Behave yourself.

691
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:25,959
To make your bed, of course.

692
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,340
What do you think I am going to do?

693
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,200
Fine.

694
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,275
You can go out now.

695
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,040
The bed is done.

696
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:37,125
Your Grace, we are
in the middle of nowhere.

697
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,239
There are a lot of beasts.

698
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,639
Are you sure you don’t need me
to stay here with you?

699
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,639
No need.

700
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:43,159
Men and women should
keep a distance away from each other.

701
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,280
It doesn’t conform with ethics for us

702
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,280
to sleep in the same room late at night.

703
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,080
It’s inappropriate.

704
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,840
Go out.

705
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:50,000
Well, if Your Grace says so.

706
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:51,800
Remember to keep the fire burning.

707
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,439
I’ll go out then.

708
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,025
Your Grace.

709
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,719
Do you really not need me
to protect you in there?

710
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,919
No!

711
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,260
Li... Li Qian?

712
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,199
What’s that sound outside?

713
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,399
Are you sleeping?

714
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,679
Yes.

715
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,919
You can still talk to me in your sleep?

716
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,159
Well...

717
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,159
Don’t be afraid.

718
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,600
These wolves are in packs.

719
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:09,000
I’ll stay outside.

720
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,040
I’m no match for these wolves,

721
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,600
but I’m enough for them to eat.

722
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,879
Just stick to the fire
and don’t let it go out.

723
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,399
They won’t come near you.

724
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:24,719
Well,

725
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,959
it’s windy outside.

726
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,000
Why don’t you sleep inside?

727
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,199
Men and women should keep a distance
away from each other, right?

728
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
It doesn’t conform with ethics

729
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:38,679
for us to be in the same room.

730
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:42,760
Fine, Li Qian. Remember this.

731
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:46,840
