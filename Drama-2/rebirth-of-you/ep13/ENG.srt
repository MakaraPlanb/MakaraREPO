=Episode 13=

27
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,959
I heard from the servants

28
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,959
that Madam He is from a humble family.

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,360
When Master was in dire straits,

30
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,000
he remarried her
after his first wife died.

31
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,520
Later, the Li Family became rich.

32
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,199
But Madam He is still

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,720
covetous of small gains.

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,399
The dowry you brought here

35
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,880
is a tempting bait to them.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,800
Everyone wants to pocket it,

37
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,080
not to mention Madam He.

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,759
Don’t worry.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,119
She can’t pocket it.

40
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,440
But Duchess and Young Master

41
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,199
have left for the capital city.

42
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,759
Even if you want help from them,

43
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,000
it’ll be too late.

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,160
My father-in-law is sensible.

45
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,759
He won’t defame himself

46
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,000
for my dowry.

47
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,360
Besides,

48
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,199
Bingzhou is a small town.

49
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,880
When something happens,

50
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,399
neighbors will all know it.

51
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,039
He’s the master of the family.

52
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,320
He won’t let his wife
do such a stupid thing.

53
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,520
What do we do, Your Grace?

54
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,440
I heard my father-in-law
likes antiques and paintings.

55
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,960
Go get the unlisted ones

56
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,679
from my dowry.

57
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,320
Tell him Mother-in-law
has taken away some presents,

58
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,360
and I should also give him some.

59
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,839
Your Grace, I’ll go make a list

60
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,039
of the antiques and paintings

61
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,240
and give them to Master.

62
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,110
What’s wrong? You freaked me out.

63
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,210
My things are broken.

64
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:28,759
What’s this?

65
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,759
She’s clever.

66
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,440
She brought us

67
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,800
all the unlisted antiques and paintings.

68
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,039
That’s good.

69
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,240
He Cuihua!

70
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,559
I can’t believe
I have such a silly wife like you.

71
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,479
You even cast greedy eyes

72
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,320
on my daughter-in-law’s dowry.

73
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,639
Are you going to disgrace my family?

74
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,279
Li Changqing,

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,919
how can you yell at me?

76
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,080
It’s all because of you.

77
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,479
You’ve spent much money

78
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,839
on that daughter-in-law.

79
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:56,039
Don’t you know it?

80
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,759
You keep saying

81
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,800
you’re doing everything

82
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,000
for the Li Family.

83
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,559
But have you thought about my feelings?

84
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,360
Have you considered Dongdong?

85
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,240
Tell me.

86
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,759
Now you’ve spent so much money.

87
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,399
What will you give Dongdong as dowries

88
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:09,559
when she gets married?

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,960
Stop talking nonsense.

90
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,839
Listen carefully.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,639
Give everything
that belongs to Her Grace

92
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,640
back to her.

93
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,679
- I won’t.
- Otherwise,

94
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,100
I’ll write a divorce paper immediately

95
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,119
to divorce you.

96
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,079
Awesome, Li Changqing.

97
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,279
We’ve been married for twenty years.

98
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,600
How many times have you said so?

99
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,559
If you don’t write one,

100
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,160
I’ll write it before you.

101
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,399
Uncle Li.

102
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,285
Mm.

103
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:35,640
Fine.

104
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,079
Madam,

105
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,920
what happened?

106
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,399
Don’t mention it.

107
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,359
It’s still because of Li Changqing.

108
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,359
He keeps talking about divorcing me.

109
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,320
I don’t think I can live like that.

110
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,760
What happened?

111
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,559
Why did Uncle Li want to divorce you?

112
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,880
It’s all because of that Princess.

113
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,679
I didn’t do anything wrong,

114
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,679
but just picked a few things

115
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,359
I like

116
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,440
from her jewelries.

117
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,679
But Li Changqing

118
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,839
slagged me off

119
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,359
indiscriminately.

120
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,519
What a life I’m living!

121
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:15,799
Who did I do this for?

122
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:17,279
For myself?

123
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,670
But how did Uncle Li know that?

124
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,239
She gave him those things.

125
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,279
Look.

126
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,519
She gave unlisted antiques and paintings

127
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,839
to flatter him.

128
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,399
If he doesn’t want them,

129
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,000
I’d like to keep them.

130
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,239
What’s wrong with me?

131
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,760
But,

132
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:35,075
without this list,

133
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,920
Uncle Li wouldn’t have known it.

134
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,840
You make sense.

135
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,119
Looks like

136
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,725
the Princess is quite shrewd.

137
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,799
Miaorong, come.

138
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,359
She just married,

139
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,959
but she gave a head-on blow at me.

140
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:56,679
I’ll show her

141
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,959
who is the real hostess of this family.

142
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,640
Madam,

143
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,160
have some tea and calm down.

144
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,000
Think about it.

145
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,040
Uncle Li is a man.

146
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,559
He doesn’t care about such trifles.

147
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,200
Commandery Princess Jia’nan
is a noble lady.

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,600
Since she married Young Master,

149
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,581
she didn’t complain about anything.

150
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,475
Am I right?

151
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:20,154
But look at you.

152
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,839
In case of any problem,

153
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,356
you make a scene like this.

154
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,040
All men will get fed up.

155
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,826
Then you’ll be unreasonable,
regardless of the truth.

156
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,799
Yeah, Miaorong.

157
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,900
You’re right.

158
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,679
Looks like

159
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,399
I have to behave carefully.

160
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,880
Or how will I deal
with such a cunning girl?

161
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,040
Right.

162
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,501
Have a try.

163
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:45,850
Mm.

164
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,079
Young Master, Your Grace.

165
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,279
What’s the matter?

166
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,920
Master sent me to ask

167
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,079
what Your Grace would like for dinner

168
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,279
so that the kitchen could get ready.

169
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,160
Aren’t we supposed to have dinner

170
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,760
in the East Courtyard today?

171
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,389
By the way, Baoning,

172
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,239
Father said

173
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,679
we always had visitors for meals

174
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:02,040
since we got married.

175
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,679
Today, they just saw off
my uncle from Yundong.

176
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,519
Today,

177
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,399
we can finally have dinner alone

178
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,959
and have a private talk.

179
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:11,519
Madam said she didn’t feel well today

180
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,880
and she wouldn’t have dinner.

181
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,359
Tell the cooks

182
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,320
to make a small dinner for us.

183
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:19,154
Yes.

184
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,679
What’s on your mind?

185
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,359
The other day, I gave Father
some antiques and paintings.

186
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,839
You knew that, didn’t you?

187
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:41,400
Mm.

188
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,880
My mother is

189
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:45,839
covetous of small gains.

190
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,920
She shouldn’t have embezzled your dowry.

191
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:50,440
It made sense when you reminded her.

192
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,119
She’s very likely to be angry.

193
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,720
It doesn’t matter.

194
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,160
She’ll be all right soon.

195
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,839
Come on.

196
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,720
- Come on.
- Listen.

197
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,359
I’m unfamiliar with Bingzhou.

198
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,279
Could you

199
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:06,760
buy some presents for Mother
on my behalf?

200
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,720
Yes, Your Grace.

201
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,831
Smile.

202
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,875
(Unifon)

203
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:20,500
Come and look at the pendants.

204
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,775
Sachets for sale.

205
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:22,350
There you are.

206
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,239
Looks good.

207
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,559
Miss, come and have a look.

208
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,559
What’s this place? It’s bustling.

209
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:28,440
Young Master,

210
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,000
I heard the Unifon

211
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,479
offers face-washing cream
to the Imperial Family every year.

212
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,679
Shall we get in and have a look?

213
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:36,249
Let’s go over there.

214
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,250
Sugar-coated haws!

215
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:39,375
I’ll take this.

216
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,039
(Unifon)

217
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,525
- Young Masters, come on in.
- Just take my advice.

218
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Have a try.

219
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
Try it.

220
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:45,760
Shopkeeper,

221
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,400
show us your face-washing cream

222
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
for the Imperial Family.

223
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,239
Sorry, we don’t sell what is offered
for the Imperial Family.

224
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,719
How about this?

225
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:52,599
It’s also great.

226
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,359
Dongqing,

227
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:54,599
let me talk to them.

228
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,039
Young Master,

229
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,200
our face-washing cream

230
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,799
is smooth mud

231
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,320
made of natural hydromica

232
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,239
through elutriation
after being subsided and filtered

233
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,159
over 180 days.

234
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,520
We don’t have many after paying tribute.

235
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,599
Normally, it’s not for sale.

236
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,119
But now that you want it, Mr. Li,

237
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,440
we’ll certainly give it to you.

238
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,799
Dongqing, go get two new jars.

239
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,539
How do you know who I am?

240
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,840
Commandant Li is
the official of Bingzhou.

241
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,039
You’re also an extraordinary man.

242
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:31,359
Look, our Dong’s Trading House

243
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,320
is the biggest firm in Bingzhou.

244
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,280
If we don’t even recognize you,

245
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,640
how can we serve the Imperial Family

246
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,599
and do business well over decades?

247
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,799
Dong’s Trading House.

248
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,359
I’ve heard a lot about it.

249
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:43,919
Fine, then.

250
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,799
Thank you for this.

251
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,479
See you, Young Master.

252
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:53,825
(Li’s Mansion)

253
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,159
Shouldn’t you have a feast?

254
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,359
Why are you back so early?

255
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,280
I missed you,

256
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,479
so I came back in advance.

257
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:01,479
Come on.

258
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,799
This is a present for you.

259
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,080
Open it and take a look.

260
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,880
Let me see.

261
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,775
(Banknote)

262
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:14,072
(Title Deed)

263
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,119
This?

264
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,280
Why?

265
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,000
Come on.

266
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
Can’t you see?

267
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,239
So many banknotes and title deeds.

268
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Can’t you see any?

269
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,799
But,

270
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,239
nobody gives banknotes and title deeds

271
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,640
as a present.

272
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,159
This is all my property.

273
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,080
You know what?

274
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,840
Now I have nothing left.

275
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,080
Don’t dislike me.

276
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:41,520
I don’t have high demands.

277
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,640
Only if I can make a living

278
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,239
and be with you every day,

279
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,719
I’ll be contented.

280
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,400
Fine. I get it.

281
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,281
I approve.

282
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,360
Baoning.

283
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,950
Mm?

284
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,479
You have to

285
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:59,119
face some disputes you didn’t need to.

286
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,880
I’m sorry for that.

287
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,760
Money doesn’t matter.

288
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,880
How can I have disputes

289
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,000
with your mother for money?

290
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,520
She isn’t your biological mother.

291
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,479
But she brought you up.
You should repay her.

292
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,919
Besides, we’re a couple now.

293
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,559
Not only are we married,

294
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,080
but our families also unite.

295
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,400
Your families are my families, too.

296
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,640
I’ll be tolerant with them.

297
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:27,924
Baoning.

298
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,640
It’s so brilliant.

299
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,760
Let me check.

300
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,499
You fixed it?

301
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,940
It’s hard to fix it?

302
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:45,960
It was made

303
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,520
by my biological mother.

304
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,640
I was naughty when I was young

305
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,721
and I accidentally broke it.

306
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,000
But it’s what my mother left.

307
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,159
I never want to throw it away.

308
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,559
Your mother was clever
and nimble-fingered.

309
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,440
She was quite an amazing girl.

310
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,960
You fixed it.
You’re nimble-fingered, too.

311
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:17,440
Come and have a look.

312
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,000
Sachets for sale.

313
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,919
Come and have a look.

314
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,025
Here, Young Master.

315
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:23,650
Enjoy it.

316
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,359
Come on. Let me feed you.

317
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,159
Come on.

318
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,880
Be careful. Be careful.

319
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,159
What a naughty girl!

320
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:38,159
Come to me.

321
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,640
Are you all right, Young Master?

322
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,840
- Are you all right?
- I’m all right.

323
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,119
- Come on, Young Master.
- Drink.

324
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:46,280
Come on. Drink some.

325
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,599
Here.

326
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:50,200
Drink some.

327
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,159
Young Master.

328
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,799
Young Master.

329
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,559
What...?

330
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,479
Baoning?

331
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,679
- Young Master.
- Baoning.

332
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,599
At last, Baoning.

333
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,960
I knew you wouldn’t leave me.

334
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,239
- Young Master.
- Baoning.

335
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,760
Under the command of His Highness,

336
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,200
I’m taking you back home.

337
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,119
All right.

338
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:09,760
I listen to you, Baoning.

339
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,919
Look at yourself!

340
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,440
What are you doing?

341
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,200
You’re making yourself so awkward

342
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:33,960
for merely a girl?

343
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,760
You’re my son.

344
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:40,880
Do you know the responsibility you bear?

345
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,440
Responsibility?

346
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:47,559
When I can’t even protect
my beloved girl,

347
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,359
what responsibility can I bear?

348
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,239
You!

349
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,919
Son,

350
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,479
there are so many girls in the world.

351
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,479
You’re rich, handsome, and talented.

352
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,039
You can marry any girl you want.

353
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,719
Even if I get married, so what?

354
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,960
Let her die lonely

355
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,039
and let my son lose his mother,

356
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,520
like what you did to my mother?

357
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:28,320
Stop talking about your mother!

358
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,320
You’re my son, a marquis’s son.

359
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,799
You should fight on the battlefield

360
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,400
and make contributions.

361
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:36,359
But you’re totally stuck in love

362
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:38,400
and give up all confidence in yourself.

363
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,880
When can a man like you

364
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:43,400
do a great cause?

365
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,000
I never care about any great cause.

366
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:51,080
All I want

367
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,400
is the happiness of a family union
that I’ve never had before.

368
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,840
All I know is that

369
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,880
if you hadn’t interfered,

370
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,039
Baoning wouldn’t have
married someone else!

371
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,080
Ridiculous!

372
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:06,280
Why can’t you understand

373
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,119
what I’ve planned for you?

374
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,880
When you’re successful,

375
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,239
you can get whatever you want!

376
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,880
What a worthless boy!

377
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,559
Why do I have

378
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,599
such a useless son like you?

379
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:28,640
Stop!

380
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Where are you going?

381
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,799
I’m going to request His Majesty

382
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,880
to transfer me
to Jinxi Border Battalion.

383
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,679
I’ll go there immediately!

384
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,309
You!

385
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,400
(Pharmacy)
My Lady, you have a stomach ache

386
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,080
because of the coldness in your body.

387
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,640
I’ll write a prescription for you.

388
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,359
When you’re back,

389
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,640
take it by dose.

390
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,440
However...

391
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,799
Feel free to say it, doctor.

392
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:19,375
Mm.

393
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,280
And ginseng.

394
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,400
You have cold hands

395
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,679
and shallow sleep.

396
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,880
Your pulse isn’t weak.

397
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,479
It’s an intermittent pulse.

398
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,440
It means you have
a more serious coldness problem

399
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,320
than ordinary girls do.

400
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,685
If you want to have a baby,

401
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,159
I’m afraid

402
00:16:37,725 --> 00:16:38,700
it’s not that easy.

403
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,840
Don’t talk nonsense, doctor.

404
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,679
Her Ladyship is still young.

405
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,520
How can she be infertile?

406
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,200
My Lady, don’t trust him.

407
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,725
He...

408
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:50,375
Wendie.

409
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:54,880
Doctor,

410
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,599
can I recover

411
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,880
from this problem?

412
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,359
I’m afraid

413
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,679
ordinary prescriptions
won’t work on you.

414
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,680
But,

415
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,640
I know an ancient prescription.

416
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:09,056
It may work.

417
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,079
If you use it,

418
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,439
the medicine will go through
your skin and into your internal organs

419
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,079
in the medicated bath.

420
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:18,319
You’ll suffer and be exhausted.

421
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,359
Make your decision
after thinking carefully.

422
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,855
Don’t be in a rush.

423
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,560
Thank you, doctor.

424
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:31,040
Roll. Roll.

425
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:32,199
Roll.

426
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,479
Roll.

427
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,400
Roll.

428
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:38,239
(Pharmacy)

429
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,040
Is it quick? Is it?

430
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,000
Is it rolling quickly?

431
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,200
(Baiyao Pharmacy)

432
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,032
Wow.

433
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,280
Su.

434
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,439
Here.

435
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,359
Boy, enjoy it yourself.

436
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,925
Mm.

437
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:56,000
How are you, Su?

438
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,239
What did the doctor say?

439
00:17:58,175 --> 00:17:59,175
No big problem.

440
00:17:59,175 --> 00:17:59,880
See you.

441
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,640
The doctor wrote a prescription for me.

442
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,850
Pendants.

443
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,400
I’m sure it’s because

444
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:05,640
you have been gluttonous

445
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,880
and eaten too much cold food.

446
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,560
From this day on,

447
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,040
I won’t let you eat any unhealthy food.

448
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,599
I know.

449
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,760
I thought you would be bored

450
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,000
when waiting for me.

451
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,800
Unexpectedly,

452
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,119
you had fun with the boy.

453
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:20,520
I saw that boy playing alone

454
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,000
and then I played with him.

455
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,088
Pendants.

456
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,800
Come and have a look.

457
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,560
Su.

458
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,160
There we are.

459
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,199
Get in the carriage.

460
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:29,800
Mm.

461
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,040
Let’s go.

462
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,375
(Qinzheng Hall)

463
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,220
Have some tea, Your Majesty.

464
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:45,514
Your Majesty.

465
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

466
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,599
Take her away

467
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,160
and club her to death.

468
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,520
Help me, Your Majesty!

469
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,640
Han Tongxin!

470
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,560
Help me!

471
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,040
What are you doing? Rebelling?

472
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,599
Your Majesty,

473
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,479
she tried to seduce you.

474
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:19,719
She dared to flirt with you
in such a serious place.

475
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,599
I’m the Empress.

476
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,280
Can’t I punish her?

477
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,400
What are you waiting for?

478
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:26,640
Take her away and club her.

479
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,000
Spare me, Your Highness!

480
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,239
Help me, Your Majesty!

481
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:30,280
- And you...
- Help me, Your Majesty!

482
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,319
Get out!

483
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,439
Your Majesty.

484
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,400
Help me, Your Majesty!

485
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,920
Han Tongxin,

486
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,239
are you so sure

487
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,239
that I don’t dare to dethrone you?

488
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,920
Dethrone me?

489
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,199
Your Majesty,

490
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,599
are you really so merciless to me?

491
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,320
The Empress’s Seal...

492
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:01,016
I gave it to you.

493
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,479
I’ve also given you

494
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,439
the glory of the Empress

495
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,839
and everything that belongs to you.

496
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,560
What else do you want?

497
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:14,205
Your Majesty,

498
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,520
can’t you see what I want?

499
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,219
From the very beginning,

500
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,331
all I want is your love for me.

501
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:28,964
Do you like me

502
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:31,710
or do you like

503
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
the power I give you?

504
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,800
So, you’d rather get a maid

505
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,719
who looks like Jiang Baoning

506
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:44,959
to serve you

507
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:47,719
than pay any attention to me?

508
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,479
You like Jiang Baoning.

509
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:57,000
But does she like you?

510
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,319
She prefers to marry Li Qian

511
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,400
rather than marry you.

512
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,119
What kind of an emperor are you?

513
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:03,918
You!

514
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,621
Get out!

515
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:21,085
Get out of here!

516
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:24,325
I don’t want to see you.

517
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

518
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,040
What brings you here?

519
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,239
Your Majesty,

520
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,199
I came today,

521
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,066
to ask for an imperial edict.

522
00:22:02,675 --> 00:22:03,715
What imperial edict?

523
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:07,255
Yongqing State casts a greedy eye
on our state.

524
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,350
I’ve enjoyed imperial favor for years,

525
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:10,855
but haven’t made any contribution.

526
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,730
I feel guilty about it.

527
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,520
In case of the invasion,

528
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,446
I request to be transferred to Jinxi

529
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,120
to defend our state

530
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:19,465
with my power.

531
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,150
You want to go to Jinxi?

532
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:27,891
Yes.

533
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,850
Do you know
Commandery Princess Jia’nan is there?

534
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,251
Your Majesty,

535
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:36,160
Her Grace is innocent.

536
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:37,254
She’s born to be a pure girl.

537
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:38,880
I think

538
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,314
she married Li Qian

539
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,989
because she was deceived.

540
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,330
If she can get sensible in time,

541
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,190
I’ll bring her back to the capital city,

542
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:48,636
at whatever cost.

543
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,079
Are you serious?

544
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,959
I will convince Her Grace

545
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,859
to see through the cunning Li Qian

546
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,975
and bring her back.

547
00:22:59,300 --> 00:22:59,975
All right.

548
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,119
I approve of your request.

549
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,055
Besides,

550
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,319
when you’re in Jinxi,

551
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,560
announce an imperial edict for me.

552
00:23:09,075 --> 00:23:09,876
Yes.

553
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:14,950
Darling.

554
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,680
I’m leaving, then.

555
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,500
Mm.

556
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,560
Wendie.

557
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,000
Go tell Doctor Wang

558
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,319
that I’ll use the ancient prescription

559
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:34,880
and ask him
to prepare the medicine for me.

560
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,199
My Lady,

561
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,520
the doctor said

562
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,880
once you use it,

563
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,680
you would suffer a lot.

564
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,199
Are you sure you’ll use it?

565
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,040
My husband likes children.

566
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,599
I want to have children
for the Cao Family.

567
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,959
No matter what I have to suffer,
I’ll have a try.

568
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
One more bucket.

569
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,400
Yes, My Lady.

570
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,479
My Lady.

571
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:24,079
Don’t worry.

572
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,920
I can hold on.

573
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,439
Come on, Su.

574
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,839
Have this.

575
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,915
Su, you’re not feeling well?

576
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,760
What’s wrong?

577
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,959
Nothing.

578
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,319
Maybe I caught a cold last night.

579
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,319
After some sleep, I’ll be fine.

580
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:57,119
Wendie.

581
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,160
Get her back for some sleep.

582
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,199
Yes.

583
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,319
Xuan,

584
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,599
prepare some digestible food

585
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:10,160
and bring it to Su.

586
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:11,280
All right.

587
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:14,079
Wendie, leave us.

588
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,640
Yes, Young Master.

589
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,040
Su,

590
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,800
are you keeping something from me?

591
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,599
Don’t guess.

592
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,800
I just caught a cold.

593
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,959
If you just caught a cold,

594
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,560
why do you have the marks

595
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:35,800
on your arms?

596
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,119
Also, how can you explain

597
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,719
the smell of herbs on you lately?

598
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,839
Actually,

599
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:47,439
the doctor said

600
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,760
I had a coldness problem.

601
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,239
I’m afraid

602
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,040
I can hardly have a baby.

603
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
He gave me a prescription
for the medical bath.

604
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:59,800
There are marks on my arms

605
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,160
because the coldness comes out.

606
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,719
They’ll be gone soon.

607
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,239
Don’t worry.

608
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,959
You have a coldness problem.

609
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:10,920
But why did you say
you had a stomach ache?

610
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,520
Also,

611
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,079
what prescription are you using?

612
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,119
It makes you so exhausted.

613
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,239
I have to suffer
when I use the prescription.

614
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,040
But as long as I can have babies,

615
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,719
this isn’t a big deal.

616
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,439
Whether we have babies or not

617
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:31,800
doesn’t matter.

618
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:35,239
Even if we have to live alone

619
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,400
for the rest of our lives,

620
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:37,839
it’s not bad.

621
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,760
Su,

622
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,439
I don’t want you to suffer for me.

623
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,359
But I know you love children.

624
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,719
I want to have children for this family.

625
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,719
Su,

626
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,560
in my heart,

627
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,239
you’re more important than children.

628
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:08,575
(Li’s Mansion)

629
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,199
(Bamboo Sways in Wind)
At the behest of His Majesty,

630
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,119
Li Qian, son of Commandant Li
of Bingzhou

631
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:19,040
is intelligent
and has made contributions.

632
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,319
His Majesty is quite contented.

633
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,359
Li Qian married
Commandery Princess Jia’nan

634
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:24,479
and became the Commandery Prince.

635
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,599
After the discussion
in the Ministry of Personnel,

636
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,479
he’s recommended to Supervisorate
of Community Self-defense

637
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:33,079
and will take his post
in the Border Battalion in three days.

638
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,520
Respect this.

639
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,640
The Border Battalion

640
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,280
is the first line of defense
of our stable state.

641
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,959
His Majesty thinks highly
of the Li Family.

642
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:48,239
So, he gave such an important post

643
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,560
to Li Qian.

644
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,760
I’ve taken over my job, too,

645
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,079
and I’m going to Border Battalion.

646
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,400
So, I came to announce this.

647
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,119
Li Qian,

648
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,400
take it.

649
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,239
Gratitude to His Majesty.

650
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,920
Gratitude to His Majesty.

651
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,959
You came all the way here

652
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,000
and you must be tired.

653
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,760
Would you like some hot tea
to warm yourself up?

654
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:25,119
Thank you, Commandant Li.

655
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,640
Your Grace.

656
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:30,800
His Majesty wants to know

657
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,479
if everything is going on well with you.

658
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,760
My grandmother must have missed me

659
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:40,199
and kept talking about me
in front of His Majesty.

660
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,880
His Majesty always cares for her.

661
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,280
Thank you, Young Master.

662
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:45,800
I’ll go write a letter to my grandmother

663
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,119
and let her no longer worry about me.

664
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:52,880
Let’s go.

665
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,319
Guanju.

666
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,050
Mm.

667
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:56,760
Go keep a close eye

668
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
on Master Zhao Xiao
and Commandery Princess.

669
00:28:59,119 --> 00:28:59,880
Yes.

670
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:14,530
Father.

671
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,025
Mm.

672
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,680
What does His Majesty mean?

673
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,599
Shortly after you married Her Grace,

674
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,760
he sent you to the Border Battalion.

675
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,079
Isn’t he driving a wedge between you?

676
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,959
I heard that

677
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,000
before Her Grace got married,

678
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:36,400
the Grand Empress Dowager

679
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,800
wanted her to be the Empress.

680
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,640
Father.

681
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,040
Baoning is my wife now.

682
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:46,599
If His Majesty thinks
you took away his girl,

683
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:48,119
do you think

684
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,760
you still have a chance
to be successful?

685
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:51,800
Besides,

686
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,479
what a place is the Border Battalion?

687
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,119
People may die at any time there.

688
00:29:57,325 --> 00:29:58,366
Why did His Majesty

689
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,520
make such a decision?

690
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,199
Isn’t that obvious?

691
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,319
Even if His Majesty didn’t transfer me
to the Border Battalion,

692
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,239
I would also request it.

693
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:10,199
I don’t want to take an unimportant job

694
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,680
in Bingzhou for your sake

695
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,000
or for my title
as the Commandery Prince.

696
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,439
Qian,

697
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,839
you’re my great son.

698
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,479
Like father, like son.

699
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,239
I expect you
to make greater contributions

700
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,239
than me.

701
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,000
Father, don’t worry.

702
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:34,959
The Border Battalion

703
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,800
is the outpost against Yongqing State.

704
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,439
I can take this chance

705
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,920
to investigate the massacre
of the Li Village.

706
00:30:42,225 --> 00:30:42,825
Mm.

707
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:47,520
I’m no longer as valiant
as I was at a young age.

708
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,079
But I hold the sword,

709
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:51,719
I still can kill

710
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,280
hundreds of Yongqing soldiers.

711
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,199
Qian, work hard

712
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,920
and fight for our family.

713
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:00,199
As for all the other things,

714
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
I will take care of them

715
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,280
for you.

716
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,400
Yes.

717
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:16,920
Come, please.

718
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,359
What...?

719
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,199
What’s going on?

720
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:24,280

00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:25,325
♪Play the zither and hear the song♪

756
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:27,925
♪Who is as beautiful as a painting♪

757
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:33,500
Father.

758
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,050
Mm.

759
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:34,575
Mother.

760
00:33:34,575 --> 00:33:35,150
Mm.

761
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:46,079
I’m leaving, then.

762
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:48,525
Mm.

763
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:53,900
Father.

764
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:54,560
Mm.

765
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,400
I’m leaving.

766
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,640
All right.

767
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,920
Be very careful on your way.

768
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,450
Mm.

769
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:02,450
Mm.

770
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,360
Your Grace!

771
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,239
Seriously?

772
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,919
Li Qian only left for two days,
but I’m missing him now.

773
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,360
I told you,

774
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Her Grace is weak

775
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,560
and she can’t stand anything
with a strong smell.

776
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,600
But look.

777
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,959
These maids

778
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,080
moved the flowers here
early this morning.

779
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,000
Nanny Tian,

780
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,959
they are all under you.

781
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,879
They’re insensible.

782
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,399
Are you insensible, too?

783
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,800
I wondered

784
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,159
what had annoyed you so much.

785
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,840
It’s just about some flowers.

786
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:36,879
If Her Grace doesn’t like them,

787
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:39,280
I’ll have them moved away.

788
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:40,800
Stop standing there.

789
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:43,159
Move them away.

790
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,120
Miss Qingke, don’t be angry.

791
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:52,199
There are so many masters and ladies.

792
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,120
Sometimes, we’re too busy

793
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:56,560
to take good care of everything.

794
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,639
The spring is coming.

795
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,520
We meant to bring some colors
to the yard.

796
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,719
Now that you don’t like them,

797
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:06,399
I shouldn’t have cared for you, then.

798
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,719
You!

799
00:36:14,075 --> 00:36:15,320
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)
What happened?

800
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,280
You and Mr. Li are newly married.

801
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,080
It’s the perfect timing for you
to get closer.

802
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,760
I didn’t want to upset you

803
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,959
with such a trouble.

804
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,239
But the servants here are so annoying.

805
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:26,280
They’re forgetful

806
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:27,399
and do things carelessly.

807
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,679
They don’t take our orders seriously

808
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,760
and always forget them soon.

809
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,560
I wonder how they’ve been managing

810
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,879
such a big mansion.

811
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,560
No wonder as long as you came,

812
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,760
Master asked Madam He
to hand over the household duties.

813
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,639
Qingke,

814
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,399
it’s all right when you say this to me.

815
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,679
But don’t let others hear you.

816
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:46,600
Mm.

817
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,719
We’ve just come

818
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:49,560
and we know little about the situation.

819
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,679
Before we control the overall situation,

820
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,199
we’d better wait and see

821
00:36:53,275 --> 00:36:54,396
and don’t be impatient.

822
00:36:54,475 --> 00:36:55,075
Mm.

823
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,479
As for the mansion,

824
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,199
keep an eye on everyone.

825
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,840
But don’t quarrel with them.

826
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,840
Write down their mistakes, instead.

827
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,959
Yes.

828
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,600
Mm.

829
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,520
I’ve been working here
for a dozen years.

830
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:11,159
Even Master or Madam
hasn’t criticized me like that.

831
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:13,360
She’s a mere girl.

832
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,600
Why could she clamor at me?

833
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,360
Even if she works for Her Grace,

834
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,959
she’s still a maid, isn’t she?

835
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,479
I’m getting old

836
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,000
and I start to annoy people.

837
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,239
Nanny Tian, don’t say that.

838
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:30,199
Since the mansion was built,

839
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,879
you’ve been working here.

840
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,719
You’ve not made great contributions.

841
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,439
But you’re a senior at last.

842
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,120
Even Master and Madam

843
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,959
care for your feelings

844
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,719
for the sake of the old days.

845
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,199
It’s sensible of you, Miss Miaorong.

846
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:52,479
Before Her Grace came,

847
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,879
we all thought

848
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,959
you would be the eldest daughter-in-law.

849
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,439
Unexpectedly,

850
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:02,639
Young Master married
a Commandery Princess.

851
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,040
Her Grace is from the Imperial Family.

852
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,239
She’s been spoilt since she was born.

853
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,399
As time goes,

854
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,399
Young Master will have a lot to suffer.

855
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,280
Nanny Tian,

856
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,399
this is the money for this month.

857
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,350
Keep it carefully.

858
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:25,050
Mm.

859
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,150
(Border Battalion)

860
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,700
- Jin Xiao.
- Li.

861
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,479
There you are.

862
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:01,239
What has happened

863
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:02,399
on the border lately?

864
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,080
There’s no family relation in the army.

865
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,600
Don’t contradict your father

866
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,800
like you usually do.

867
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:07,800
I know.

868
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:08,919
But Zhao Xiao

869
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,199
has just taken office today.

870
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:11,399
If you hear something,

871
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,800
don’t be angry.

872
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,000
Feel free to tell me.

873
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,239
It’s no big deal, understand?

874
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
Yes, Master.

875
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
Remember that.

876
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,879
I came to take office,
under the command of His Majesty.

877
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,080
Greetings, Mr. Jin.

878
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,100
Mm.

879
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,320
His Majesty is far-sighted

880
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:32,800
and uses subordinates wisely.

881
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,520
He picked you from thousands of men

882
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,080
because he trusts you
and thinks highly of you.

883
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,239
Work hard

884
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,280
and don’t let His Majesty down.

885
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,879
I understand.

886
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:47,560
You must have known Master Zhao Xiao.

887
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,639
He’s the duty regent
His Majesty designated.

888
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:53,399
He’ll be your superior.

889
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,879
I’ll leave Supervisor Li to you.

890
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:58,000
I know.

891
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,520
Let me take you to the drill ground

892
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,959
and meet soldiers of Huben Battalion.

893
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:04,719
Li Qian,

894
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,320
as long as I’m here,

895
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:08,080
you’ll never be successful.

896
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:19,879
I’m afraid

897
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,879
Master Zhao Xiao
holds an unfriendly intent.

898
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,479
Your Grace,

899
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,639
we’ve been shopping for a while.
Time to go back home.

900
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,159
Qingke, catch up.

901
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:33,800
Hot steamed stuffed buns.

902
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,560
Come and have a look.

903
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,040
- Your Grace.
- Come and have a look.

904
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,399
Hot steamed stuffed buns.

905
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:41,520
Sachets.

906
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,150
Bamboo hats.

907
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,025
Miss, come and have a look.

908
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,350
Bamboo hats. Bamboo hats for sale.

909
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,171
This is all you have?

910
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,600
Make way, please.

911
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,000
Make way.

912
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,879
Make way, please.

913
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,000
Baoning.

914
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,639
What a coincidence!

915
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,080
Young Master, why are you here?

916
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,919
I came to the government office
for the report of military affairs.

917
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,919
Then I’m taking a walk
in my spare time.

918
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,919
Baoning,

919
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,280
I’m new here.

920
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:15,959
I work in the army.

921
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:17,639
But I’m unfamiliar with this place.

922
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:20,520
How about showing me around?

923
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,360
I’d love to.

924
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,225
- But I just came here, didn’t I?
- Come and have a look.

925
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:27,000
Come on.

926
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:29,120
- When my husband has a day off,
- Have a look.

927
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,120
- shall we show you around together?
- Sachets.

928
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:33,930
I forgot Supervisor Li.

929
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,725
Sachets for sale.

930
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,040
When you got married,

931
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,280
I didn’t go to your wedding.
I quite regret it.

932
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,221
Sachets.

933
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,425
Come and have a look.

934
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:44,919
This jade pendant...

935
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,280
I’ve been taking it
as an amulet since little.

936
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,520
I’m giving it to you

937
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,879
as a wedding present.

938
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:54,120
No, thanks. It’s too precious.

939
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,360
Your Grace!

940
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,159
Qingke.

941
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,120
- Your Grace!
- What?

942
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,350
Zhao... Zhao Xiao.

943
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,175
Bamboo hats.

944
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,199
Your Grace, I was looking for you!

945
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,040
Let’s go.

946
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,399
Miss.

947
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,450
All right. Go.

948
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,050
Let’s go.

949
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:13,625
Fine.

950
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:15,950
Go.

951
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,600
It still doesn’t work.

952
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,959
What are you reading?

953
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,360
The Book of Supreme Weapons.

954
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,520
What?

955
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:46,800
It sounds brilliant, doesn’t it?

956
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,399
This book looks quite old.

957
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,325
Mm.

958
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,439
I’ve been working on it for days.

959
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,199
But I’ve achieved nothing.

960
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,520
Would you like some sweet soup?

961
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,280
Forget it.

962
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,719
Take it away. I have no appetite.

963
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,080
Give it to me.

964
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,800
Take it...

965
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,719
Why is it you?

966
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,080
I came back to see you
on my way to some military business.

967
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:26,239
I’m going back to work in one hour.

968
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,840
What’s wrong?

969
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,000
You don’t want me to leave?

970
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:32,075
Mm.

971
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,320
All right. All right.

972
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,000
I miss you so much.

973
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:38,320
If anyone bullies you,

974
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,201
write to me.

975
00:44:39,201 --> 00:44:39,719
Mm.

976
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:40,875
I’ll be back immediately.

977
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:41,425
Mm.

978
00:44:51,879 --> 00:44:52,800
I’ll take this away.

979
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:54,520
It has your scent on it.

980
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,600
When I miss you at work,

981
00:44:56,919 --> 00:44:58,000
I can look at it.

982
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,000
I do poor needlework.

983
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,520
This one isn’t made by me, either.

984
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,040
It doesn’t matter. I like it.

985
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,360
Keep it very carefully.

986
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,479
Don’t let anyone else steal it.

987
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,320
I’m leaving.

988
00:45:28,575 --> 00:45:29,150
Mm.

989
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,000
One.

990
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,399
Two.

991
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:55,479
Three.

992
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:57,879
Four.

993
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:00,159
One.

994
00:46:01,479 --> 00:46:02,199
Two.

995
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,639
Three.

996
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:06,959
Four.

997
00:46:11,919 --> 00:46:12,840
Supervisor Li,

998
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,399
you do excellent martial arts

999
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:16,800
among these soldiers.

1000
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:18,040
Fall out.

1001
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:20,320
Let’s have a close duel

1002
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,199
like we did in Xuanjia Battalion.

1003
00:46:26,879 --> 00:46:27,679
Come on.

1004
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,600
Supervisor.

1005
00:46:32,425 --> 00:46:32,975
Here.

1006
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,919
Huben Battalion,

1007
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,239
we haven’t competed yet.

1008
00:46:48,399 --> 00:46:49,560
How about a competition?

1009
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:12,560
What did you think you were doing?

1010
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,159
This is a military camp.

1011
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:15,520
In the army,

1012
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:17,679
you’re respected leaders.

1013
00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:20,800
But you started
an internal conflict first.

1014
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,879
If others know about it,

1015
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:24,439
I’ll be too disgraced

1016
00:47:24,479 --> 00:47:27,800
to command the Border Battalion!

1017
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,800
Mr. Jin, I failed
to restrain my subordinates.

1018
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,919
His Majesty sent you, Young Master.

1019
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,760
It’s not your fault.

1020
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:39,280
Marquis Jinghai is strict

1021
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,879
and good at commanding troops.

1022
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,399
Young Master, you won’t behave

1023
00:47:43,399 --> 00:47:44,199
like such good-for-nothing men.

1024
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:44,879
Father!

1025
00:47:47,439 --> 00:47:50,080
Mr. Jin, why are you so assertive?

1026
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:52,000
They actually provoked Li Qian.

1027
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,360
Shut up!

1028
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,075
But...

1029
00:47:54,075 --> 00:47:55,439
Go sort out

1030
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:56,360
military tasks and documents.

1031
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,040
I...

1032
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,080
Go!

1033
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,959
Supervisor Li,

1034
00:48:06,439 --> 00:48:07,840
you’re the Commandery Prince.

1035
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,520
But you started all this.

1036
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,719
Mr. Jin,

1037
00:48:12,479 --> 00:48:14,000
I’ll take the punishment with others.

1038
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,719
It’s indeed sensible of you.

1039
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,159
Take them away.

1040
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,439
Report to the whole army

1041
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,439
that whoever was involved

1042
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,000
will be clubbed for 20 times

1043
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,560
and grounded for three days!

1044
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:38,520
Sorry. Sorry.

1045
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,560
I’ll be gentler.

1046
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,719
- I’ll be gentler.
- Sir,

1047
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:41,639
have some water and calm down.

1048
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:42,639
Have some water and calm down.

1049
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:46,199
Mr. Shao, calm down.

1050
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,080
Now that those poor soldiers
in Xuanjia Battalion defended him,

1051
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,120
why didn’t Mr. Jin and Mr. Zhao

1052
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,639
get him to Xuanjia Battalion directly?

1053
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:57,600
He’s at least the husband
of Commandery Princess Jia’nan

1054
00:48:58,399 --> 00:49:00,040
and the eldest lineal son
of the Li Family.

1055
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:02,840
How shall we deal with him, then?

1056
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,320
How to deal with him?

1057
00:49:24,825 --> 00:49:25,760
Shao Jiang,

1058
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,440
what does this mean?

1059
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,080
Under the command of Mr. Zhao,

1060
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:33,679
you’re moving to Xuanjia Battalion
from this day on.

1061
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,320
Mr. Shao,

1062
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,560
we must be careful with what we say.

1063
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:39,399
Everybody in our nation knows that

1064
00:49:39,399 --> 00:49:42,478
the Grand Empress Dowager cares
for Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

1065
00:49:42,975 --> 00:49:45,134
Supervisor Li is her husband.

1066
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,720
If we hurt him

1067
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,320
and he complains to Her Grace in bed,

1068
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:52,320
we’ll get in trouble.

1069
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,719
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That’s right.

1070
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,959
Why did I forget that?

1071
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,360
Now that you’ve married Her Grace,

1072
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,120
you’re now a nobleman.

1073
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,550
Yeah.

1074
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:04,525
Yeah.

1075
00:50:06,959 --> 00:50:08,199
In our Huben Battalion,

1076
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,879
all members

1077
00:50:09,879 --> 00:50:12,000
are from distinguished clans!

1078
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:13,600
What do you think you are?

1079
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,150
Yeah.

1080
00:50:15,439 --> 00:50:17,879
You think you have a higher position
by marrying Her Grace

1081
00:50:17,879 --> 00:50:20,478
and you’re no longer
from a bandit family?

1082
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:22,560
Why can you stay in Huben Battalion?

1083
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,639
You only deserve
to work in Xuanjia Battalion

1084
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,479
where there are only poor people.

1085
00:50:29,479 --> 00:50:31,679
Right. Go to Xuanjia Battalion.

1086
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:33,360
Yeah. Go to Xuanjia Battalion!

1087
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:44,550
Smells so good.

1088
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:47,639
I’ve never smelled this
from any other girls.

1089
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,639
Everyone can defend his state,
regardless of his family background.

1090
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:00,959
You shouldn’t slander or punch

1091
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:02,159
your fellow countrymen,

1092
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:04,040
but your enemies on the battlefield.

1093
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,399
Don’t make me
ask the Grand Empress Dowager

1094
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:06,719
to remove your father from office.

1095
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,479
Let go of me!

1096
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,879
When I let go of you,

1097
00:51:11,399 --> 00:51:12,439
you’d better shut up.

1098
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:13,879
Leave immediately

1099
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,520
with your men.

1100
00:51:15,959 --> 00:51:17,320
Yes. I will.

1101
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,040
Mr. Zhao.

1102
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,600
Li Qian hurt his fellow officer

1103
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,959
and he even threatened to kill me!

1104
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,040
Mr. Zhao.

1105
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,000
Who allowed you to steal his sachet?

1106
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,800
- Go away!
- Mr. Shao.

1107
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:34,959
Go.

1108
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:39,320
Let’s go.

1109
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,120
I don’t think

1110
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:41,800
you can keep staying

1111
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:43,760
in Huben Battalion.

1112
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,159
Go to Xuanjia Battalion instead.

1113
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,159
I’m telling you in advance.

1114
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,439
Xuanjia Battalion
is the vanguard army

1115
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:52,679
that fights against Yongqing State.

1116
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,840
They live a dangerous life.

1117
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:57,760
You should be ready
to sacrifice at any time.

1118
00:51:59,175 --> 00:51:59,879
Yeah.

1119
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:09,080
You! Do you dare to compete with me?

1120
00:52:16,439 --> 00:52:18,360
I heard you’re the best fighter
of Xuanjia Battalion.

1121
00:52:19,439 --> 00:52:21,840
It’s no big deal to be the best
of Xuanjia Battalion.

1122
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,719
Strength reigns in Xuanjia Battalion.

1123
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,280
When I defeat you,

1124
00:52:26,919 --> 00:52:28,120
they’ll leave me alone.

1125
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,879
Bring it on if you’re not afraid to die.

1126
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:45,475
