=Episode 17=

27
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,559
This is monkshood, rhizoma zingiber,

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,319
cistanche and epimedium.

29
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:05,080
And this is scutellaria, caulis perllae,

30
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,720
atractylodes, dodder...

31
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:07,559
Come on.

32
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,800
Why are you dividing the herbs?

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,679
Get the herbs

34
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,720
and decoct them for him.

35
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,279
He can’t take this.

36
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:13,759
Why can’t he?

37
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,479
The left pile is aphrodisiac.

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,479
The right pile is
for miscarriage prevention.

39
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,520
Stop laughing.

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,839
You’re so badly wounded.

41
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,839
If you were an ordinary man,

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,360
you would have been dead.

43
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,399
You’re still alive,

44
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,240
only because you have a strong body.

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,839
But without medicine,

46
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:33,479
you’re likely to die, too.

47
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,399
It’s the third time.

48
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,399
Aning, it’s the third time
you went wrong today.

49
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,479
What’s on your mind?

50
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,199
Anything wrong?

51
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,479
Nothing.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,360
I’ll go apply some more glue.

53
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:13,080
Commander,

54
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,839
in recent days,

55
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,240
Aning has been absent-minded.

56
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,639
I heard

57
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:19,639
he’s getting close to a handyman

58
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,199
and often visits him without a reason.

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,880
Mind your own business.

60
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,839
Don’t gossip about others.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,720
Come on.

62
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,240
Where does it hurt?

63
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,119
I didn’t see you the whole day.

64
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,160
My heart hurts.

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,320
Why are you still in the mood of joking?

66
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,440
It’s Zhao Xiao, I guess.
I’ll go open the door.

67
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,351
Ma... Master.

68
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,399
Sir.

69
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,000
Ma...

70
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:26,880
Here we meet again.

71
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,119
You know each other?

72
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,799
We came to Yongqing State alive,

73
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,000
because he saved us.

74
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,000
He’s your husband?

75
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:42,480
How did he know I was a girl?

76
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,440
Don’t stare at me like that.

77
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,959
I knew it on the first day you came.

78
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:50,079
No boys can be as lovely as you.

79
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Master,

80
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,880
I shouldn’t have kept it from you.

81
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,679
He’s my husband.

82
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,399
He hasn’t returned home after the war.

83
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:02,200
I was looking for him and came here.

84
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,000
So, that’s why

85
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,679
you’ve been absent-minded lately?

86
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,799
He’s badly wounded.

87
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,040
He needs good herbs

88
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,760
and careful treatment from doctors.

89
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,720
But I can do nothing.

90
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,119
This really isn’t a place
for recuperation.

91
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,200
What about the other man?

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,440
Take them to me tomorrow.

93
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,440
Be quick.

94
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:52,359
You two, get him to the bed.

95
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:53,799
Be careful.

96
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,160
He’s my distant nephew.

97
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,480
Go get a doctor to us.

98
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,720
Yes.

99
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,279
Sir,

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,679
thank you.

101
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,480
I’m not helping you.

102
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,359
I’m helping my apprentice.

103
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:27,600
Master,

104
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
we don’t know how to thank you.

105
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,959
I help you because I cherish your talent

106
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,119
and hope you can work for me
without concern.

107
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,799
But you came for your husband.

108
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,519
And he’s a soldier.

109
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,440
I don’t think you’ll stay long
in Yongqing State.

110
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,200
When he gets recovered,

111
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:48,000
you’ll have another plan.

112
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:49,720
Master.

113
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,239
We can’t repay your kindness.

114
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,239
In either state,

115
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,000
where there’s a war,

116
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,480
people suffer most.

117
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,760
The fact that you and your husband
can have a reunion

118
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,200
is because of your luck.

119
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,480
You should cherish it.

120
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:12,675
Mm.

121
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,239
I’m going back
to the Weapon Battalion.

122
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,079
If you need anything, tell the servants.

123
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,016
If our states weren’t at war,

124
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,439
I wish I could keep
learning from Master.

125
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,160
By the way,

126
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,920
Master made sense.

127
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,279
It’s dangerous to stay here for long.

128
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,399
We should try to leave this place.

129
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,119
Here we are.

130
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,720
Open your eyes.

131
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,450
Wow.

132
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:01,096
What a beautiful place!

133
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,640
Qing An, come over!

134
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:15,036
A petal rain.

135
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,000
Come and play with me.

136
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,399
Come on.

137
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,359
An?

138
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,000
What’s wrong?

139
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,159
When I was little,
I was often bullied by my elder brother.

140
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,919
In case my mother got unhappy,

141
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,640
I tried hard to pretend I was all right.

142
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,080
But my mother saw me through every time

143
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,559
and she asked me,

144
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,479
“Qing An, what’s wrong?”

145
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:27,799
I suddenly realize that

146
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,520
it’s been quite a long time

147
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,159
that no one asked what was wrong

148
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,599
or cared for me

149
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,000
since my mother left.

150
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,640
No way. You have me.

151
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:40,719
I’m your good friend.

152
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,559
Sometimes,

153
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,880
the care I want

154
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,840
can’t be from a friend.

155
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,960
Tell me what you want, then.

156
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,880
Do you know where this place is?

157
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,239
This is my mother’s favorite place.

158
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,119
She calls it Flower Dream.

159
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,200
It’s a blooming season

160
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:09,359
when it looks the most beautiful.

161
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,640
So, I want to show you around here.

162
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,679
Falling petals, leisurely,
carefree, as in a dream.

163
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:20,599
It’s quite a beautiful place.

164
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,719
My mother loved flowers.

165
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:24,080
Then my father had this sea of flowers

166
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,280
planted for her.

167
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,359
Your father must have loved her a lot.

168
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:33,880
He did, I guess.

169
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,280
Otherwise,

170
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,799
why would he plant
such a sea of flowers

171
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:38,760
for my mother

172
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,440
when he was so busy?

173
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:42,960
My mother was from Mu’an.

174
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,400
After she was saved by my father,

175
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,880
she married him.

176
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,919
But my grandfather

177
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,239
got a wife from Yongqing for my father

178
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,960
and she gave birth to my elder brother.

179
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,039
Your mother was a concubine
though she married your father earlier.

180
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:58,400
Your mother must have lived a bad life.

181
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:03,200
You’re right.

182
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,760
When I think about it now,

183
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,960
I guess she was very sad.

184
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,799
But she never looked sad
in front of me.

185
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,559
She often took me
to this valley, though.

186
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,400
Unfortunately, she left
when I was very little.

187
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,679
Everyone says she eloped with a man.

188
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:20,479
But I don’t believe that.

189
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,200
She loved me

190
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,159
and my father so much.

191
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,080
Why would she ever abandon us?

192
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,359
So, I’ve been doing business
in different towns,

193
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,239
so that I could find her someday.

194
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,080
Your mother came up with

195
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,280
such a beautiful name
as Flower Dream.

196
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,919
I’m sure she is a gentle

197
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,080
and nice woman.

198
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,359
I’ll look for her with you.

199
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:49,799
We’ll find her.

200
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,069
Dongzhi.

201
00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:55,650
Mm?

202
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,770
I have something for you.

203
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,359
What a special ring!

204
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,359
But I don’t usually wear rings.

205
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,320
Now that you’re wearing it,

206
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,640
it’s yours.

207
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:13,014
Dongzhi,

208
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,559
from this day on,

209
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,200
we’re no longer friends.

210
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,350
Ah?

211
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,640
It’s a present for breaking up?

212
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,520
Why do you have such a weird custom?

213
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,159
No.

214
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,080
This is the love token

215
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,799
my father gave my mother.

216
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,039
According to our custom,

217
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,599
when I give you this token,

218
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,400

from this day on,

222
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,479
you’re no longer my good friend,

223
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,799

00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,400
In our state, when we love someone,

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,599
we confess to her.

231
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,300
Life is short.

232
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,640
Meeting a girl that I have a crush on

233
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,039
isn’t that easy.

It’s so good to be young.

258
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,760
You can get off the bed so soon.

259
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,760
Thank you.

260
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,840
Thank you, Master,
for the medicine and doctor.

261
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,320
You’re always honey-lipped.

262
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:57,119
You keep flattering me every day.

263
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:58,719
Seize your time

264
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,159
to learn from me.

265
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,559
Or you won’t have a second chance.

266
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,159
Mm.

267
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:06,280
Master, I’ll go decoct the herbs.

268
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:08,359
Don’t drink any wine.

269
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,320
I won’t.

270
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,280
Come on.

271
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,039
The more beautiful the wife is,

272
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,880
the more scared the husband will be.

273
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,640
The more scared I’m of my wife,
the luckier I’ll be.

274
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:21,679
Sir, speaking of it,

275
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,000
why don’t you get a wife?

276
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:25,359
Get a wife to restrain me?

277
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:26,679
She won’t allow me to drink.

278
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,119
You make sense.

279
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,039
You’re indeed lucky.

280
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,679
Aning is such a beautiful girl.

281
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:37,039
After living for so many years,

282
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,479
I’ve never seen any lady
as beautiful as Aning,

283
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,919
but the concubine from Mu’an

284
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,440
of the King of Yongqing.

285
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,479
The King had a concubine from Mu’an?

286
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,919
The situation wasn’t the same as now

287
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,880
when the two states are always at war.

288
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,359
In the past,

289
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,359
there was no war between the two states.

290
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:59,559
Yongqing people exchange
their horses and milk

291
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,679
for silk and tea from Mu’an people.

292
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,760
The two states were in harmony.

293
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,359
The King of Yongqing
was a prince at that time.

294
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,719
He didn’t use the imperial flag,

295
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,440
but the flag of his clan.

296
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,719
He usually went hunting on the border.

297
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:14,760
One day,

298
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,760
he saw a Mu’an village on the border

299
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,599
was on fire.

300
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,520
A woman ran out.

301
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,760
The King then saved her.

302
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,159
After a three-month treatment,
she finally woke up.

303
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,200
The King kept taking care of her

304
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,960
for three months.

305
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,559
What harm is there

306
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,119
to take care of his beloved woman?

307
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,159
If I were him,

308
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,559
I would take care of her
for my whole life.

309
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:38,960
Yeah. He said so, too.

310
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,159
He was willing to do anything for her.

311
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,679
She liked flowers.

312
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,559
The King then
planted a sea of flowers for her.

313
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,119
You know what?

314
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:50,280
It’s not easy to plant
that kind of flower

315
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,760
in our state.

316
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,280
But what a pity!

317
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,320
What pity?

318
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:58,640
Life is too complicated.

319
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,960
They loved each other,

320
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,479
but they couldn’t end up together.

321
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,400
When people love each other,
they should try to be together.

322
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,040
You’re too young and naive.

323
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,319
When you grow up, you’ll know.

324
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,959
People have too many
responsibilities to bear.

325
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,839
Even if they love each other,

326
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,920
they can’t end up together.

327
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,920
If I were him,

328
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,000
I wouldn’t let it happen.

329
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,029
Li Qian!

330
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,839
I saw you drink some wine.

331
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,959
You deny it?

332
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,079
Say something.

333
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:45,239
I’m still here.

334
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,520
Don’t get angry.

335
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,760
I was just too excited talking to him.

336
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,319
I won’t listen. I won’t.

337
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,225
Oh.

338
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,160
Try to trick me again?

339
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,000
I ran too fast

340
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,160
and hurt my rib.

341
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:08,959
Let me check.

342
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:10,640
Hold me.

343
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:12,400
Are you all right?

344
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,479
Much better.

345
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,280
- Go, go, go.
- Don’t be angry.

346
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,439
I’m not angry anymore.

347
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,040
Be careful.

348
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,560
They’re quite having fun.

349
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,599
Let it go.

350
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,119
Don’t hurt yourself.

351
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,199
Let it go?

352
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:42,160
It’s easier said than done.

353
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,800
When I see the girl belonging to me

354
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,119
is taken away,

355
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,800
how can I just let it go?

356
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,040
For humans,

357
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,479
it’s the hardest thing

358
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,000
to overcome their desire.

359
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,550
Come and have a look.

360
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,079
Brother?

361
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,280
Brother!

362
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,280
I knew you would be alive.

363
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,040
You’re brave and powerful.

364
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,920
You wouldn’t easily die.

365
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,439
Stop flattering me.

366
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,160
He hasn’t completely recovered yet.

367
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,280
When he can come out,
he came to see you first

368
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,359
to tell you he’s all right.

369
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:25,680
Go take a seat.

370
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,325
Mm.

371
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:26,959
- Go.
- Mm.

372
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:27,675
Come on.

373
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,719
Come on.

374
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:39,280
Baoning, you’re brilliant.

375
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:40,775
You indeed found my brother.

376
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:41,400
Mm.

377
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,079
I think

378
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,280
there’s nothing you can’t do
in this world.

379
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,479
From this day on,

380
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,479
I’ll admire you
from the bottom of my heart.

381
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,680
Come on. Let’s have some tea
instead of wine

382
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,359
and cheers.

383
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,520
Double-headed Eagle?

384
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,250
Cheers.

385
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,959
Where did you get the ring?

386
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,520
From a friend.

387
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,760
A friend?

388
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,350
Mm.

389
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,520
Who’s he?

390
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,920
Why did he give you a ring?

391
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,119
He...

392
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,439
He’s Qing An.

393
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,680
He’s a businessman

394
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,599
who does business
in Yongqing and Mu’an.

395
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:13,880
This ring

396
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,160
is the love token
his father gave his mother.

397
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:16,825
Brother.

398
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:18,439
Love token?

399
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
How long have you known him?

400
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:20,959
Who exactly is he?

401
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,239
Why did he approach you?

402
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,439
Don’t you even think about it?

403
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,319
I’m warning you!

404
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,199
I don’t allow you to see him again.

405
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,520
You and he can’t be a couple!

406
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,520
Yes.

407
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,079
I haven’t known him for a long time.

408
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,560
But before you know who he is,

409
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,719
you’re being so assertive already.

410
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:34,359
Why?

411
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,280
You!

412
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,400
Stop quarreling.

413
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,760
Let’s reason things out.

414
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,839
This is not negotiable!

415
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:40,439
I’m telling you.

416
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:42,239
You two won’t make a couple.

417
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,199
I don’t allow you!

418
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,000
You can’t interfere!

419
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:45,719
You!

420
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:48,400
Dongdong!

421
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:49,775
Dongdong!

422
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,479
What happened?

423
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:56,560
Are you all right?

424
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,520
Yes.

425
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
What’s wrong with the ring?

426
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,675
I’ve never seen you be so angry.

427
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,359
Do you remember I told you

428
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:07,479
what happened to my mother?

429
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,000
Mm.

430
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,119
When Yongqing troops
attacked the border,

431
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,760
someone set fire
and massacred your village.

432
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:17,000
Your mother died in the fire, too.

433
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,680
When the village was on fire,

434
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,119
my father was on his way back home.

435
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,119
Fire!

436
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,439
They set the fire!

437
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,599
I’ll fight with them!

438
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,560
Don’t go! Don’t.

439
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,599
There are so many of them.

440
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,000
He saw the pattern

441
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:50,599
on those people’s flag.

442
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,560
So,

443
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,959
the owner
of the Double-headed Eagle Flag

444
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,280
was the murderer?

445
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,479
Over so many years,

446
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,239
my father and I have been looking for

447
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,880
the owner
of the Double-headed Eagle Flag

448
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,239
but we failed.

449
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,119
When Dongdong fell in the water,
Qing An saved her.

450
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,719
They have similar personalities.

451
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,400
Dongdong won’t be nice to him

452
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,599
if she knows he’s not a good man.

453
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,920
Is there some misunderstanding?

454
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:23,199
My father saw it with his eyes.

455
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,479
How can it be a misunderstanding?

456
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:27,599
Baoning,

457
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,319
I’ll find out the truth.

458
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,199
If Qing An’s clan is involved,

459
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,920
I’ll make them pay with their lives.

460
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,680
Why did you restrain me?

461
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,199
Why did you?

462
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,479
I...

463
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,175
Annoying!

464
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,119
Qing An, who exactly are you?

465
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:12,000
Why is my brother so angry?

466
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:17,400
Simply because you’re from Yongqing?

467
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:25,160
I don’t care.

468
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:28,160
No matter where you’re from,

469
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,359
you’re just you.

470
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,199
I want to trust you.

471
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,724
(Yunyang)

472
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,880
Go.

473
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,520
Where’s your pass?

474
00:23:58,959 --> 00:23:59,920
I forgot to take it.

475
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:01,239
Go away!

476
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,000
Go, go.

477
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:02,800
Stop him!

478
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:05,640
Let go of me! Let go of me!

479
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,920
You have no pass
and you look suspicious.

480
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,119
Are you a spy from Mu’an?

481
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,479
No, officer. I’m just a refugee.

482
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,520
Officer, please let go of me!

483
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,680
Officer, I’m just a refugee. Officer!

484
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,550
Officer!

485
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,479
According to First Prince,

486
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,280
we would rather kill wrong persons
than let them go!

487
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:23,839
Miss Gao,

488
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,920
without the pass, we have to break in.

489
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:27,439
If we alert Qing Tai,
there’ll be trouble.

490
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,000
Let’s wait here

491
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:34,680
and try to find him
when the opportunity arises.

492
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,920
If Qian is in Yunyang,

493
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,640
he’ll try to get out.

494
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,880
We can coordinate with him here.

495
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:41,800
Mm.

496
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
Have you got the pass?

497
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:50,439
Yes.

498
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:51,880
Young Master,

499
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,000
this pass is

500
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,079
only available for 24 hours.

501
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,479
Before this time of tomorrow,

502
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:59,119
you have to get out of town.

503
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,239
All right. Get ready

504
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:02,400
and wait for me at the city gate.

505
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,839
I worry about you.

506
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:05,880
Young Master,

507
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:08,680
there’s a nearby deserted posthouse
out of the city gate.

508
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,839
I’ll wait for you there.

509
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,760
All right.

510
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:13,920
Young Master,

511
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,000
if you go with Her Grace,

512
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,359
you’ll be easily noticed.

513
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,839
Also, she has a husband now.

514
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,079
You’d better let her go.

515
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,520
I can’t run away myself

516
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,000
and leave her alone.

517
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:34,479
I’ve got the pass.

518
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,800
We can get out of town tomorrow.

519
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,839
What happened?

520
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,040
You’re feeling unhappy?

521
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:46,959
Or,

522
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,880
are you feeling disgraced

523
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:52,400
because I’ve done something you can’t?

524
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,839
In front of death,

525
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,880
what’s the point of caring for disgrace?

526
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,040
I just have something important to do

527
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,439
and I can’t leave for the moment.

528
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,400
When I find Dongzhi tomorrow,

529
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:06,479
please leave with her and Baoning.

530
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,000
Don’t wait for me.

531
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,400
What’s so important?

532
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,280
The death of my mother

533
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:18,239
and the extermination of my clan.

534
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,199
Does...?

535
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:23,920
Does Baoning know that?

536
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,560
She doesn’t need to know.

537
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,040
Tomorrow,

538
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,079
I’ll leave Baoning to you.

539
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,920
If she’s in danger,

540
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,199
I’ll fight it out with you.

541
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,839
Even if you don’t leave her to me,

542
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,880
I’ll also take good care of her.

543
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,150
Mm.

544
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,640
When I march troops to Mu’an,

545
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,439
within three months,

546
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,439
I can get what I want.

547
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:10,479
Your Highness, you’re powerful.

548
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,319
You’re blessed by Heaven.

549
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:14,760
Report.

550
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:22,596
Your Highness,

551
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:25,160
there’s news from the Palace

552
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,239
that His Majesty is getting worse.

553
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:30,040
I’m afraid he’s dying.

554
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:33,079
When is he not dying?

555
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,959
But the situation is different
this time.

556
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:38,680
His Majesty summoned
the Second Prince back to Yunyang.

557
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,839
Your Highness,

558
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:42,400
is His Majesty going to pass the throne

559
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,160
to the Second Prince?

560
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:47,959
Never!

561
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:56,479
Come, please.

562
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,439
So many dishes?

563
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,959
You made them?

564
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,119
No, I didn’t.

565
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:06,560
I bought them with my pay
of the first month.

566
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,880
You’re so skilled in mechanism,

567
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,959
but you can’t cook?

568
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,079
I can’t cook.

569
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,160
But I can make other things

570
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,719
with my skillful hands.

571
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,359
It’s always clever of you.

572
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:20,520
Master,

573
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,359
this is the drawing
you asked me to make the other day.

574
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,599
You’re leaving?

575
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,400
Why did you know everything?

576
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:34,880
You got so many dishes
early this morning.

577
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,319
And you gave me the drawing

578
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,680
without going to the Weapon Battalion.

579
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:39,880
Isn’t that obvious?

580
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,479
Master,

581
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,160
when I’ve been in Yunyang,

582
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,599
thank you for taking care of me.

583
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:48,760
Later,

584
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,000
if you come to Mu’an,

585
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,359
I’ll repay you.

586
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,880
Forget it.

587
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,479
The two states are at war.

588
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,959
If I’m in Mu’an,

589
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,319
I’ll be invading or be captured.

590
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,560
Neither is a good thing.

591
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,920
We’d better not meet again.

592
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,760
No civilians want a war.

593
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,400
So, the war will be over soon.

594
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,439
By then,

595
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,439
Yongqing people can go to Mu’an

596
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:16,680
to exchange their goods
for silk and tea.

597
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,160
Mu’an people can also come to Yongqing

598
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:20,439
for horses and porcelain.

599
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:21,959
Master, when you hunt rabbits,

600
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,599
you can exchange them
for eggs as you did before.

601
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,359
Hope the day will come.

602
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,719
It will come.

603
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,560
Sir.

604
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:45,319
Excuse me.

605
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,800
Do you know a businessman named Qing An?

606
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,719
He’s a big businessman.

607
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,719
I certainly know him.

608
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,920
That’s good.

609
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,640
Do you know where he lives?

610
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,719
I’ve got some emergency to tell him.

611
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,599
Walk along this road

612
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,359
(Ironware Shop)
and you’ll see an ironware shop.

613
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:02,160
He often makes deals there.

614
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,160
He hasn’t come yet.

615
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,719
Looks like he won’t come today.

616
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,640
An.

617
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,599
Come over.

618
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,719
An?

619
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,199
Can he be Qing An?

620
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,160
Tell me. What did you come for?

621
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:26,560
You have to go back this time.

622
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,520
His Majesty is getting worse.

623
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,520
He can’t even move
out of bed these days.

624
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,760
Nonsense!

625
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,880
When was Father so badly sick?

626
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,520
I don’t dare to talk nonsense.

627
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,280
His Majesty urged you

628
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:38,839
to go back, no matter what,

629
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:41,880
and see him for the last time.

630
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:48,920
(Ironware Shop)

631
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,680
Your Highness!

632
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,479
He looks stealthy.

633
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,760
I’ll follow up and see.

634
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:57,655
(Thought)

635
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:21,319
What’s wrong with Li Qian?

636
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,760
If he’s too late,

637
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,040
no one can get out of town.

638
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:26,719
Baoning, how about this?

639
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:28,319
Let me take you away first.

640
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,400
Then let’s try to get them out.

641
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:31,560
No way.

642
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,040
I won’t leave without Li Qian.

643
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,560
Baoning, let me tell you the truth.

644
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,520
Li Qian said he would check
on the man who killed her mother

645
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,400
and asked me to leave
with you and his sister.

646
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,640
But Dongdong hasn’t come back yet.

647
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:51,675
Wait.

648
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,959
You’re not familiar with this place.

649
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:54,000
Where can you find them?

650
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,239
I’m indeed not familiar.

651
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,800
But my master is.

652
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,000
I’ll go look for him.

653
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,079
How long does it take

654
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,040
to go to and come back
from the Weapon Battalion?

655
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,400
Time is running out already.

656
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,239
But what I want now

657
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,119
is to keep Li Qian safe,

658
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,079
instead of getting out of town!

659
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,400
But I want to keep you safe!

660
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:19,079
Young Master,

661
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,479
thank you for your concern.

662
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:22,959
But this is my business with Li Qian.

663
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,520
Don’t waste your time

664
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,719
on us.

665
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:27,040
If we can’t make it back,

666
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,959
get out of town without us.

667
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,280
We’ll meet you in Mu’an.

668
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,040
Baoning,

669
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,319
I’ll go with you.

670
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,680
No way.

671
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,400
You’ve done enough for me.

672
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:40,160
If you still want to help me,

673
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,520
go find your subordinates.

674
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,959
If we can catch up,

675
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,079
we’ll leave with you.

676
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,400
But...

677
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,920
Baoning, you promised that.

678
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,199
You must come back!

679
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,359
I’ll be waiting for you!

680
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,599
Master.

681
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,239
Aning?

682
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,800
Haven’t you left yet?

683
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,800
I have something important to ask you.

684
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:19,959
Master,

685
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,640
have you seen a flag

686
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
or ornament with this pattern?

687
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,119
How do you know
the flag of the King’s maternal clan?

688
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,400
Who?

689
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,439
This is the clan flag
of the King’s maternal clan.

690
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,479
When he was a prince,

691
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,800
he used this flag.

692
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:37,400
After he became the King,

693
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,959
his maternal clan was incorporated
into the imperial clan.

694
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:41,040
This flag was no longer used, then.

695
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:42,640
Over so many years,

696
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,839
few people have seen this pattern again.

697
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,479
Where did you see it?

698
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,520
It was the King of Yongqing?

699
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:51,319
What’s wrong?

700
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,199
Master, you must help me!

701
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,839
Please save my husband!

702
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,319
What happened?

703
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,560
Young Master,

704
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,640
you’ve come at last.

705
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,599
Let’s go meet the others.

706
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,640
Wait.

707
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,319
She hasn’t come yet.

708
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:09,280
Young Master, we can no longer wait.

709
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:11,959
I know how far to go.

710
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,159
Baoning, do come!

711
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,000
Screwed.

712
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,000
He must have tracked it down
to the Imperial Palace.

713
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,600
I’m going to see His Majesty.

714
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,760
Hope it’s not too late

715
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,879
before your husband makes a big mistake.

716
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,840
I’ll go with you!

717
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:36,719
Looks like he has a high status
in Yongqing.

718
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,479
Qing Tai has taken away
most of the troops.

719
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,879
It’s not hard to sneak in, I guess.

720
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,719
Your Majesty.

721
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,360
An?

722
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,600
It’s me.

723
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,439
The unfilial son you used to criticize.

724
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,760
Didn’t you refuse to see me

725
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:23,760
because you hated me

726
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:26,199
for being a low-class businessman

727
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,000
instead of a prince?

728
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:41,879
Son,

729
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,800
I’m dying.

730
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,840
Before I die,

731
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:50,040
I want to see you again.

732
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:05,360
Qin Yu?

733
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,639
Qin Yu!

734
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:17,120
You look so much like your mother.

735
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,479
My heart hurts every time I see you.

736
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,040
When you were little,

737
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,520
I couldn’t often accompany you.

738
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,040
I...

739
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,120
An, what brings you here?

740
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,199
Come on. Sit down.

741
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,479
Your brother beat you again?

742
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,600
What a bad brother!

743
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,120
It doesn’t hurt. It doesn’t.

744
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:51,600
No.

745
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,399
I couldn’t be too nice to you.

746
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,479
If I die someday,

747
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,000
what will you do, then?

748
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:10,159
Father.

749
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:17,199
Be seated.

750
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,600
I saw your decoction spilled.

751
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,120
I’ll go make some for you.

752
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:30,239
Don’t leave.

753
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:32,679
Father, I’ll be right back.

754
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,040
Who are you?

755
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:23,679
Tell me.

756
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:26,479
Is this your flag?

757
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,040
Yes.

758
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:32,239
That’s the flag of my maternal clan.

759
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,439
You’re the King,

760
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:41,239
but you burned a village on the border.

761
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:43,280
And you slaughtered innocent people.

762
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,040
How can you be the King?

763
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,479
You can’t even be a human.

764
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,439
Burned a village and killed people?

765
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,800
I’ve never done that.

766
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,879
Shall I remind you?

767
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,080
The Li Village on the border
20 years ago.

768
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,959
When I was young,
I often went hunting on the border.

769
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,479
I indeed went to the Li Village.

770
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,025
But...!

771
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:14,350
When you went there with your troops,

772
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,679
the fire had been burning
for a day and night.

773
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,000
People from 80 years old

774
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,919
to less than one year old

775
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:26,679
were massacred by you.

776
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,239
When you left with your men,

777
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,159
my father saw

778
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,159
this flag you were using!

779
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,000
20 years ago?

780
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,520
The Li Village?

781
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,239
Fire?

782
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,479
Don’t pretend you don’t know!

783
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,399
After all these years,
I finally found you.

784
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:56,719
Even if you’re the King of Yongqing,

785
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:58,800
I’ll use your blood

786
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:01,320
to sacrifice for my dead mother
and innocent people!

787
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,679
(Zhenning Gate)

788
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,360
Wait.

789
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,280
You mustn’t break through
the palace gate.

790
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,280
Master, what’s this?

791
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:20,320
It’s the pass His Majesty gave me.

792
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:36,439
Li Qian,

793
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,840
don’t hurt my father!

794
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
You know me?

795
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:42,479
Good.

796
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,239
You knew who I am

797
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:46,520
and then you approached
my sister deliberately?

798
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,080
I’m sincere to Dongzhi.

799
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,439
I have no other intention.

800
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,399
If you’re dissatisfied with me for that,

801
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:52,600
fight me.

802
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,760
My father is innocent.

803
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:57,280
Now that he’s your father,
he’s certainly related!

804
00:40:58,919 --> 00:40:59,840
20 years ago,

805
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,159
your father killed my mother
and my whole clan.

806
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,360
20 years later,

807
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,879
you spared no effort

808
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,520
to get close to my sister
for your state!

809
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,600
Today,

810
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:11,504
neither of you can leave alive!

811
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,399
Son!

812
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:49,959
Don’t kill him!

813
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,000
Stop fighting!

814
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:53,360
There’s some misunderstanding.

815
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:53,879
It’s not the King of Yongqing.

816
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:54,879
Sir, get out of my way!

817
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,719
I know you’re local

818
00:41:58,639 --> 00:41:59,719
and you saved my life.

819
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,399
But this is a different thing.

820
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:04,159
I must take revenge today!

821
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,080
Li Qian,

822
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:06,719
put your sword down.

823
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,760
Master knew what happened 20 years ago.

824
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:10,639
On that day 20 years ago,

825
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,639
Master went to the Li Village
with the King.

826
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,479
Precisely.

827
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,479
20 years ago,

828
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:17,360
when the Li Village was on fire,

829
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,879
His Majesty was there.

830
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:21,159
However, someone else set fire
and massacred the village.

831
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,159
His Majesty didn’t kill anyone.

832
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,639
Instead, he saved someone.

833
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,320
Your Highness,

834
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,199
the village of Mu’an is on fire.

835
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,719
Your Highness,

836
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,439
shall we go have a look?

837
00:42:44,879 --> 00:42:46,360
This is the border of two states.

838
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,600
We can’t make trouble.

839
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:49,679
Everybody, leave.

840
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,639
Yes.

841
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,360
Help!

842
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,159
Help!

843
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,000
Help!

844
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:02,959
Later,

845
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,439
His Majesty sent me to the Li Village

846
00:43:05,879 --> 00:43:07,520
and check if anyone else was alive

847
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,320
and looked for families
for Princely Lady.

848
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,679
When I arrived at the Li Village,

849
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,800
it was already a heap of rubble.

850
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,199
When the King of Yongqing got there,

851
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,760
the Li Village was on fire

852
00:43:20,879 --> 00:43:22,239
and that lady was hunted down.

853
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,320
Anyway, someone else is the murderer!

854
00:43:28,725 --> 00:43:32,800
(Zhenning Gate)

855
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:45,600
Your Highness,

856
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,959
unless you’re summoned,

857
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,280
you can’t get in with soldiers.

858
00:44:22,879 --> 00:44:24,399
When the lady from Mu’an

859
00:44:24,479 --> 00:44:25,879
was saved by His Majesty,

860
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,320
she didn’t wake up from a coma
until three months later.

861
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:30,239
Because her head was hit,

862
00:44:30,399 --> 00:44:31,679
she didn’t remember anything.

863
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:34,239
His Majesty then gave her

864
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,679
a new name of Yongqing, Qin Yu.

865
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,520
Later, she became an imperial concubine

866
00:44:38,919 --> 00:44:40,199
and gave birth to the Second Prince.

867
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,479
Unfortunately,

868
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,439
more than ten years ago,

869
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,399
she left Yongqing.

870
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,600
I know you can hardly accept it.

871
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,199
But what we have to do now

872
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,239
is to get back to Mu’an
and find out the truth.

873
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,159
Good. Very good.

874
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,120
I had planned to arrest Qing An only.

875
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:12,719
Thanks to Heaven,

876
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:15,800
Commandery Princess Jia’nan
and Li Qian are here, too.

877
00:45:16,919 --> 00:45:17,879
Thank you

878
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,840
for seeking your doom.

879
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:22,080
Son,

880
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,520
what are you doing?

881
00:45:24,879 --> 00:45:25,600
Father,

882
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,879
don’t be angry.

883
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,239
I know

884
00:45:28,919 --> 00:45:31,479
you only care for that woman
and her son.

885
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:35,040
When you’re dying,
you even want to pass the throne to him.

886
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,280
But I always respect you, Father.

887
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:42,199
I heard that Qing An wanted to kill you.

888
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,479
Then I gave up
the great chance to go south

889
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:46,760
and came back to save you.

890
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:49,120
What a traitor!

891
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

892
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:53,000
I’m talking nonsense?

893
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:57,239
Qing An and his helpers

894
00:45:57,239 --> 00:45:58,879
are right in front of you.

895
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,520
They’re doing the self-injury

896
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:04,120
to win your trust

897
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,679
and cheat you of your throne

898
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,479
before they kill you.

899
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:09,080
You!

900
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,919
Qing Tai, don’t sling mud at us!

901
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,360
He’s making use of us

902
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,639
to frame Qing An up.

903
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,320
Even without us,

904
00:46:16,879 --> 00:46:18,159
he’ll kill Qing An, too.

905
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,040
I’ll find a chance

906
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,199
and take you away.

907
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:22,280
All right.

908
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:26,879
Today,

909
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,800
none of you can leave.

910
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,760
Tai,

911
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,719
you and An are both my sons.

912
00:46:36,399 --> 00:46:39,120
Don’t hurt each other!

913
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,679
Hurt each other?

914
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:55,479
Now you know I’m your son?

915
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,439
When I was little,
you pretended you cared for me.

916
00:46:59,439 --> 00:47:00,919
But you taught him horse-riding
and archery secretly.

917
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:02,280
You think I don’t know?

918
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:03,600
My mother

919
00:47:04,479 --> 00:47:06,040
is your Empress!

920
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,320
But you’ve never looked her in the eye.

921
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:11,639
Now you’re dying

922
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,840
and you’ll pass the throne to him!

923
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,560
At this time,

924
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,239
why don’t you remember
I’m also your son?

925
00:47:24,439 --> 00:47:25,439
But it doesn’t matter.

926
00:47:26,479 --> 00:47:27,399
If I want something,

927
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,159
I get it myself.

928
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:31,239
The throne is mine.

929
00:47:31,959 --> 00:47:33,320
The state is mine.

930
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:36,000
And even the world will be mine!

931
00:47:36,919 --> 00:47:37,719
You!

932
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:42,280
As for Qing An,

933
00:47:43,439 --> 00:47:44,800
now that you like him so much,

934
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,439
I’ll kill him first

935
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,760
so that he can wait for you in hell.

936
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:50,600
You!

937
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,760
What a traitor!

938
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:54,919
Father.

939
00:47:54,919 --> 00:47:55,550
Your Majesty.

940
00:47:55,575 --> 00:47:56,150
Father.

941
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,280
Take them down!

942
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,080
Use this.

943
00:48:11,399 --> 00:48:12,000
Go.

944
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:12,800
Father!

945
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,416
Your Highness!

946
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,959
- Father!
- Go!

947
00:48:15,399 --> 00:48:16,000
Father.

948
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:18,639
Go after them!

949
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:19,360
Quickly!

950
00:48:19,879 --> 00:48:20,719
- Quickly!
- After them!

951
00:48:21,439 --> 00:48:22,080
Quickly.

952
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:31,959
Keep running.

953
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,159
You’ll have nowhere to escape.

954
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,159
Go!

955
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:38,000
Kill them all!

956
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,000
Pull the arrow out.

957
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,280
Look how desperately you fight.

958
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:38,439
Li Qian,

959
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,280
you were strong and proud.

960
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,600
But now you’re nearly dying.

961
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,879
How can you still fight me?

962
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:47,879
Kill him.

963
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:50,080
Your Grace, take Li Qian away.

964
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:51,000
I’ll bring up the rear.

965
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:55,560
Qing An, Dongzhi hasn’t been back.

966
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,719
You must find her!

967
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:04,199
Go.

968
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,239
Young Master,

969
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:14,320
we must leave, or it’ll be too late.

970
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:15,120
Shut up!

971
00:50:15,399 --> 00:50:16,280
Leave without me if you want.

972
00:50:17,439 --> 00:50:18,239
Young Master,

973
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,199
your father is waiting for you at home.

974
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,239
I said, shut up!

975
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,199
I promised to wait for her.

976
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,879
I won’t leave until she comes.

977
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:29,360
Quickly!

978
00:50:29,959 --> 00:50:30,639
After them!

979
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,199
Hang in there.

980
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:51,625
Li Qian!

981
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:55,840
Go.

982
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:58,239
Go.

983
00:50:58,479 --> 00:50:59,639
After them!

984
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:11,360
Quickly!

985
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,560
Shoot.

986
00:51:53,925 --> 00:51:55,500
(No fire)

987
00:51:56,775 --> 00:51:59,300
(Oil)

988
00:52:06,325 --> 00:52:07,300
(Oil)

989
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,625
(Oil)

990
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,700
(Oil)

991
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,275
(Wine)

992
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,840
Your Highness,

993
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,919
we’ve besieged them.

994
00:52:42,479 --> 00:52:43,120
Screwed.

995
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,080
They’re setting off a signal.

996
00:52:45,959 --> 00:52:46,639
Your Highness,

997
00:52:46,919 --> 00:52:49,040
the Second Prince
is your biggest concern.

998
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:51,840
Don’t worry.

999
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,639
I shot him.

1000
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,320
He can’t escape.

1001
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,000
Some of you stay and besiege the yard.

1002
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:02,399
The rest go after Qing An with me.

1003
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,520
