00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,200
Hey,

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,279
District Princess Qingyi,

29
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:06,199
is that a cricket on your shoulder?

30
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,399
Your Majesty,

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,520
I have to go to
the Empress Dowager’s quarters

32
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,559
to find my grandfather.

33
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:26,160
Excuse me.

34
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,759
Baoning,

35
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,839
you’re not mad at me for forcing you
to marry me, are you?

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,119
I know

37
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,919
I’ll have to marry you in the end.

38
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,639
It’s just my mind wasn’t made up.

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,600
I’m not prepared

40
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,880
to share my husband with other women.

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,919
However, Grandmother has
made the decision for me.

42
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,800
So I’ll try my best to learn

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,119
to be a good empress.

44
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,150
Baoning,

45
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,039
no one will be
a better empress than you.

46
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,600
Your Majesty,

47
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,080
the cricket trainers

48
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,440
use their index
and middle fingertips a lot.

49
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,839
But that man doesn’t have calluses

50
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:23,919
on his middle fingertip.

51
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,520
Instead, he has calluses on the joint,

52
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,839
which means he writes
with a paintbrush a lot.

53
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,440
So he’s not a cricket trainer.

54
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,839
You have an agile mind.

55
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,479
I won’t lie to you then.

56
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,160
He’s Yan Huanian, a former councilor
of the Office of Grand Council.

57
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,039
Since my mother took over
the state affairs,

58
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:41,919
he resigned in a rage.

59
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:44,360
I invited him back to the palace

60
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,160
to be my consultant.

61
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,399
You just told me like that?

62
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,479
Does my uncle assign him to you?

63
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,479
I don’t mind telling you.

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,080
My mother

65
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,839
has put all kinds of restrictions on me.

66
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,199
Even the scholar

67
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,240
teaches me superficial knowledge.

68
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,679
He instructs me what is what

69
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:08,399
but not how or why.

70
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,559
Luckily, I have Yan Huanian
to teach me in secret.

71
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,000
Since he’s my uncle’s man,

72
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,880
you’d better work hard.

73
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,720
By your words, my dear cousin.

74
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,480
Grandpa, have some water.

75
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,119
Grandpa,

76
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,559
your illness...

77
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,279
It’s old trouble.

78
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,079
I’m fine.

79
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,239
Tongxin,

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,519
your parents passed away young.

81
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,559
I wish someone would
give you a happy home.

82
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,920
You don’t know much

83
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,040
about things in the palace.

84
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:04,720
The Empress Dowager is in charge
of the court.

85
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,600
His Majesty has no real power.

86
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,519
Even if you can marry His Majesty,

87
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,359
you’ll become
the Empress Dowager’s pawn.

88
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,320
I want

89
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:20,160
to give the best to you
and I’m worried about you.

90
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:25,880
Grandpa,

91
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,359
I won’t marry any men

92
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,320
other than the man I like.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,920
If I can’t marry the man I like,

94
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,200
but I can live a peaceful life,

95
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,760
what’s the meaning?

96
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,359
Even if you can marry His Majesty,

97
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,559
there will be so many concubines.

98
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,399
How much do you think His Majesty
will love you?

99
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,359
Don’t forget
Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

100
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,440
She grew up with His Majesty.

101
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,959
I know.

102
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,559
His Majesty is surrounded
by beautiful women.

103
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,799
But Grandpa,

104
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,200
a man is not a stalk of grass or a tree.

105
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,720
As long as I love His Majesty

106
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,399
with all my heart,

107
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
I believe

108
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,880
that he’ll realize I’m his true lover.

109
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Tongxin,

110
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,359
do you really want to marry His Majesty?

111
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,160
Grandpa.

112
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:21,247
Alright.

113
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:24,160
With my beauty, wisdom

114
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,079
and the identity of Lord Jian’s
granddaughter,

115
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,440
I’m sure I’ll win the honor

116
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,799
in the palace.

117
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,720
Tongxin,

118
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,640
I’ve learned what you mean.

119
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,679
I’ll let the Empress Dowager know.

120
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,839
Your Highness,

121
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,799

I was ordered to investigate

124
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:06,239
is nothing but a game His Majesty held

125
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,160
to amuse the Princess

126
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,839
with interesting gadgets.

127
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,040
His Majesty

128
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,399
isn’t a child anymore.

129
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,559
This is ridiculous.

130
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,160
Your Highness, there’s one more thing.

131
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,040
Go ahead.

132
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,000
His Majesty takes a fancy
in cricket fighting recently

133
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,839
and even had Du Sheng
get a cricket trainer

134
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,959
to the palace.

135
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,399
Since it’s someone outside the palace,

136
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:41,239
I want you to find out for me

137
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,760
if this man is fishy.

138
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,600
Yes, Your Highness.

139
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,600
I’ll see to it.

142
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,040
I forgot to give it back to him.

146

of the Machinist Contest.

147
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,920
So Zhao Yi didn’t hold the contest

148
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:29,959
to find me

149
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,799
some interesting gadgets,

150
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,880
but to finish

151
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,880
the making of waterfowl ships.

152
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,359
Send this to His Majesty.

153
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,039
Sneak it in a food box.

154
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,080
Yes.

My mother cannot see that thing.

161

I didn’t let anyone in today.

163
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:22,799

00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,640
in your letter, you rushed me

189
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,359
to take you back to our mansion.

190
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,919
Is something wrong?

191
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,119
I have some guesses.

192
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:24,042
Come and take a look.

193
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:24,760
But I have to confirm it

194
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,280
with my uncle.

195
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:27,106
Oh,

196
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,239
your uncle isn’t in town lately.

197
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,919
I’m afraid he won’t be back

198
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,400
until the night.

199
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,039
What about Lyu?

200
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,520
I haven’t seen him in the palace
for a long time.

201
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,239
To the public, we said

202
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,440
your cousin has been ill at home.

203
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,400
In fact,

204
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,719
your uncle sent him to Zhuo’an.

205
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,080
But as for the purpose of his trip,

206
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,280
I don’t have a clue.

207
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:54,409
(Li’s Mansion)

208
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:56,141
Be careful.

209
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:56,593
Sure.

210
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,719
So many chests!

211
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:00,730
Wei Shu.

212
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,040
Yes.

213
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,960
What are these?

214
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,960
They are Master’s presents
for Empress Dowager’s birthday.

215
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,960
By the way, young master.

216
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,679
When I left for Bingzhou
to pick up the presents,

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,880
I found the Archduke’s son
rode out of town

218
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,400
in plain clothes
with a squad of soldiers.

219
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,119
I found it strange,

220
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,080
so I followed him for a day

221
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:18,640
and found out they went to Zhuo’an

222
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,280
via hidden paths.

223
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,280
I asked around when I came back.

224
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,799
The Archduke claimed

225
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,359
that his son has been taken sick
at home.

226
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,280
The Archduke sent his son

227
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,083
to Zhuo’an?

228
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:34,445
Yes.

229
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,559
Zhuo’an is the level-one garrison

230
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,000
that’s the closest to Longevity Hill,

231
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,479
where Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet
is going to be held.

232
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,831
But the Archduke
is His Majesty’s henchman.

233
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,479
It seems the capital

234
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:53,479
is going to see a tremendous change.

235
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,640
Young master,

236
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,200
if it happens,

237
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,559
will Commandery Princess Jia’nan

238
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,479
be able to get The Book
of Supreme Weapons for you?

239
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,719
Welcome back, Duke.

240
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,000
Baoning, you’re back.

241
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,719
Uncle.

242
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,479
We have

243
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,719
lost count of the cups of tea we had.

244
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:22,640
Your uncle is finally back.

245
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,359
Baoning.

246
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,760
How have you been in the palace?

247
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,080
You’re in such a hurry to see me today.

248
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,520
Are you in some kind of trouble?

249
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,520
Uncle.

250
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,000
Are you and His Majesty planning

251
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,719
to make Empress Dowager step down

252
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:40,239
at her birthday banquet
on Longevity Hill?

253
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,239
Come.

254
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,200
How did you know?

255
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,000
I found out by chance that Zhao Yi

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,520
is learning governance from Yan Huanian.

257
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,400
I didn’t think much of it

258
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,880
until I found he’s
building waterfowl ships.

259
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,799
There’s no need for a waterfowl ship
in the palace.

260
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,640
But there’s a need
on the lake of Longevity Hill.

261
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Are you trying to ship strong fighters

262
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,479
to Longevity Hill?

263
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,200
We do intend to do so.

264
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,599
I think I understand.

265
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:16,559
Zhao Yi

266
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,559
did everything

267
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,960
to win my grandmother’s sympathy

268
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,000
and make Empress Dowager
approve our marriage.

269
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,919
The reason he’s so eager

270
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:24,440
to marry me is that

271
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,679
he needs our family
to help him stabilize

272
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,320
the court without Empress Dowager.

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,719
And I

274
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,559
am just someone

275
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,400
to help him assure the officials.

276
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,039
What about you, Baoning?

277
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,080
Do you want to marry His Majesty?

278
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,919
Of course I don’t.

279
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:43,200
Well, I don’t want anything to happen
to our family either.

280
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,760
Uncle, you can help Zhao Yi
to take over.

281
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,039
But for the sake of
peace and stability in the palace,

282
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,599
we can’t let Empress Dowager
lose all her power.

283
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:55,679
It’s dangerous to give our family’s fate
to either the Emperor

284
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,520
or the Empress Dowager.

285
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,559
It’s easier said.

286
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
But it’s too difficult to do.

287
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:07,799
I’ve found out.

288
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,840
Zhao Yi has a child with a maid.

289
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,320
The child lives outside the palace.

290
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,679
Once the child is in the hands
of Empress Dowager,

291
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,359
I’m sure
Zhao Yi will be careful with us.

292
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:16,359
Is it true?

293
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:16,984
Yes.

294
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:18,520
Baoning,

295
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,359
our top priority now

296
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:22,280
is to keep the maid safe.

297
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,080
Zhao Yi has his best men protect her.

298
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,960
Baoning,

299
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,000
you’ve been in the palace all this time.

300
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
How did you find out about
His Majesty’s affair with the maid?

301
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,039
By chance, I met

302
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,320
Li Qian, son of the
Commandant of Bingzhou.

303
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,479
I promised to help him find something
in the palace,

304
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:39,599
and he agreed to help me.

305
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:40,520
Is he reliable?

306
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:43,200
He knows about
His Majesty’s affair anyway.

307
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,479
So he’s a concerned party.

308
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,559
But,

309
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,840
in a few days,
you’ll be made the empress.

310
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,000
Once the edict is issued,

311
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,880
you’ll be the empress,

312
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,799
which will be irreversible.

313
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,679
I won’t just sit here
and wait for it to happen.

314
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:05,559
We still have a few days.

315
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,599
I’m sure I’ll find a way.

316
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,840
As a princess living in the palace,

317
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,440
you shouldn’t have worried about these.

318
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,840
It’s all my fault.

319
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,200
I didn’t take good care of you.

320
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,039
You live in the palace.

321
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,960
I can’t even arrange
everything in your life.

322
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,280
Even your marriage

323
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,599
is out of my hands.

324
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
Uncle,

325
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:39,479
our family is my strongest support.

326
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,000
Who is it?

327
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:05,760
Your Grace.

328
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:09,559
You’re the son of a commandant.

329
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:11,080
Where are your manners?

330
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:17,880
Hey, you...

331
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,239
If you dare...

332
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:20,919
do something...

333
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,000
I... I...

334
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:23,760
Your Grace,

335
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,880
you’re not thinking about
something indecent, are you?

336
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,280
We’re in the palace.

337
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,960
I don’t have the guts to do that.

338
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,640
I’m sure you don’t.

339
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,479
Alright, what do you want?

340
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,119
Your Grace,

341
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,159
the Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet
is approaching.

342
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,559
And the Archduke sent
his son Jiang Lyu secretly

343
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,400
to Zhuo’an.

344
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,280
Zhuo’an is the level-one garrison

345
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,159
closest to Longevity Hill.

346
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,760
I made a bold guess.

347
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,440
Your family is planning
to help His Majesty

348
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,080
force the Empress Dowager to step down

349
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,919
on her birthday banquet.

350
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,840
This is nonsense.

351
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,760
You could be decapitated

352
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,559
for what you said in the palace.

353
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:06,239
Your Grace,

354
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:07,959
can you convince the Archduke

355
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,400
to share his plan
for the birthday banquet with me

356
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,920
and take me to Empress Dowager

357
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,520
on her birthday?

358
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:13,920
I’m tired.

359
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:14,479
Go.

360
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,359
No rush to drive me away.

361
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,680
I’m here to make a deal with you.

362
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:22,439
I can’t think of anything
to trade with you.

363
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,560
That’s not necessarily true.

364
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,959
I’ve been thinking about it.

365
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,239
Your family is loyal to His Majesty.

366
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,119
So it’s not an easy thing

367
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,719
to get The Book of Supreme Weapons

368
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,239
from the Empress Dowager.

369
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,959
So we can work together.

370
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,119
Help me gain
the Empress Dowager’s trust,

371
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,880
so I can get The Book of Supreme Weapons

372
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
a lot easier.

373
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,160
How do you want to do it?

374
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,439
On that day,

375
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,839
I will support Empress Dowager.

376
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,680
At the birthday banquet,

377
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,760
my family will stand up
for Her Highness.

378
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,520
In this case, your family

379
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,319
will not be condemned
for offending Her Highness.

380
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,280
What do you think?

381
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,439
This is about my family’s fate.

382
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:02,599
How can I trust you?

383
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,359
A commitment?

384
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,400
Keep this written commitment.

385
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,400
If we break our promise,

386
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,119
the letter in your possession

387
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,280
can make our family decapitated.

388
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,319
If you want to know

389
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,599
the detailed plan for the banquet,

390
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,239
go to my uncle,

391
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:47,280
Jiang Zhenyuan with this jade pendant.

392
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,280
If I screw it up,

393
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,359
you can take my life.

394
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:58,560
What do I need your life for?

395
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,730
It’s true that an equal player

396
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,719
makes the game more interesting.

397
00:19:14,242 --> 00:19:18,069
(Cining Palace)

398
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,160
Greetings, Your Grace.

399
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,319
Greetings, Your Highness.

400
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,800
To what do I owe this honor,

401
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,040
Princess?

402
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,319
I’ll be made the empress in a few days.

403
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,560
So I’m thinking,

404
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,079
when I become the empress,

405
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,119
I’ll need to come to greet you often.

406
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:40,520
I made the fan for you.

407
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:41,920
My grandmother likes it so much.

408
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,000
So I thought I should make one
for Your Highness.

409
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:47,040
That’s very kind of you.

410
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,719
My grandmother said

411
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:55,800
the late emperor also liked
such ingenious devices.

412
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,520
Your Highness once found
The Book of Supreme Weapons

413
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,800
for him.

414
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,119
I heard
it’s in Your Highness’s possession.

415
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,000
It’s about weapon design.

416
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,880
Are you interested in weapons?

417
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,199
Thank you for the fan.

418
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:15,359
I have some reports to review.

419
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,239
You may leave.

420
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:19,000
Min Zhou,

421
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,920
see the Princess out.

422
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,079
Yes.

423
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,160
Your Grace, please.

424
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,719
Looks like we have to follow his plan.

425
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,680
But it’s a dangerous move.

426
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:35,319
Li Qian, you have to be careful.

427
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,897
(May the state and people be in peace
East Market)

428
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:50,880
Duke Jiang.

429
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,800
Baoning?

430
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,800
Li Qian, son of the
Commandant of Bingzhou.

431
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,199
I’ve reached a deal with the Princess

432
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,439
that on the day of the birthday banquet,

433
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,280
my family will back Empress Dowager,

434
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,239
and it’ll prove your family has nothing
to do with it.

435
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,359
Baoning told you

436
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,000
about His Majesty’s plan to force

437
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,839
Empress Dowager to step down?

438
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,319
Yes.

439
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:18,040
I gave the Princess my commitment.

440
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,880
From now on,

441
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:21,439
the Li’s and the Jiang’s

442
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:23,000
are on the same boat.

443
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,599
I trust Baoning.

444
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,199
What is your plan?

445
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,000
Except for the plan
for the birthday banquet,

446
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,479
I’d also like to ask a favor

447
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:38,199
to assign me and my men

448
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:40,839
to Longevity Hill as guards.

449
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:50,330
(East Market)

450
00:22:01,474 --> 00:22:03,474
(East Warmth Chamber)

451
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,839
Why did Empress Dowager suddenly

452
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,599
summon District Princess Qingyi

453
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,040
to learn from Grand Mentor Xiong
in the palace?

454
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:19,239
Sleepyhead,

455
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,959
still in bed?

456
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,920
You’ll be late for school.

457
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,640
Get up.

458
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:28,280
No!

459
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,359
(Pure and Gracious)
Your Highness,

460
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,040
here are gifts
from District Princess Qingyi.

461
00:22:32,112 --> 00:22:32,526
Oh.

462
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,309
This is Unifon clearing cream mask.

463
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:38,408
(Unifon)

464
00:22:38,408 --> 00:22:40,560
Why is this princess reaching out

465
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,040
to Grandmother?

466
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:44,079
She’s been pestering Zhao Yi.

467
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:46,680
Does she want to marry Zhao Yi?

468
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,479
Just in time.

469
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,079
I must help you.

470
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:50,920
Get up.

471
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,760
Alright.

472
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,920
I’m going to the school, Grandmother.

473
00:22:56,804 --> 00:22:58,804
(Xuanwen Hall)

474
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,239
Grand Mentor Xiong.

475
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,040
Your ladyship,

476
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,239
this is one of the best Duan ink-slab
with plum blossoms.

477
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,839
It’s too valuable.

478
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:24,760
I cannot accept it.

479
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,000
Grand Mentor,

480
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,280
it’s from my grandfather.

481
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,160
He said it’s a small gesture.

482
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:33,160
I’ve long heard of
your profound knowledge

483
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:34,479
about both the past and the present.

484
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,040
From now on, I will do my best

485
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,439
in the study.

486
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:39,119
Flattering Grand Master Xiong?

487
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:41,359
She’s such a fool.

488
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:43,079
The Empress Dowager summoned you

489
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,400
to be the Princess’s
partner in the study.

490
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,199
From now on, I hope you,

491
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,160
the Princess and Township Mistress

492
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,400
can learn more from each other.

493
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:51,439
Grand Mentor,

494
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,920
I’m here to learn from you,

495
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:55,760
not to keep the Princess company.

496
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,560
She’s not only stupid,

497
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,959
but also aggressive.

498
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:02,359
Perfect candidate for the Empress.

499
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:02,890
Mm-hmm.

500
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:05,800
Take a seat.

501
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,079
Alright, the class begins.

502
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,359
Today our lecture

503
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,640
is about this bronze mirror.

504
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,239
Grand Mentor,

505
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,959
I know this mirror.

506
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,160
It’s a bronze mirror engraved
with sacred beasts and inscriptions.

507
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,160
The inscriptions and pattern
on it are excellent.

508
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,359
The dark brown coating
by the abraded area

509
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:36,000
is smooth and shiny.

510
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:37,199
In fact,

511
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:39,839
I want you to compare this mirror

512
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,760
with humanity.

513
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
What do they have to do with each other?

514
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,560
Princess,

515
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,400
what’s your opinion?

516
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,400
A bronze mirror helps us
tidy our garments.

517
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,040
History as a mirror lets us know
how a dynasty falls.

518
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,800
People as a mirror

519
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,640
shows us the gains and losses.

520
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,959
All in all,
it’s just a mirror, isn’t it?

521
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,680
Not at all.

522
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,599
People as a mirror

523
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,839
means we should listen to others’ advice

524
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,079
and find our advantages
and disadvantages,

525
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:15,640
so that we can improve ourselves.

526
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,319
Your Grace is right.

527
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,160
So much for our lecture.

528
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Do remember

529
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,959
(Xuanwen Hall)
to review what we learned today.

530
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,560
Your Grace,

531
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:41,239
do enlighten me.

532
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,119
How do you take people as mirrors?

533
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,319
Here.

534
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,160
It slipped off my hands.

535
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,839
It’s stained.

536
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,599
You wouldn’t be angry with me,
would you?

537
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,479
Your Grace,

538
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,880
the rice paper looks so plain.

539
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,599
When I come to the palace next time,

540
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,119
I’ll bring you some from Jin County.

541
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:15,719
Their rice paper is as thin and light
as cicada wings and snowflakes.

542
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
I’m afraid there’s no
such good rice paper in the palace.

543
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,760
It doesn’t matter.
Just a piece of rice paper.

544
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,719
I have to give my regards
to Empress Dowager.

545
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,319
Good day.

546
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,359
Baoning,

547
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,400
District Princess Qingyi
is so overbearing.

548
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,079
This paper is from Jin County.

549
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:43,119
She couldn’t tell.

550
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,560
Xiaoman, let go.

551
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:56,280
Sure.

552
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:12,400
Your...

553
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:24,920
Isn’t this
His Majesty’s cricket trainer?

554
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,920
Oh no, there’s Empress Dowager’s eunuch.

555
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,079
Your Grace!

556
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:32,990
Xiaoman, let’s go back.

557
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:33,390
Huh?

558
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,599
Your Grace, wait for me!

559
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:37,501
(Gate of Divine Might)

560
00:27:38,846 --> 00:27:39,742
Flowers!

561
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:42,866
Take a look!

562
00:27:43,112 --> 00:27:44,366
Hey, the flowers are so beautiful.

563
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:44,909
Yes.

564
00:27:44,974 --> 00:27:46,369
Flowers for sale!

565
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:52,265
Hey,

566
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,479
which palace are you from?

567
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,439
Where’s your pass?

568
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,239
She’s a maid of Cining Palace.

569
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,160
The Empress Dowager ordered me

570
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,439
to go out and buy something with her.

571
00:27:59,478 --> 00:27:59,801
Oh,

572
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,040
Mr. Li.

573
00:28:01,172 --> 00:28:02,891
Flowers for sale!

574
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:03,920
What are you waiting for?

575
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:04,839
Go!

576
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:06,731
Oh.

577
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:10,299
Flowers!

578
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,880
Umbrellas!

579
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,160
Painted umbrellas!

580
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,760
Why did you sneak out this time?

581
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,599
I’m following a man.

582
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,800
A man who plays cricket fighting
with His Majesty.

583
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:30,599
This man has a princess on his tail.

584
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:32,839
He’s really something.

585
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,280
Min Zhou is following him.

586
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,439
You and I have to keep him safe.

587
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,319
Why do I feel
Your Grace is setting me up?

588
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:43,213
The flowers are beautiful.

589
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,880
Who is this man?

590
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,880
You’d better not know this.

591
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,280
I don’t even know who this person is.

592
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,520
Better stay out of it.

593
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,040
Good day.

594
00:28:56,657 --> 00:28:57,058
Hey!

595
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,079
Sit down.

596
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:01,645
Flowers for sale!

597
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:05,359
Take a look. Don’t miss it.

598
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,640
He’s Yan Huanian, a former councilor
of the Office of Grand Council.

599
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,000
He goes to the palace
as a cricket trainer

600
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,760
to teach His Majesty governance.

601
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,479
If the Empress Dowager found out

602
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:21,239
His Majesty is learning
governance in secret,

603
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,079
she’d realize he
wants to be a real ruler.

604
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,599
So we have to keep him safe.

605
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,800
The Empress Dowager
can’t know about it now.

606
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,605
(Blissful Cranes and Clouds)
Sachets!

607
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,319
Pretty sachets!

608
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,880
Maybe they’ve left the palace.

609
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,520
No way.

610
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,439
I saw them in the Imperial Garden.

611
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:45,760
If they leave,

612
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,640
they have to take the path
to the Gate of Divine Might.

613
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:50,040
I came out via an alley
in Shoukang Palace.

614
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,160
I’m faster than them.

615
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,599
Take a look, lady.

616
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:53,986
(Land of Talent and Bliss)
Let’s go.

617
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:56,640
It’s said the teahouse serves great tea.

618
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,439
Really?

619
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,800
It’s just up ahead.

620
00:29:59,199 --> 00:29:59,959
Let’s go.

621
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,818
(Land of Talent and Bliss)

622
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:06,386
Flowers!

623
00:30:06,386 --> 00:30:08,501
(Blissful Cranes and Clouds)

624
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,800
This is Min Zhou’s carriage.

625
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:19,400
Do you have any silver taels?

626
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:21,280
Hurry!

627
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,400
I’ll go distract Min Zhou.

628
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,599
Protect Yan Huanian in the chaos.

629
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,760
Let’s meet up here later.

630
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:27,959
Wait, but...

631
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:37,920
Whose horse is it?

632
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,800
It’s mine.

633
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,640
I’ll buy it.

634
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,959
Get out of the way!

635
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,920
Move!

636
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,319
Get away from there!

637
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:04,839
Watch out!

638
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,400
You’re useless!

639
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,359
Idiot!

640
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,359
You...

641
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:01,920
Who are you?

642
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:04,040
Mr. Yan, you’re followed.

643
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,570
Huh?

644
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:25,400
What a surprise, Your Grace!

645
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,680
What happened to your wrist?

646
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,680
I might have sprained it on the horse.

647
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:32,959
Thank you.

648
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:34,079
Or I’d have died.

649
00:32:36,065 --> 00:32:36,638
By the way,

650
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,439
why is Your Grace dressed up like this?

651
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:44,640
I heard there’s a lion dance today.

652
00:32:45,337 --> 00:32:47,538
So I sneaked out to watch it.

653
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,680
Well, look,

654
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,199
my maid must be looking for me.

655
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:53,119
I have to go.

656
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:54,079
Good day.

657
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,520
Your Grace, I...

658
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,119
All done with Yan Huanian?

659
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,599
Rest assured, Your Grace.

660
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,760
I’ve escorted Mr. Yan home safely,

661
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:08,680
with no one on our tail.

662
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,520
Good.

663
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,640
How did things go with Your Grace?

664
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,160
I thought riding a horse should be easy.

665
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,680
It’s actually quite difficult.

666
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:20,367
So you don’t know how to ride a horse.

667
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,199
What happened to your hand?

668
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,280
It’s nothing.

669
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,439
I sprained it when I was riding.

670
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:30,680
Luckily, no harm is done.

671
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:34,920
You’re a noble.

672
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,719
Allow me to do it for you.

673
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:41,324
Here.

674
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,479
What do you mean?

675
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:47,040
You have sprained your right hand.

676
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,560
If you sprain your left hand too,

677
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:49,760
I’ll be in huge trouble.

678
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Leave it to me.

679
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,920
What are you implying?

680
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,719
Your Grace,

681
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,560
allow me to teach you riding someday.

682
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,239
I don’t need you

683
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,320
to teach me.

684
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,040
Don’t underestimate me, Your Grace.

685
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,120
My horsemanship is unbeatable

686
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,239
in Mu’an.

687
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,439
What a blowhard!

688
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,399
Then it’s a deal.

689
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,520
When I’m free,

690
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:33,919
I’ll teach you to ride a horse.

691
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,371
(Li’s Mansion)

692
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,879
Your Excellency,

693
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,080
this is my prescription for the Madam.

694
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,239
Take the medicines on time,

695
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:56,280
and Madam’s illness can be alleviated.

696
00:34:56,582 --> 00:34:57,067
Good.

697
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,959
Thank you so much, Miss Gao.

698
00:34:59,159 --> 00:34:59,719
Mr. Wang.

699
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,600
You are?

700
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,879
You are

701
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,760
Li Qian who saved Empress Dowager
from the assassin?

702
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,080
That’s me.

703
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,879
But what brings you here, Mr. Wang?

704
00:35:15,919 --> 00:35:17,840
It’s said Miss Gao is a great physician.

705
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,199
I know she came to the capital,

706
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,280
so I took my long-suffering mother

707
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:22,120
here for treatment.

708
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,639
Today Miss Gao

709
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,239
has proved herself to be
an exceptional physician.

710
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,760
I’m flattered, Your Excellency.

711
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,367
I’m just doing my job.

712
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:30,940
Mm-hmm.

713
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,800
We’ll have to come by someday.

714
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,760
Well, I won’t take more of your time.

715
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:39,000
I have to take my mother home
for some rest.

716
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Sure, let me see you out.

717
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,439
Thanks.

718
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,159
Be careful, Mother.

719
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:47,879
This way, please.

720
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:48,600
Sure.

721
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,239
Miaorong,

722
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,439
my friend suffered a sprain
on horseback.

723
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,040
Can you make some ointment

724
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,040
for it?

725
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,719
Sure, where is the sprain?

726
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:06,421
Here.

727
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:08,959
Alright, I see.

728
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,000
When it’s done,

729
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,320
I’ll deliver it to you.

730
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,236
Thanks.

731
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,959
Baoning, what a surprise!

732
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,040
Grandmother said it’s hot

733
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,360
and asked me to bring
some chilled fruit over.

734
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,560
Xiaoman, get it to the kitchen.

735
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:32,919
Baoning,

736
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,040
you can have a servant bring it over.

737
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,479
You don’t have to come.

738
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,840
You cannot learn from that man anymore.

739
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,080
Empress Dowager had somebody

740
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,399
following the cricket trainer.

741
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,159
What did you say?

742
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,800
I saw Min Zhou following him today.

743
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,479
That means Empress Dowager
has become suspicious.

744
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,239
I managed to keep
the secret for you today.

745
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:51,600
But I don’t know if I can next time.

746
00:36:52,497 --> 00:36:52,981
Right.

747
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,840
Baoning, it’s so good to have you.

748
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,280
Anyway,

749
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:58,280
you might not be able

750
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,000
to invite him over to your quarters.

751
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:01,615
Mm-hmm.

752
00:37:02,077 --> 00:37:02,716
I understand.

753
00:37:05,425 --> 00:37:06,080
By the way, Baoning.

754
00:37:07,782 --> 00:37:09,159
My mother

755
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,120
has agreed on our marriage.

756
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,040
So I’ll ask the Astrology Office

757
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,719
to pick an auspicious day...

758
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,360
Well,

759
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,840
you’ll probably have to

760
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,719
find another cricket trainer

761
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,199
as distraction

762
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:23,199
until Empress Dowager
is out of disbelief.

763
00:37:24,124 --> 00:37:24,611
Alright.

764
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,080
You’re the smartest.

765
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:26,987
I’ll do as you say.

766
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:34,454
(May Everyone Benefit from Your Virtue)

767
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,280
Qian!

768
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,199
Qian.

769
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:47,470
Miaorong.

770
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,439
I got the ointment you asked for.

771
00:37:50,439 --> 00:37:50,972
Here.

772
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,600
I was just going to find you.

773
00:37:57,271 --> 00:37:57,793
Thank you.

774
00:37:59,562 --> 00:38:00,196
Hey,

775
00:38:00,993 --> 00:38:01,919
it’s late.

776
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:05,040
And you’re delivering it to your friend?

777
00:38:05,706 --> 00:38:06,560
I’ll be back soon.

778
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,719
Wei Shu.

779
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,807
Miss Gao.

780
00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:20,800
Qian said

781
00:38:20,919 --> 00:38:23,360
he’s going to deliver the ointment
to a friend.

782
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,439
Let me ask you.

783
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,040
Who are his friends in the capital?

784
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,879
We don’t know a lot of people here.

785
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,000
Could be his colleagues in the palace.

786
00:38:32,995 --> 00:38:33,567
Oh.

787
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,199
Alright then.

788
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,120
What’s that sound?

789
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,199
Qingke.

790
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:54,159
I want to go to sleep.

791
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,080
You may leave.

792
00:38:56,693 --> 00:38:57,600
Yes.

793
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:14,040
Li Qian.

794
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,760
How do you know it’s me, Your Grace?

795
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,919
It’s Shoukang Palace.

796
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,879
No one would break in except you.

797
00:39:25,788 --> 00:39:26,280
You...

798
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,280
What are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

799
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:32,439
Well, you were hurt last time
you sneaked out.

800
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,959
I guess you won’t seek
an imperial physician’s help.

801
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:42,000
This ointment is for your sprain.

802
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,560
Why don’t you try it later?

803
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,600
Your Highness.

804
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:49,360
No, no, no!

805
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:51,320
There must be a lot of people out here.

806
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,719
Hurry up!

807
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,177
Get on.

808
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,399
Baoning,

809
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,360
you turned in so early.

810
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:20,080
Are you uncomfortable?

811
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,080
Grandmother, don’t get close to me.

812
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,760
Yes.

813
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,320
Nothing misses your eyes.

814
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:31,399
I caught a cold.

815
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,719
So don’t come any closer.

816
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:34,040
I’m afraid I’ll infect you.

817
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,360
How did the Princess catch a cold?

818
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,239
Pardon me, Your Highness.

819
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,280
Grandmother,

820
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,760
don’t blame them.

821
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,800
It’s me.

822
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,840
I played too long in the cold wind.

823
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,360
But it’s just a cough.

824
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,959
I’ve had Liu Xiaoman get some medicines.

825
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,520
Are you feeling terrible?

826
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:05,239
No.

827
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,320
I’m just

828
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,159
a little drowsy.

829
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,399
Then get some sleep.

830
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,800
Maybe you’ll be better when you wake up.

831
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:16,760
Yes.

832
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,159
If it doesn’t get better,

833
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:21,239
you’ll have to get the chief physician.

834
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,080
Sure.

835
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,600
Qingke, escort my grandmother back.

836
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:26,800
Yes.

837
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,840
Good night then.

838
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:31,419
Mm-hmm.

839
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,159
