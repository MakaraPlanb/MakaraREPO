Come on!

29
00:02:01,076 --> 00:02:02,575
Yes!

30
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:04,640
Nice!

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,850
Are you alright, Su?

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,520
Relax.

33
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,240
They’re far away from us.

34
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:10,280
Good!

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,720
I just can’t.

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,650
Great!

37
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,700
Sachets and pendants!

38
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,720
Take a look!

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,880
Careful.

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
I remember that year,

41
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,200
we met right here
at the Lantern Festival

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,360
as if it happened yesterday.

43
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,450
Su,

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,760
you know,

45
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,520
the moment the mask was off,

46
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,400
I knew I found the love of my life.

47
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,440
I can’t

48
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,680
live the way I wanted,

49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,760
but luckily, I have you by my side.

50
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,440
We only

51
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,320
live once.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,160
All I want

53
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,760
is to grow old with you and only you.

54
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,480
Xuan, how about we fly a lantern?

55
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,300
Sure.

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:35,375
(Qinzheng Hall)

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,360
Please tell His Majesty that I’m here.

58
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:39,600
Your Highness,

59
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,800
His Majesty is going through reports.

60
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,120
Your Highness.

61
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,200
I know.

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,040
Just go.

63
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:48,000
Uh...

64
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,800
Yes.

65
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,400
Your Highness,

66
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,000
His Majesty has a rule

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,800
against women’s disturbance at work.

68
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,160
You’ve made mistakes there before.

69
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,080
Have you not learned anything?

70
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,520
No, he’ll let me in today.

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,680
Your Majesty,

72
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,800
Her Highness requests to see you.

73
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,880
The rule exists for a reason.

74
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,840
Do I have to tell you again?

75
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,040
I’m sorry

76
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,480
but Her Highness insists.

77
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,840
I’ll tell her to leave then.

78
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,840
Wait.

79
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,520
What’s the date today?

80
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,600
Today is...

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,000
October 2nd, Your Majesty.

82
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,160
That explains it.

83
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,520
It’s still three months away.

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,960
What’s the rush?

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Taste it, Your Majesty.

86
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,600
With the arrival of autumn,

87
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,280
your birthday is also near.

88
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,000
How do you want to celebrate it?

89
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,960
Your Majesty,

90
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,920
there are still three months.

91
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,240
I’m surprised that you remember it.

92
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,080
That’s enough to make me happy.

93
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,080
No, it’s not.

94
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,640
You’re the Empress.

95
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,600
Your birthday celebration is on schedule

96
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
and it must be big.

97
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,800
Inform the Ministry of Rites

98
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,400
about everything you need.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,400
There will be a grand celebration.

100
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

101
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,400
If you don’t mind,

102
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,760
I still have work to do.

103
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,360
Good day, Your Majesty.

104
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,040
See? Look at her!

105
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,360
Hasn’t she changed?

106
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,040
She’s learned something over the years

107
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,880
and she can finally toe the line.

108
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,880
Her Highness is endowed with wit,

109
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,920
and she’s a perfect match for you.

110
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,120
You two are so sweet together.

111
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,440
That’s enough. Don’t exaggerate it.

112
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,200
Listen,

113
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,200
her birthday celebration

114
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,960
is a priority.

115
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,080
After all,

116
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,080
she represents our state

117
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
and me.

118
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,800
Envoys will also be in town

119
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,480
in a few days.

120
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,280
It’s a chance for us

121
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,120
to get down to business,

122
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,880
such as buying war-horses from them

123
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,640
which I’ve been trying for years.

124
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,840
The last thing I need

125
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,280
is Han Tongxin stirring up trouble.

126
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,640
I understand.

127
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,160
That’s great news!

128
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,640
Have you sent a message to your parents?

129
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,480
I already have.

130
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,480
Good. I’m so happy for you.

131
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,480
Since you and Baoning
got married,

132
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,160
my place looks empty all of a sudden.

133
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,960
No one else will play games with me.

134
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,560
Your Highness...

135
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,880
I’m old enough

136
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,800
to realize

137
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,320
that people come and go in our life.

138
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,160
We’re happy about the reunion
and sad about the separation.

139
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,920
Your Highness,

140
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,800
I’ll come more often for Baoning

141
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,120
to keep you company.

142
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,520
Fangling,

143
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,080
bring it in.

144
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,125
Yes.

145
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,050
Have some tea.

146
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,400
I’ve prepared something

147
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,160
for your baby

148
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,160
on the way.

149
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,650
Thank you, Your Highness.

150
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,720
It’s like you were a baby yesterday,

151
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,960
and now, you’re having your own baby.

152
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,160
I won’t be with you for too long.

153
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,400
Still, I’m glad
to see the next generation.

154
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,920
Cute umbrellas! Come and take a look!

155
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,520
Her Highness’s gifts are so delicate.

156
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,560
The longevity locket
is even embedded with agate.

157
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
That’s luxurious.

158
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,440
Her Highness does care about you.

159
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,799
Since Baoning moved to Bingzhou,

160
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,775
Her Highness must’ve felt lonely.

161
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,280
When the baby is born,

162
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,360
I’ll take him or her

163
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,760
to Her Highness’s chamber

164
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,175
so that she can enjoy

165
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,175
having another child in her life.

166
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,720
Wendie.

167
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,375
Yes.

168
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,655
Tell the groom

169
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,000
to stop at the fabric shop.

170
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,040
The locket and bracelets are exquisite.

171
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,240
I’d like to

172
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,880
pick up matching baby clothes.

173
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,040
Sir,

174
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,525
let’s go to Jinxiu Fabric Shop.

175
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,560
Yes, Miss Wendie.

176
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,480
There’s a boy!

177
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,240
My lady!

178
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,640
Are you alright, my lady?

179
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,720
Did you get hurt?

180
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,400
My lady!

181
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,000
Anybody there!

182
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,120
Help!

183
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,760
Xuan.

184
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,450
Mother.

185
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,720
- Where’s Su?
- Madam.

186
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,000
Su?

187
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,160
She went to pay respects
to Grand Empress Dowager.

188
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,040
Look at you.

189
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,680
You finally have a day off.

190
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,200
Why aren’t you resting?

191
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,680
What are you doing?

192
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,680
I’m making a swing for Su and our baby.

193
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,320
When spring comes,

194
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,320
they can enjoy flowers in the yard

195
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,560
and red leaves

196
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,680
in autumn.

197
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,760
You’re a good husband.

198
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,650
Go on.

199
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,760
Go! Go! This way.

200
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,240
What happened?

201
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,000
She... she was in the carriage

202
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,200
- when it jolted,
- Su!

203
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,200
- and then there was blood.
- Su!

204
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,280
- Su!
- I’ve had them call Physician Wang.

205
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:07,960
Su!

206
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,640
- Go!
- Su!

207
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,650
Please.

208
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:16,850
Is everything alright?

209
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,280
How are they, Physician Wang?

210
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,760
I’m sorry

211
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,200
about the loss of her baby.

212
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,440
Su,

213
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,925
you’ll have more babies.

214
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,520
There, there.

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,360
We love it

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,320
but we love you more.

217
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,840
Babies or not,

218
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,480
they aren’t as important as Xuan and Su.

219
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
Marchioness,

220
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,800
let’s give them the room.

221
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,600
They probably need some space.

222
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,880
Sure.

223
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,000
Keep yourself warm.

224
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,960
Mother.

225
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,400
Xuan,

226
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,120
take good care of Su.

227
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:35,650
I will.

228
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,920
It’s my fault

229
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,560
that we lost our baby.

230
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,120
That’s not true.

231
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,920
Don’t beat yourself up.

232
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,080
Su,

233
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,720
your safety

234
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,000
matters more than anything else.

235
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,040
If

236
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,200
anything happened to you,

237
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,280
I can’t imagine

238
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,000
life without you.

239
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,120
Listen,

240
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,160
you mean

241
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,900
the most to me.

242
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,925
(Li’s Mansion)

243
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,120
How can I help you?

244
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,960
I’m not talking to you.

245
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,640
Go

246
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,520
tell your master and his son

247
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,680
that Liu Guirong is here.

248
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,560
Please wait here.

249
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,960
Guirong.

250
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,920
Yes?

251
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,520
Long time no see.

252
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,080
Indeed.

253
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,320
You were still in split pants
the last time I saw you.

254
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,120
And now, you’re even taller than me

255
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
and married.

256
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,720
True.

257
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,720
How time flies, right?

258
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,680
You must be doing good, too.

259
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,680
I wouldn’t be here if I was.

260
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,080
Heaven took my father
and everything else away from me.

261
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,200
Poor me!

262
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,840
Guirong,

263
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,120
if you need help,

264
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,240
don’t hesitate to ask.

265
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,720
We’ll see what we can do.

266
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,360
Help?

267
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,440
What does that mean?

268
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
If you offer to help me,

269
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,840
I’ll be straight with you then.

270
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,440
You’ve been neglecting me

271
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,025
all these years

272
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,440
since my father

273
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,440
died for nothing.

274
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,800
I’m old enough to marry

275
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,720
but that’s long overdue.

276
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,640
How are you

277
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,000
going to help me with that?

278
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,240
Guirong,

279
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,720
I bought you

280
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,760
farmland years ago, didn’t I?

281
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,480
Don’t get me started on that!

282
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,480
It’s too poor to produce anything.

283
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,760
Besides,

284
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,280
I’m all alone.

285
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,480
I can’t do all the farm work on my own.

286
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,175
I understand.

287
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,120
Farming is definitely not

288
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,320
a one-man job.

289
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,840
How about this?

290
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,440
You’ve just arrived.

291
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,720
Why don’t you get some rest?

292
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,560
We can talk about it later.

293
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,440
Alright?

294
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,240
Hey,

295
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,600
I need food, too.

296
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,160
I haven’t had anything for a day.

297
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,000
I’d like roast chicken, beef,

298
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,960
oh,

299
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,520
and liquor.

300
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,800
No problem.

301
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,040
Servant!

302
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,200
Show our guest to his room.

303
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,880
Yes.

304
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,160
By the way,

305
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
I’m all raggedy

306
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,520
without more clothes.

307
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,440
Can you give me yours?

308
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,440
Sure.

309
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,080
I’ll have them

310
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,960
make new ones in your size

311
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,080
so that you can get changed.

312
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,720
I’ll take them.

313
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,920
Thank you.

314
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,560
What kind of person is he, darling?

315
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,560
Is he a rascal or what?

316
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,920
Liu Xiaoman told me what happened.

317
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,600
What’s so special about Liu Guirong

318
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,360
that Father and Mother are in his pocket

319
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,640
and even you give him new clothes?

320
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,720
Not exactly.

321
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,320
It’s not that we’re in his pocket.

322
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,040
His father

323
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,320
was my father’s right-handed man

324
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,480
who devoted his life to our family.

325
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,960
He died for my father

326
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,720
in the battle of Yongqing,

327
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,800
so

328
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,720
we’re in his debt.

329
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,080
You know my father.

330
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,000
He hates ingrates most.

331
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,900
That’s why he indulges Liu Guirong

332
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,400
no matter how far he goes.

333
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,850
That rogue

334
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,400
knows Father is too kind

335
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,600
and keeps exploiting his kindness.

336
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,400
He lost his father when he was little

337
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,640
and had a pretty tough life.

338
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,120
My father

339
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,960
felt sorry for him and his mother,

340
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,320
so he bought land and a house

341
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,200
for them at their hometown.

342
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,440
But shortly after that,

343
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,440
his mother died of illness, too.

344
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,320
Since then, he’s been all alone

345
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,080
and fooling around every day,

346
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,400
leaving that land

347
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,319
wasted.

348
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,800
This blackmail must stop,

349
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,880
or he’ll take your help for granted

350
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,119
and keep asking you

351
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,680
for more and more.

352
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,440
That won’t end well.

353
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,599
I understand what you said,

354
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,720
but we can’t put the cards on the table.

355
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,240
Don’t worry.

356
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,560
I’ll talk to Father

357
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,320
and see how it goes.

358
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,640
Fine. Let’s go.

359
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,450
Sure.

360
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,925
If you ask me,

361
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,500
just give him some money

362
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,200
and cut him loose.

363
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,280
No way!

364
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,000
It’s easy for you to say that.

365
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,920
Our money doesn’t grow on trees.

366
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,120
I disagree!

367
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,440
Even if we paid him,

368
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,560
he’d squander it away

369
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,320
and come back for more.

370
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,600
Hear that?

371
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,080
What happened to Guirong?

372
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,560
He’s got nothing good from his father.

373
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,080
How about

374
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,800
we give him a job?

375
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,040
We can do that,

376
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
but look at him!

377
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,520
What... what can he do?

378
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,000
We’ll still have to
pay the price in the end.

379
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,840
Dongzhi’s idea isn’t too bad.

380
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:39,680
Yes.

381
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,840
He’s got no skills.

382
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,760
We can arrange something easy
to keep him busy

383
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,680
before we find the right job for him.

384
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,040
Let’s help him one last time.

385
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,560
If he’s still greedy

386
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,920
and ungrateful,

387
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,760
he’s on his own.

388
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,000
Want some sunflower seeds, Miss?

389
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,840
Leave the shells in the dustpan.

390
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,120
Relax. I’ll clean them up.

391
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,320
A job will settle Liu Guirong down,

392
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,575
won’t it?

393
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,920
I hope so.

394
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,040
It’s the best we can do for now.

395
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,640
Father is soft with him
for old times’ sake.

396
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,920
If he can go hard on him this time,

397
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,120
maybe we’ll get rid of him forever.

398
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,560
Or if he turns over a new leaf,

399
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,600
I’ll certainly

400
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,040
give him a good job.

401
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,925
Right.

402
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,000
Madam,

403
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,600
are you still mad?

404
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,320
Given that man’s father

405
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,520
saved Master’s life,

406
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,160
the Li Family owes him.

407
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,400
We can’t make light of this matter.

408
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,560
Master values his name most.

409
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
Liu Guirong can say whatever he wants.

410
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,880
If he goes out and blabbers,

411
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,760
others might call us the bully.

412
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,680
That’s what I’m worried about.

413
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,440
Master is deeply troubled about it

414
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,160
and so am I.

415
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,680
If he were any less lazy and annoying,

416
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,560
I’d give him a helping hand.

417
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,280
But he certainly doesn’t deserve it.

418
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,240
What to do?

419
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,480
Madam, is he craving a wife?

420
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,760
He keeps complaining
about being single, right?

421
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,720
Once he gets married,

422
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,600
settles down, and has his own family,

423
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,840
that’ll probably give him hope.

424
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,560
If everything else fails,

425
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,320
we can set him up

426
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,960
with a maid.

427
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,440
We don’t have any but we can ask others.

428
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,640
Then he’ll go away.

429
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,440
You have a point.

430
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,160
There’s no harm

431
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,200
in trying it, I guess.

432
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,920
Let’s give it a shot.

433
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,240
It’s sad that you are still single

434
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600
at this age.

435
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,800
That’s right.

436
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,640
Madam,

437
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,640
you touched a soft spot.

438
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,080
You don’t know what I’ve been through.

439
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,560
The matchmaker
once introduced a girl to me,

440
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,960
but she ran away

441
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,640
because I was down and out.

442
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,100
I have an idea.

443
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,520
I’ll find you

444
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,320
a maid at your age.

445
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,640
Once you two are together,

446
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,560
you can do business

447
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,560
or go in for farming.

448
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,040
You’ll have a family.

449
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,360
That’d be great.

450
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,600
(Choose and Follow What is Right)
Thank you in advance, Madam.

451
00:21:46,325 --> 00:21:47,280
(Li’s Mansion)

452
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,000
Night watchman?

453
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,560
That’s your job for me?

454
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,400
Guirong, here’s the thing.

455
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,240
You came all of a sudden

456
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,680
when all the posts

457
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,120
had been taken

458
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,000
other than the night watchman.

459
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,280
That’s pure legwork.

460
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,800
An old geezer can do that.

461
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,320
Guirong,

462
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,280
you’re wrong.

463
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,040
A night watchman

464
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,960
must be young and strong.

465
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,160
Think about it.

466
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,440
You need to patrol and tell time.

467
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,920
Without you,

468
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,080
people would be lost in time.

469
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
Your job is crucial.

470
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,680
It’s more important than you thought.

471
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,360
Guirong, that post is only temporary

472
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,320
before you’re transferred

473
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,840
to a better one,

474
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,150
you know?

475
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,920
Fine. I’ll give it a go.

476
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,160
But if it’s long hours and low paid,

477
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
I’m out.

478
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,720
All is safe!

479
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,640
I need to get some rest.

480
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:13,575
Hey.

481
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,300
What do you want?

482
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Miss Qingke,

483
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,120
don’t I look good

484
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,600
in this uniform?

485
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,360
We make a perfect match, don’t we?

486
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,840
Trust me.

487
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,800
Even if I’m on the rise,

488
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,240
I won’t dump you.

489
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,600
What nonsense are you talking about?

490
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
Do you even know who you are?

491
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,325
Go away!

492
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,120
I don’t know what to do.

493
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,640
How dare he!

494
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,920
Relax. I’m here for you.

495
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:51,875
I know.

496
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,000
Look,

497
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,760
try to stay away from him

498
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,440
and ignore him.

499
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,480
That’s what I’ve been doing!

500
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,000
But he’s brazen enough

501
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,800
to harass me.

502
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,080
Then stay with me

503
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
for the next couple of days.

504
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,640
I’ll find a way to kick him

505
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,800
out of this mansion forever.

506
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:10,250
Thanks.

507
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,575
There, there.

508
00:24:15,575 --> 00:24:19,950
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)

509
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,120
He’s way crossed the line!

510
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,080
What’s gotten into him?

511
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,920
It’s better

512
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,240
that he moves out.

513
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,200
Having a stranger at home

514
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,800
is inconvenient.

515
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:31,700
I know.

516
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,520
I’ll handle it.

517
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,160
I’ll talk to Father first thing tomorrow

518
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,840
to find him a place outside.

519
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,440
Don’t worry too much.

520
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,760
Despite

521
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,920
his frivolous talk,

522
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,560
he wouldn’t dare to do anything.

523
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,000
You don’t know that.

524
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,040
Your ethics don’t apply to him.

525
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,040
He’s a boor.

526
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,800
Let him out as soon as possible.

527
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:54,925
I will.

528
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,800
Also, I heard

529
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,680
that he always leaves early

530
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,040
and he was late for work last night,

531
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,120
doing heaven knows what.

532
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,350
(Li’s Mansion)

533
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,600
Liu Guirong,

534
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,040
your behavior is unacceptable!

535
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,560
Do you know what happened

536
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,400
when you were absent
from work last night?

537
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,200
Mr. Li’s warehouse got robbed!

538
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,920
What a coincidence

539
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:21,315
that it happened during my absence!

540
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,560
What about guards on the night shift?

541
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,120
They needed to hear from you, too!

542
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,600
Guirong,

543
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,280
you’ll be fired

544
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,680
after what happened last night.

545
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,280
Can’t wait for it.

546
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,000
I’m sick of staying up outside all night

547
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,240
while you sleep soundly at home.

548
00:25:38,925 --> 00:25:39,720
You know what?

549
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,000
Forget about the job.

550
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,440
Give me money

551
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,080
and Miss Qingke instead.

552
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,880
What?

553
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,520
In your dreams!

554
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,560
Qingke is my maid. No one can touch her!

555
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,880
Madam He has promised me!

556
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,440
I...

557
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,560
She pities me

558
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
and intends to set me up with a maid.

559
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,440
I don’t need others.

560
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,320
Miss Qingke is good enough.

561
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,160
If you give me what I want,

562
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,480
I’ll be on my way.

563
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,200
If you don’t,

564
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,640
I’ll never leave!

565
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,760
I didn’t promise you any money

566
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,225
or the maid.

567
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,040
Whoever you like is your business.

568
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,840
Stop making a scene!

569
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,720
You can’t force anyone to marry you!

570
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,080
I don’t care!

571
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,440
Madam He has made a promise.

572
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,280
Does that mean nothing?

573
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,160
No one’s promise does!

574
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,560
Miss Qingke is Baoning’s maid.

575
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,480
No one can decide her marriage

576
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,640
other than Her Grace.

577
00:26:37,775 --> 00:26:38,455
Let’s go.

578
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:41,900
Hey!

579
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,080
Uh...

580
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,880
Baoning.

581
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,075
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)

582
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,000
Hey,

583
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,760
taste the new dessert

584
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,560
and see if you like it.

585
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,440
It’s sweet!

586
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,800
Just one bite, please!

587
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,040
Don’t be mad.

588
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,000
Your health matters most.

589
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,080
Hadn’t you been relatively fair,

590
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,800
I’d be even madder!

591
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,440
What was Mother thinking?

592
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,640
How could she give in
to such an unreasonable demand?

593
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,840
She was misled.

594
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,320
She wasn’t thinking too much

595
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,960
and got used by him.

596
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,320
I can’t believe

597
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,680
a lowly thug like him

598
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,120
would dream so high.

599
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,640
He’s indeed pathetic and disgusting.

600
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,600
Where was he in the middle of the night

601
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,440
when he didn’t show up for work?

602
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:43,000
He could be at so many places.

603
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,400
Who knows what he was doing?

604
00:27:47,025 --> 00:27:47,600
Hey,

605
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:49,280
have some tea to appease yourself.

606
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,960
Take a look.

607
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,080
Not good enough.

608
00:27:57,975 --> 00:27:58,688
I’ll wrap it up for you.

609
00:27:58,688 --> 00:27:59,528
This one.

610
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:00,625
Thanks.

611
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:04,025
I like this one.

612
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:06,225
Stop looking at that one.

613
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,225
Sure.

614
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,525
Come on.

615
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:11,225
Let’s go.

616
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:12,350
This one is cute.

617
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,025
That one looks special.

618
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:17,575
A meat bun, please.

619
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,250
Sure. Here you are.

620
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,040
Let’s go.

621
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,525
Here you are.

622
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,475
Thanks. Good day.

623
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
Dongdong and I staked out
that house until dark.

624
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,480
That’s where he lives.

625
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,720
Are you sure?

626
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,720
And there’s a woman inside.

627
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,080
My guess is

628
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,160
that she’s Liu Guirong’s wife.

629
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,960
We must get to the bottom of those two

630
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,640
no matter what it takes.

631
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,440
Have someone look into that woman

632
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,920
and see if they’re married.

633
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,160
If they are,

634
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,760
don’t spook anyone.

635
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,160
We better wait

636
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,280
until Liu Guirong lowers his guard

637
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,400
and leaves a trail.

638
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,520
I see.

639
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,800
I’ll have them go there tomorrow.

640
00:29:21,258 --> 00:29:27,612
(Li’s Mansion)

641
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,960
Guirong.

642
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,800
Hi, Qian.

643
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,080
I’m still waiting.

644
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
When are you going to

645
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,960
carry out Madam He’s promise?

646
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,760
I know.

647
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,225
Be patient, though.

648
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,160
Getting married is no small matter.

649
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,520
A lot of preparations must be done.

650
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
Miss Qingke

651
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,840
is Her Grace’s maid.

652
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,960
She isn’t like anyone.

653
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,480
But I promise

654
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,520
I’ll do anything
to help you two together.

655
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,560
Before that,

656
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,920
please do me a favor

657
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,360
and sign this paper.

658
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,240
Sign what?

659
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:04,800
Show him.

660
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,600
What’s this?

661
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,560
It’s your profile

662
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,880
including your name and place of birth

663
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,200
for you to verify.

664
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,920
Read it to me. I can’t read or write

665
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,920
other than my own name.

666
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,000
Sure. No problem.

667
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,280
My name is Liu Guirong.

668
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,010
Yes.

669
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,440
I’m from Tiandi Village.

670
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
My parents have both died.

671
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,840
I own half an acre of farmland

672
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,200
and a tile-roofed house
with three rooms.

673
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
I’m still single.

674
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,640
What’s written above is all true.

675
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,680
All correct.

676
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,440
Put your name on it then.

677
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,320
Sure. No problem.

678
00:30:45,275 --> 00:30:47,400
Here, take a look.

679
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,320
Good. I’ll take care of the rest.

680
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,920
Thanks.

681
00:30:53,575 --> 00:30:55,075
(Letter of Divorce
Mudan failed as my wife...)

682
00:30:55,075 --> 00:30:56,550
(Hence this Letter of Divorce.
Liu Guirong)

683
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,400
You’re good!

684
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,760
A fake Letter of Divorce!

685
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,880
If his wife finds out

686
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,560
he’s divorcing her,

687
00:31:10,025 --> 00:31:11,480
she’ll definitely make a scene.

688
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,400
His wife can catch him in the act

689
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,120
tomorrow!

690
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,175
(Li’s Mansion)

691
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,300
Where’s Miss Qingke?

692
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,280
I’m not seeing her.

693
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,480
She’ll come in a minute. Be patient.

694
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,680
Of course.

695
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,400
We’ll become a family soon.

696
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,040
She can take her time.

697
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,320
It’s right there after the turn.

698
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,320
Right ahead of us.

699
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,960
Mudan!

700
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,840
Mudan!

701
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,320
I mean, what’s done is done.

702
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,480
You can talk to Guirong nicely.

703
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,160
Why bother? I’ll kill him!

704
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,120
How dare you, Liu Guirong!

705
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,450
Hey,

706
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,200
what do you have

707
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,640
to support Qingke once you’re married?

708
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,960
That’s not your concern.

709
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Once she’s my wife,

710
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,960
I’ll treat her well.

711
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,920
I’ll only love her.

712
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,840
Then... what about your wife at home?

713
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:21,720
You have a wife?

714
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,520
- That’s not true!
- What’s going on?

715
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,440
Stop lying!

716
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,000
I’m single.

717
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,240
Liar!

718
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,520
How dare you cheat on me!

719
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,575
No, wait...

720
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:38,560
I can explain...

721
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,400
You cheating bastard!

722
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,280
I’m telling you,

723
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,840
you can’t get rid of me! Not a chance!

724
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,400
No...

725
00:32:46,275 --> 00:32:46,850
Move!

726
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:47,850
Easy!

727
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,400
He’s gone. You can stop worrying.

728
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,720
Your Grace!

729
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,520
I said you’d be fine. See?

730
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,800
Your Grace,

731
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,025
I could never repay you
for your kindness.

732
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,360
Then you’ll have to marry me.

733
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,375
No! No!

734
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,725
Qingke!

735
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,840
Qingke, come back!

736
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,520
Guirong, are you alright?

737
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,900
Guirong,

738
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
we’re sorry

739
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,960
that you lost your father too young,

740
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,080
but my father hates to
see you go astray.

741
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,600
This is the last time

742
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,000
we give you money.

743
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:49,800
- Take it.
- You...

744
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,000
Go home with your wife

745
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,240
and take good care of your land.

746
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,640
You’ll live well.

747
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,080
But if you attempt to
harass our family again,

748
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,120
we won’t let it slide.

749
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,600
Qian,

750
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,680
thank you so much.

751
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,440
I won’t do it again.

752
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,800
Thank you, Qian,

753
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,120
and Master.

754
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,040
I’ll leave in a few days.

755
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,120
Alright. Just...

756
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,080
- Get up.
- Liu Guirong!

757
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,520
Where are you? Come here now!

758
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,600
Yes, yes, I’m here! Coming!

759
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,080
- Coming, coming!
- Come in!

760
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,120
Do I have to beat you up again?

761
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,040
Where were you?

762
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:21,840
Please stop!

763
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,480
What were you doing?

764
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,560
- I’m sorry!
- What now?

765
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,840
Have you learned your lesson?

766
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,520
- In the autumn
- Father!

767
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,920
of the 3rd Year of Zhending Reign,
the nonstop heavy rain

768
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,320
- leads to the flooding of the Yellow River.
- Father!

769
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:53,199
28 towns, 4 counties and 3 provinces
are damaged.

770
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,960
- 140,000 hectares of land are soaked
- Father!

771
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,840
in water
that could go 10 meters deep.

772
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,840
More than 50,000 offices
and houses are destroyed.

773
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,040
(Bingzhou City)
Thousands of people have drowned.

774
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,840
Tons of civilians are struggling.

775
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,200
However, a flood is like a war.

776
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,560
Many will suffer. I urge you

777
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,760
to take action quickly.

778
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,400
My respects to you, Your Majesty.

779
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,600
Rise.

780
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

781
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,680
People are homeless and destitute
because of the flood.

782
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,000
Coordinate with the Ministry of Revenue
on disaster relief soon.

783
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

784
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,200
The flood is severe

785
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,600
and the affected area is huge.

786
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,320
Even if we give it our all,

787
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,520
it’ll take a considerable amount of time

788
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,920
to restore everyone’s livelihood.

789
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,800
I see. I understand.

790
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,680
Do your best.

791
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:05,640
Yes.

792
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,080
This is as clear as water.

793
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,520
We need more rice!

794
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,280
Yes!

795
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,324
- At this point,
- That’s right!

796
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,840
you should be grateful

797
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,360
that you can still

798
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,680
have congee.

799
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,560
You know,

800
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
many don’t even have this.

801
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,080
But

802
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,400
where are the buns?

803
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,120
Yes! We need buns!

804
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,480
- Starting today,
- Yes. We have drinks,

805
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,560
- there won’t be a bun for each
- but no food.

806
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,400
at lunch.

807
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,800
- What?
- No bun?

808
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,640
We can deal with thin congee,

809
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,160
but we need buns!

810
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,985
- Yes!
- We can’t battle

811
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:48,000
on an empty stomach!

812
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,480
- That’s right!
- We’re in the same army.

813
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,880
How come Huben Battalion
has rice and meat every day

814
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,160
while we, Xuanjia Battalion,
barely have anything to eat?

815
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,400
We’re risking our lives for the state!

816
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,360
Yes!

817
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,560
- Silence! Silence!
- Without enough food,

818
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,480
- how could we serve the state?
- Enough!

819
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,280
Be quiet!

820
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,520
This isn’t my order.

821
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,840
You’re yelling at the wrong person.

822
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,600
We demand an explanation,

823
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,520
or we’ll make you pay!

824
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,400
Yes! Right!

825
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:07,996
We demand an explanation!

826
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,360
You’re fighting back?

827
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,325
Beat them!

828
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:13,232
Beat them up!

829
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,480
Go away!

830
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,920
What are you doing, Li Qian?

831
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,680
You tell me!

832
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,240
Xuanjia and Cooking Battalions
were fighting outside.

833
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
You don’t know that?

834
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
How dare they!

835
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,680
Our camp isn’t an arena!

836
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,400
Aren’t you going to ask

837
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,240
why they fought?

838
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,880
Members of Xuanjia Battalion

839
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,040
all rose from bandits.

840
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,720
They’re unruly and undisciplined.

841
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,720
I’m not surprised that they fought.

842
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,640
Zhao Xiao, you’re Quartermaster!

843
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,800
It’s your job and responsibility

844
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,480
to take care of their food and clothes.

845
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,000
Right now,

846
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,440
food served to Xuanjia Battalion

847
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,240
has been cut to less than half.

848
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,320
What do you have to say about that?

849
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,720
Flooding of the Yellow River
affected tons of people.

850
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,320
The influx of the homeless

851
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,240
has stretched
local resources to the limit.

852
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,760
You should know that.

853
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,080
Be that as it may,

854
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,760
we don’t even have enough food

855
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,800
for our men?

856
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,920
Go out there and see for yourself.

857
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,560
The winter is coming

858
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,320
and they’re still in light clothing.

859
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,800
Without enough food and warm clothes,

860
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,520
how could our men

861
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,120
fight against enemies?

862
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,320
Zhao Xiao,

863
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,760
don’t forget

864
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,920
you’ve made a promise!

865
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,880
I have an idea

866
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,200
to earn more

867
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,680
with what we have.

868
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,520
Will it work?

869
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,680
Of course.

870
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,520
We’ve been doing that all these years.

871
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,640
Or

872
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,320
how did the entire army

873
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,800
live on insufficient funds for so long?

874
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,240
I see.

875
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,760
I’m entrusting it to you.

876
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,800
If anything goes wrong,

877
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,040
you’ll be held accountable.

878
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,400
You can count on me, Young Master.

879
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,240
I’m trying to solve

880
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
the lack of provisions and supplies.

881
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,040
Give me a few more days.

882
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,440
I assure you

883
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,480
that I’ll fix it.

884
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,320
Before that, Xuanjia Battalion

885
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,120
will have to bear with
the situation for now.

886
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,080
Once more supplies arrive,

887
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,320
I’ll make it up to them.

888
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,320
Is that so?

889
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,160
Has Commander Li

890
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,720
said nothing to you, Your Grace?

891
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
He’s been busy in the army.

892
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,680
I’ve only seen him a few times

893
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,640
over the last month

894
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,920
and I’ve only heard good news from him.

895
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,440
He seldom talks to me about work.

896
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,280
He’s too thoughtful

897
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,720
to trouble you

898
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,960
with any of that mess outside.

899
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,480
Tell me everything you know.

900
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,520
What’s going on?

901
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,280
Right now,

902
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,280
victims of the flooding
of the Yellow River are everywhere.

903
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,120
The court has provided
disaster relief funds

904
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,280
but there are simply too many of them.

905
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,280
They’re all homeless.

906
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,080
Even our soldiers

907
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,000
don’t have enough food

908
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,760
or warm clothes.

909
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,760
Haven’t those in charge

910
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,480
tried to do anything about that?

911
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,160
They’re struggling themselves.

912
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,960
Don’t expect them

913
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,600
to give others a hand.

914
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,600
Tension is growing
among civilians and soldiers.

915
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,600
I’m afraid

916
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,920
Jinxi will no longer be in peace.

917
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,160
Commandery Prince.

918
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,000
Is that some treasure you’re hiding?

919
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,440
No.

920
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,760
It’s nothing valuable.

921
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,960
Have a seat.

922
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,480
I’ll have Qingke prepare hot water.

923
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,600
Sit with me.

924
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,720
No need to trouble her.

925
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,880
I’m occupied with work

926
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,000
and I’m back to check on you
at break time.

927
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,600
I can only stay for 15 minutes.

928
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,600
Then you’ll have to leave?

929
00:41:08,725 --> 00:41:09,300
I’m afraid so.

930
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,600
I won’t be able to see you for a while,

931
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,360
so I’m back when I still can.

932
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,480
Baoning, the homeless

933
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,800
have been flooding into the city.

934
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,320
It’s not safe outside.

935
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,120
Don’t go out

936
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,000
unless you have to, understand?

937
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,300
Yes.

938
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,640
You’re finally back.

939
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,520
Do you have anything to tell me?

940
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,960
There’s something important.

941
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,160
I’m listening.

942
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,240
What is it?

943
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,480
I miss you.

944
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,720
You must be joking!

945
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,720
I’m not!

946
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,120
I mean every word I said!

947
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,240
I miss you, too.

948
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,080
This is for you.

949
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,800
What’s the banknote for?

950
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,880
With poor crops in the flooded area,

951
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,600
our soldiers lack food to eat.

952
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,720
That’s not good for their morale.

953
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,480
Here are 5,000 taels of silver

954
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,840
to help them.

955
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,880
I can’t take your money.

956
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,080
Is your pride more important
than their lives?

957
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,040
Baoning, it’s about principles,

958
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,840
not pride.

959
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,080
Ever since we got married,

960
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,360
they’ve had eyes

961
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,800
on our family.

962
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,440
It’s kind of you to offer your money

963
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,840
to help our soldiers,

964
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,880
but the evil-minded

965
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,920
won’t think so

966
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,120
and they’ll use it against us.

967
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,520
Once Grand Empress Dowager
and His Majesty

968
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,280
get word of me using your dowries

969
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,000
and people start talking,

970
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,320
things will go out of control.

971
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,040
Besides,

972
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,200
you should have more faith in me.

973
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,320
If I got stopped by such a hiccup,

974
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,880
how would I keep a foothold in the army?

975
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,640
Did you make this for me?

976
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,650
You...

977
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,320
I like this handmade sachet

978
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,200
more than 5,000 taels of silver.

979
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,720
Thank you, darling.

980
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,000
It’s about time.

981
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,320
I have to go.

982
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:28,960
You’ll miss me, right?

983
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,250
Hey...

984
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,025
Here you are.

985
00:43:51,025 --> 00:43:51,900
Take this.

986
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,520
Line up.

987
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,560
This is yours.

988
00:43:57,175 --> 00:43:58,040
Here you are.

989
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,625
- Thank you.
- Take this.

990
00:43:58,625 --> 00:43:59,175
How kind!

991
00:43:59,175 --> 00:44:00,360
Eat it while it’s hot.

992
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,560
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

993
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,440
- Son! Son!
- Take it slow.

994
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,200
Son!

995
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,125
Is he choked?

996
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,800
Are you alright, son?

997
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,320
Son, can you hear me? Son!

998
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,280
Spit it out!

999
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:24,440
He’s fine.

1000
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,440
Thank you so much for the food.

1001
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,200
You’re welcome.

1002
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,200
It’s all Commandant Li
of Bingzhou’s doing.

1003
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,760
It pains him to see you suffer,

1004
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,125
so he’s doing everything he can...

1005
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:33,676
Commandant Li!

1006
00:44:33,676 --> 00:44:35,440
To help you pull through this disaster.

1007
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,480
He’s a saint!

1008
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,960
Commandant Li puts people first.

1009
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,400
Heaven will bless him.

1010
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,425
Indeed. Of course.

1011
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,360
Thank you, Commandant Li! Thanks!

1012
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,840
It’s nothing.

1013
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,175
Let’s go back to work.

1014
00:44:47,175 --> 00:44:48,032
What a great man!

1015
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,350
Thank you.

1016
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,025
He’s so kind!

1017
00:44:50,025 --> 00:44:51,100
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

1018
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,400
I greatly admire

1019
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,160
your efforts to help those in need.

1020
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,440
It’s the right thing to do

1021
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,280
and Commandant Li gets all the credit.

1022
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,720
Those getting free food from you

1023
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,600
will certainly speak highly of him.

1024
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,520
That doesn’t matter.

1025
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,240
What matters is to save more lives.

1026
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,320
Your Grace,

1027
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,240
have you considered setting up shelters?

1028
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,240
Shelters?

1029
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,480
I’m all ears.

1030
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,560
The Yellow River flooded

1031
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,160
countless people’s homes,
causing the influx of victims everywhere.

1032
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,320
It’s impractical for the court

1033
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,880
to help every one of them.

1034
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,880
If you’re thinking

1035
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,360
to put a roof over their heads,

1036
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,440
I suggest you set up shelters

1037
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,600
in Commandant Li’s name

1038
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,000
and raise money for charity.

1039
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,080
That way,

1040
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,080
the homeless can settle down.

1041
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,280
In the meantime,

1042
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,080
merchants and landowners in Jinxi

1043
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,000
will donate money actively

1044
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,680
to look good.

1045
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,080
We can

1046
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,440
provide those in the shelter

1047
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,360
with easy jobs

1048
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,560
so that they can

1049
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,840
support themselves.

1050
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,040
For starters,

1051
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,800
I’ll donate 10,000 taels of silver.

1052
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,480
This is the silk for the gown
you’re wearing on your birthday.

1053
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,600
All that is the finest

1054
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,760
from all over the state,

1055
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,560
together with gifts and imports

1056
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,480
from foreign lands.

1057
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,680
Everything you need is here.

1058
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,000
These are matching accessories,

1059
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,520
including crowns, hairpins, necklaces,

1060
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,800
bracelets, earrings, pendants

1061
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,840
made of gold, silver, jade
and all kinds of gems.

1062
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,480
Here’s the menu
for your birthday banquet.

1063
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,840
Read it to Her Highness.

1064
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,475
Yes.

1065
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,080
Shredded fish with fish balls,

1066
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,760
roast goose slices, stir-fried scallops,

1067
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,680
lotus seeds...

1068
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,520
Enough.

1069
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,960
They’re all good.

1070
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,960
You may leave.

1071
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,400
Not you.

1072
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,840
These are designs of your makeup

1073
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,040
by experts in and outside the palace.

1074
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,200
They’re of various styles.

1075
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:06,960
Keep this

1076
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:08,960
and this one.

1077
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,840
Aren’t you going to go through them all?

1078
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,640
If there’s anything you don’t like,

1079
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,080
we can still find replacements.

1080
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:17,520
Use your brain!

1081
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,680
All of them are the best of the best.

1082
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,560
Which one I pick doesn’t matter.

1083
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,120
What matters is

1084
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,880
that I can go

1085
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,120
and discuss every item with Yi.

1086
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,920
I didn’t think of that.

1087
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,120
You’re thorough, Your Highness.

1088
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
But, Your Highness,

1089
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,360
asking His Majesty to choose your makeup

1090
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,160
is a bit...

1091
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,160
A bit what?

1092
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,040
Inappropriate? Ridiculous?
Is that what you think?

1093
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,520
I don’t need a dedicated emperor,

1094
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,360
but a caring husband.

1095
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,320
Besides, girls doll themselves up
for men they love.

1096
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,880
I’ll put on

1097
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,040
whatever makeup Yi likes.

1098
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,480
Speaking of him,

1099
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,280
he must be working
at Qinzheng Hall at this hour.

1100
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,400
Come on, Baihe.

1101
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,680
Let’s bring everything

1102
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,520
to see him there.

1103
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,600
Yes.

1104
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:30,025
(Qinzheng Hall)

1105
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,600
Your Highness, His Majesty isn’t inside.

1106
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,360
I’m here for my birthday celebration.

1107
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,080
It’s not against His Majesty’s rule.

1108
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,560
Your Highness! Your Highness!

1109
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,640
His Majesty isn’t here.

1110
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,625
Hey,

1111
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,600
where’s His Majesty?

1112
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,000
Your Highness,

1113
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,000
His Majesty went out with Eunuch Du.

1114
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,680
I don’t know where he is.

1115
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:54,880
Your Highness,

1116
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,880
we can go back

1117
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,640
and come again later.

1118
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,300
No!

1119
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,560
Find him for me!

1120
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,040
Your Majesty,

1121
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,280
why are you doing this to yourself?

1122
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,360
You shouldn’t be working here.

1123
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,880
It’s windy.

1124
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,360
You might catch a cold.

1125
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,280
I have no choice

1126
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,800
but to take shelter here

1127
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,480
because Han Tongxin

1128
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,280
must be waiting for me
at Qinzheng Hall as we speak.

1129
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,960
Funing Hall isn’t safe either.

1130
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,000
Only this place

1131
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,560
is quiet.

1132
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,600
I doubt she’ll come here.

1133
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,120
Still, this is unnecessary.

1134
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,600
“Unnecessary”?

1135
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,875
Do you remember what she did last year?

1136
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,280
Greetings, Your Majesty.

1137
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,520
Do I look pretty like this?

1138
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,680
What about this one?

1139
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,440
Not good?

1140
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,400
What about this one?

1141
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,640
Look at it.

1142
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,640
That’s fine. There are two more.

1143
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,560
Your Majesty, do you like this one?

1144
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,760
As Her Highness’s birthday is coming,

1145
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,080
she’s... a bit...

1146
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,600
Only a bit?

1147
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,080
It’s a lot more than that!

1148
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,640
She’s clingy enough most of the time,

1149
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,440
and this whole birthday thing

1150
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,720
kicks it up a notch

1151
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,640
that she’s totally unbearable!

1152
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,560
You think I can’t do anything

1153
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,480
to her?

1154
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,480
You’re right. I can’t.

1155
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,520
Never mind.

1156
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,520
Your Majesty.

1157
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,480
(Beautiful and Elegant)
Who is it

1158
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,320
(Beautiful and Elegant)
that even you can’t do anything to?

1159
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,120
No one. It’s about the court.

1160
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,640
Your Majesty,

1161
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,520
it’s chilly out here.

1162
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,360
If you don’t mind,

1163
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,360
we can go back to my chamber.

1164
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,240
No need. I’m fine.

1165
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,080
Your Majesty, my birthday makeup

1166
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,000
has come down to these two designs.

1167
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,680
Which one do you think is better?

1168
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,280
They’re both good.

1169
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,920
This one has arched eyebrows

1170
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,480
while these eyebrows are distant.

1171
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,520
This lip is like a butterfly

1172
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,360
while this a petal.

1173
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,760
Aren’t they the same?

1174
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,850
Which one is prettier?

1175
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,560
I like this one.

1176
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,400
I like

1177
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,120
whatever you choose.

1178
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,800
Baihe, put this design away.

1179
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,120
According to the one you choose,

1180
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,640
the petal on my forehead

1181
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,080
should go lower.

1182
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,360
Why don’t you try it on me?

1183
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,800
There’s no petal here.

1184
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,350
(Beautiful and Elegant)

1185
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,360
I’ve prepared one for you.

1186
00:52:11,325 --> 00:52:15,000
(Beautiful and Elegant)

1187
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,120
Your Majesty, Mr. Wang says you’re needed
for disaster relief immediately.

1188
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,360
He’s waiting at Qinzheng Hall.

1189
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,440
Let’s go!

1190
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,480
Go back to Qinzheng Hall!

1191
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,440
Baihe,

1192
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,800
how do I look?

1193
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,200
What are you doing?

1194
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,440
Your Highness,
the petal is way off-center.

1195
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,840
Others will laugh at you if they see it.

1196
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,840
It’s off?

1197
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:40,975
Yes.

1198
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,520
I’m going to

1199
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,280
tour around the garden

1200
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,240
with it

1201
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,720
and others

1202
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,480
