27
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,040
Your Majesty,

28
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,000
leave with me.

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,560
Let’s run out of the Palace.

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,400
Tongxin.

31
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,960
Your Majesty.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,640
No, Yi.

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
You’re my husband.

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,640
I just want you to be alive.

35
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,400
I’ll do anything to keep you alive.

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,120
I can’t leave.

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,640
I’m the Emperor of Mu’an.

38
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,680
If I leave,

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,040
what will my people do?

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,520
Fine.

41
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,840
If you don’t leave,

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,840
I’ll stay here with you

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,960
and defend our state.

44
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,720
Tongxin,

45
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,360
you’re my wife.

46
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,840
I used to be very rude

47
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
to you.

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,920
I’m sorry.

49
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,560
If we have the next life,

50
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,920
I won’t let you down again.

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,440
No, Yi.

52
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,400
I don’t want the next life.

53
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,040
All I want is this life.

54
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,320
Yi,

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
when the war is over,

56
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,080
in the future...

57
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,160
let’s sneak out of the Palace.

58
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,520
Let’s dress up in plain clothes

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,760
and go traveling around, shall we?

60
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,240
There’s no future.

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,960
There’s no future.

62
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,680
Yi.

63
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,560
Throughout my life,

64
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,560
I’ve never got a chance
to make a choice.

65
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,320
I was born in the Imperial Family.

66
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,000
Since I was little,
I’ve received too many expectations.

67
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,040
I was confused

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,279
and I also suffered.

69
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,640
But now,

70
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
I only want to be a good emperor

71
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,200
and fight enemies with my troops.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,360
Unfortunately, I’m incurably sick.

73
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,280
How I hate it!

74
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,040
Somebody!

75
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,440
Physicians.

76
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,320
We need physicians.

77
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,800
Somebody!

78
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,080
Zhao Yi.

79
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,000
Zhao Yi.

80
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,480
Baoning.

81
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,600
You’re back at last.

82
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,480
Baoning, I’m sorry to my ancestors.

83
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,120
After I die,

84
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,760
let the enemies dismember me.

85
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,600
Remember.

86
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,160
Protect our people.

87
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,080
Don’t talk nonsense.

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,400
You’re the Emperor of Mu’an.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,840
You will protect your people.

90
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,560
You must live!

91
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,840
Baoning,

92
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,760
I’m sorry for you.

93
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,320
I’m sorry for our state.

94
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,840
Baoning,

95
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,920
take good care of Xi.

96
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,560
Your Highness.

97
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,720
Your Highness, let’s run away.

98
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,600
Go, Your Highness.

99
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,560
Go.

100
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Idiot.

101
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Even if you have to pretend,

102
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
you don’t need to hurt yourself.

103
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,640
Wu is right.

104
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,720
You’re my sharpest weapon.

105
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,640
And you’re the most loyal dog.

106
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,320
Something for me?

107
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,960
Your Majesty.

108
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,919
It’s the flag of defending the Emperor.

109
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Qing An brought it back.

110
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,799
Your Majesty, Li Qian
has sealed the pass

111
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,360
and cut off our backup force.

112
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,280
Your Majesty!

113
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,400
What’s going on?

114
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,400
Your Majesty, he led the picked troops

115
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,920
and joined forces
with Yang Jun’s army in the north.

116
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,200
With Zhao Yi’s imperial edict
to defend the Emperor,

117
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,520
he’s going to break into our capital!

118
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,960
Catch a rat in the hole.

119
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,320
Excuse me?

120
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,800
Catch a rat in the hole.

121
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,280
We’re screwed.

122
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,600
Your Majesty,

123
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,720
if Li Qian and Yang Jun
besiege the capital city,

124
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,280
we’ll indeed be a rat in the hole.

125
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,880
Give my order.

126
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,880
We’ll retreat!

127
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,960
Take him away.

128
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,040
Take him away!

129
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,720
Yes.

130
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,640
Go.

131
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,000
Qing An,

132
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,720
you idiot.

133
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,400
Leave.

134
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,440
- Leave.
- Go.

135
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Baoning.

136
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,080
Here she is.

137
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,560
It’s all right. It’s all right.
It’s over.

138
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,720
Baoning,

139
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,480
we were so worried.

140
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,480
The Grand Empress Dowager
even fell sick.

141
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,160
Uncle, Aunt,

142
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,160
sorry to have kept you worried.

143
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,240
Is Grandmother all right?

144
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,840
She’ll be all right when she sees you.

145
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Get in and see her.

146
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,120
All right.

147
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,880
Don’t tell her His Majesty is dead.

148
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,960
Grandmother.

149
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,160
Grandmother.

150
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,000
I miss you so much.

151
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,920
Think less of me

152
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,680
and I can be less worried about you.

153
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,520
Grandmother,

154
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
I’m sorry.

155
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,440
Don’t be angry.

156
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,280
Do you know

157
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,960
I’ve been sleepless lately?

158
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,200
If you’re hurt,

159
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,760
how can I live?

160
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,240
Stop crying.

161
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,360
(Three Abodes of the East)

162
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,240
Your Grace,

163
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,840
is my aunt already...?

164
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,040
Fortune is fickle.

165
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,480
Those who can survive the war

166
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,920
are blessed.

167
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,080
Lord Cao,

168
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,520
I’m sorry for your loss.

169
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,200
Lyu,

170
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,600
I need you to do something for me.

171
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,000
The death of His Majesty
and Empress Dowager Cao

172
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,240
can’t be leaked
before the morning court tomorrow.

173
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,160
Baoning, you...

174
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,520
Trust me.

175
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,520
Here are the medicinal materials.

176
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,800
Lin, you’re finally back.

177
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,240
I’ve searched all pharmacies in town.

178
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,560
Some are closed
and some owners have run away.

179
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,200
Luckily, I met a girl

180
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,560
who grew medicinal materials.

181
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,120
She gave me
all the remaining medicinal materials.

182
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,760
Good things happen to good people.

183
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,760
Do you know the girl’s name and address?

184
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,880
Let’s repay her when possible.

185
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,000
You can’t imagine who she is.

186
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,680
It’s kind of fate.

187
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,280
I wondered

188
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,880
why I found that girl familiar.

189
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,720
She once worked for the Li Family.

190
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,840
Do you remember Zhang Duolan’s maid?

191
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,560
Liuhe?

192
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,960
Yes, it’s her.

193
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,080
You still remember her.

194
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,160
I used to be rude to her.

195
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,040
After wandering all the way,

196
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,200
I didn’t expect to meet her this way.

197
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,280
Luckily, she met you, Lin.

198
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,040
If she had met me,

199
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,680
she wouldn’t help me.

200
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,640
Miaorong,

201
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,600
don’t say that.

202
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,960
You’re a kind girl

203
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,760
and you’ve helped so many people.

204
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,640
What happened in the Li Family is gone.

205
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,000
Even if some people
don’t understand you,

206
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,480
I’m still with you.

207
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,400
I’m always there for you.

208
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,000
Miaorong, I...

209
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,320
Nothing.

210
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,400
I’ll go decoct the herbs.

211
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,160
Lin,

212
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,680
thank you for keeping me company lately.

213
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,880
Without you,

214
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,080
I don’t know if I would still be alive.

215
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,440
Miaorong, you...

216
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,880
Lin,

217
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,560
I’ve thought about it.

218
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,160
Now, we live a poor life.

219
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,640
But helping so many people with you

220
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,160
makes me really happy.

221
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,720
Miaorong, you mean...?

222
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,240
I’m so happy, Miaorong.

223
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,760
Put me down.

224
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,360
People are watching.

225
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,400
Lin,

226
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,440
we’ve spent all the money we have

227
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,520
on food and medicine.

228
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,360
What do we do in the future?

229
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,720
Trust me.

230
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,760
I’ll make us live a good life.

231
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,400
Help! Somebody passed out!

232
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,920
Somebody passed out.

233
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,760
Miss.

234
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:09,960
Come on.

235
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,400
Miss.

236
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,840
You saved me?

237
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,400
Miss, you’re finally awake.

238
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,560
How dare you!

239
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Do you know who I am?

240
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,720
How dare you call me Miss!

241
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,160
I’m the Empress.

242
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,480
Your Highness.

243
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,600
You may rise.

244
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,920
When Jiang Baoning summoned you
to the Palace,

245
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,640
I saw you.

246
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,240
The girl you asked me to investigate

247
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,440
is said to be a physician from Jinxi.

248
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,640
She has excellent medical skills.

249
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,720
And she’s Li Qian’s
childhood sweetheart.

250
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,800
I know you.

251
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,440
You’re Li Qian’s childhood sweetheart.

252
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,440
You’re Gao Miaorong.

253
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,880
Your Highness,

254
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,320
I’m no longer related
to the Li Family in Bingzhou.

255
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,160
What happened to your finger?

256
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,040
Nothing.

257
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,320
I accidentally hurt it.

258
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,800
It’s just an old story.

259
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,200
Yongqing army broke into the Palace.

260
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,000
In the chaos, I came here.

261
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,200
Now that we’re destined to meet,

262
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,680
when the chaos dies down,

263
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,120
go back to the Palace with me.

264
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

265
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,520
But I never mean to go to the Palace.

266
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,520
Miss Miaorong,

267
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,480
you have such good medical skills.

268
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
Instead of living a poor life
in this place,

269
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,720
why not go to the Palace
and be my personal physician?

270
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,240
Isn’t it far better?

271
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,839
Your Highness,

272
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,760
take a rest.

273
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,240
I’ll go get some medicine.

274
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,440
Miaorong, let me help you.

275
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,960
Your Highness.

276
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,480
Good news.

277
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,400
The Palace is safe now.

278
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,400
Thank you.

279
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,160
Take it.

280
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,120
All right.

281
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,080
Thank you.

282
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,000
Here.

283
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,520
What, Lin?

284
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,480
What are you thinking of?

285
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,680
I’m thinking

286
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,640
what you’re thinking of.

287
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,720
Lin,

288
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,760
I used to make many mistakes.

289
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,520
But you’ve never abandoned me.

290
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,560
From this day on,

291
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,000
I only want us

292
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,360
to live a peaceful life.

293
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,480
Don’t worry.

294
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,480
I won’t go to the Palace.

295
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,640
Do you really think so?

296
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,280
I have a jade bracelet.

297
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,120
Go pawn it

298
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,240
for some money.

299
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,440
After this period,

300
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,560
the capital city will be in peace.

301
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,120
Then we can find a way to make a living.

302
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,440
How can I pawn it?

303
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,160
This has been the last thing you keep

304
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,400
since you left the Li Family.

305
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,960
Keep it as a souvenir.

306
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,280
Just take it.

307
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,560
Don’t you always tell me

308
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,560
to forget the past and have a new start?

309
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,120
None of these things

310
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,200
can be a souvenir to me.

311
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,520
All right.

312
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,120
After the hard days,

313
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,480
let’s save some money,

314
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,160
buy some farmlands,

315
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,640
and live a simple life.

316
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,320
Or we can buy a shop

317
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,880
and do some business.

318
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,080
But...

319
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,440
But you’ll have to suffer.

320
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,240
I won’t.

321
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,360
I won’t suffer anything.

322
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,320
As long as you can

323
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,160
always be by my side,

324
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,320
I’ll feel content.

325
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,680
Miss Miaorong,

326
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,400
the Palace is safe now.

327
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,760
I’m going back.

328
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,360
See you.

329
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,800
Your Highness.

330
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,240
Your Highness, wait a second.

331
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,760
I have something to tell you.

332
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,920
Your Highness, you’re pregnant.

333
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,120
Are you sure?

334
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,440
You must be a hundred percent sure.

335
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,440
I know this is very serious.

336
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,680
I don’t dare to lie about it.

337
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,920
Jiang Baoning,

338
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,240
I still have hope.

339
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,640
I still have hope.

340
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,600
Baihe,

341
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,680
get me back to the Palace.

342
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,520
Li.

343
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,040
Li.

344
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,560
Li, we repulsed Yongqing army.

345
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,840
Why do you still look worried?

346
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,400
What makes you think I’m worried?

347
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,280
I saw it with my eyes.

348
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,600
When Her Grace comes,

349
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,640
you’ll tell the truth.

350
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,880
So, it’s because of Her Grace.

351
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,600
Why must I worry about her?

352
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,880
Is it because she broke
into the capital city alone

353
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,240
without telling you?

354
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,160
Jin Xiao,

355
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,800
why are you so idle today?

356
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,600
Have you settled the soldiers
as I told you?

357
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,480
I think I guessed right, Li.

358
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,000
I quite know you.

359
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,840
Get out!

360
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,600
Li Qian, how ungrateful you are!

361
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,800
You... You put your wife over me.

362
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,800
Don’t move. Don’t move.

363
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,800
I must mix all the best parts

364
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,720
into this letter

365
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,920
to express my true feelings.

366
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,320
Baoning,
it’s so dangerous in the Palace.

367
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,960
But you’re not anxious at all.

368
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,880
Just because troubles are coming,

369
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,200
I must be calm.

370
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,360
Besides,

371
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,880
if I don’t send a message to Li Qian,

372
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,400
he’ll be anxious.

373
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,560
You were too daring.

374
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,240
You came back alone

375
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,360
without telling your husband.

376
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,680
Baoning, how about
going out of the Palace

377
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,600
and coaxing your husband?

378
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,240
Not today.

379
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,560
It took us great trouble to ask Lyu

380
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,680
to block the information.

381
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,880
If I leave the Palace now,

382
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,200
many people are keeping an eye on me,

383
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,480
and I will give them a handle.

384
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,120
Will you really not

385
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,280
tell your husband
about the situation in the Palace?

386
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,560
Tomorrow, what if the officials...?

387
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,160
This is such a big case.

388
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,520
I’m the Commandery Princess, after all.

389
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,720
Officials don’t dare to hurt me.

390
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,680
But if the Li Family is involved,

391
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,320
there’ll be terrible consequences.

392
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,040
Commandery Prince,
a letter from the Palace.

393
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,800
Her Grace asked me to give it to you.

394
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,720
Leave me.

395
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,600
Yes.

396
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
A letter from Her Grace?

397
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,760
Read it as you wish.

398
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,160
Don’t stop simply because I’m here.

399
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,000
This is a letter from Her Grace.

400
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:26,960
Can you not read it?

401
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,720
You!

402
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,400
Did Her Grace mention

403
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,800
what was going on in the Palace?

404
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,160
After Yongqing army
retreated in the day,

405
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,000
the Imperial Guards
besieged Longevity Hill

406
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,800
and the Imperial Palace.

407
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,520
We don’t know how His Majesty
and Empress Dowager Cao

408
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,200
are doing.

409
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,920
It’s just a letter to tell me
she’s safe.

410
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,480
Li,

411
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,000
don’t you find it a bit fishy?

412
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,920
Now that Yongqing army retreated,

413
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,480
the Palace should be safe.

414
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,880
But think about what’s going on now.

415
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,160
I heard before Her Grace
went to the Palace,

416
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,720
His Majesty gave her
two imperial edicts.

417
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,560
I wonder what she...

418
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,680
She always knows how far to go.

419
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,960
We’ll know everything in court
tomorrow morning.

420
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,920
Don’t make groundless assumptions.

421
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,640
She knows how far to go?

422
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,080
Who annoyed you so much
that you didn’t even read the letter?

423
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,520
All right. I’ll leave you alone.

424
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:39,440
(Hanyuan Hall)

425
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:50,040
(Convince with Morality and Courtesy)

426
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,760
Commandery Princess Jia’nan has arrived.

427
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,560
Your Grace,

428
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,000
this is the morning court.

429
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,880
Why did you bring the little prince

430
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,200
to the court?

431
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,560
Don’t be afraid.

432
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,000
I came for the court, of course.

433
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,040
Ridiculous.

434
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
This is the court.

435
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,960
A woman can’t talk nonsense here.

436
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,960
I’m a woman, so what?

437
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,760
I’m the Commandery Princess
titled by the late emperor.

438
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,040
How dare you be rude to me!

439
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,280
Your Grace,

440
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,600
don’t change the topic.

441
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,720
This isn’t the imperial harem.

442
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,920
Anyway, women can’t interfere
with politics.

443
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,320
Archduke,

444
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,880
why don’t you

445
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,640
explain to them?

446
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,600
Yes, Your Grace.

447
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,320
Everybody,

448
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,280
Yongqing army broke
into the capital city yesterday.

449
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,520
Jinxi Army and Beiji Army

450
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,400
came back in time
and defeated the enemies.

451
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,640
However,

452
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,160
they were still late.

453
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,040
The Empress is missing.

454
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,880
Empress Dowager Cao and His Majesty

455
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,120
have passed away.

456
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,360
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

457
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:38,520
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

458
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,280
Your Highness.

459
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:45,080
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

460
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,480
Silence.

461
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,360
You know what happened yesterday.

462
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,440
Yongqing army fought fiercely.

463
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,520
When I arrived at Longevity Hill,

464
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,240
Empress Dowager Cao had been dead.

465
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,640
Luckily,
the little prince is still alive.

466
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,760
He’s the remaining royal member.

467
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,320
His Majesty

468
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,560
passed away

469
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,680
because of his chronic disease.

470
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,320
Even when he was dying,

471
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,520
he was thinking of defending our state

472
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,560
and he fought
till the last minute with his troops.

473
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,000
His Majesty

474
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,800
has lived up to his ancestors

475
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,120
and his people.

476
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,080
Your Majesty.

477
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,720
Your Grace,

478
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,120
I have some confusion.

479
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,400
Now that Her Highness
and His Majesty passed away yesterday,

480
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,560
why didn’t you tell us until now?

481
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,040
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

482
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,560
Everybody,

483
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
the situation was critical yesterday.

484
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Her Grace made a prompt decision,

485
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,680
asking Lord Cao and me

486
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,320
to block the news
with the Imperial Guards.

487
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,320
If it had been leaked yesterday

488
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and the morale of the army
had been shaken,

489
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
how do you think
we would end up, Mr. Wang?

490
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
Everybody,

491
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,800
allow me to say something.

492
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,000
I’ve served Empress Dowager Cao
for many years.

493
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,400
Her Grace didn’t lie anything

494
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,920
about what happened yesterday.

495
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,640
If Her Grace hadn’t arrived in time,

496
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,440
the little prince and I
would have been...

497
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,040
Everybody,

498
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,360
His Majesty was sick for a long time.

499
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,960
Before Yongqing army
was attacking the capital city,

500
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,960
His Majesty asked me
to send two imperial edicts

501
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,680
to Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

502
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,960
One is for defending His Majesty.

503
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,080
The other

504
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,160
is the testamentary edict,

505
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,560
just in case.

506
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,760
There’s a testamentary edict?

507
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,720
Yeah.

508
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,480
Her Highness and His Majesty
have been dead.

509
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,880
We must cheer up

510
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,880
to protect our state.

511
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,760
A state can’t do without an emperor.

512
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,040
Now that Her Grace
has the testamentary edict,

513
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,080
let’s have the chief eunuch
of the Messenger Office

514
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,160
to authenticate it.

515
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,560
Get the chief eunuch to the court.

516
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,760
This is the real handwriting
of His Majesty.

517
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,840
- It’s real.
- It’s real.

518
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,520
Yes. That’s great.

519
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,080
Does anybody have other confusion?

520
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,640
Now that you don’t,

521
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,720
Du Sheng, declare it.

522
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,760
Yes.

523
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Here’s the edict.

524
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,800
Kneel.

525
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,200
Since I took the throne,

526
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,520
I’ve been ruling the state.

527
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,720
I always show respect to heaven.

528
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,560
But I’m guilty and feel worried.

529
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,960
I can’t stop feeling scared.

530
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,880
When the capital city is broken in,

531
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,600
I’ll die on this day.

532
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,200
An emperor defends his state
and dies for his people.

533
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,240
In consideration of future arrangements,

534
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,720
I’m leaving this imperial edict.

535
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,200
The First Prince Zhao Xi
will be the Crown Prince

536
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,680
and take the throne.

537
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,400
Chief Councilor Wang Jidao will lead
other officials in political affairs.

538
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,560
I command Commandery Princess Jia’nan
to assist Zhao Xi

539
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,680
in protecting our state and people.

540
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,440
Then I’ll die without regrets.

541
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,960
We will obey the late emperor

542
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,200
and help the new emperor
take the throne.

543
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,960
We will also obey the late emperor

544
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,240
and help the new emperor
take the throne.

545
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,360
The Empress Dowager has arrived.

546
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,960
Your Highness, you’re safe.

547
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
This is great.

548
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,280
I’m the Empress Dowager.

549
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,920
If you call the wrong title again,

550
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,840
even if you’re the Chief Councilor,

551
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,560
I’ll punish you.

552
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,680
Are you disappointed

553
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,560
to see me alive?

554
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,640
Your Highness!

555
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,000
I’m the Empress Dowager!

556
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,480
The new emperor
hasn’t taken the throne yet.

557
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,360
How can you call yourself
the Empress Dowager?

558
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,920
Not because of the son of the concubine,

559
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,800
but because of the lineal son

560
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,920
I’m having.

561
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,320
- What?
- What?

562
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,200
But there’s a testamentary edict.

563
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,520
Lineal sons are always nobler.

564
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,800
Now that the Empress Dowager

565
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,840
is having the eldest lineal son,

566
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,840
the testamentary edict will be...

567
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,120
It’s still valid!

568
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,320
Grandmother?

569
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,840
Tongxin,

570
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,639
now that you’re having the baby,

571
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,199
why did you come to the court

572
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,560
instead of resting in Ciyuan Hall?

573
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:54,840
I...

574
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,200
When replying
to the Grand Empress Dowager,

575
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,800
you need to kneel.

576
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,960
Forget it.

577
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,640
I care about the little prince
she’s having.

578
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,920
You don’t need to kneel.

579
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,920
Just stand aside and listen.

580
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,920
Be careful.

581
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,840
Since our dynasty was founded,

582
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,560
the emperor has been picked
according to virtues,

583
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,320
regardless of their mothers.

584
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,600
God bless our state.

585
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,800
Now the Empress has the baby
of the late emperor.

586
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,840
When the baby is born,

587
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,480
he’ll be Prince Gong if it’s a boy

588
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,760
and she’ll be a princess if it’s a girl.

589
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,440
The Empress will be
Empress Dowager Xiaoci.

590
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

591
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,520
Xi is still a little boy,

592
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,560
but he studies hard
and he’s honest and simple.

593
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,680
Officials will also help him.

594
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,280
He has a bright future.

595
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,640
So, according to the testamentary edict
of the late emperor,

596
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,840
the First Prince Zhao Xi
will be the Crown Prince.

597
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,080
Yes, Your Highness.

598
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,040
I think I need some tricks
to sneak into the camp.

599
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,720
Go.

600
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,320
I lost the fan, didn’t I?

601
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,680
Why are you having it?

602
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
My precious.

603
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:12,920
Leave.

604
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,560
Stop them.

605
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
Miss Li,

606
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,320
there’s a saying in your state.

607
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,200
Catch a rat in the hole.

608
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,600
You’re the rat in the hole now.

609
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,720
Take them down.

610
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,920
Qing Tai, are you out of your mind?

611
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,400
How inhuman you are!

612
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
He’s your brother!

613
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,960
He?

614
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,560
He’s a son of a concubine.

615
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,240
How can he be my brother?

616
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,080
Now he’s just a dog.

617
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,280
He won’t even bite however I beat him.

618
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,960
Qing An!

619
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,320
Did you forget what you promised me?

620
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,960
You promised to protect me.

621
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,560
You promised to keep me safe.

622
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,280
I’m now in danger and will die.

623
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,680
If you still don’t fight back,

624
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,840
he’ll kill me!

625
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,160
Miss Li.

626
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,840
Qing An!

627
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,200
I don’t know what to say.

628
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,880
Are you stupid

629
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,240
or are you ignorant?

630
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,400
Under such circumstances,

631
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,720
do you still think you can live?

632
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,680
Tens of thousands of my soldiers
came all the way

633
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,600
but acquired nothing!

634
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,680
It’s all because of
your brother Li Qian!

635
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,840
Today,

636
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,480
I’ll use your blood

637
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,720
to make a sacrifice
for my dead soldiers.

638
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,560
You love her, don’t you?

639
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
Today,

640
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,280
I’ll make your hands
covered with her blood.

641
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,480
Go.

642
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,720
Go kill her.

643
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,080
Qing An.

644
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,440
Qing An, wake up.

645
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,480
Wake up.

646
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,400
Qing An.

647
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,320
Miss Li,

648
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,400
today,

649
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,840
I’ll make you feel

650
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,280
how it hurts
when your beloved man kills you.

651
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,520
Qing An, I’m Dongdong.

652
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,280
Qing An, I’m Dongdong.

653
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,160
Qing An,

654
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,960
what are you waiting for?

655
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,280
Kill her!

656
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,680
Wake up.

657
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,920
Kill her!

658
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,840
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

659
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,520
Kill! Kill!

660
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,400
Do it!

661
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,240
Do it!

662
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,880
Do it! Quickly!

663
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,200
Kill her! Kill her!

664
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,800
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

665
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,000
Kill her!

666
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,720
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

667
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,960
Kill her! Do it!

668
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,880
Quickly! Kill her!

669
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,200
Qing An, are you really
going to kill me?

670
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,240
Horses in Yongqing are more violent

671
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,040
than those in Mu’an.

672
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,520
But don’t be scared.

673
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,400
With me around,

674
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,280
you’ll be all right.

675
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,320
You’re agile.

676
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,960
I’ll always keep you safe.

677
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,600
Do it!

678
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,880
Kill him!

679
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,360
Qing An, go!

680
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,800
After them!

681
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,440
Go.

682
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,560
Your Majesty!

683
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,320
His Majesty commands that

684
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,840
we should catch them, alive or dead,

685
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,280
and never let them run away.

686
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,920
You guys, go that way.

687
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,480
Yes.

688
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,800
And you guys, follow me.

689
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,080
You even failed

690
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,240
to find a woman and an idiot!

691
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,840
What’s the use of keeping you?

692
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,200
Go after them!

693
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,600
All of you, go after them!

694
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,960
If you can’t catch them alive,

695
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,840
you’ll be dead!

696
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

697
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,880
Calm down, Your Majesty.

698
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,280
During this war,

699
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,480
we’ve lost many soldiers.

700
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,000
Bingzhou is the territory
of the Li Family.

701
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,320
We shouldn’t stay here for a long time.

702
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,920
But Qing An is still on the run.

703
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,880
His head is badly wounded

704
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,640
and he’s mentally disturbed.

705
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,120
Even if he fortunately escapes,

706
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,440
he’s an idiot.

707
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,560
Your Majesty, listen to me.

708
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,600
Let’s retreat to Yunyang

709
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,480
and make adjustments.

710
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,240
After the recovery,

711
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,840
you can come back with our army.

712
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:09,800
Let’s retreat.

713
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,120
Tonight.

714
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,000
Yes.

715
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,840
(Chongzheng Hall)
Kneel.

716
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,560
Kowtow for the first time.

717
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,360
Up.

718
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,400
Kowtow for the second time.

719
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,440
Up.

720
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,120
Kowtow for the third time.

721
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,600
Up.

722
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,240
On February 9, the 18th year
of Yuanding Reign,

723
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,640
(Chongzheng Hall)
the late emperor passed away.

724
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,320
(Chongzheng Hall)
The national mourning will last 27 days.

725
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,640
The late emperor Zhao Yi died

726
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,520
because of domestic trouble
and foreign invasion.

727
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,120
He left a testamentary edict,

728
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,040
having Commandery Princess Jia’nan
as the regent

729
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,240
to assist the new emperor Zhao Xi.

730
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,040
Empress Dowager Cao passed away

731
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:43,480
and is titled
as Saint Empress Dowager Cishou.

732
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,280
Great Grand Empress Dowager is titled

733
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,120
as Saint Grand Empress Dowager

734
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:55,360
Shoukang and Zhangqing.

735
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,040
Empress Han is titled
as Empress Dowager Xiaoci.

736
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,680
The First Prince Zhao Xi
will take the throne as of today

737
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,160
and start the reign of Shengzhen.
