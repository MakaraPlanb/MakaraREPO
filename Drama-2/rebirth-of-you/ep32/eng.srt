27
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:01,360
Lin,

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,800
you refused to be an official

29
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,959
when Empress Dowager
offered to pull some strings,

30
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,240
then take this money

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,320
to do business instead.

32
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,520
I’ve built my connections

33
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,960
by working in the Palace

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,800
and I can give you some support.

35
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,279
Lin,

36
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,160
look,

37
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,000
this job I’m doing

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,559
is well-paid!

39
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,919
It’d take forever to make this much

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,360
if I worked as a physician.

41
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,520
But, Miaorong,

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,880
ever since you started to work there,

43
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,919
you’ve been frowning all day

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,720
and you seldom smile.

45
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,199
You promised me

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,880
that once you saved up enough money,

47
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,679
you’d leave and marry me.

48
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,440
I’m strong and I can work, too.

49
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,520
I assure you

50
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,679
that we’ll live a well-off life.

51
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,479
Can you quit now?

52
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,119
Lin,

53
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,399
I...

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,720
I can’t leave yet.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,839
Because of Jiang Baoning?

56
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,800
I heard she’s in the capital, too.

57
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,199
Did you run into her in the Palace?

58
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,479
You’re thinking too much.

59
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,240
What are the odds

60
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,960
for us to meet in such a big city?

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,600
Then I’ll take you away.

62
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,839
Leave with me, will you?

63
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:25,440
Stop it!

64
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,520
We’re talking about the Palace,
not a cottage.

65
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,720
We can’t come and go as we see fit.

66
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,360
Relax.

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,479
Empress Dowager is kind.

68
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,559
She already said

69
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,520
to let me go soon

70
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,880
with ample dowries,

71
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,279
no less.

72
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,639
Then the two of us

73
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,520
will get married, have children

74
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,039
and grow old together.

75
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,800
Really?

76
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:53,600
Yes.

77
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:56,839
I’ll give you a grand wedding

78
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,199
and every girl in the city
will envy you.

79
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,279
That’s unnecessary.

80
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,800
What if...

81
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,320
What if they fall for you and then what?

82
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,479
Well then,

83
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,520
our wedding is up to you.

84
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:17,800
(Li’s Mansion)

85
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,640
Miss, don’t be too upset.

86
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,600
You’re pining away these days.

87
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,359
Why don’t we tell the truth
to Young Master Lin?

88
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,480
He loves me dearly.

89
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,799
I can’t drag him down with me.

90
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,799
It’s not like that.

91
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,239
Had it not been for him and me,

92
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,320
you wouldn’t have taken this job
in the first place.

93
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,239
Who’d know

94
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:44,320
Her Highness would be so evil

95
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,320
and more and more demanding?

96
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,000
Enough, Guanju!

97
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,279
It’s not our place

98
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,760
to judge Her Highness.

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,040
If anyone overheard what you said,

100
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,279
we’d be doomed!

101
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,920
Certain things

102
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,519
are out of our control.

103
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,880
One misstep and there’s no coming back.

104
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,640
I thought she’d be reasonable,

105
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,440
but she’s not.

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,640
Anyway,
complaining is of no use. Let’s go.

107
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:31,640
Marquis Jinghai.

108
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
It’s you!

109
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,239
You’re still alive!

110
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:44,799
Thanks to Empress Dowager,

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,440
I’m working in the Palace to get by.

112
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,640
I heard you had inherited

113
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,880
your father’s title.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,559
Please accept
my belated congratulations.

115
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,559
Clearly, I underestimated you

116
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,160
who committed a heinous crime

117
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,799
but got away with it

118
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:02,839
and you managed
to be hired by Her Highness.

119
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,320
You’re much more capable

120
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,880
and craftier than me.

121
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,720
You’re flattering me, Marquis.

122
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,000
We only have one life

123
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,959
and we do whatever it takes

124
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,600
to survive.

125
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,040
Her Highness gave me this chance

126
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:23,720
just for my slight knowledge
of medicine.

127
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,359
I hope this chance

128
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,519
will forever be your meal ticket.

129
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:30,799
So,

130
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,559
what do you want from me?

131
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:36,760
Marquis,

132
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,559
serve under Her Highness

133
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,720
and your support won’t be forgotten

134
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,760
when she succeeds.

135
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,160
By that time,

136
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,000
your rise and success

137
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,160
can be expected.

138
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,480
Are you trolling me for her?

139
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:55,239
Marquis,

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,359
public humiliation

141
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,839
is rough, isn’t it?

142
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:03,559
A noble and proud man like you

143
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,799
never saw that coming, right?

144
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,600
Without Li Qian,

145
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,640
you wouldn’t be
standing here with a title.

146
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:15,519
Don’t you want those who insulted you

147
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:17,839
to grovel for mercy?

148
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,040
A toast to you, Father.

149
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,959
Qian,

150
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:44,079
you’re returning to Bingzhou tomorrow.

151
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
I don’t remember

152
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,359
the last time we drank together.

153
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:49,799
Me neither.

154
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,000
It’s too rare and generous of Mother

155
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,679
to take out the best stash.

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,559
We better enjoy it

157
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,440
when there won’t be
another time like this soon.

158
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:58,040
Cheers!

159
00:07:59,359 --> 00:07:59,880
Cheers!

160
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,000
If your late mother

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,640
saw what you had achieved,

162
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,440
I’m sure

163
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,119
she’d be proud of you.

164
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,760
Oh, Father!

165
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,000
I think the same, though.

166
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,479
I told you

167
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,760
to always be...

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,359
- Humble!
- ...humble!

169
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,599
I know that.

170
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,159
Sadly,

171
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,080
after all these years,

172
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,799
those who slaughtered our village

173
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,479
and killed your mother

174
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,919
are still at large.

175
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,239
Father,

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,599
trust me.

177
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,400
Now that Mu’an is stable again,

178
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,440
I’ll hunt them down

179
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,960
at all costs

180
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,599
to avenge Mother’s murder.

181
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,639
(East Lounge)

182
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,200
Rise.

183
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,479
Thank you, Your Highness.

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,320
Come.

185
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,640
Have a safe trip, you two.

186
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,000
Take care.

187
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,400
You too, Grandmother.

188
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:43,919
Let’s go.

189
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,919
Baoning...

190
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,919
I’ll stay with you, Grandmother!

191
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh, silly!

192
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,919
If you do,

193
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:01,320
what about your husband?

194
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,359
There, there.

195
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,640
It’s not like you’ll be gone forever.

196
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,440
Feel free to come back to visit me

197
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,200
whenever you can.

198
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,200
Go.

199
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,159
Come.

200
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,000
Go ahead.

201
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,159
I’m going.

202
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,840
Father, Mother,

203
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,080
do take care of yourselves.

204
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,080
We will.

205
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:46,919
So should you.

206
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,719
Qian,

207
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,320
don’t forget about Dongdong
when you get back.

208
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,799
She’s old enough.

209
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,840
Remember to find her a good husband.

210
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,359
Now isn’t the time!

211
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,679
When would that be if not now?

212
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,119
Alright.

213
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,000
Baoning,

214
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,440
come back as long as you can.

215
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,559
Of course. I’ll miss you.

216
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,559
See you, Qian.

217
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,000
See you.

218
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,960
It’s about time.

219
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:15,440
Let’s go.

220
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:37,600
(Five Years Later)

221
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,679
Here.

222
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
Great Grandmother.

223
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,119
Mother.

224
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,840
Are you tired?

225
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,200
Or thirsty?

226
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,559
Have a mandarine

227
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,840
to rehydrate.

228
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,119
Great Grandmother.

229
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,640
Biggest ones are for the most respected.

230
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Here you are.

231
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,719
Good boy.

232
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,280
Greetings, Great Grandmother,

233
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,400
Mother.

234
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,760
- Brother.
- Min Zhou pays respects to

235
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,200
Your Highnesses.

236
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,359
Is the morning session over?

237
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:39,799
Yes.

238
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,239
How’s everything?

239
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:43,359
All good, Great Grandmother.

240
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,440
Have a mandarine, Brother.

241
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,440
An,

242
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,599
mandarines arrived are big and small.

243
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,479
If you give the big ones to me

244
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:02,159
and your brother,

245
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,640
you’ll only have the small ones.

246
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,280
Grand Mentor told me in class

247
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,960
about Kong Rong
giving up the biggest pear.

248
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,239
He said,

249
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:13,440
“The younger ones are ought
to choose smaller fruits.”

250
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,239
This is for you, Brother.

251
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:19,200
An,

252
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:23,159
you should give the big one to Mother.

253
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:24,960
Here you are, Mother.

254
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,359
I have no appetite.

255
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,640
I’ll pass.

256
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,239
Mother,

257
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,840
this batch of mandarines is the best.

258
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,280
Why don’t you have a taste?

259
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,679
Your Majesty,

260
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,840
are you giving me

261
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,679
leftovers?

262
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,440
I didn’t mean that.

263
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:50,400
Brother, let’s go play Cuju.

264
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,239
An,

265
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,799
I’m tired.

266
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,479
Go back with me.

267
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:55,000
Mother,

268
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,520
I want to play with Brother.

269
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,960
Have you done your homework

270
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,479
or memorized those texts?

271
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,440
Come here.

272
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:03,760
Say goodbye to Her Highness.

273
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,679
We shall take our leave, Your Highness.

274
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:11,840
Good day, Your Highness.

275
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,280
Ow! It hurts!

276
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,200
Shut up!

277
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,640
You deserve it!

278
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,159
How dare you insult me in front of them!

279
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,200
You’re useless!

280
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,719
Please calm down, Your Highness.

281
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:24,640
He’s a child.

282
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,400
Be patient with him.

283
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,359
Tears are all over his face.

284
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:30,400
I’ll have him freshen up.

285
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,599
Cry baby!

286
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,320
He’s still young.

287
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,760
Don’t be too mad, Your Highness.

288
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:40,960
He’s young?

289
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,080
Zhao Xi already ascended the throne

290
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,679
at his age.

291
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,119
But look at him!

292
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:49,080
He only cares about fruits and games.

293
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,880
A lineal son can’t be like that.

294
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:52,640
Your Highness,

295
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:57,080
ever since Zhao Xiao became
the new Marquis Jinghai,

296
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Nanmin has become even more prosperous

297
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,400
than it was back in Zhao Kuan’s days.

298
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,200
So far,

299
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:06,559
you’ve been backed by the young Emperor

300
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,000
and Marquis Jinghai.

301
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Don’t let trifles get under your skin.

302
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,119
It’s not worth it.

303
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,559
Zhao Xiao

304
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,840
is too proud

305
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,320
to bend for me.

306
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,119
Luckily,

307
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,200
you planted seeds of revenge in him

308
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:28,200
before he went back.

309
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,840
All thanks to your strategies.

310
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Miaorong,

311
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,039
relax.

312
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,760
Actually, I’m also waiting

313
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:43,520
for Zhao Xiao to grow strong enough

314
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,239
to stage a comeback against Li Qian.

315
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,119
Then my chance will come.

316
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,960
Are you upset

317
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,640
about how your mother treated you?

318
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,559
I must’ve done something wrong

319
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,400
that annoyed her.

320
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:04,919
If you didn’t

321
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,400
and she still treated you the same way,

322
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,280
how would you feel?

323
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,679
She’s strict with me

324
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,320
because she wants me to be diligent

325
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
instead of slack.

326
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,239
I always believe

327
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,440
all parents want the best
for their children.

328
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,760
You set a good example

329
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,719
for your younger brother, An.

330
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,520
That’s what I should do

331
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,719
as a son and an elder brother.

332
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,880
If you had a second chance,

333
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,400
Xi,

334
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,880
would you like to come to the throne

335
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,239
this young?

336
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,479
I don’t get it, Great Grandmother.

337
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,200
As supreme

338
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:57,080
as an emperor seems,

339
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,159
once you sit on that chair,

340
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:03,400
you’ll have to endure
loneliness and coldness,

341
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,599
hide your true feelings

342
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:09,239
from court officials

343
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,760
and live with all kinds of comments

344
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,400
from generations to come.

345
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,880
Xi,

346
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,079
there are many more challenges

347
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,839
down this road.

348
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,400
Will you be able to walk on
no matter what?

349
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:31,920
After so long,

350
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,239
I still remember

351
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,800
how Aunt paved the way

352
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,719
and led me to where I am now.

353
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,839
If she could take such a risk

354
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,239
to get me this far,

355
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,880
I’d never step down.

356
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:44,800
Excellent.

357
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
Your determination

358
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,000
is such a relief.

359
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,319
(Li’s Mansion)

360
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,599
This is to address
Lord Lintong, Li Qian.

361
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,119
Officials who serve the people

362
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,280
and the state
with loyalty and dedication

363
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:07,760
shall be rewarded.

364
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,199
“Lord Xin” as a title
is bestowed upon you

365
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,520
to encourage you
to carry on your honesty.

366
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,319
This commendation

367
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,839
is to thank you for your service

368
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,640
and honor your achievements.

369
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,359
Respect this.

370
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

371
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:34,319
Congratulations, Lord Xin!

372
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,319
Appreciated, Eunuch Min.

373
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,560
Qian! Qian!

374
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,239
I heard you’re promoted again!

375
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,319
That’s rude. Where are your manners?

376
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:42,959
This is my younger sister.

377
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,479
I apologize for her rudeness.

378
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,560
They say Miss Li is outgoing

379
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,920
and one of a kind.

380
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:51,280
Your reputation does precede you.

381
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,199
Pleasure to meet you, Eunuch Min.

382
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,520
The pleasure is mine.

383
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,680
Eunuch Min,

384
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,560
how’s Grandmother?

385
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,520
Her Highness is fine.

386
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,839
Don’t worry.

387
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,239
I came with the edict

388
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,959
to offer early birthday congratulations

389
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,000
to Lord Xin on His Majesty’s behalf

390
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,479
and

391
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,920
to check on Princess Jia’nan

392
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,479
for Grand Empress Dowager.

393
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,880
I’m doing well.

394
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,560
Please give Grandmother my regards

395
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,160
and tell her to take care of herself.

396
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,479
I will.

397
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,520
Your Grace,

398
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,920
my ride back is waiting outside.

399
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,680
I should get going.

400
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,239
Please excuse me.

401
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:26,920
I’ll walk you out.

402
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,920
Thanks.

403
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,640
Good day.

404
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,160
Goodbye.

405
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,319
Have a safe trip.

406
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,680
Qian,

407
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,199
why are you rewarded

408
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,680
all of a sudden?

409
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,079
Seeing that Eunuch Min
came to deliver the edict,

410
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:47,439
this reward

411
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:49,199
must be Grand Empress Dowager’s idea.

412
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,920
Too bad, Father and Mother aren’t here.

413
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,680
If they were,

414
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,520
they’d be thrilled!

415
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,359
Enough about me.

416
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,680
Where have you been

417
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,479
these days?

418
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:01,959
I’m a big girl now.

419
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,400
Stop treating me

420
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,119
as a child.

421
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,520
Fine. In that case,

422
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,880
stop running around and get married.

423
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,719
Just when I thought
no one would nag me to marry

424
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,199
after our parents
left for the post in the capital,

425
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,959
here you are to talk my ear off.

426
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,000
Would you rather grow old alone

427
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:20,239
or be a nun?

428
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That’s exactly what I have in mind.

429
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,079
Listen to yourself!

430
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,920
Our family is rich.

431
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,000
Even if Dongdong remains single forever,

432
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,920
as her sister-in-law,

433
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,199
I’ll support her
for the rest of her life.

434
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,599
You’re the best!

435
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,040
Stop spoiling her!

436
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,000
I’m not.

437
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,520
Women can choose to marry or not.

438
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
A bad marriage

439
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,040
is like hell.

440
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,560
Exactly!

441
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:40,719
You’re absolutely right.

442
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,560
I can’t agree with you more!

443
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,359
I simply...

444
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,680
Well, you know,

445
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,000
there are good men.

446
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,680
Your brother is one of them.

447
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,079
Find someone like him

448
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,040
and you’ll be fine.

449
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,520
Nice work to make everyone happy.

450
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,439
Qing An!

451
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,719
Qing An!

452
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
There you are.

453
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:26,280
Look. Aren’t they pretty?

454
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:28,000
Sniff them.

455
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,199
Hey, this one is cute.

456
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:51,640
Here you are.

457
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,479
Take it.

people are dying!

494
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:56,400
We must provide them with grain reserves

in disaster relief!

The plague has been spreading
since the outbreak last year.

501
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:12,280
Deputy Censor Wang
is asking for grains for civilians.

502
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,000
Nonsense!

503
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,839
If I give them away, what about my army?

504
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,479
Yes. I understand.

505
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,400
Dismiss him.

506
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:28,239
Find me another Wang Nan.

507
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,280
Get me another censor.

508
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,199
Let him go.

509
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:36,000
All of them are hideous!

510
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:37,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:51,480
(Qingyan Hall)

512
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,439
Has His Majesty approved it?

513
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:56,040
As per His Majesty’s verbal instruction,

514
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,760
you’re removed from your post.

515
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,439
Deputy Censor Wang,

516
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,640
go home and rest.

517
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,439
- There’s a severe famine outside!
- Get him out of here.

518
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,280
But His Majesty
is taxing the people to the bone!

519
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:11,760
- Move!
- Yongqing State is dying!

520
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:13,959
What are you doing?

521
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,160
We didn’t do anything!

522
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,079
What is this?

523
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,479
Arrest them

524
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,680
and throw them into prison.

525
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:32,800
Yes.

526
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:39,599
Move! Move it!

527
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,560
What are you doing?

528
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,199
You can’t do this to me!

529
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,599
I was a pirate

530
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,359
but I never robbed people of Nanmin!

531
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,599
Besides,

532
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,239
we beat back those at sea
for the late emperor!

533
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:51,000
That still counts!

534
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:51,719
Shut up!

535
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,160
We’re following Marquis Jinghai’s order.

536
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,439
Enough of your nonsense!

537
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,359
Officer.

538
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,520
Officer.

539
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:56,959
Mother.

540
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,640
He’s my only son

541
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,439
and our only hope

542
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:03,359
to carry on the Zhous’ family line.

543
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,959
He only joined the wrong group

544
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,719
because he had no choice!

545
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:07,439
Stop it!

546
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,040
Take him away.

547
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:08,920
Move!

548
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,319
Mother!

549
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:10,199
- Son!
- Mother!

550
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,800
- Officer!
- Mother!

551
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,079
Please, Officer!

552
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:13,599
Move!

553
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,439
Officer...

554
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,280
- Brother!
- Let me go!

555
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,920
Marquis Jinghai has become
insanely cruel over the years.

556
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:21,640
To make up for the heavy losses
when battling pirates,

557
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,400
he ignored the law

558
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
and imposed forced recruitment on us.

559
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,839
He also hoarded
the newly ripe local rice,

560
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,760
causing prices to go sky-high.

561
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,400
All the margin must’ve
ended up in his own pocket.

562
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:33,520
Indeed!

563
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,599
By confiscating

564
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:38,839
the arrested pirates’ weapons,

565
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,000
his army is now strong enough

566
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,479
to combat Jinxi Army.

567
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,319
You’re wrong about that.

568
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,000
Let me tell you something.

569
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:50,599
I once saw

570
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
a magic weapon back in Jinxi

571
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,160
that was destructive enough

572
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,280
to level the whole world.

573
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,199
It’s extremely powerful!

574
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,640
If Jinxi Army
is equipped with such weapons,

575
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,239
Marquis Jinghai’s troops
won’t stand a chance.

576
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,280
Really?

577
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,479
What exactly is that weapon?

578
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
Tell us in detail.

579
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,760
We want to know.

580
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,760
Please, Your Highness!

581
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,319
Spare me, please!

582
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:13,760
I can spare you

583
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,760
only if

584
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,359
you tell me the truth.

585
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,920
I’ll tell you everything

586
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,160
you want to know.

587
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,280
I swear.

588
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,400
It’s said that

589
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,640
a magic weapon was discovered in Jinxi

590
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:34,880
that was destructive enough

591
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,239
to level the whole world.

592
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,119
Is that true?

593
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,239
Yes, it is.

594
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,959
It’s true.

595
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:42,839
Tell me about it.

596
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Back then,

597
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:48,119
when we encircled
Jiang’s Mansion in Bingzhou,

598
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,280
Princess Jia’nan took out that weapon

599
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:56,079
and the next thing I knew,
my men were gone.

600
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:57,839
I barely made it out alive

601
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:59,400
and fled to the south.

602
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,000
Meanwhile, I swore to heaven

603
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,119
that I’d never

604
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,079
set foot in Jinxi ever again.

605
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:10,479
Do you still remember

606
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,800
what that weapon looks like?

607
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,400
(Li’s Mansion)

608
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,800
It’s been a while.

609
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,719
Congratulations!

610
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,599
This way, please.

611
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:16,959
Sure.

612
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:17,959
My lord.

613
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,839
- This way, please.
- Congratulations!

614
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:19,920
Greetings, Mr. Hu.

615
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,719
I wish you good fortune

616
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:23,959
and longevity.

617
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:24,920
That’s too nice of you,

618
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,479
Mr. Hu.

619
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,959
Mr. Hu, you’re a senior.

620
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,359
Your bow is too much.

621
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,719
Rank tops age.

622
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:30,920
That’s the rule.

623
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,040
His Majesty conferred
the title of Lord Xin on you,

624
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,880
which is the second noblest.

625
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:39,199
I’m in awe of you, my lord.

626
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,599
Here’s a little something

627
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:45,239
for your birthday.

628
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:46,560
I hope

629
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,119
it’s not too humble.

630
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,599
Please accept it.

631
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,719
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

632
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:51,959
Please have a seat inside.

633
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,160
Thank you, my lord.

634
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,719
- My lord.
- Please.

635
00:28:58,719 --> 00:28:59,400
Thank you. Thanks.

636
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,040
Congratulations! Congratulations!

637
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,880
This way, please.

638
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,160
My lord,

639
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,119
Mr. Hu regifted

640
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,280
what we gave to his wife

641
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,400
at her birthday last year.

642
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,400
How could he...?

643
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,079
Did you just meet that old fox?

644
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:12,880
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

645
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,439
Congratulations, my lord!

646
00:29:13,439 --> 00:29:14,319
This way, please.

647
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,479
Where’s Princess Jia’nan?

648
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,520
I haven’t seen Her Grace.

649
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,280
Well,

650
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,479
you receive the guests,

651
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:24,400
and I’ll go inside to look.

652
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,199
Yes.

653
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,439
Where’s Princess Jia’nan?

654
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
I have no idea, my lord.

655
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:44,479
Have you seen Princess Jia’nan?

656
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,160
No, my lord.

657
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:00,239
Baoning!

658
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,359
Baoning!

659
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:14,839
It’s you.

660
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,760
Where’s she?

661
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,439
To celebrate your birthday

662
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,760
and promotion

663
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,000
on this very day,

664
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,160
Her Grace prepared a special gift.

665
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,239
Bring it in.

666
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,760
Take your time, my lord.

667
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,640
Still, you haven’t said where she is.

668
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,479
She specifically told me

669
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,680
not to say that

670
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,160
until you open the case.

671
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,040
Why so mysterious?

672
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,839
Let me see

673
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:18,479
what game that clever girl is playing.

674
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,640
“A gift only for the wise.

675
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,520
Are you wise, darling?”

676
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,119
I’m wiser than you think!

677
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,839
“Are you giving in?”

678
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,079
“You can beg me.”

679
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,920
My dear princess,

680
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,040
where are you?

681
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:52,719
You know what?

682
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,040
I’m throwing in the towel.

683
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,160
Give me a hint, will you?

684
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:03,239
“Say ‘I’m an idiot’ out loud.”

685
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
I’m an idiot!

686
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,719
I’m an idiot! Happy?

687
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,880
The lock seems to be jammed.

688
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,280
Guests are waiting in the front hall.

689
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,239
I’ll work on it later.

690
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:41,519
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)

691
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:07,160
The lock is fine.

692
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,760
Qingke!

693
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,879
Qingke!

694
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,320
Qingke, where are you?

695
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,320
Come here.

696
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,239
Qingke...

697
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,159
Your Grace.

698
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,679
What took you so long?

699
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:50,120
Lock the case.

700
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:50,879
Let me see

701
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,120
what’s wrong.

702
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,719
You should come out.

703
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,760
I can beat my own trap.

704
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,360
Do it.

705
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:00,919
Come on.

706
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,040
Your Grace!

707
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,080
Unlock it, Qingke!

708
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,639
Are you alright, Your Grace?

709
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,639
I hit myself.

710
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,280
The switch is on the side.

711
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,600
The side? Which side?

712
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:20,679
What’s going on?

713
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,199
Where’s she?

714
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,239
She...

715
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,120
Hurry!

716
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,320
It’s not down there.

717
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,840
Go up! Go to the top!

718
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,679
Are you good?

719
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,520
Come out.

720
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,479
Be careful.

721
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,159
How are you? Did you get hurt?

722
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,600
I’m fine

723
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,919
amid the hit by accident.

724
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:47,159
Why... why are you back?

725
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,399
I’m back to make sure

726
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,959
you’re fine, of course.

727
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,080
What were you thinking

728
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,320
by going into the case?

729
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:00,280
I meant to surprise you.

730
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:03,199
May I see

731
00:36:03,479 --> 00:36:04,760
your so-called surprise now?

732
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Oh, that?

733
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:11,040
Well...

734
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:14,239
Am I not enough?

735
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,919
It’s me!

736
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:21,040
I like it.

737
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,199
Actually,
this Luban Lock is the surprise.

738
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,360
Still,

739
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:33,520
I prefer you.

740
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,080
Your Highness,

741
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,919
what’s on your mind?

742
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,560
I’ve recalled that

743
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,679
when I first

744
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,360
arrived in the capital

745
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,399
for the Machinist Contest,

746
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,719
The Book of Supreme Weapons
had already emerged.

747
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:07,000
Later, when I checked with my father,

748
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,760
he said

749
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:11,760
Empress Dowager Cao had handed it in

750
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,360
to the late emperor

751
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,600
which ended up in the Treasure House
at Longevity Hill.

752
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,600
Few had knowledge of that.

753
00:37:18,439 --> 00:37:19,760
The Machinist Contest

754
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:22,080
was also held
by some high-up in the Palace.

755
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,080
And I was asked to stay away from it.

756
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:26,639
Does it mean

757
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,280
that book is still in the Palace?

758
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,080
I remember

759
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,080
Baoning won that contest,

760
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,639
so she might

761
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,239
have it.

762
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,760
Or it might’ve never

763
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,560
left the Palace.

764
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,000
Baoning! Baoning!

765
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,479
She was in the Treasure House
at Longevity Hill

766
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,239
when that place was on fire.

767
00:37:57,479 --> 00:37:58,639
Come to think of it,

768
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,159
she was most likely there

769
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,239
for that book.

770
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,360
Thank you for giving yourself to me.

771
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,000
It’s the best gift I’ve ever had.

772
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:31,879
I meant to give you a sword yesterday,

773
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:34,719
but its scabbard was more fragile
than I thought.

774
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,560
It didn’t matter anyway.

775
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,760
What matters

776
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:40,600
is right here.

777
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:43,919
My father gave this jade pendant

778
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:46,080
to my mother as a love token.

779
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,040
He said

780
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:49,040
it witnessed

781
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,840
everything happened to them.

782
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,320
Ever since they left,

783
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,320
I’ve been wearing it

784
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,840
all the time.

785
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:00,600
This piece of jade was a present
to the imperial family

786
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
and a rarity.

787
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:03,800
However, a corner was chipped

788
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,120
due to an accident.

789
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,959
Even the best craftsman my uncle hired

790
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:07,719
couldn’t fix it,

791
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,919
so you can still see the crack.

792
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,600
Stay away from my business!

793
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,959
Xiuhe,

794
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,560
listen,

795
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,679
good acts can lead to trouble.

796
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,280
Don’t do it

797
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,800
or it’ll bury you and your family.

798
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,800
It’s the least I can do for Qing.

799
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,879
Leave me alone!

800
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,199
There will be consequences.

801
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:45,840
Now,

802
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,239
I’m giving it to you

803
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:51,320
as a symbol of our love

804
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,159
to be as solid

805
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,280
as my parents’.

806
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,879
You don’t like it?

807
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:09,239
I do.

808
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,719
It occurred to me
that I still have work left.

809
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,679
I need to go.

810
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:42,159
Is that... Zhao Xiao?

811
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,479
Yes, it is.

812
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:45,840
He’s scheduled to come back
to report on his work.

813
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:48,560
It’s about time that he arrives.

814
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:50,439
He’s changed tremendously

815
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,560
over the years.

816
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,599
(Gate of Divine Might)

817
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:18,000
Zhao Xiao.

818
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,360
Mr. Wang.

819
00:41:19,919 --> 00:41:20,719
Mr. Zuo.

820
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,639
How have you been over the years?

821
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:24,719
No sedan

822
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,679
or horse riding beyond the Palace gate.

823
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:29,280
Have you been away for too long

824
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,280
to remember the rules, Marquis Jinghai?

825
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,320
Mr. Wang,

826
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:35,040
those rules aside,

827
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,120
ask yourself

828
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,679
who should take the credit

829
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,840
for the prosperous capital
you’re living in.

830
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,439
Nevertheless, rules are rules.

831
00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:45,320
Rules?

832
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:48,159
Rice and flour you eat every day

833
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:50,320
all come from Nanmin.

834
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:52,080
So do military supplies

835
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,199
the court needs

836
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,080
and provisions

837
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,280
for the troops at the border.

838
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:58,239
Besides,

839
00:41:58,479 --> 00:42:00,239
we pay the maximum taxes

840
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,959
and get the minimum military fundings

841
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,120
only to benefit the court.

842
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:06,639
Mr. Wang,

843
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,760
when your daily life depends on me,

844
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,439
how dare you badger me about rules!

845
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,719
Zhao Xiao,

846
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,280
who do you think you are?

847
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,600
His Majesty is expecting me.

848
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:18,879
Good day.

849
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:32,080
We should’ve crushed him
once and for all

850
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,479
when he was most vulnerable.

851
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,120
Too late.

852
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,399
Greetings, Your Highness.

853
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:44,159
I brought with me from Nanmin

854
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:46,560
a rare treasure.

855
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:48,479
I hope you like it.

856
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,439
That’s very generous of you.

857
00:43:02,439 --> 00:43:03,600
I love

858
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:06,040
your gift.

859
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:07,399
Marquis,

860
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:09,280
we’re family.

861
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:10,959
You don’t need to do this.

862
00:43:13,479 --> 00:43:14,560
The past years

863
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:17,679
have only refined your elegance,
Your Highness.

864
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:22,239
We have no enemies

865
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,719
at home or abroad for so long

866
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,280
while our state keeps thriving

867
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,199
all because of you.

868
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,000
You’re flattering me, Your Highness.

869
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,159
I’m simply doing my job.

870
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,560
Mother.

871
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:36,639
An.

872
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:38,800
I’ve memorized

873
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,120
that poem you asked me to.

874
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:40,919
Come.

875
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,679
An, meet your uncle.

876
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,320
Pay your respects to him.

877
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,879
My respects to you, Uncle.

878
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:59,919
Was he born
after the late emperor passed away?

879
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:01,679
Yes.

880
00:44:02,919 --> 00:44:05,159
He should’ve been
the rightful heir to the throne.

881
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,360
Unfortunately,

882
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:09,959
he didn’t even get to see his father.

883
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:14,560
There’s a remarkable resemblance
between him and the late emperor.

884
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:18,280
Now that you’re back,

885
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,560
do you mind taking care of him?

886
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:23,040
I’ll do my best.

887
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Your Highness,

888
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,199
I need a favor, though.

889
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:35,719
Come. Let’s go.

890
00:44:40,959 --> 00:44:42,000
I heard

891
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,879
a new Treasure House

892
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,199
was built in the Palace

893
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,080
when the old one at Longevity Hill
was destroyed in a fire.

894
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:50,120
More valuable treasures

895
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,159
are stored there.

896
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:54,719
May I take a look inside?

897
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,639
Of course.

898
00:44:58,399 --> 00:44:59,080
Baihe,

899
00:44:59,879 --> 00:45:01,040
lead the way for him.

900
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:02,239
Yes.

901
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,679
Thank you, Your Highness.

902
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,199
Your Highness.

903
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,120
Follow him

904
00:45:20,959 --> 00:45:22,159
and see what he’s up to.

905
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,239
Yes.

906
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:33,400
(Treasure House)

907
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,399
Miss Baihe,

908
00:45:41,479 --> 00:45:44,000
it’s best that we wait here

909
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,600
when His Highness takes his time inside,

910
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:46,800
don’t you agree?

911
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,760
(The Book of Supreme Weapons)

912
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,120
Luckily, I’m well-prepared.

913
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,479
I got played!

914
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:19,199
Baihe,

915
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:19,879
why is Her Highness

916
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,399
asking for me this late?

917
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,560
She’s feeling unwell

918
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,399
and expecting you to examine her.

919
00:47:25,959 --> 00:47:27,280
We’d better hurry.

920
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,440
(Saint Empress Dowager Cishou’s Tablet)

921
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,879
Weren’t you Empress Dowager Cao’s maid?

922
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,239
Are you a nun at Fanhua Hall?

923
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,600
It’s dark.

924
00:47:55,919 --> 00:47:57,199
Where were you rushing to?

925
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,879
Your Highness,

926
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,919
my monastic name is Jing’an.

927
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,080
I was... I was going to...

928
00:48:04,399 --> 00:48:05,080
Say it!

929
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,719
Tell me the truth,

930
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:08,840
or, Baihe,

931
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,959
have her grilled in prison.

932
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,800
No, Your Highness!

933
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:14,479
I’ll tell you everything.

934
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:16,320
Please be lenient with me.

935
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:22,120
I was Empress Dowager Cao’s maid

936
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,280
before becoming a nun

937
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:27,639
to practice Buddhism at Fanhua Hall.

938
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,879
Marquis Jinghai is looking for me

939
00:48:30,439 --> 00:48:32,159
in the Palace,

940
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:36,080
so I tried to escape at night.

941
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,239
Marquis Jinghai is looking for you?

942
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,000
But why?

943
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,000
Uh...

944
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,360
Speak!

945
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:52,320
It has something to do with
The Book of Supreme Weapons.

946
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:56,599
(The Book of Supreme Weapons)

947
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:01,840
What happened?

948
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,040
Your Highness,

949
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:04,840
it’s a long story.

950
00:49:14,439 --> 00:49:15,320
I promise

951
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:18,479
your secret is safe with me.

952
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,919
But how come

953
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,760
the case is empty?

954
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,159
Where’s that book inside?

955
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:27,399
It must’ve been burned

956
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,919
when the Treasure House

957
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:31,639
at Longevity Hill caught fire.

958
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,399
This empty case

959
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,719
is nothing but a bait.

960
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,280
That book

961
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:43,639
is useless to me,

962
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,439
but we can use this

963
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,719
to our advantage.

964
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,840
I need you to find someone for me.

965
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:53,760
Your Highness,

966
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:58,040
I heard about that book
back in Li’s Mansion

967
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:01,040
which could be used
to make mighty weapons.

968
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,080
Back then,

969
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,800
the Li Clan and Li Qian’s birth mother

970
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,560
were all killed because of that book.

971
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:10,159
The Li Family has been
looking for it since then

972
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,080
but to no avail.

973
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:18,639
Is Marquis Jinghai
also trying to find it?

974
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,879
But

975
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,439
what’s that got to do with you?

976
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,399
I’ve been in the Palace for decades

977
00:50:26,879 --> 00:50:29,760
and I used to be
Empress Dowager Cao’s closest maid.

978
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,520
I guess

979
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,320
I’m the only one left

980
00:50:33,479 --> 00:50:36,199
who knows where that book came from.

981
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:40,320
Maybe Marquis Jinghai
found out about that

982
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:42,439
and wanted me in his custody.

983
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,439
Are you saying

984
00:50:44,879 --> 00:50:46,399
you know the origin of that book?

985
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,320
Yes.

986
00:50:49,919 --> 00:50:51,360
The Book of Supreme Weapons

987
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:55,159
was the Master of Weaponry,
Zhang Zeshi’s last work.

988
00:50:55,479 --> 00:50:57,760
It was a masterpiece.

989
00:50:58,199 --> 00:50:59,080
Rumor has it

990
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,239
that he gave that book

991
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:03,159
to one of his female disciples

992
00:51:03,479 --> 00:51:05,120
before retiring to the countryside.

993
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,239
The late emperor’s father

994
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:10,959
also craved that book.

995
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:13,159
Empress Dowager Cao, his then concubine,

996
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,679
asked Princess Jia’nan’s father,

997
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:19,159
Jiang Zhenying,
who was Zhang Zeshi’s student,

998
00:51:19,439 --> 00:51:22,439
to find it to win His Majesty’s favor.

999
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:23,840
She presented

1000
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,199
the book to him

1001
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:27,840
before long,

1002
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,919
thus

1003
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,199
gaining a foothold in the harem.

1004
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,239
Do you mean

1005
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,679
Jiang Zhenying grabbed that book?

1006
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:42,919
That book is of major significance.

1007
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,919
I wouldn’t dare to lie.

1008
00:51:49,919 --> 00:51:50,800
I see.

1009
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,280
You may leave.

1010
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,879
Remember,

1011
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:56,919
do not breathe a word of this to anyone.

1012
00:51:58,159 --> 00:51:58,760
I won’t.

1013
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,959
Miaorong,

1014
00:52:15,919 --> 00:52:17,120
you said

1015
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,879
The Book of Supreme Weapons

1016
00:52:18,879 --> 00:52:21,040
caused Li Qian’s birth mother’s death.

1017
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,719
If what that old nun said is true,

1018
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,080
Jiang Zhenying would be to blame.

1019
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:30,679
As Empress Dowager,

1020
00:52:30,879 --> 00:52:32,679
I can’t reverse a conviction

1021
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,879
solely based on a nun’s testimony,

1022
00:52:35,959 --> 00:52:38,320
or it’d shake the court.

1023
00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:51,639
Right now,

1024
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:55,280
Marquis Jinghai is also after that book.

1025
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,719
I’m sure

1026
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,000
the truth

1027
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,840
will come out eventually.

1028
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:06,479
Miaorong,

1029
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,280
wherever that book is,

1030
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:13,399
this could be

1031
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,159
your chance.

1032
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,719
Think about it.

1033
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:19,120
After what happened
between you and the Li Family,

1034
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,439
it’s time to

1035
00:53:21,919 --> 00:53:23,000
get your revenge

1036
00:53:23,919 --> 00:53:25,800
or return their favor.

1037
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:33,919
The conferring edict
has arrived in Bingzhou.

1038
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:35,280
Your son’s promotion

1039
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,760
has graced your whole family.

1040
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,760
You’re a lucky man, Mr. Li.

1041
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,399
A young man like him

1042
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,479
doesn’t deserve your compliment,
Mr. Zuo.

1043
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,959
He still has a long way to go.

1044
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,959
I must pay you a visit some other day

1045
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,760
for parenting advice.

1046
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,639
That’d be my honor.

1047
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:55,719
I’m looking forward

1048
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,679
to seeing you.

1049
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:15,000
Uncle Li.

1050
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,399
You are...?

1051
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,719
Long time no see, Uncle Li.

1052
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,080
How’s everything going?

1053
00:54:27,399 --> 00:54:28,159
Miaorong.

1054
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,000
Long time no see.

1055
00:54:32,919 --> 00:54:33,760
Uncle Li,

1056
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,520
let’s talk somewhere else.

1057
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,639
Sure.

1058
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,119
(Fanhua Hall)

1059
00:55:03,879 --> 00:55:05,879
What are you doing in the Palace?

1060
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,399
I drifted around due to the war

1061
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,280
and somehow landed here.

1062
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,239
Right now,

1063
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,879
I’m studying medicine
under master’s guidance

1064
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,399
and cultivating my mind in the Palace.

1065
00:55:24,439 --> 00:55:25,360
Gao Miaorong,

1066
00:55:26,399 --> 00:55:28,040
our family has cut all ties with you.

1067
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,399
What do you want?

1068
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,000
Uncle Li,

1069
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,679
you treated me well

1070
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,199
and I’m grateful to you for that

1071
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,520
despite all those incidents.

1072
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,399
I’m here

1073
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,239
to tell you something.

1074
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,320
What is it?

1075
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,479
You took me and my uncle in

1076
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,000
when I was little.

1077
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:02,639
I heard a lot
about the massacre of your village

1078
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:06,120
and Li Qian’s birth mother from you.

1079
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,159
So far, their killer still hasn’t
been brought to justice.

1080
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,360
What’s your point?

1081
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:19,479
Uncle Li,

1082
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:22,760
I’ve tracked down

1083
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:26,399
that perpetrator.

1084
00:56:28,439 --> 00:56:29,199
Who is it?

1085
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,639
It’s none other

1086
00:56:36,399 --> 00:56:39,360
but Princess Jia’nan’s father,
Jiang Zhenying.
