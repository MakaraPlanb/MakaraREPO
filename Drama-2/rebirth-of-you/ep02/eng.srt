Go away! What do you want to do to me?

28
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,750
I…

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,880
Enchanting incense.

30
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,630
Miss Jiang.

31
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,030
Miss Jiang.

32
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,440
Miss Jiang.

33
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,630
By mixing face powder
with enchanting incense,

34
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,470
an ordinary face powder ball

35
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,830
turns into a weapon.

36
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,160
How did she come up with such an idea?

37
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,750
Miss Jiang. Mr. Zhang.

38
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,960
I’m here to rescue you with the people
of the Mechanism Pavilion.

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,190
Mr. Zhang.

40
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,960
Come.

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,440
Miss Jiang. Miss Jiang.

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,800
What happened to her?

43
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
She seems fine.

44
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,670
I’ll take Miss Jiang downhill, then.

45
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,880
You two continue the contest.

46
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,880
I’ll quit and go down with her.

47
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,240
Thank you.

48
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,080
How did I knock myself out?

49
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,030
What a shame.

50
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,470
Fortunately, I didn’t inhale
too much incense.

51
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,470
Miss Jiang.

52
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,600
I…

53
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,670
I didn’t eat anything,

54
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,750
so I got dizzy just now.

55
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,000
Well,

56
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,670
I’ve found the waterproof material.

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,550
Take me to the Master.

58
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,360
Yes.

59
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,000
Come on.

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,880
Master.

61
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,390
I found the waterproof material.

62
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,520
It’s turpentine.

63
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,600
But Miss Jiang already

64
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,470
found it before you.

65
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,030
Didn’t she quit the contest?

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,440
She brought us the turpentine
when she came downhill.

67
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,720
After testing, we confirmed

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,950
it actually is a
natural waterproof material.

69
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,920
Therefore, the champion of the contest

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,200
is Miss Jiang.

71
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,950
Then, the Book of Supreme Weapons…

72
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,110
She took it.

73
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,510
In that case, I bid you adieu.

74
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,000
Please.

75
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,600
Fill the cup.

76
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,510
Try the food.

77
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,510
- Come.
- Please.

78
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,110
Okay.

79
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Congratulations to you
for winning the first prize.

80
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,790
Okay.

81
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,000
To be honest,

82
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,040
I have a favor to ask you.

83
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,760
Ask me?

84
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,550
What can I do for you?

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,480
The reason
why I take part in the contest

86
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,390
is because I want to find someone

87
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,830
who can help me solve the problems
with the sailboats of Nanmin Navy.

88
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,670
Okay.

89
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,760
My father is the Commandant of Nanmin.

90
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,070
Nanmin locates by sea.

91
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,510
We have navies.

92
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,830
Nowadays, most navies
are equipped with such sailboats.

93
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,160
Once caught in a storm,

94
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,550
the sailboats will go out of control.

95
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,480
They are often destroyed
and people die.

96
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,950
I wonder if you have any ideas

97
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,950
to improve the boats?

98
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,670
Let me have a try.

99
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,390
Are you interested?

100
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,720
Okay.

101
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,440
Qian.

102
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,790
We received the invitation for the
Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet.

103
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,440
I’ve had the gift sent to the capital.

104
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,390
The imperial edict allowing you to enter
the capital is also sent to you.

105
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,600
You must pay a formal visit to the
Empress Dowager before the banquet.

106
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,480
Young Master.

107
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,830
I went to the inn
where Miss Jiang stayed.

108
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,880
But the innkeeper said she had left.

109
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,270
What should we do now?

110
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,830
The Book of Supreme Weapons

111
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,600
is our only clue.

112
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,040
I haven’t returned her thing yet.

113
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,000
She should still be in the capital.

114
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,670
Go to make some inquiries.

115
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,320
Yes.

116
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,440
You were being silly.

117
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,320
Fortunately, Qingke told me in time.

118
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,790
The news hasn’t spread to the palace.

119
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,830
Otherwise, my father has to
go to the palace

120
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,070
and apologize to
the Grand Empress Dowager again.

121
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,920
Cousin, I know I was wrong.

122
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,350
I dare not do it again.

123
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,230
(The Archduke’s Son Jiang Lyu)
Naughty.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,070
Where’s my gilding ball?

125
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,000
It’s just a gilding ball.

126
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,110
If you like it,

127
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,350
I’ll find some better ones
when I get home

128
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,440
and send them to you.

129
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,640
No. It was made by myself.

130
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,780
(The Emperor of Mu’an State Zhao Yi)

131
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,270
(Eunuch Du Sheng)
Your Majesty, Her Grace arrives.

132
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,600
Why did you come here so early?

133
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,070
I haven’t seen you for days.

134
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,200
I just want to come over to see you.

135
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,760
I brought you fortunate cookies
given in tribute by Nanmin.

136
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,920
Especially sweet. Have a try.

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,880
What’s this?

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,200
A friend left it here for now.

139
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,320
Just a knickknack.

140
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,320
Baoning, you’re a princess.

141
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,720
The things you use should be worthy
of your status.

142
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,640
Everything in the palace,

143
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,110
look, the chair,

144
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,000
the candlestick,

145
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,470
the blanket,

146
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,110
which one was not
carefully prepared by me?

147
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,440
Breaking a boat

148
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,640
is not a big deal.

149
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,910
I’ll give you a jade boat next time.

150
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,000
Thanks, cousin.

151
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,640
I’m going back to rest, then.

152
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,960
Du Sheng, let’s go.

153
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,670
Your Grace, it’s my fault.

154
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,550
I should’ve hidden it in advance.

155
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,710
Silly girl,
it has nothing to do with you.

156
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,960
Don’t blame yourself.

157
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,760
Bring me my treasure box.

158
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,200
Your Grace.

159
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,180
(Eunuch Liu Xiaoman)

160
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,910
Are you all right?

161
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,230
I’m fine.

162
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,590
It doesn’t hurt at all.

163
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,000
Your Grace, please go to
the Imperial Garden now.

164
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,790
His Majesty is waiting for you.

165
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,400
Didn’t he just leave?

166
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,670
(Rhythmic Orchid Pavilion)
I invite you here to make up to you.

167
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,880
Open it.

168
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,760
What do you think?

169
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,640
Do you like it?

170
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,760
The phoenix pattern is for the empress.
I can’t accept it.

171
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,280
Giving you a bracelet
with phoenix pattern

172
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,550
means I want you to be my empress.

173
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,200
There you go again.
I must find an excuse to leave.

174
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,110
It looks like rain.

175
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,200
I’m going back now.

176
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,470
You should go back, too.

177
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,470
Baoning.

178
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,840
What do you want to do?

179
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,200
In any case,

180
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,590
you’re meant to be my empress,

181
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,760
whether you like it or not.

182
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,400
No, I…

183
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,150
What a dirty trick.

184
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,790
Your Majesty.

185
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,710
You…

186
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,440
Come to help.

187
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:40,880
No, I…

188
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,590
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

189
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,780
- I’m finished. It’s hard to clear myself.
- Your Majesty.

190
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,540
(Grand Empress Dowager)

191
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,080
Chief physician, how is the emperor?

192
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,710
Your Highness,

193
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,710
His Majesty fell into the water
and caught a cold.

194
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,110
He’s developed a cough and fever.

195
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,030
You’re good at pretending.

196
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,280
I’ll let the physicians decoct herbs

197
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,320
and bring it here.

198
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,550
Yi.

199
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,030
How do you feel?

200
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,550
Don’t worry. Grandmother.

201
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,550
Baoning, if Yi hadn’t saved you,

202
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,840
the one who lies here would be you.

203
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,030
Thank you for saving me today.

204
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,710
Grandmother, don’t blame Baoning.

205
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,280
Actually, I had something to give her,

206
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,350
so I asked her to meet me by the lake.

207
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,640
Do you have anything good

208
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,520
to give Baoning?

209
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,640
I specially have this made for her.

210
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,960
White jade bracelet
inlaid with a golden phoenix.

211
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,550
I want to tell Baoning,

212
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,030
I’ll

213
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,400
marry no one except her.

214
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,520
No, I didn’t expect that.

215
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,000
- He knows I’m obedient to Grandma.
- Good. Good.

216
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,230
You grew up in a short moment.

217
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,320
When you were children,

218
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,030
you laughed and played together.

219
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,760
It was like yesterday.

220
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,760
In a flash,

221
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,470
you’re about the age to get married.

222
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,110
Baoning,

223
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,550
would you like to stay in the palace?

224
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,200
His Majesty
was my playmate in childhood.

225
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,640
We grew up together.

226
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,280
Marrying him,

227
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,840
I only need to move from
Shoukang Palace to Ciyuan Hall.

228
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,320
I can stay with Grandma all my life.

229
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,350
Yi, why don’t you

230
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,550
put the bracelet on Baoning’s wrist?

231
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,550
Yes.

232
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,790
Grandmother, so,

233
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,550
what about mother?

234
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,230
Your grandma agrees with the marriage.

235
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,110
Would the Empress Dowager
object to it?

236
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,280
Thank you, Grandmother.

237
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,590
You may withdraw now.

238
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,520
(Township Mistress Qinghui Bai Su)
His Majesty fell into the water to save you.

239
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,000
Is he all right?

240
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,400
He pretends to be very ill.

241
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,880
How dare Zhao Yi set me up!

242
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,710
He tried to use the sympathy-getting ploy
to impress Grandma.

243
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,520
Grandma loves him.

244
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,590
She may force Empress Dowager Cao
to agree with our marriage.

245
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,960
What are you going to do?

246
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,540
(Hanyuan Hall)

247
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,590
Your Majesty,

248
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,550
Our country is vast in territory

249
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,470
(Empress Dowager Cao)
with numerous ravines from south to north.

250
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,840
It takes a long time travelling.

251
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,790
(Lord Jian)
I suggest

252
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,960
digging canals to connect waterways
from south to north.

253
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,940
(The Archduke Jiang Zhenyuan)

254
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,080
Your Majesty.

255
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,470
I disagree with Lord Jian’s suggestion.

256
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,000
What’s your opinion?

257
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,230
Please speak your mind freely.

258
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,350
I think

259
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,910
we have constant disputes
with Yongqing State in recent years.

260
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,230
If we dig canals as Lord Jian said,

261
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,590
it must exhaust the people
and drain the treasury,

262
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,470
leading the state to unrest.

263
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,080
The Archduke is reasonable.

264
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,230
Projects that waste money and manpower

265
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,350
are unacceptable.

266
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,280
It’s commendable that the Archduke

267
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,470
cares about the people.

268
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,520
But digging canals
and building irrigation works

269
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,110
will facilitate people.

270
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,350
It’s a common aspiration of the people.

271
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,440
Emperor,

272
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,670
what do you think?

273
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,400
Mother, you’re right.

274
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,150
Flowers.

275
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,440
(Gate of Divine Might)
Flowers.

276
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,350
Fresh flowers.

277
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,590
Mr. Li.

278
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,640
According to rules, you can’t enter
the palace with weapons.

279
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,550
When you leave,
come here to get it.

280
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,790
I’m a herald.

281
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,550
(Proper at the Time)
No weapons found. Let him in.

282
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,080
Let him in.

283
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,060
(Contented and Happy)

284
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,220
(Ingenious)

285
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,060
(The Book of Supreme Weapons)

286
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,640
(Wide tool bit
tool bar with black iron hoop)

287
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,230
Double-edged.

288
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,880
Isn’t it the weapon in the Lu Book?

289
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,200
The Book of Supreme Weapons?

290
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,590
The Machinist Contest

291
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,910
fooled me with a fake book.

292
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,470
Isn’t this rice paper
from Qinzheng Hall?

293
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,030
Qinzheng Hall?

294
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,150
You mean it’s used by His Majesty?

295
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,470
I almost forgot.

296
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,080
The contest must
have something to do with Zhao Yi.

297
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,640
Also,

298
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,320
the inexplicably pregnant maid,

299
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,440
he’s never talked about her.

300
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,640
It’s strange. I must ask him.

301
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,710
Qingke.

302
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,960
Your Grace, what can I do for you?

303
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,470
Let’s go. To Funing Hall.

304
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,030
Li Qian is honored to see Your Highness.

305
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:30,840
No need for the ceremony.

306
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,230
Thank you, Your Highness.

307
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,000
We’ve received the invitation
of Your Highness’s birthday banquet.

308
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,520
I specially come to the capital
for congratulations.

309
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,350
I appreciate it.

310
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,470
Though your father rose from the people,

311
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,350
he is brave
and good at fighting all his life.

312
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,400
Over the years, how are your family

313
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,230
doing in Jinxi?

314
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,440
Because of the late Emperor’s favor,

315
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,520
my father was appointed as
the Commandant of Bingzhou

316
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,230
after he defeated the army
of Yongqing State in Jinxi.

317
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,670
He’s been devoting himself

318
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,110
to the imperial court these years.

319
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,380
(Funing Hall)

320
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,350
Baoning, what’re you doing here?

321
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,160
Du Sheng, it’s hot today.

322
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,070
Go get some chilled fruit.

323
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,190
Baoning,

324
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,000
it’s such a hot day.

325
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,430
Why did you think of coming to see me?

326
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,590
I came to ask you

327
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,070
if the Machinist Contest

328
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,070
had anything to do with you?

329
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,110
How did you know about a civil contest?

330
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,350
When I went to see my uncle,

331
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,040
I accidentally found the contest.

332
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,560
So I took part in it on a whim.

333
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,230
I found by chance during the game

334
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,520
a corner of an unburned envelope

335
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,800
from the master
of the Mechanism Pavilion.

336
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,470
It was rice paper
from the Qinzheng Hall.

337
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,000
I wanted to surprise you.

338
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,190
Surprise me?

339
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,110
Yes. This year’s Machinist Contest

340
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,520
was held by me.

341
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,680
I planned to collect some
mechanical tools

342
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,830
among the people for you.

343
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,350
I wanted to send them to you myself.

344
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,830
Du Sheng.

345
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,560
Go get those entries

346
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,830
and show them to Baoning.

347
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,350
Yes.

348
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,710
The first prize of the contest

349
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,070
is the Book of Supreme Weapons.

350
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,400
But only after I won it

351
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,560
did I find it’s fake.

352
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,800
It’s just a weapon in Lu Book.

353
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,110
Lu Book is one of
the palace collections.

354
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,760
I found it because I’d read the book.

355
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,590
If someone else won the first prize,

356
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,880
they would never know it was fake.

357
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,350
You’re really good.

358
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,470
You actually took the first place.

359
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,710
So you really have the book?

360
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,520
It’s such a rare book.

361
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,190
How can I get it?

362
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,000
If not, why do you take it as a prize?

363
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,520
I’d seen it from my late father.

364
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,560
I knew it was very precious.

365
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,310
I thought if I took it as a prize,

366
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,430
the contest might attract

367
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,310
many skilled craftsmen.

368
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,230
Saw it from the late emperor?

369
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,760
Does that mean it was in the palace?

370
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,680
Here.

371
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,310
Sure enough, it’s not here.

372
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,110
Why has the maid called Fang Yiru

373
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,040
in your palace

374
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,190
been missing for days?

375
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,520
That maid.

376
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,190
She climbed up a ladder to clean
the other day

377
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,230
before she accidentally fell down
and broke her head.

378
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,800
She died that night.

379
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,880
Died?

380
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,230
Liar.

381
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,160
Why does he hide it from me?

382
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,710
Could

383
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,760
the baby be his?

384
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,760
Well, Baoning,

385
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,110
there’re quite a lot of things.

386
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,800
Shall I let Du Sheng
have it sent to your palace?

387
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,880
Okay.

388
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,470
Then I’m going back now.

389
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,950
(Funing Hall)
It’s really strange.

390
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,070
Since she’s pregnant,

391
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,310
maybe I can find some clues
in the medical record room.

392
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,640
Go to find me a uniform

393
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,950
for the assistant physician
of the Imperial Hospital.

394
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,680
Your Grace, what’re you going to do?

395
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,880
Do what I asked you to do.

396
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,430
Go.

397
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,880
Yes.

398
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,000
Your Highness.

399
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,560
Our army defeated the enemy of Yongqing.

400
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,110
The herald brings news of victory.

401
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,160
Let him in.

402
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,680
Your Highness.

403
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,900
(News of victory)

404
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,280
(Commander of the Imperial Guards Cao Guozhu)
Your Highness, are you all right?

405
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,590
I’m fine.

406
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,190
Young Master, he is the one

407
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,640
who contacts with the herald
in the palace.

408
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,710
Your Highness.

409
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,470
I passed the palace gate
with the herald.

410
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,520
I found at that time

411
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,280
his belt was badly worn

412
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,470
at here,

413
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:54,520
which means

414
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,110
who used to wear the robe

415
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,640
usually tied the belt here.

416
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,880
There was barely any crimp

417
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,160
where the assassin tied his belt.

418
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,230
It indicates the robe isn’t his at all.

419
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,310
I didn’t know what he wants.

420
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,760
So I played cat and mouse
and let my guard follow him.

421
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,350
I never thought he came to
assassinate Your Highness.

422
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,000
This man must be a traitor
in the palace.

423
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,950
Commander Cao,

424
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,880
drag him down.

425
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,520
Wait for penalization.

426
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:20,830
Yes.

427
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,880
Someone, drag him down.

428
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,350
Yes.

429
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,110
Your Highness, spare me!

430
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,070
Li Qian, you did a good job
protecting me.

431
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,470
Min Zhou.

432
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,190
(Eunuch Min Zhou)
Yes, Your Highness.

433
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,040
Now take Li Qian

434
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,800
to the Imperial Hospital
to heal his wounds.

435
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,280
Yes, Your Highness.

436
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

437
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,800
You go to Shoukang Palace.

438
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,830
You go to Qinzheng Hall.

439
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,640
Yes.

440
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,280
(Lord Cheng’en Cao Xuan)
Princess. Mistress Qinghui.

441
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,430
What happened?

442
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,430
Why do you reinforce guards
in the palace today?

443
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,040
An assassin attacked the Empress Dowager
in Cining Palace.

444
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,070
For safety,

445
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,640
security has been stepped up
in the palace.

446
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,880
Assassin?

447
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,110
The palace is heavily guarded.

448
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,110
How did the assassin sneak in?

449
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,830
The assassin who disguised as a herald
was from Yongqing State.

450
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,830
Fortunately, Li Qian,
son of the Commandant of Bingzhou,

451
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,710
saw through his plot in time.

452
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,520
He broke the assassin’s neck
and killed him on the spot.

453
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,560
The Li family accepted amnesty
and surrendered before.

454
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,000
They used to make
lots of trouble in Bingzhou.

455
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,920
Of the 5 prefectures, 16 districts and
178 counties,

456
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,950
his family alone controlled
3 prefectures, 11 districts

457
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,230
and 129 counties.

458
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,640
Cao Xuan,

459
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,000
you just come here
to catch assassins.

460
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,040
How dare you take the chance
to get close to Baoning?

461
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,520
Baoning.

462
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,040
Your Majesty.

463
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,880
Baoning.

464
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,400
I heard that an assassin
sneaked into Cining palace.

465
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,190
I’m afraid you’re frightened.

466
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,110
So I come here to check on you.

467
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,400
We’re fine here.

468
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,830
That’s good.

469
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,520
I’ll go to check on Grandmother.

470
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,280
Do you like Lord Cheng’en?

471
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,280
Don’t talk nonsense.

472
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,310
I only met him a few times
in the palace.

473
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,760
Good for you.

474
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,830
He is the nephew of Empress Dowager Cao,

475
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,190
a relative on the distaff side.

476
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,280
His title ends in three generations.

477
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,430
That doesn’t count.

478
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,710
He does well
when the Cao Family is in power.

479
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,800
But if His Majesty
comes into power in the future,

480
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,190
the Cao Family will be
the first to suffer.

481
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,880
Baoning, let’s go.

482
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,110
Grand Mentor Xiong is waiting for us.

483
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
An assassin sneaked in.

484
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,640
Now the guards must’ve been

485
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,830
transferred to each palace.

486
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,710
Isn’t it the best time

487
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,950
to go to the medical record room?

488
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,800
Baoning.

489
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,470
I suddenly remember
I have something to do.

490
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,110
You go without me.

491
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,590
Please tell Grand Mentor Xiong
I asked for leave.

492
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,880
Okay, I’m going.

493
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,070
Did you prepare
the uniform for me?

494
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,950
Do you want it now?

495
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,400
There’s no better time.

496
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,350
Go.

497
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,680
Your Highness, I’ve confirmed

498
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,160
the herald was an assassin
from Yongqing State.

499
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,680
The army of Yongqing was defeated.

500
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,230
He killed the real herald

501
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,760
and pretended to be him
to assassinate you.

502
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,800
Are you sure it had nothing to do
with the emperor?

503
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,430
I’m sure.

504
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,470
Your Highness,
there’s something I don’t understand.

505
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,230
It was dangerous just now.

506
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,110
Why didn’t you let me
catch the assassin?

507
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,400
Didn’t you stay by my side?

508
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,950
Even if Li Qian failed,

509
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,680
I’m sure

510
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,560
you could protect me.

511
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,040
By the way, what’s Li Qian’s position?

512
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,880
He works under his father, Li Changqing,

513
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,680
as a Fifth-Rank
General of Guerrilla Warfare.

514
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,470
Give an order for me.

515
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:24,000
Appoint Li Qian as Third-Rank
Armed Guard of the Imperial Guards.

516
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,000
I was troubled over promoting him.

517
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,800
The assassin came at the right time.

518
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,950
Do you keep Li’s son in the palace

519
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,710
because you want the support
of the Li Family?

520
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,520
The emperor grew up.

521
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,760
I must do something.

522
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,580
(Funing Hall)

523
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,660
(Records of Cining Palace)

524
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,310
Fang Yiru.

525
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,110
Was my guess wrong?

526
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,160
Why aren’t there any records?

527
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,580
(Maid Xiao Rongniang Bazhen decoction)

528
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,040
The maid named Xiao Rongniang

529
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,470
(Maid Xiao Rongniang Bazhen decoction)
had Bazhen decoction 6 months ago.

530
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,070
But during that time,

531
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,430
no concubine was pregnant.

532
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,800
Abortion prevention medicine
couldn’t be prescribed

533
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,350
unless ordered by the emperor.

534
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,230
The baby must have something to do
with His Majesty.

535
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,000
If Zhao Yi is really absurd like this,

536
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,040
Grandma would never

537
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,310
let me marry him again.

538
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,230
To find the truth,

539
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,800
I must find Xiao Rongniang first.

540
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,310
(Fortune and Auspiciousness)
Mr. Li, please take a seat.

541
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,920
I’ll see if the physicians are free.

542
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,040
Thank you.

543
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,520
What is he doing here?

544
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,680
I think the physicians are busy now.

545
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,160
Just find an assistant for me.

546
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,760
It won’t do, Mr. Li.

547
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,310
You’ve saved the Empress Dowager’s life.

548
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,830
How can I just find a random assistant

549
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,640
to dress your wound?

550
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,350
Isn’t his name Zhang Qian?

551
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,470
How come he becomes

552
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,310
Li Qian who saved the Empress Dowager?

553
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,640
There.

554
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,160
The assistant there.

555
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,350
Could you apply the medicine for me?

556
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,000
Come here. Assistant.

557
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,470
Thank you.

558
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,710
Mr. Li, I’ll leave you alone.

559
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,710
I have some business to do.

560
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,590
What’re you doing?

561
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,830
Aren’t you an assistant physician?

562
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:39,640
You…

563
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,640
It’s you.

564
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,230
Miss Jiang.

565
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,430
Miss Jiang.

566
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,800
I know the ways well in the palace.

567
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,430
I’m an assistant physician getting
medicine for the princess.

568
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,190
(Three Abodes of the East)
Baoning, why are you dressed like this?

569
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,230
Lyu.

570
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,680
I become

571
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,880
interested in medicinal herbs recently.

572
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,070
So I went to the Medicine Service.

573
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,110
Do you know herbs?

574
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,950
I’ve been weak since childhood.
Prolonged illness makes me a doctor.

575
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,830
Maybe I’ll become
a famous doctor one day

576
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,950
and practice medicine.

577
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,830
Your favorite food
bought in the east of the city.

578
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,590
I have something important
to discuss with His Majesty.

579
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,350
Mother asked me to bring it to you.

580
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,160
Aunt is always thinking of me.

581
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,710
I need your help with something.

582
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,710
What is it?

583
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:09,000
Well, I want you to find someone.

584
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,640
The person…

585
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,310
(Good Governance and Harmonious People)
(Clear River and Calm Sea)

586
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:14,920
By the way,

587
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,560
you don’t have
to look for the girl again.

588
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,350
I met her in the palace today.

589
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,640
No wonder I couldn’t find her.

590
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,800
She is in the palace.

591
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,950
Is she a maid?

592
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,310
I don’t know.

593
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,680
She disguised as an assistant physician
in the Imperial Hospital.

594
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,000
I wanted to talk to her.

595
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,430
But she slipped away.

596
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,640
Can we get the

597
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,950
Book of Supreme Weapons from her?

598
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,710
Empress Dowager Cao appointed me
as Third-Rank Armed Guard.

599
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,920
I’ll be on duty in the palace
from tomorrow.

600
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,070
I’m sure I’ll meet her again.

601
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,400
I’ll go to catch you
when I count to one hundred.

602
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,280
I used to catch you every time.

603
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,590
You must hide well this time.

604
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:57,830
One.

605
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,000
Hurry. Go. Go.

606
00:32:59,280 --> 00:32:59,760
Two.

607
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:01,920
Three.

608
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:02,680
Go.

609
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,830
Four.

610
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,950
Why do you follow me?

611
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,160
My dagger is merciless.

612
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,160
Jiang Xian.

613
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,470
It’s you again.

614
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,560
So, do you think you can
take the hairpin as a dagger?

615
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,830
You pretended to be a physician
the other day.

616
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,830
I didn’t catch you.

617
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,640
Today I won’t let you go.

618
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,680
I’ve checked.

619
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,230
There’s no maid
called Jiang Xian in the palace.

620
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,350
Judging by your gorgeous clothes,

621
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,760
are you a princess?

622
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,280
Tell me, who are you?

623
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:57,680
I…

624
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,110
Don’t I look like a princess?

625
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,400
Besides, why do I have to tell you
who I am?

626
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,520
You’re not Zhang Qian, either.

627
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,560
I…

628
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,280
I’m a son of the Commandant of Bingzhou,
Li Changqing.

629
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,910
Li Qian.

630
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,800
I said I was Zhang Qian

631
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,000
just for convenience during the contest.

632
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,470
Why do you look for me?

633
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,150
I want to see
the Book of Supreme Weapons.

634
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,280
Your Grace.

635
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
You’re here.

636
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,710
The Archduke’s son came.

637
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,840
He wants to see you right now.

638
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,390
You’re good.

639
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,430
You find someone to cover you up.

640
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,950
Are you a new guard?

641
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,520
Why are you so rude to
Commandery Princess Jia’nan?

642
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,430
Ignore him.

643
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,800
Qingke, you go to tell Su.

644
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,560
I’m going back to Three Abodes
of the East to see Lyu first.

645
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,870
Is she really
Commandery Princess Jia’nan?

646
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,700
(Clear River and Calm Sea)

647
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,230
I really didn’t expect she is

648
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,230
Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

649
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,840
Is she?

650
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,630
Isn’t it the Archduke’s carriage?

651
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,120
Princess Jia’nan.

652
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,470
Turn around and follow the carriage.

653
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:28,950
Yes.

654
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,910
Baoning, are you in trouble?

655
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,280
Why don’t you

656
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,470
tell me what happened?

657
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,760
If I can’t help you,

658
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,840
I’ll ask my father.

659
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,190
Lyu, I’m not a child.

660
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,950
Can’t you trust me?

661
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,560
I can’t tell you why I have to

662
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,630
find Xiao Rongniang.

663
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,870
Don’t ask me again.

664
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,430
But she didn’t offend me.

665
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,190
Anyway, I must

666
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,040
find Xiao Rongniang.

667
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,000
Please help me out.

668
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,280
Okay. Okay.

669
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,360
I just can’t refuse you.

670
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,000
Come. Be careful.

671
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,870
Why does the princess
come here in disguise?

672
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,360
The Archduke’s son

673
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,800
comes to our humble shop.

674
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,080
We’re so honored.

675
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,040
Someone, bring the best Longjing tea.

676
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,520
Yes.

677
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,840
Don’t bother.

678
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,430
I come here today...

679
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:00,870
Well,

680
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,000
for my cousin,
Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

681
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,520
Several days ago,

682
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,950
she carelessly damaged

683
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,520
the peacock feather gold thread cape
given by the Grand Empress Dowager.

684
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,910
I took it to the Tailoring Service
in the palace.

685
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,120
Unfortunately,

686
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,280
they said it couldn’t be mended.

687
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,320
Young Master, can I take a look?

688
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,080
It’s a precious cape.

689
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,470
What a pity it’s torn.

690
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,390
Don’t worry, Young Master.

691
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,950
We have a tailor

692
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,520
called Xiao Rongniang,

693
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,230
who came out from Funing Hall.

694
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,080
Xiao Rongniang is here as expected.

695
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,630
Ask Xiao Rongniang to come out.

696
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,280
Yes.

697
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,320
Young Master, just a moment.

698
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:44,800
Young Master, they’ve been in for long.

699
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,120
Why haven’t they come out?

700
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,080
There’re many tailors in the palace.

701
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,360
Why do they come to
an embroidery workshop?

702
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,390
Wei Shu, I’ll go in and have a look.

703
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,670
You wait for me here.

704
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,430
Yes.

705
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,710
This is Master Jiang.

706
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,360
You tell her.

707
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,560
Young Master. Look at this.

708
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,520
Judging by her belly,

709
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,080
she isn’t pregnant.

710
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,000
So the medicine
was prescribed for…

711
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,230
Xiao Rongniang.

712
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,190
How long have you been
out of the palace?

713
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:31,950
If you’re out too long,

714
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,190
I wonder if you’re still capable

715
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,190
of doing delicate needle craft.

716
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,230
I left the palace six months ago.

717
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,320
But the maids of Funing Hall

718
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,470
always come to me if there’re

719
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,230
anything they can’t mend.

720
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,000
Six months ago.

721
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,190
It was exactly the time
when the medicine was prescribed.

722
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,840
It seems that someone

723
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,390
took the medicine in the name of Xiao.

724
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,430
In that case,

725
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,040
I’ll leave the peacock feather

726
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,840
gold thread cape to you.

727
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,910
This is really

728
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,630
rare good cloth.

729
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,910
I’m surprised the embroidery workshops
in the capital

730
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,080
are hundreds of times better than those
in Bingzhou.

731
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,000
It’s really rare.

732
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,910
Shopkeeper.

733
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,040
Baoning.

734
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,190
I’ll take both of these.

735
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:12,910
Don’t call me.

736
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,840
Pack it, clerk.

737
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,190
See you. Young Master.

738
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,560
Let’s go. Go.

739
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,800
Baoning,

740
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,800
why did you hide from that man?

741
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,470
He’s Li Qian, son of the
Commandant of Bingzhou.

742
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,280
The Empress Dowager appointed him
as Third-Rank Armed Guard.

743
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,870
I’ve met him before in the palace.

744
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,150
I was afraid he would recognize me

745
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,520
and make me trouble.

746
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,760
Be careful.

747
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,280
I heard when Princess Jia’nan
was a child,

748
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,360
she used to climb
on the Emperor’s desk,

749
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,120
and stamped casually
with the imperial jade seal.

750
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,190
The late Emperor
and the Grand Empress Dowager

751
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,230
wouldn’t scold her.

752
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,560
Now is she afraid of damaging a cape?

753
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,870
It’s strange.

754
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,760
Young Master, shall we let a man

755
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,430
keep watch on the shopkeeper?

756
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,470
No.

757
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,430
I’ll ask Princess Jia’nan

758
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,840
face to face.
