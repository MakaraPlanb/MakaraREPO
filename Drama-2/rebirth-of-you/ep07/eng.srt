I hope Your Majesty make an Empress
and have a prince soon.

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,520
I think

29
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:13,520
District Princess Qingyi

30
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,160
was born in a noble family

31
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,080
with talents and virtue,

32
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,039
she is perfect to be the Empress.

33
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,720
Today,

34
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,360
I make District Princess Qingyi

35
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,240
the Empress.

36
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:32,720
Mother.

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,921
Your Majesty, are you happy?

38
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:54,360
My marriage

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,440
is in your hands, Mother.

40
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,000
Summon District Princess Qingyi
to be granted.

41
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,279
The hall of the Empress
has been uninhabited for long.

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,440
District Princess Qingyi is highborn

43
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:42,759
with virtue and diligence,

44
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,639
by the order of the Empress Dowager,

45
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,919
she is made the Empress
and shall move to the harem.

46
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,600
Respect this.

47
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,119
Thank you for your grace, Your Highness,

48
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,679
Your Majesty.

49
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,399
Wish Your Majesty and the Empress

50
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,559
a harmonious union
lasting a hundred years.

51
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,239
Long live Your Majesty.

52
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:25,079
Long live Your Highness.

53
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,239
Cao Guozhu is inside. Kill him.

54
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,880
(Yile Hall)

55
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,375
Excellent!

56
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,025
Excellent!

57
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:50,732
Excellent!

58
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,640
Great!

59
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,475
Wow.

60
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,440
A string of six lanterns?

61
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,320
Seems that Cao Guozhu is dead.

62
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,359
Good.

63
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,399
Young Master, Cao Guozhu is dead.

64
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:21,959
I see.

65
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:24,200
Young Master.

66
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,519
I’ll go with you.

67
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,559
We must make Empress Dowager Cao believe

68
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:30,079
that we learned the news by accident.

69
00:05:30,175 --> 00:05:31,559
I have to go by myself.

70
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,600
Get some people
to guard the Paiyun Hall.

71
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,440
The Empress Dowager
will leave from the Dehui Hall.

72
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,279
The only way to leave the Longevity Hill

73
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,440
is to pass through the Paiyun Hall
and go down from the mountain behind.

74
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,239
Okay.

75
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,875
I’ll send people to the Paiyun Hall now.

76
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:45,425
Um.

77
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,119
This entrance

78
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,279
should be guarded by Jiang Lyu.

79
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:20,959
(Yile Hall)

80
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,480
Excellent!

81
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,440
Great!

82
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,150
Come on.

83
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,519
Didn’t they say
Commandery Princess Jia’nan

84
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,720
would be made the Empress
a few days ago?

85
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,000
How did it become
Lord Jian’s granddaughter today?

86
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:34,900
Good.

87
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,519
Although His Majesty
and Princess Jia’nan are in love,

88
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,399
they are no match
for the Empress Dowager.

89
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,760
Lord Jian
is on the Empress Dowager’s side.

90
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:47,720
His Majesty dare not
disobey the Empress Dowager.

91
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,440
I remember His Majesty’s face

92
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,959
when the Empress was made.

93
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:53,839
Let’s not talk about it.

94
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,920
Lord Jian has arrived.

95
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,440
Lord Jian.

96
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,400
Lord Jian.

97
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,799
Good. Good.

98
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:12,000
Please. Please.

99
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,640
Congratulations to Lord Jian.

100
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,679
Now District Princess Qingyi
is the Empress.

101
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,880
You and the royal family
are twice related now.

102
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,760
It’s the Empress Dowager’s idea.

103
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,760
The Empress Dowager

104
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,720
likes my granddaughter a lot.

105
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:34,760
She stays by Her Highness’s side
right after she entered the palace.

106
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:35,440
Well...

107
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,679
I wonder how it is going with Li Qian.

108
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:49,550
Okay.

109
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,676
Come on.

110
00:07:56,799 --> 00:08:00,200
It’s said that the dragon totem was
embroidered with gold feather thread.

111
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:01,559
His Majesty’s court dress

112
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,720
didn’t use the feather thread.

113
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,720
Has the juggling started?

114
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:12,440
Right after the banquet.

115
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:15,440
The ministers and Titled Madams
are watching it now.

116
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,040
Lianzhu Troupe

117
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,760
specially prepared some shows
for Your Highness.

118
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,799
They are waiting for you to come,

119
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:22,959
so that they can perform.

120
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,679
Um.

121
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:25,440
Very good.

122
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,359
Your Highness.

123
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:31,040
Guard Li broke in
from the rear court room.

124
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,119
He said he has something urgent
to tell you.

125
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,520
Who is Guard Li?

126
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,919
Commandment of Bingzhou’s son,

127
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,520
Li Qian, the one

128
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,760
you promoted last time.

129
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,599
Him?

130
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,280
Let him in.

131
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,599
Yes.

132
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,119
Your Highness.

133
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,559
Why do you look a mess? What happened?

134
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,719
Your Highness, please come with me now.

135
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,400
Commander Cao has been killed.

136
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,520
His Majesty and the Archduke
are coming with their men.

137
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,599
It doesn’t look good for you,
Your Highness.

138
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:11,119
What did you say?

139
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:12,320
I have no reason to lie to you.

140
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,640
If you don’t believe me,

141
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,599
just send someone to check the outside.

142
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,479
Your Highness.

143
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,359
You must believe me.

144
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,440
When I was punished by
Commandery Princess Jia’nan that day,

145
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,080
it was Commander Cao who saved me.

146
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,799
I wanted to thank him in person,

147
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,239
but I didn’t expect

148
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,080
that Jiang’s guard killed Commander Cao.

149
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,200
Now the men
around the Tempe of Gratitude

150
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,679
have been replaced by Jiang’s guards.

151
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,559
I broke my way out to be here.

152
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,359
Looks like the Emperor
has been plotting a coup.

153
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,159
He won the Jiang family over

154
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,000
to force me to hand the power
back to him.

155
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,159
Your Highness.

156
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,640
The Paiyun Hall is right behind
the Dehui Hall.

157
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,359
We can go down the path
beside the Paiyun Hall

158
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,479
and we can get to
the foot of the Longevity Hill.

159
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,799
I have asked my people

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,039
to wait for Your Highness

161
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,159
at the foot of the Longevity Hill.

162
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,320
Let me ask you again.

163
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:10,479
Is Commander Cao really dead?

164
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,159
I saw it with my own eyes

165
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,880
that the Jiang family’s guard
killed Commander Cao.

166
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,400
You two stay here.

167
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,080
As long as I can leave here,

168
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,320
they dare not do anything to you.

169
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,080
Yes.

170
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,000
Let’s go.

171
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,039
Your Highness.

172
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:36,000
Your Highness.

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,550
You must be safe.

174
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,650
Your Highness, this way.

175
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,175
Um.

176
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,375
(The Directorate of Palace Seals)

177
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,080
Your Highness.

178
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,239
Your Majesty.

179
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,039
You and General Jiang
came to my place so late.

180
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,280
What’s so urgent?

181
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,159
Mother.

182
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,919
This whole Longevity Hill

183
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,080
has been surrounded

184
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:16,239
by the Jiang family’s guards
and my guards.

185
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,359
This is your big gift to me

186
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,520
for my birthday?

187
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,960
I implore Mother
to return the power to me.

188
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,679
Jiang Zhenyuan.

189
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,679
Did you teach the Emperor to do this?

190
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,679
Your Highness.

191
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,080
The generations of the Jiang family
have been loyal.

192
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,719
We are following
the will of the Emperor.

193
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,520
It’s all because of you.

194
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,080
You think I’m too young

195
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,719
to handle political affairs,

196
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,119
and you still seize the reins of power.

197
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,640
I have no other way

198
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,159
but to ask the Archduke
to purge the court for me.

199
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:36,975
(Yile Hall)

200
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:45,080
Young Master, this is...?

201
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:46,039
Vice Minister of Rites.

202
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,679
Your job is to maintain the rites,

203
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:51,400
but you sent Empress Dowager Cao
a porcelain carved with the motif of dragon.

204
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,919
You disrespected His Majesty
and you should be killed.

205
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,719
Get him.

206
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:56,200
Yes.

207
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,919
How is this possible?

208
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,320
Young Master!

209
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,799
I’m wronged, Young Master!

210
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:03,919
Lord Jian.

211
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,599
His Majesty never dared

212
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,840
to defy the Empress Dowager in public.

213
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,960
The Empress Dowager hasn’t shown up.

214
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,280
Could something go wrong?

215
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,280
Let’s wait and see.

216
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,080
I guess Empress Dowager Cao
has been besieged by Zhao Yi now.

217
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:29,760
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

218
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,520
Don’t follow me.

219
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,880
Your Grace.

220
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Young Master Zhao?

221
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,359
Why are you here?

222
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:51,880
Let’s go.

223
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,559
Your Grace.

224
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,119
I saw you leave in a hurry.

225
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,200
Where are you going?

226
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,559
Take me out first.

227
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,679
Okay, follow me.

228
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,320
Okay.

229
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,440
Seems that my son has grown up.

230
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,479
I’m happy.

231
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
In the blink of an eye,

232
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:38,880
you are a big man now.

233
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,400
I carried you for ten months

234
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:45,640
and raised you up with a lot of effort.

235
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,080
You are a part of me.

236
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:52,719
During all these years,

237
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,359
I’ve been trying my best

238
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,080
to govern Mu’an well.

239
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,559
I did all this to assist Your Majesty.

240
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:04,320
Today, you want me
to give you the power back.

241
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:09,479
I’m delighted
from the bottom of my heart.

242
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,640
But I’m curious about

243
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,440
how much you know about Mu’an.

244
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,760
Do you know how many prefectures
and subprefectures there are in Mu’an,

245
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,960
Your Majesty?

246
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:29,520
There are 19 prefectures
and 240 subprefectures.

247
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,640
Our government system
inherits the previous dynasty.

248
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,719
For each subprefecture,

249
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,559
there is a Subprefectural Magistrate
like the previous dynasty,

250
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,559
and there is also
a Prefectural Magistrate

251
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,000
to restrict
the Subprefectural Magistrate.

252
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,200
There are districts
under the prefectures,

253
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:47,599
but the districts are also under
the jurisdiction of the imperial court.

254
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,599
All the orders in the world
are made by the Emperor,

255
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,119
and all the things in the world
are managed by the court.

256
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:00,760
Mother.

257
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,479
Am I right?

258
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,640
Looks like I underestimated you before.

259
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,799
I never thought

260
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,280
you have been plotting this.

261
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:17,880
Mother.

262
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,440
As the Son of Heaven,

263
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,559
I will do as an emperor should.

264
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,280
Your Highness,
please hand over the jade seal.

265
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:34,840
Mother.

266
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,799
Please trust me.

267
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:40,039
I’ll manage Mu’an well.

268
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,159
If I remember correctly,

269
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,359
he should be
Commandant of Bingzhou’s son.

270
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,039
Why is he here?

271
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:08,479
Your Majesty.

272
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,359
The Archduke.

273
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,319
Did we make it?

274
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,359
Yes.

275
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,520
As long as the Empress Dowager
hands over the jade seal.

276
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,520
Who is that?

277
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,359
Fangling.

278
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,079
Well...

279
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,479
It must be Grandmother’s carriage.

280
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,079
Seems that Yi has grown up.

281
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,959
Mother.

282
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,400
Yi.

283
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,079
Why are you upset?

284
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:26,880
Come on.

285
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,359
Tell me what’s wrong.

286
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:30,920
Mother.

287
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,239
Father came to my class,

288
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,599
but I couldn’t answer the question
of the Grand Mentor.

289
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:42,479
I’m not as smart as other nobles.

290
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,839
I upset Father.

291
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,560
Yi.

292
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:52,359
Do you know that a dragon can change?

293
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,239
A dragon

294
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,760
can get bigger or smaller.
It can rise or hide itself.

295
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,520
A real dragon

296
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,040
must keep a low profile
for the future’s sake.

297
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:08,640
My Yi.

298
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:12,359
Do you want to be a real dragon?

299
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,250
Um.

300
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,040
I understand.

301
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,959
You are a good boy.

302
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,000
Keep a low profile

303
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,239
and accumulate your strength.

304
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,280
Yi.

305
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,800
You never forgot my teachings,

306
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,199
right?

307
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,839
My Yi.

308
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,400
You’ve grown up.

309
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,280
It’s just a jade seal.

310
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,560
Her Highness has been there for a while.

311
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,719
Could anything go wrong?

312
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,000
Lord Jian.

313
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,280
Your Highness.

314
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,640
This is how loyal you are to me?

315
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,280
Mother.

316
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,040
How can you say that to Granduncle?

317
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:48,560
I remember you said before

318
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,800
that we wouldn’t be where we are today

319
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,680
if it wasn’t for Granduncle.

320
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:54,959
Did you say that

321
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,319
to hurt Granduncle’s feelings?

322
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,479
Your Highness.

323
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:06,400
His Majesty has grown up.

324
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:09,599
He will marry Tongxin as the Empress.

325
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,359
It’s time to give the power back to him.

326
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,359
Mother.

327
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,239
If you are willing
to retreat to the harem,

328
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,560
I’ll still respect you

329
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:52,880
and treat you well

330
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:55,079
just as before.

331
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:58,319
Yi.

332
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,319
I only hope

333
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,040
you can be a wise emperor,

334
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,560
a good emperor.

335
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,350
Mother!

336
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:16,560
Your Highness!

337
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,640
Yi.

338
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,599
By now,

339
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,959
my days have gone.

340
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,450
There is nothing to worry about.

341
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,100
No.

342
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,199
I just hope you can be a good emperor.

343
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,680
I’ll give you what you want.

344
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,000
- The Empress Dowager!
- Mother!

345
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,160
- Your Highness.
- You...

346
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:31,900
You...

347
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,959
You...

348
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,160
What are you doing?

349
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,150
Yiru?

350
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:41,479
Your Majesty.

351
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,439
Someone wants to hurt our child.

352
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,040
Fortunately, the Grand Empress Dowager

353
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,680
saved our kid.

354
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:58,479
The Grand Empress Dowager?

355
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:01,040
Your Majesty.

356
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,280
Is she carrying

357
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,479
your child?

358
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:17,119
Yes. It’s mine.

359
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,680
It’s God’s will.

360
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,530
I guess this child
is fated not to die now.

361
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,599
I don’t care

362
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,880
what shows you put on today.

363
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,479
This is the royal family’s child.

364
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:44,800
I must protect him.

365
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:48,239
No one can hurt him.

366
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,599
If I have the kid...

367
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:56,280
Mother.

368
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,520
Since it’s Yi’s child

369
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,719
of royal blood,

370
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:02,325
I will protect him well.

371
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:03,850
Um.

372
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,920
Baoning.

373
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,560
It’s not like this.

374
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,079
Let me explain.

375
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:17,119
Your Majesty, you already have a child

376
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,959
and you’ve made Han Tongxin the Empress.

377
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,920
Is there still a place for me?

378
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,119
If Grandmother

379
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,560
didn’t bring Fang Ruyi
to the Longevity Hill,

380
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,119
I would still be kept in the dark.

381
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,800
Grandma, I’ll go back
to Qingshan House then.

382
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,375
Um.

383
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:33,160
Baoning.

384
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,199
Baoning.

385
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,880
Baoning! Don’t go!

386
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,319
Listen to me!

387
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,239
- Baoning!
- Your Majesty.

388
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:40,199
Your Majesty.

389
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:42,439
My belly hurts.

390
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,520
I’m afraid it’s the baby.

391
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,280
- Hurry.
- Min Zhou.

392
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,920
Get the physician.

393
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,079
Go to the Imperial Medical Bureau

394
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:48,040
and get a midwife.

395
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,760
Try harder.

396
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,400
It’s coming out soon.

397
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,350
- Coming.
- Get a basin of water here.

398
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:53,520
Harder.

399
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,000
Water. Water.

400
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,770
Here is the water.

401
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:56,050
Go get the scissors.

402
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,439
Half a head is out.

403
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:58,274
Try harder.

404
00:24:58,275 --> 00:24:58,800
Scissors.

405
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,425
There.

406
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:00,880
Try harder.

407
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,040
It’s born. It’s born.

408
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,475
Take it away.

409
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:09,775
Here.

410
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,520
Congratulations to Your Highness.

411
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,400
Is it a prince or a princess?

412
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,719
It’s a prince.

413
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:17,880
Min Zhou.

414
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:19,680
Congratulations to Your Highness.

415
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
It’s born! It’s born!

416
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Congratulations to Your Majesty.

417
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,560
Congratulations to Your Highness.

418
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,160
It’s a little prince.

419
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,359
Congratulations to Your Highness!

420
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:32,000
Congratulations to Your Majesty!

421
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,000
Good.

422
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,680
This is the first prince
of our royal family.

423
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,880
Although he is illegitimate,

424
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,160
I’m still very happy.

425
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,119
Hurry, bring the little prince here

426
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,599
and let me see.

427
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,101
- Okay.
- Yes.

428
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:47,600
Yes.

429
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,680
I’ll bring the little prince

430
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:49,880
to Grandma now.

431
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:52,119
No hurry, Your Majesty.

432
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:58,479
Your Majesty, no hurry.

433
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,920
The little prince was born prematurely.

434
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,719
He is weak now.

435
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,359
If we bring him out now,

436
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
what if

437
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,760
he catches a cold?

438
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,119
Greetings to Mother.

439
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,880
Greetings to Mother.

440
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,119
Take a seat.

441
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,359
Thank you, Mother.

442
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,359
Mother.

443
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:32,959
Mother.

444
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,319
Although I’ve returned
the power to the Emperor,

445
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,439
I wonder

446
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,119
if I’m still in charge of the harem.

447
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:43,439
Of course.

448
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,439
The harem

449
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,680
is still in your charge.

450
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,280
Thank you, Mother.

451
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,680
Your Majesty.

452
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,760
This child was born of a maid.

453
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:56,239
Without my consent,

454
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,800
it doesn’t conform with rites
to put him on the royal genealogy.

455
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,119
What does that mean, Mother?

456
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,959
I can put him on the royal genealogy,

457
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,959
but he has to stay with me
at the Longevity Hill.

458
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,640
Not going back to the Cining Palace?

459
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,439
If you want to raise the child,

460
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,119
why don’t you go back
to the Cining Palace?

461
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,640
Your Majesty, have you forgotten

462
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:31,439
that I just returned the power to you?

463
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,000
I won’t concern myself
with the political affairs anymore.

464
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,760
I’ll burn incense,

465
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:41,079
and worship Buddha alone.

466
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,760
I’ll live the rest of my life
in the Longevity Hill.

467
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:46,680
With the little prince by my side,

468
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,599
we can share family time together,

469
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,000
isn’t that great?

470
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,839
And also,

471
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,400
I want the Guards of Li from Bingzhou

472
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:58,479
to protect me.

473
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:03,599
In that case,

474
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,719
I’ll listen to Mother.

475
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,800
Min Zhou.

476
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,079
Yes.

477
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,520
Take the Grand Empress Dowager
and the Emperor

478
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,239
to see the little prince.

479
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:15,520
Please.

480
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,599
Li Qian.

481
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,280
From today,

482
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:40,319
you will be promoted to

483
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,400
the head of the Imperial Guards
of the Longevity Hill.

484
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,680
You will protect me.

485
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,599
Yes.

486
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,520
Thank you, Your Highness.

487
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,959
With the Li family stepping in,

488
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,760
the Jiang family was able
to get away with it.

489
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:18,575
Commandery Princess Jia’nan

490
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:20,599
made it anyway.

491
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,680
This princess
who grew up in the deep palace

492
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,119
is resourceful.

493
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,079
She is not inferior to a man.

494
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,560
I need you to leave now

495
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,239
and send the Guards of Li
who followed us to the capital

496
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,199
to the Longevity Hill.

497
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,640
Young Master,

498
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,959
but we came to the capital

499
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:36,959
with a small army,

500
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,119
just about one hundred men.

501
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,560
How can we guard the Longevity Hill?

502
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,439
After you send them here,

503
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,680
make them all
guard the Empress Dowager’s palace.

504
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:47,839
I’ll send a letter
to my father with pigeons

505
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:50,000
and ask him
to send more people from Bingzhou.

506
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:50,880
Yes.

507
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,160
Young Master is inside.

508
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,000
Okay.

509
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:01,560
Jin Xiao.

510
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:02,680
Li.

511
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,319
What’s going on with
Empress Dowager Cao and His Majesty?

512
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,839
A lot of people
who came to celebrate the birthday.

513
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,079
all left early in the morning.

514
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,800
They all left?

515
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,479
His Majesty left first.

516
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,239
He took the Archduke
and Lord Jian with him.

517
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
Then the Grand Empress Dowager
and Commandery Princess Jia’nan left.

518
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,920
Those imperial officials...

519
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,719
- I’ll guard the Longevity Hill.
- ...and Titled Madams also left.

520
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,640
I’m afraid I won’t see you again.

521
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,275
Hey. Hey.

522
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,599
What are you thinking about?

523
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,599
You are so absorbed.

524
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,079
Jin Xiao.

525
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,880
I have something to discuss with you.

526
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,599
Come over.

527
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,439
You found out about Fang Yiru.

528
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,400
Thanks to you,
I was able to keep the royal blood.

529
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,400
What did you say?

530
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,040
How...

531
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,959
How is it possible?

532
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,500
Song Xianyi showed me the love letter

533
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,560
His Majesty wrote to Fang Ruyi.

534
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,599
There is his private seal on it.

535
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,800
How could it be wrong?

536
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,680
Empress Dowager Cao’s
birthday banquet is coming.

537
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,040
Let’s not make a big deal.

538
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,880
After the birthday banquet,

539
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,479
I’ll do you justice.

540
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,680
Don’t be sad.

541
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:19,599
I will find you a better man

542
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,560
who will treat you well wholeheartedly.

543
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:25,800
I don’t want anyone else.

544
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,359
I just want Grandma.

545
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,119
Think about it.

546
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,439
Is there anyone you like

547
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,839
among the sons of the noble families?

548
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,319
Come on, eat while it’s still hot.

549
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,400
No.

550
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:52,719
Okay, no hurry.

551
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,880
Take your time.

552
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:08,959
Who would expect the capital
to change overnight?

553
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,359
Yes.

554
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,880
The Empress Dowager was having her time
at her birthday feast yesterday,

555
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,280
how would she go to the Longevity Hill

556
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,479
to enjoy the rest of her life now?

557
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,160
This is strange indeed.

558
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,199
His Majesty can’t wait
to summon the ministers today.

559
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,800
Seems that he’s going
to rule the country in person.

560
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,400
Your Majesty.

561
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,119
These are for the court meeting today.

562
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,119
Greetings to Your Majesty.

563
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,040
You are the Empress.

564
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,160
You are supposed to stay
in your Ciyuan Hall.

565
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,119
What are you doing here?

566
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:53,400
Today is your first day in court.

567
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,119
I’m here to congratulate Your Majesty
for ruling the country in person.

568
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:00,719
My Lady, please have tea.

569
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,800
What did you say?

570
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,400
Your Highness, please have tea.

571
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,280
Mercy, Your Highness.

572
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,959
It was a slip of the tongue.

573
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,040
A slip of the tongue?

574
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,640
I think you don’t see me

575
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,479
as the Empress in the Palace.

576
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,920
Baihe.

577
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,839
Slap her mouth hardly.

578
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:19,959
Don’t you dare!

579
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,160
Your Majesty.

580
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,239
This lowly maid has no respect for me!

581
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,439
Your Majesty.

582
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,719
As the head of the harem,

583
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,719
I’m obliged to discipline the maids.

584
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,680
Please don’t interfere.

585
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:40,839
Well.

586
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,160
You dare to beat people
in front of me now.

587
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,199
Look at you now!

588
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,520
You are not like an empress at all.

589
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,040
You are no match for
a finger of Baoning.

590
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,920
Jiang Baoning. Jiang Baoning!

591
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:59,000
She is all you care about!

592
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,160
Shut up!

593
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,239
- I...
- Your Majesty.

594
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,439
The ministers are waiting
in front of the hall.

595
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,680
You can’t go to the court
being angry today.

596
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,399
The Empress Dowager made you the Empress

597
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,120
in front of the ministers.

598
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,560
I can choose

599
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,919
not to repudiate you.

600
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,439
But,

601
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,879
just stay in your Ciyuan Hall.

602
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Don’t be an eyesore in front of me!

603
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,080
Your Majesty!

604
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,000
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

605
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,000
Those lords and royal highnesses learned

606
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,520
that Lord Jian’s granddaughter
became the Empress,

607
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,959
not Princess Jia’nan,

608
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,719
they all got interested in
Princess Jia’nan.

609
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:46,375
Um.

610
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,439
They presented the birthdates

611
00:34:48,475 --> 00:34:49,479
of their sons.

612
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,600
We should pick a good man

613
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,000
for Baoning.

614
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,239
Among these men,

615
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,199
(Birthdate of Marquis Jinghai’s son)
Marquis Jinghai’s son is good.

616
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,879
Marquis Jinghai, Zhao Kuan,

617
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,760
has a big household in Nanmin,

618
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:10,399
but he is a humble man.

619
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,879
After his wife died,

620
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,719
he didn’t marry again.

621
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,000
He doesn’t even have a concubine.

622
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:22,000
It can be seen how deeply
he is in love with his wife.

623
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:24,679
The son raised by such a person

624
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,399
will be a good man.

625
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,760
You are right.

626
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,600
When we went to the Longevity Hill,

627
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,040
he came with Princess Jia’nan
to pick you up.

628
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,760
If he is also interested in Baoning,

629
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,800
after Baoning marries into his family,

630
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:42,479
they won’t treat Baoning badly

631
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:46,080
with the temperament of his family.

632
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,600
The Lantern Festival is coming soon.

633
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,000
Just say

634
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,639
I want to hold a banquet

635
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,239
and invite some young people
to have fun.

636
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,719
Ask someone to send an invitation
to Zhao Xiao.

637
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,239
Yes.

638
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:10,425
(Three Abodes of the East)

639
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,000
Lord.

640
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,919
Right.

641
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,520
How could it be him?

642
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,840
He went to the Longevity Hill
to protect Empress Dowager Cao,

643
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,239
Zhao Yi won’t let him come back.

644
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,040
(East Warmth Chamber)
Greetings to Your Highness.

645
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,120
Take seats.

646
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,679
I’m old now.

647
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:52,239
I’m really happy to see

648
00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:55,679
young people like you.

649
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,719
Zhao Xiao.

650
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:11,560
Yes.

651
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,879
Marquis Jinghai

652
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,919
does have a good son.

653
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,399
Here.

654
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,679
A toast to you first.

655
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,919
Thank you, Your Highness.

656
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:49,600
Baoning.

657
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,675
Um.

658
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,919
You should also make a toast
to Young Master Zhao.

659
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,000
Your Grace, hold on.

660
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,919
Baoning can’t hold the drink.

661
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,959
I’ll drink it for Her Grace.

662
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,360
This is the Wenhua Ink
from the previous dynasty.

663
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,280
There is only one piece left
in the palace.

664
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,399
Baoning asked for it a few times.

665
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,280
I don’t want her to waste it.

666
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:52,000
I’ll give it to you today.

667
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

668
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,239
But I may have to

669
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,639
reject your kindness today.

670
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,280
I want to give this ink to someone else.

671
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:04,800
I don’t know if I can have
your permission.

672
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,919
I gave it to you. It is yours.

673
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,600
You don’t need my permission.

674
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:16,159
Since Princess Jia’nan likes it,

675
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,000
I’ll give the ink,
a reward from Your Highness,

676
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,560
to Princess Jia’nan.

677
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,679
She will waste it

678
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,520
if you give it to her.

679
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:34,879
I’m honored

680
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:37,879
to let Baoning waste whatever I have.

681
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:39,125
Um.

682
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,120
It has been a while

683
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,760
since what happened
on the Longevity Hill.

684
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:01,360
But I still have the commitment letter.

685
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,679
I don’t know if there will be a chance
to give it back to him.

686
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:06,360
Baoning.

687
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,399
The Lantern Festival
in the capital today

688
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,800
must be lively.

689
00:40:11,439 --> 00:40:12,199
Yeah.

690
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,679
Probably because

691
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,679
Zhao Yi married Han Tongxin
as the Empress,

692
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:17,919
so Grandma wants me
to go to the Lantern Festival

693
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,360
and take my mind off it.

694
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,760
You look prettier

695
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,040
in the light clothes of a lady.

696
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,320
Your Grace.

697
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:29,080
The carriage is ready for departure.

698
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,199
We met the Archduke’s son

699
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,439
on the way here.

700
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:32,959
He asked me to bring you the snacks

701
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:33,919
made by the Duchess.

702
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,879
Is Lyu here?

703
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,919
He is on the way to Qinzheng Hall.

704
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,560
Ask him to come here.

705
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,879
Yes, Your Grace.

706
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,760
Your Grace, the son of the Archduke
has arrived.

707
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:53,975
Oh.

708
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,159
I need to talk to Lyu alone.

709
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,275
Um.

710
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:10,479
Baoning.

711
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:13,000
Why do you want to see me?

712
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,159
Since we left the Longevity Hill,

713
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,080
I haven’t seen you
and Uncle for a while.

714
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,600
His Majesty
is ruling the country in person.

715
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,479
Is everything going well
with the Jiang family?

716
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,280
The Jiang family

717
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,840
made great contributions to it.

718
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:26,280
Even the Imperial Guards in the capital

719
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,479
are in charge of the Jiang family now.

720
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,199
How about Empress Dowager Cao...

721
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,800
How is it going with the Li family?

722
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,080
Empress Dowager Cao

723
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,399
settled down on the Longevity Hill.

724
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,919
But,

725
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:43,080
His Majesty allowed Li Qian
to return to the capital today

726
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,560
to bring the objects and slaves
in Li’s Mansion

727
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,879
to the Longevity Hill.

728
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:48,639
Is Li Qian in the capital now?

729
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,100
Um.

730
00:41:56,325 --> 00:42:01,475
(Li’s Mansion)

731
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,281
Brother Qian.

732
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:04,959
Um.

733
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:05,879
Why don’t I

734
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:08,080
go to the Longevity Hill with you?

735
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:10,919
The Longevity Hill is a forbidden place.

736
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,840
Do you think
you can come and go at will?

737
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:16,080
Let Wei Shu send you back to Bingzhou.

738
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:18,879
Okay then.

739
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:21,959
Be careful on your way
to the Longevity Hill.

740
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:22,650
Um.

741
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,280
If you can take care of yourself,

742
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,040
I’ll be relieved as your elder brother.

743
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,441
Just go.

744
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:34,159
Miss Gao.

745
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,375
(Li’s Mansion)

746
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,003
(Li’s Mansion)

747
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,120
Good. Good.

748
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:26,600
It’s high.

749
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,879
Baoning.

750
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,239
The folk Lantern Festival
is lively indeed.

751
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:35,000
What’s wrong?

752
00:43:35,439 --> 00:43:37,040
You used to try all kinds of ways
to sneak out of the palace.

753
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,800
- You are out now. Why are you sullen?
- It’s great.

754
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:41,925
- I guess I didn’t sleep well. I’m fine.
- Okay.

755
00:43:42,479 --> 00:43:43,719
Let’s go over there.

756
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,000
Slow down.

757
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,919
- Baoning!
- Slow down.

758
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:50,600
Run slowly. Be careful.

759
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:52,719
Baoning!

760
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,975
Colorful umbrellas.

761
00:43:57,975 --> 00:43:58,700
Okay.

762
00:43:58,959 --> 00:43:59,625
Su.

763
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:00,875
That’s beautiful.

764
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,439
Su.

765
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
That festival lantern is so pretty.

766
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,275
And there...

767
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,280
Su!

768
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:12,750
Excellent!

769
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,800
Let’s go over there.

770
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,120
Baoning.

771
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,250
Coming.

772
00:44:22,479 --> 00:44:23,360
My Lady?

773
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,479
My Lady, are you okay?

774
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,479
Lord Cao?

775
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,314
Buns.

776
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,159
Flowers.

777
00:44:43,479 --> 00:44:44,719
Flowers.

778
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,639
Fragrant flowers.

779
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:50,479
Big brother, buy a flower
for the girl you love.

780
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,575
Dear, over here.

781
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,350
Dear, over here.

782
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,439
Kiddo.

783
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:02,080
I’ll buy all your flowers.

784
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,159
It’s getting late.

785
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,360
Come on.

786
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:07,399
Go back home with your flowers now.

787
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,879
Big brother, your flowers.

788
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:14,520
I only need one.

789
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,199
You can give the rest to others.

790
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:18,000
Go back now.

791
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,760
Sugar-coated haws!

792
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,679
Hello, here are some flowers for you.

793
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,919
