00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,080
What did you say?

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,599
Draft an edict

29
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,125
to cancel the betrothal immediately!

30
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

31
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:13,119
Please be appeased, Your Majesty.

32
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,440
In my humble opinion,
marrying Her Grace into the Li Family

33
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,880
isn’t all too bad.

34
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,534
If Marquis Jinghai’s son
married her,

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,000
it’d only be a matter of time

36
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,279
before Nanmin became the strongest.

37
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,800
That still doesn’t explain

38
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
why Grandmother

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,639
is marrying Baoning to Li Qian.

40
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,039
Over the years, Grand Empress Dowager

41
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,279
adores Her Grace.

42
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,200
Given the current situation,

43
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:39,800
it’s the best she can do

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,520
for the sake of Her Grace’s reputation.

45
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,960
Your Majesty,

46
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,320
Her Highness is determined

47
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,600
that she bypassed you

48
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,040
and used the empty edict
left by the Founding Father.

49
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Canceling the betrothal now

50
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,279
would put Her Grace’s life at risk

51
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,000
and yourself in grave peril

52
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,399
for disobeying the Founding Father.

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,240
Censors would bury you with criticisms!

54
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,320
Please think twice, Your Majesty!

55
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,600
Please think twice, Your Majesty!

56
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:19,000
Why?

57
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,639
Are you pressuring me again?

58
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,785
I listened to you

59
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,800
when you said
to marry Baoning into Yongqing.

60
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,520
And what did
those ingrates do in return?

61
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,399
Did they show a hint of appreciation?

62
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,279
I won’t make that mistake again.

63
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,320
Baoning cannot marry Li Qian!

64
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,160
Even I

65
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,360
can’t change your mind?

66
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,160
Greetings, Grandmother.

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,481
You may leave.

69
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,039
Yes, Your Highness.

70
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,080
Grandmother.

71
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,199
What brings you here, Grandmother?

72
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:08,606
Yi,

73
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:12,839
are you trying

74
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,479
to kill me and Baoning?

75
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,440
Of course not, but why are you

76
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,640
marrying her to that underdog?

77
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,359
Without that “underdog”,

78
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,799
she could’ve still

79
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,200
been held hostage by Yongqing

80
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
or not even survived

81
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,279
to this day

82
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,000
when the engagement went south.

83
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,480
Listen to me,

84
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:46,816
the late emperor and I

85
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:51,399
have both approved

86
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,359
this marriage.

87
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,640
I’m living on borrowed time

88
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,519
and I want nothing more

89
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,040
than to see Baoning marry a good man.

90
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,640
Otherwise,

91
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:11,720
I’d rather die

92
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,480
to be with the late emperor sooner.

93
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,079
Please don’t say that, Grandmother.

94
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:21,040
I’m sorry.

95
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,519
Yi,

96
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,799
you wouldn’t let me down, would you?

97
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,069
I wouldn’t dare.

98
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,375
(Eternal Peace and Prosperity)

99
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,799
Auntie.

100
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,300
(Jiang’s Mansion)
There you are!

101
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:49,079
How’s Grandmother?

102
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,079
She’s fine.

103
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,600
Her Highness can’t be better.

104
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,480
Hadn’t Stewardess Meng
talked her out of it,

105
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,359
she’d disregard the rules

106
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,679
to come here

107
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,480
to marry you off in person.

108
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,279
I’m so sorry

109
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,559
for troubling you all.

110
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,079
Darling,

111
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,440
you did nothing wrong.

112
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,320
Mishap is a blessing in disguise.

113
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,440
Heaven is fair

114
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:14,239
that you’re blessed with
a wonderful man

115
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:17,385
after the previous misfortune.

116
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:21,799
And, Baoning,

117
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,600
(Jiang’s Mansion)
look, your dowries are outside.

118
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,760
All of them are mine?

119
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,559
Yes.

120
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,119
That’s way too many!

121
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,559
Not at all!

122
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,519
Her Highness and your uncle

123
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,839
thought you needed more.

124
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:37,279
You had a long journey to Bingzhou.

125
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,559
Why don’t you go inside with Baoning

126
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:40,600
to chat and rest, Auntie?

127
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,839
- Qingke and I
- Yes.

128
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,520
will make an inventory
of those dowries outside.

129
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,359
Thank you, Su.

130
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,959
Madam.

131
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,525
(He Cuihua)

132
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,359
Li Changqing!

133
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:11,279
Darling.

134
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,225
Yes?

135
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,119
You aren’t going to put me
and Dongdong behind, are you?

136
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,239
Of course not!

137
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,519
I’m talking to you.

138
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,279
Look me in the eye.

139
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,040
Can’t you see I’m busy?

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,675
Darling.

141
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:28,175
What?

142
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,600
He Cuihua.

143
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,340
Yes?

144
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,760
Don’t be so horny

145
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,880
this early!

146
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
You shoved me!

147
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,119
- I...
- You forgot what I did for you?

148
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,559
Back then, nobody liked you.

149
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,440
They despised you

150
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,320
for rising from a bandit.

151
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:49,799
Only I, He Cuihua, would marry you!

152
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:50,359
And now what?

153
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,760
You’ve become rich and powerful

154
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,399
and you’re throwing me
and my daughter away,

155
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,119
aren’t you?

156
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,399
How could you be so heartless?

157
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,959
Are you done?

158
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:59,239
I’m not!

159
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,559
Stand up!

160
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:01,850
Look at me!

161
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,475
What?

162
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,000
Li Lin told me

163
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,799
that you prepared 2,000 taels of gold

164
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,519
and 10,000 taels of silver

165
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,720
for Qian’s wedding.

166
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,839
The rest would follow

167
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,000
the routine
of the richest families in the south.

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,320
Is that true?

169
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,839
Answer me!

170
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,760
Yes!

171
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:24,640
Look,

172
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,519
my eldest son is getting married

173
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,720
with the most distinguished princess

174
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,279
in Mu’an.

175
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,200
Their wedding must be grand.

176
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:35,799
But you can’t squander
all that we have on it!

177
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,159
No one in Jinxi

178
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,359
has ever paid such a huge price

179
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,880
to have a daughter-in-law.

180
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,640
Besides,

181
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,159
with no money left in reserve,

182
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,440
what about the rest of us?

183
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,840
We can’t live on air!

184
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,239
My son is marrying a princess!

185
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,520
We’d look cheap

186
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,799
without a handsome amount
of betrothal gifts!

187
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,280
So for you to look better,

188
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,440
our entire family

189
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,760
should go hungry, right?

190
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,599
He Cuihua, did I ever not give you food

191
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:56,799
or clothes?

192
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,799
All that I’ve been doing

193
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,599
is for the best of our family!

194
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,799
Cuihua.

195
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,440
Darling.

196
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,440
Hear me out.

197
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,640
Our son

198
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,719
marrying a princess

199
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,080
is bringing glory to our whole clan.

200
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,520
Look at you.

201
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,640
You’re penny wise and pound foolish.

202
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,359
Focus on the long term, will you?

203
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,080
Don’t be so shortsighted.

204
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,280
Whatever!

205
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:27,159
If you use up all our savings,

206
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,239
her dowries are to make up the deficit!

207
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,119
You can’t be reasoned with.

208
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,460
Confucius is right.

209
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:41,280
Women and children are hard to please.

210
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:42,799
I...

211
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,239
Li Changqing, you...

212
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,479
Young Master Qian
is destined to get on in life

213
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,520
ever since I came to work here.

214
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,039
He’s marrying a princess

215
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,919
shortly after he started
working in the capital.

216
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,919
With this marriage,

217
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,359
the Li Family will top the others

218
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:06,119
in Bingzhou.

219
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,280
Agreed.

220
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,880
I used to think

221
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,679
he’d marry Miss Gao eventually,

222
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,919
but now,

223
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:14,599
she’s not even likely to be a concubine.

224
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:19,599
Focus on your job

225
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,050
instead of gossiping around.

226
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:23,786
The Li Family’s rules

227
00:10:23,786 --> 00:10:25,267
aren’t just words on paper.

228
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,230
- Yes.
- Yes.

229
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:39,660
Li Qian,

230
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,524
didn’t I tell you

231
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,559
not to come and harass Baoning

232
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,120
before the wedding ceremony?

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,520
Auntie came all the way to Bingzhou.

234
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,441
It’s common courtesy

235
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,190
to come and pay respects.

236
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,389
I hope you don’t mind, Cousin Lyu.

237
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:58,450
(Splendid and Magnificent)

238
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,811
Drop your act!

239
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,440
Baoning isn’t your wife yet.

240
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,620
Don’t “Auntie” or “Cousin” us.

241
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,881
We aren’t that close.

242
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,760
Cousin Lyu.

243
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,680
Enough, Lyu.

244
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,990
Let our guest in.

245
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,625
(Splendid and Magnificent)

246
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:22,679
Greetings, Madam.

247
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,799
Skip the formalities.

248
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,119
Madam,

249
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,359
these local specialties

250
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,640
are a little something for you.

251
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,400
I hope you don’t mind.

252
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:53,919
Some cheap stuff

253
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,400
for Baoning to be your wife?

254
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,840
Nice try!

255
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,799
Lyu, where are your manners?

256
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,200
My father is preparing betrothal gifts,

257
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,719
and they’ll arrive shortly.

258
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,320
I left for Bingzhou in a rush

259
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,559
and could only give these to you.

260
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,640
I hope you don’t mind.

261
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,359
I’ll make it up to you

262
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:11,719
next time.

263
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,039
That’s too kind of you, Madam.

264
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,760
Soldiers are put behind
scholars by this administration.

265
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,640
With my military background,

266
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,239
Princess is marrying down to me.

267
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,840
I can only study hard

268
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
to prove that
Grand Empress Dowager’s appreciation

269
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,640
is worth it.

270
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:25,280
Thank you for thinking ahead, Auntie.

271
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,719
Li Qian,

272
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,039
I didn’t know

273
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,280
you were so good at flattery.

274
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:30,856
Lyu!

275
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,000
Please forgive him.

276
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,880
He’s upset

277
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,741
that you’re taking away his cousin.

278
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,760
Don’t blame him.

279
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:41,799
Auntie,

280
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,200
I’d never do that.

281
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,625
I’m just glad

282
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,080
that so many of you care about Baoning.

283
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,719
Cousin Lyu,

284
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,640
I hope you’ll accept me

285
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,919
and watch me closely.

286
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,359
If I fail

287
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,559
as Baoning’s husband,

288
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,550
punish me as hard as you can.

289
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,559
Boot-licker!

290
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:59,034
Stop playing the husband card!

291
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,119
Show-off!

292
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,640
Li Qian,

293
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,280
come out.

294
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,599
I know why you came
to fawn on my mother.

295
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:26,000
Your intention can’t be more obvious.

296
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,919
My father is too occupied

297
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,440
to be here for Baoning’s wedding,

298
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:32,806
but she still has me.

299
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:34,346
I’m here on behalf of my father.

300
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:35,799
You cannot cross the line

301
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,320
under my watch.

302
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:39,000
Did you ask me to come out

303
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,039
only to lecture me?

304
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,559
Baoning is always the apple of our eye,

305
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,840
but you stole her away from us.

306
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,080
You’re still here in one piece

307
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,815
because she likes you.

308
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,960
You didn’t fight back at the temple.

309
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:56,325
Now,

310
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:58,475
let’s battle it out!

311
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,589
I’ve long heard about your reputation,
Commander Li,

312
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,280
that you’re skilled
at all kinds of weapons.

313
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,960
Beat me first

314
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,549
if you want to marry Baoning.

315
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:18,306
I’ll do my best then.

316
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,775
(Eternal Peace and Prosperity)

317
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:39,725
(Blessed with Good Fortune)
How about

318
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,600
we have a bet?

319
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,440
If you lose,

320
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,119
you must promise me one thing.

321
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,559
No problem.

322
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,960
Make it ten

323
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,280
if you win!

324
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,479
You lost.

325
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,111
You didn’t play by the book.

326
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,185
Don’t you tend to win
with your strength?

327
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,039
Why the dirty tricks this time?

328
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:47,504
You had seen through my usual moves,

329
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:49,735
so I got to try something different

330
00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:51,256
to win quickly.

331
00:15:53,475 --> 00:15:54,756
Li Qian,

332
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,039
you’re the craftiest person
I’ve ever seen.

333
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,840
Yet Baoning says
you’re honest and reliable.

334
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:04,006
You’re good!

335
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,860
Thank you.

336
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,679
Don’t move. Sit still.

337
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,039
Are you done?

338
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,239
Not yet.

339
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,400
Be patient.

340
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,760
Your eyebrows are similar to Baoning’s.

341
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,840
I’d like to do hers after we’re married,

342
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:24,799
so I’m practicing on yours first.

343
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,760
You what?

344
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,499
A promise is a promise.

345
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,239
Sit tight and let me check.

346
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:34,525
Yes.

347
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:36,080
All done.

348
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,619
Why did he dash off?

349
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:44,080
Let me see in the mirror.

350
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,760
Li Qian!

351
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,479
Come back!

352
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,359
You could make a good thief

353
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,119
if you weren’t a commander.

354
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:13,479
Baoning,

355
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,959
you’re going to be my wife

356
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:16,265
in three days.

357
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,060
I have something for you.

358
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,280
The Book of Supreme Weapons

359
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,040
should’ve been yours in the first place.

360
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,160
But back then, I...

361
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:35,524
The best thing I’ve ever done

362
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:39,199
is to slap you that day.

363
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,119
I guess I’m doomed

364
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,199
to be your doormat.

365
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,760
It’s not too late to regret.

366
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,891
The best decision I’ve ever made

367
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:53,280
is to snatch you away.

368
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,015
Greetings, Madam.

369
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,400
Bao...

370
00:18:08,275 --> 00:18:11,375
Baoning, your big day is coming.

371
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,839
The last thing

372
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:15,119
Grand Empress Dowager wants

373
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:18,599
is to skip your wedding ceremony
but she can’t come.

374
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,119
She asked me

375
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,560
to convey her message
to you before I left.

376
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:24,125
I see.

377
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,599
Our generation is being cautious

378
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,880
and making so many sacrifices

379
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,319
not for ourselves

380
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,520
but for children like you

381
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,439
so that you can live the way you want.

382
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,880
We all

383
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,520
want you to be happy.

384
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:43,425
I know.

385
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:44,560
I understand that.

386
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,166
Li Qian, you can come in.

387
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:54,520
Auntie.

388
00:18:56,175 --> 00:18:58,936
You two, come with me.

389
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:05,839
Let’s go.

390
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:08,405
Baoning,

391
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:12,755
your uncle knows that you’re filial

392
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,160
and he said specifically
to bring you here.

393
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,396
I trust that your parents

394
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:25,376
would hope to see your husband.

395
00:19:29,975 --> 00:19:32,174
Father, Mother,

396
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:34,705
I consider myself most fortunate

397
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,621
to be able to marry Baoning.

398
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,650
I swear for the rest of my life,

399
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,940
I’ll love her, protect her
and respect her.

400
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,311
We’ll build a family,

401
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,929
have children,

402
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:50,425
fulfill filial duties
and grow old together.

403
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,060
I’ll give her a home.

404
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:31,959
Your Grace.

405
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,079
Madam Hu is here
to put the hairpin on you.

406
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,160
That’s too polite of you, ma’am.

407
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,760
I’m honored to do this job.

408
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,159
Your Grace.

409
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:50,705
You’re gorgeous, Your Grace!

410
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,880
You’re raised well in the palace.

411
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,040
Commander Li is a lucky man.

412
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,400
I’ll leave the rest to you, Madam Hu.

413
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,079
Congratulations, Your Grace!

414
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,825
Come on! Let’s go!

415
00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:33,200
How festive!

416
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,199
What a big crowd!

417
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,314
Commander Li has arrived.

418
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,525
There’s music and everything!

419
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,300
Yes!

420
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:57,079
Congratulations!

421
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,319
Congratulations, Commander Li!

422
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,920
Congratulations!

423
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,839
Commandery Prince has arrived!

424
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,025
This is nice.

425
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,119
From now on,

426
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,225
you’ll be a member of the Li Family.

427
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Even though you’re a princess,

428
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,319
you should respect your husband

429
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,134
and his parents.

430
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,450
I will.

431
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,039
But, listen,

432
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,221
if they hurt you in any way,

433
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,845
you must let us know.

434
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,040
We’re always on your side
to protect you.

435
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,690
Auntie, Su,

436
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,491
I hate to leave you.

437
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,560
It’s your big day.

438
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,400
Don’t be upset.

439
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:04,885
Baoning,

440
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,520
I wish you endless happiness,

441
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:09,305
good fortune

442
00:23:10,075 --> 00:23:11,756
and a happy life with Li Qian!

443
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,250
Thanks.

444
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:18,154
Baoning,

445
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,314
I’ll be escorting you today.

446
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,400
(Jiang’s Mansion)

447
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,000
The bride is out! She’s out!

448
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,800
Congratulations!

449
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,596
Congratulations!

450
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:38,225
Congratulations!

451
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:39,125
- Congratulations!

452
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:50,400
(Jiang’s Mansion)
Congratulations!

453
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:50,975
How nice!

454
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:52,685
Now,

455
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:55,284
I’m officially entrusting
Baoning to you.

456
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:58,666
As her cousin, all I want

457
00:23:59,675 --> 00:24:01,195
is for you to love her

458
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:02,725
and cherish her.

459
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,096
You have my word, Cousin Lyu.

460
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:05,969
From now on,

461
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:07,595
she’s my life.

462
00:24:07,595 --> 00:24:09,175
What a perfect couple!

463
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,252
They’re made for each other!

464
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,359
Rise!

465
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:26,119
Rise!

466
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:27,040
Let’s go!

Congratulations!

473
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,000
Best wishes!

474
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,175
Grow old together!

475
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,520
Have tons of children!

476
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,621
Happily ever after!

477
00:24:40,621 --> 00:24:43,500
(Jiang’s Mansion)

478
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,699
Congratulations!

479
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,440
Congratulations!

480
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,200
- Thanks for your gift, Mr. Yu.
- Congratulations!

481
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,725
Thanks.

482
00:24:48,725 --> 00:24:49,325
Congratulations!

483
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Thank you. Thank you very much.

484
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,640
Please. Have a seat inside.

485
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,500
(Li’s Mansion)
Congratulations! Congratulations!

486
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,075
(Li’s Mansion)
Congratulations!

487
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,275
(Li’s Mansion)
Thank you! Thanks a lot!

488
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,560
Miss, it’s time to get changed

489
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,040
to welcome the bride.

490
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:08,995
I’ll put that one on.

491
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,640
Miss, it’s too plain

492
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,800
for the occasion.

493
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,640
The new gown

494
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,719
Madam He prepared for you is better.

495
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,280
I’d rather not
attend their wedding at all.

496
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:24,400
Anyway,

497
00:25:25,199 --> 00:25:26,640
no one cares if I’m there.

498
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:27,839
Miss,

499
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,839
they’re getting married

500
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,319
whether you like it or not.

501
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,479
You have to accept your fate.

502
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,000
Let go of your obsession,

503
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,520
or you’ll only get hurt.

504
00:25:37,575 --> 00:25:38,974
Qian always says,

505
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,675
“I’m the master of my own fate”.

506
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:46,199
Don’t step back
when you’re supposed to push forward.

507
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:48,239
How do you know you’ll lose

508
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:49,636
without putting up a good fight?

509
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,441
He fought hard

510
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:00,000
and won himself a princess.

511
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,250
Miss...

512
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:07,636
I won’t stop fighting for what I want!

513
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,650
(Clear Sky and Gentle Breeze)
Congratulations!

514
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,160
Thanks!

515
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,079

(Li’s Mansion)
- Commandant Li! - Thank you!

519
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,319
(Li’s Mansion)
Congratulations! Congratulations!

520
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,199
This way, please.

521
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,280
Good to see you, too.

522
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,400
Please.

523
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,119
Congratulations!

524
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,119
Congratulations!

525
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:26,869
Madam Zhang.

526
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,550
Hey,

527
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,800
that old geezer Hu Yiliang is here.

528
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,719
He’s yours.

529
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,599
I don’t want to see him.

530
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,280
Yes.

531
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:33,839
Commandment Li! Wait! Hold on!

532
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,000
- Commandment Li.
- Mr. Hu.

533
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,400
Congratulations to you!

534
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,439
Thanks a lot.

535
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,880
We haven’t met again for years

536
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,040
since your transfer to Yangqu.

537
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,479
I know.

538
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,719
That’s why I asked His Majesty

539
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:51,280
to call me back.

540
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:53,439
After all,

541
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:55,479
I miss my old friend.

542
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:57,079
Of course. Likewise.

543
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,599
Commandment Li,

544
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:01,719
your son is so lucky

545
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,719
that he’s marrying a princess.

546
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:09,640
I bet your ancestors

547
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:11,800
would never see that coming.

548
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,119
Don’t forget to
go to their tombs to thank them.

549
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,420
I beg to differ.

550
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:22,959
My son is honored

551
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:24,160
that he’s the chosen one.

552
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,199
If there’s anyone to thank,

553
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,479
we should thank heaven and earth

554
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,959
and thank His Majesty!

555
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,479
Yes. Absolutely!

556
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,225
Mr. Jin is here.

557
00:27:33,225 --> 00:27:33,950
Commandment Li.

558
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,000
Fuyu, show Mr. Hu in.

559
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:36,626
Commandment Li.

560
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,050
Mr. Jin.

561
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:38,894
This way, please, sir.

562
00:27:38,894 --> 00:27:39,981
Long time no see, Mr. Jin.

563
00:27:39,981 --> 00:27:40,600
Uncle Li.

564
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,625
This way, please.

565
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:42,835
Commandment Li,

566
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:45,599
congratulations!

567
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:48,119
Best wishes to the bride and the groom!

568
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,700
Many thanks!

569
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,069
And this is...?

570
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:52,750
Congratulations!

571
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:55,680
He’s my son with my late wife.

572
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,599
He and your son are close friends,

573
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,079
so I brought him along for the wedding.

574
00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:05,000
Uncle Li, I’m Jin Xiao,

575
00:28:05,025 --> 00:28:06,250
Li Qian’s best friend.

576
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,160
Grand Empress Dowager
transferred him back to Jinxi,

577
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,439
and I asked her

578
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,640
to send me back, too.

579
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,350
I have a lot

580
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,680
to learn from you and him.

581
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,479
Good boy.

582
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:16,823
This way, please.

583
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:17,475
- Please.
- Please.

584
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,025
Please.

585
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,149
Excuse me, sir,

586
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,650
may I see your invitation?

587
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:28,825
Invitation?

588
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:29,450
Yes.

589
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,479
I don’t have one.

590
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:32,679
I’m Officer Accountant.

591
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,239
Commandment Li knows me.

592
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,280
He’s invited guests all over the state

593
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,359
to his eldest son’s wedding today.

594
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,920
I’m also here with gifts
to congratulate him.

595
00:28:41,575 --> 00:28:44,734
Invitation only.

596
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:48,354
Young Master is marrying a princess.

597
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,520
Who are you

598
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:51,599
to attend their wedding?

599
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:52,719
Leave now.

600
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:53,614
Go away.

601
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:56,119
I will

602
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,439
after giving my gifts to Commandment Li.

603
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:03,871
You...

604
00:29:06,225 --> 00:29:06,985
Stop!

605
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:11,100
(Li Lin)

606
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,180
(Li Lin)
What’s going on?

607
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:14,400
Madam He said

608
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,640
invitation only,

609
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,120
but this man

610
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,440
doesn’t have it.

611
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,211
I’m Officer Accountant, Cai Shuang.

612
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:25,040
I’m in Commandment Li’s debt

613
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,880
for his kindness.

614
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,599
Learning that his eldest son
is getting married,

615
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,560
I prepared a little something

616
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,479
as wedding gifts.

617
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,281
That’s it?

618
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,880
Today is Li Qian

619
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,640
and Her Grace’s big day.

620
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,340
Many are eager to attend the ceremony

621
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:41,025
to borrow good fortune from them.

622
00:29:41,025 --> 00:29:41,685
Yes, that’s right.

623
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:42,871
You may go in.

624
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:45,184
I’ll vouch for him.

625
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,321
Thanks. I really appreciate it.

626
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:52,959
Go back to work.

627
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:53,760
Yes.

628
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:55,975
They’re here!

629
00:29:55,975 --> 00:29:56,897

Look, that’s them!

631
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,800

It’s a traditional custom in Jinxi

643
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,560
that the bride’s shoes

711

712
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,621
That’s very nice of you to say that.

713
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,291
Madam Liu,

714
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:28,154
is your gold hairpin

715
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:31,400
from Dong’s Jewelry Shop?

716
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,040
It is.

717
00:33:34,775 --> 00:33:40,214
Madam He is getting better with words.

718
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,199
Those high-sounding words

719
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,280
can’t cover her low birth.

720
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:49,044
Others may not take her seriously.

721
00:33:57,075 --> 00:33:59,994
It’s a pleasure to see you,
Madam Zhuang, Miss Zhuang.

722
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,550
The pleasure is mine.

723
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,839
The Li Family’s eldest heir

724
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,079
and Commandery Princess Jia’nan
are tying the knot.

725
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,199
With all the titled figures in town

726
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,399
to send their congratulations,

727
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:13,239
how could we not?

728
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,851
Where’s Miss Li?

729
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,000
Couldn’t she even make time

730
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,560
for her eldest brother’s wedding?

731
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,300
What am I thinking?

732
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,520
Unlike other girls,

733
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:29,465
she grew up in the army,

734
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,024
wielding all kinds of weapons.

735
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,981
She seldom hangs out with girls

736
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:36,199
but fools around with men all day.

737
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,719
No other well-bred young ladies

738
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:40,560
are like her.

739
00:34:41,425 --> 00:34:42,760
And, Madam He,

740
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,080
don’t say I didn’t tell you this.

741
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,240
She’s old enough

742
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,334
and she can’t always have her way

743
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,420
for the sake of her marriage.

744
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,359
My daughter Furong

745
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:55,115
is about her age.

746
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,399
I’ve said no to tons of matchmakers

747
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:00,120
when they come to propose.

748
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:02,959
Well,

749
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:05,080
you have a point, Madam Zhuang.

750
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,679
It’s just that

751
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,159
my husband insists

752
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,760
on marrying our daughter up.

753
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:12,760
Problem is, our family

754
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,479
isn’t as rich and powerful
as Water Transport Commissioner’s.

755
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,679
Madam Zhuang

756
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:20,360
may have enough money
to throw into the water

757
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,360
to catch big fish, but I don’t.

758
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,800
My concern is

759
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:25,679
for those who do take the bait,

760
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,800
are they doing so for your daughter

761
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,120
or for your money?

762
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,280
Better keep your eyes open,
Madam Zhuang.

763
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,600
I apologize for being a bad host,

764
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,840
but with so many things going on,

765
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,925
my schedule is tight.

766
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,600
We must finish the banquet early

767
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,120
so that I can get some rest

768
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,959
before my noble daughter-in-law

769
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,000
showing up eagerly

770
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,760
to bow to me tomorrow morning.

771
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,360
Enough about that. It’s a lot!

772
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,239
- Ladies,
- Of course.

773
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,439
- dig in, please.
- Please.

774
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,959
We hired a new chef to cook for you.

775
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:56,550
- Please.
- It’s good.

776
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,200
- Very nice.
- Have a taste.

777
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:57,800
- Dig in.
- Sure.

778
00:35:58,719 --> 00:35:59,959
(Night Falls and Wind Blows)
Baoning!

779
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:02,280
Where are you going?

780
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,479
I’ll go

781
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:05,439
wherever you go.

782
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:07,039
We’ll never part.

783
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,360
Drunkards can’t control themselves.

784
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,271
That jerk can’t be thinking about...

785
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,120
Baoning!

786
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,679
Baoning!

787
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:24,520
Baoning!

788
00:36:25,025 --> 00:36:26,705
We need to talk, Li Qian!

789
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,399
Naughty girl.

790
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,525
I have something to tell you.

791
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,239
Look at you.

792
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,439
You’re making me...

793
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,199
Hey, stop...

794
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,040
I can’t say anything like this.

795
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,879
I didn’t cover your mouth.

796
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:41,325
You can say whatever you want.

797
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,445
As you know,

798
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,120
my... my condition is...

799
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:51,479
What about it?

800
00:36:52,925 --> 00:36:55,044
It’s our wedding night.

801
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,020
Grandmother told Auntie

802
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,110
that I’m not

803
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,000
healthy enough to be intimate with you.

804
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,199
Hold yourself back, please.

805
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,706
All that was an act!
You aren’t drunk, are you?

806
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,439
What’s the matter with you?

807
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,159
I knew about your condition

808
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:29,959
without Her Highness’s reminder.

809
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:31,239
Back at Mount Wutai,

810
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,520
Abbot Hongyi told me

811
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,230
you’re still weak
because of the residual poison.

812
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,719
We’re going to grow old together.

813
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,439
I’d never want you any less healthy.

814
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:42,159
Then why are you still here?

815
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,959
This is our bed.

816
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:46,318
You can’t kick me out.

817
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,120
Besides, you moved to Bingzhou alone

818
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,189
to marry me.

819
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,479
Won’t you feel lonely

820
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,239
with no one to talk to?

821
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,181
And us being in the same bed

822
00:37:57,725 --> 00:37:59,005
doesn’t mean we have to do that.

823
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,250
We can just talk like this, right?

824
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:05,120
Can we?

825
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,959
Of course!

826
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,981
Look,

827
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,630
this place will forever be ours

828
00:38:11,525 --> 00:38:14,086
where we get married and have children.

829
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,220
It’s our home.

830
00:38:19,825 --> 00:38:21,585
Our home?

831
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:22,625
Yes.

832
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:24,565
A home for us

833
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,770
and our children to come.

834
00:38:32,075 --> 00:38:33,075
It’s been a long day.

835
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,440
Let me undress you and tuck you in.

836
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:39,900
Hey!

837
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,679
Stop! No tickling!

838
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,225
- Jiang Baoning!
- You tricked me!

839
00:38:43,225 --> 00:38:43,719
Stop it!

840
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,479
I’m punishing you!

841
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,000
I’m sorry! My bad! My fault!

842
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,550
No!

843
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,766
- Hands off!
- Stop, please!

844
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,399
Prince, Princess is weak!

845
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:54,120
Don’t stay up too late!

846
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,040
She’s blaming you!

847
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,159
Fine!

848
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,280
I’ll blow out the candles.

849
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,825
Sure.

850
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,919
The candles went out.

851
00:39:14,225 --> 00:39:15,679
They’re fine. They’re going to bed.

852
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:17,560
Let’s go. Stop worrying.

853
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,719
Come on.

854
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:23,900
(Li’s Mansion)

855
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,290
Allow me.

856
00:40:15,275 --> 00:40:16,715
Aren’t you going to do my eyebrows?

857
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,960
What are you waiting for?

858
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,769
I thought you and Cousin Lyu
had similar eyebrows,

859
00:40:23,225 --> 00:40:24,146
and we had a bet.

860
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:25,514
If he lost,

861
00:40:25,775 --> 00:40:26,936
I’d do his eyebrows
to practice my skills

862
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,981
before doing yours.

863
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:32,925
But what I’m seeing is

864
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:35,165
that your natural eyebrows are perfect.

865
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,970
It’s totally unnecessary

866
00:40:37,075 --> 00:40:38,256
to color them.

867
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,421
Forget it.

868
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:44,565
I’m robbed of this kind of pleasure.

869
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:50,280
I didn’t know you could be so sweet.

870
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,350
You haven’t seen the sweeter side of me.

871
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,760
I’d only

872
00:40:57,399 --> 00:40:58,600
sweet-talk you and you alone.

873
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:26,840
This hairpin...

874
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,040
It belonged to

875
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,309
my late mother.

876
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:38,654
We used to live
near the border in Jinxi.

877
00:41:39,775 --> 00:41:41,936
My parents and I

878
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,845
and the Li Clansmen were all together.

879
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,740
Those were some good old days.

880
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,740
My mother was known for her beauty

881
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,141
and my father went to great lengths

882
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,310
to be able to marry her.

883
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,830
Then they had me,

884
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:58,439
a naughty trouble-maker.

885
00:41:58,675 --> 00:42:00,474
Every time my father
was about to punish me,

886
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:03,000
my mother would shield me.

887
00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:06,644
He couldn’t do anything

888
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,376
other than fly into a howling rage.

889
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,191
And?

890
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:13,665
And...

891
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,680
Yongqing invaded.

892
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,930
Someone set our whole village on fire

893
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,245
and wiped out

894
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:28,794
almost our entire clan.

895
00:42:30,225 --> 00:42:32,426
We’re the only ones who survived.

896
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,831
All these years,

897
00:42:37,775 --> 00:42:38,936
I only have two wishes.

898
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,890
One is to beat back Yongqing

899
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:43,515
to safeguard our state,

900
00:42:44,925 --> 00:42:45,764
and the other

901
00:42:46,425 --> 00:42:47,745
is to track down those

902
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:49,750
who killed my mother and clansmen

903
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,540
and make them pay with blood.

904
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,939
Qing Tai got lucky this time.

905
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,359
If they offend us again,

906
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,760
I’ll find them and kill them!

907
00:43:31,825 --> 00:43:33,305
Father, Mother.

908
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,150
Your Grace.

909
00:43:35,575 --> 00:43:36,855
I, Li Changqing, pay...

910
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:38,399
Well,

911
00:43:38,675 --> 00:43:40,355
since I’m already Li Qian’s wife,

912
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,529
I’ll respect the family etiquette.

913
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:43,600
That’s more like it.

914
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:44,986
Good. Very well.

915
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:46,075
Be seated.

916
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,079
Your Grace,

917
00:43:55,725 --> 00:43:57,765
this is Qian’s birth mother’s tablet.

918
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,770
(Wife Zhang Xiuhe’s Tablet)
We lost her a long time ago.

919
00:44:00,825 --> 00:44:02,800
She hoped to see Qian

920
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:04,320
grow up,

921
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,639
get married and make his career.

922
00:44:06,439 --> 00:44:08,800
You can bow to her

923
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:10,915
and call her mother.

924
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:13,925
Yes.

925
00:44:23,775 --> 00:44:24,775
- Mother.
- Mother.

926
00:44:28,025 --> 00:44:29,025
Good. Please rise.

927
00:44:29,879 --> 00:44:30,600
Come.

928
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:33,650
Give it to me.

929
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,300
Father.

930
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:39,800
Huh?

931
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,180
Ah, yes. Have a seat.

932
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:46,165
- Please sit back, Father.
- Yes, sure.

933
00:44:47,025 --> 00:44:48,144
Thank you, Your Grace.

934
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:56,505
Qian gave her his late mother’s hairpin!

935
00:45:06,225 --> 00:45:07,040
Your Grace.

936
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:08,639
Please be seated, Father.

937
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:09,679
Sure. Sure.

938
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:10,970
Thank you, Father.

939
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:14,600
Sure!

940
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:17,000
This way.

941
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,431
Mother.

942
00:45:20,825 --> 00:45:21,525
Yes.

943
00:45:35,175 --> 00:45:35,800
It’s yours.

944
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:38,280
Thank you, Mother.

945
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:42,406
Let me introduce the others to you.

946
00:45:42,475 --> 00:45:43,000
Alright.

947
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:48,335
He’s my cousin, Li Lin.

948
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,340
He’s in charge of the entire household.

949
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:52,490
Greetings.

950
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:53,150
Cousin Lin.

951
00:45:55,925 --> 00:45:57,500
You’ve met Miaorong before.

952
00:45:58,075 --> 00:46:00,515
She’s the niece
of our advisor, Gao Fuyu,

953
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,879
who grew up with me and my cousin.

954
00:46:03,575 --> 00:46:04,335
Miaorong,

955
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,660
you and Baoning
already met in the capital.

956
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:08,159
You’re one of us,

957
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,320
so you can follow Dongzhi

958
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,800
and treat Baoning as your sister-in-law.

959
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,500
Your Grace.

960
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:14,229
Miss Gao.

961
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,560
Speaking of Dongzhi,

962
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,679
she’s my younger sister,

963
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,919
also known as Dongdong.

964
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,919
She grew up in the army

965
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,520
and she’s caught up with work there,

966
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,679
so she didn’t come back.

967
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:25,439
You’ll see her in a few days.

968
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:27,760
She’s a warrior.

969
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,879
I admire her a lot.

970
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:32,199
That’s because you don’t know her.

971
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:33,879
She’s wielding swords,

972
00:46:33,879 --> 00:46:35,120
spears, sticks and stuff every day.

973
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,439
What kind of girl would do that?

974
00:46:38,725 --> 00:46:40,965
That girl is really a headache!

975
00:46:41,775 --> 00:46:42,495
By the way,

976
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,320
Your Grace,

977
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,639
you’re married into a good family.

978
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:48,840
Talk to Dongdong from your experience.

979
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:49,959
All women

980
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:52,399
will have to get married
and have children.

981
00:46:52,399 --> 00:46:54,320
Their happiness depends on
the family they go to.

982
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,399
I will.

983
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,199
Starting today,
Princess, as Qian’s wife,

984
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,719
will be the matriarch of our family.

985
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:09,360
Cuihua,

986
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,800
you’re about the age to retire.

987
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,919
Once they have children,

988
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:16,080
you can watch them grow up

989
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,679
and enjoy their company.

990
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,439
Also,

991
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,760
our daughter and her marriage

992
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,360
require your full attention.

993
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,159
It’s a good time to hand over

994
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,320
your power to our daughter-in-law.

995
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:28,080
Darling,

996
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,560
I’ve been sparing no effort

997
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,199
taking care of this family for so long.

998
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,120
Isn’t it too soon

999
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,239
to release from my post

1000
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,199
right after Princess came?

1001
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,360
Cuihua,

1002
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:42,959
she’s already

1003
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:44,679
Qian’s lawfully-wedded wife,

1004
00:47:44,919 --> 00:47:48,560
hence the responsibility
for household duties.

1005
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:51,320
There’s no harm for her

1006
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,601
to get hands on them early.

1007
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,919
Uncle Li,

1008
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,360
she’s new to this family.

1009
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:59,120
It takes time to know her way around.

1010
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,199
Those duties

1011
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:06,560
would be too big a burden for her now.

1012
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:07,804
I suggest

1013
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,800
we take things slow.

1014
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,439
That way,

1015
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:13,199
our servants

1016
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,600
will also have time
to get used to the shift, right?

1017
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,840
Uncle, spring plowing
is also in full swing.

1018
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:22,959
The takeover can wait

1019
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,360
until the busy season is over.

1020
00:48:25,959 --> 00:48:26,800
Exactly.

1021
00:48:27,025 --> 00:48:28,919
I agree with Miaorong and Lin.

1022
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:32,120
Father, as a new member,

1023
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:33,879
I have a lot to learn from scratch.

1024
00:48:33,879 --> 00:48:34,639
Other things can wait.

1025
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,679
That’s right, Uncle Li.

1026
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,439
Let me show her

1027
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:40,359
around the mansion.

1028
00:48:41,075 --> 00:48:43,035
Good idea. Go ahead.

1029
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,120
Your Grace,

1030
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,790
we’ll do it your way then.

1031
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:54,326
Madam.

1032
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:55,650
Yes.

1033
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,719
Are these all her dowries?

1034
00:49:08,439 --> 00:49:09,199
Madam,

1035
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,080
here’s the inventory.

1036
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,000
Please take a look.

1037
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:14,840
I’ve checked it.

1038
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,360
There are
over 20 pages of items!

1039
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,439
Wonderful!

1040
00:49:18,439 --> 00:49:20,399
Antiques, calligraphy
and paintings excluded.

1041
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,719
Princess’s furniture
and valuable accessories alone

1042
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:27,199
are worth 4,000 taels of gold

1043
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,719
and 50,000 taels of silver.

1044
00:49:28,879 --> 00:49:30,360
Those who sent her here said

1045
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,320
Grand Empress Dowager

1046
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,000
gave her tons of jewelry
from her own vault.

1047
00:49:34,399 --> 00:49:36,959
The Archduke’s Mansion
and Lord Cao’s Mansion

1048
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:38,719
pitched in and paid a lot for her, too.

1049
00:49:39,225 --> 00:49:40,725
The Jiang Family is incredibly wealthy.

1050
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,879
Why did they still ask for

1051
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:43,000
so many betrothal gifts from us?

1052
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:43,959
Madam,

1053
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,270
Princess is of noble birth.

1054
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,020
Her title and rank must be honored.

1055
00:49:49,275 --> 00:49:50,800
Uncle Li invested everything

1056
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,320
in this marriage

1057
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,760
for the sake of Qian’s integrity

1058
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,080
and career.

1059
00:49:57,959 --> 00:49:58,760
Think about it.

1060
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:01,600
If he climbs up the ladder,

1061
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:04,520
the Li Family will rise with him.

1062
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,519
Madam, I’m afraid

1063
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:12,239
the tide seems to be turning.

1064
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:13,719
We’ll have to

1065
00:50:13,919 --> 00:50:16,560
give way to Princess.

1066
00:50:16,919 --> 00:50:17,959
Impossible!

1067
00:50:17,959 --> 00:50:19,558
Why should I?

1068
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,790
I’m her mother-in-law.

1069
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,800
It’s only right for her to obey me.

1070
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,000
Who’d be

1071
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,639
led around by the nose

1072
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:27,760
by a daughter-in-law?

1073
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,120
Besides,

1074
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,280
a woman should follow
the man he marries.

1075
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,120
As highborn as she is,

1076
00:50:33,399 --> 00:50:34,600
as a Li’s wife,

1077
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,760
she must follow our rules.

1078
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,280
Indeed.

1079
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:39,760
Does it look good on me?

1080
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,560
Absolutely!

1081
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,159
Like it was made for me, right?

1082
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,879
She’s now part of our family.

1083
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,360
By that logic,

1084
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,199
what’s hers

1085
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,040
is also ours.

1086
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:55,919
Am I right?

1087
00:50:57,875 --> 00:50:59,196
