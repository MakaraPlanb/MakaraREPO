It doesn’t seem like a small incident.

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,199
I’ll stay here,

30
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,279
you take some guys there to have a look.

31
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:06,919
Okay.

Li Qian.

35
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,039
You won’t die.

36
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,199
I’m taking you
to meet up with Zhao Xiao.

37
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,919
He’ll take us out of the city.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,625
Qian.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,675
Qian.

Jiang Baoning,

43
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,559
how is Qian so heavily injured?

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,199
He got injured for me.

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,600
He got injured for you every time.

46
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:05,080
Freeze! Freeze!

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,039
Someone’s coming.

48
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,199
Now is not the time to talk.

49
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,175
Miss Gao, you get the horses ready.

50
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:10,720
We need to go at once.

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,520
- Okay.
- Freeze!

52
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,240
Qian,

53
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,440
please wait for me here.

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,559
Chase them!

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,759
Li Qian,

56
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,160
you’re the one
who protected me all the time.

57
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,559
This time, let me protect you.

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,240
Baoning.

59
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,000
Baoning.

60
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:43,720
Your Grace.

61
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,800
Baoning.

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,520
Supervisor Li.

63
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:48,279
Go, protect her.

64
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,039
Qian.

65
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,520
Qian.

66
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,600
Qian, come on.

67
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,880
Over here. There they are!

68
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,800
- Chase! Chase them!
- Freeze!

69
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,679
Stop!

70
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:08,360
Stop there!

71
00:04:12,425 --> 00:04:13,720
Young Master, forgive us,

72
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,440
but taking you back safely
is the top priority.

73
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,839
We can’t watch you do silly stuff.

74
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,720
Chase them!

75
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,399
Freeze!

76
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,679
Freeze!

77
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,399
Baoning.

78
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,440
Young Master.

79
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,359
Stop running!

80
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,760
Freeze!

81
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:36,679
Baoning, come on.

82
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:41,320
Baoning, are you okay?

83
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:46,799
Your Grace, Young Master,
we can’t stay here long.

84
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,559
Just go.

85
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:48,320
Let’s get out of here now.

86
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,550
Go.

87
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,760
Baoning.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,040
I can walk on my own.

89
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,600
You’ll slow us down.

90
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,320
They’ll catch up with us.

91
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,519
- Put me down.
- Waste no time.

92
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,079
Quickly.

93
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,160
Quickly.

94
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,880
Your Highness, what is this place?

95
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,119
I’m kind of lost.

96
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,320
Hurry!

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,440
Where are they?

98
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,279
So many alleys here.
It’s really hard to find them.

99
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,050
You are useless!

100
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,480
Split up!

101
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,119
Yes, my lord.

102
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,359
Split up!

103
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:33,799
Yes, my lord.

104
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,160
- Quickly.
- This way.

105
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,160
Be quick! Be quick!

106
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,750
Be quick!

107
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,760
Hurry up! Split up and find them.

108
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,760
Your Highness,

109
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,200
it’s like a maze here.

110
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,239
It’s amazing that you know the way.

111
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,519
After my mother left,

112
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,799
I was badly treated in the palace,

113
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,079
so I often ran out,

114
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,679
and I got familiar with this area.

115
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,359
I’m sorry about your childhood.

116
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,959
I’ve put it behind me.

117
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,399
We can go out now.

118
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:03,640
Don’t we wait for your men?

119
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,359
I prepared the firework for Dongzhi.

120
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,320
I’ve been away from
Yongqing State all these years.

121
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,320
I don’t have any men here.

122
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,600
Commander Siqin,

123
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,720
please return to the palace
to find my father.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,959
He’ll make sure of your safety.

125
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,799
What about you?

126
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,399
I have yet another place to go.

127
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,600
He’s still not here.

128
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,839
Dongzhi.

129
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:10,250
You came.

130
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,425
What took you so long?

131
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,160
Do you have any idea

132
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,119
how long I waited for you here?

133
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,440
- I...
- Now is not the time to talk.

134
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,400
I’ll take you out of the city first.

135
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,519
Wait a minute.

136
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,825
Qing An,

137
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:21,239
what’s the deal with this ring?

138
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,279
Who on earth are you?

139
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:24,839
Dongzhi,

140
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,559
it’s a long story.

141
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,320
We talk about it after we get
out of here, okay?

142
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,799
- Let’s go.
- No.

143
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,959
- Listen.
- What I hate the most is confusion

144
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,920
or perplexity.

145
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,000
Who on earth are you?

146
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,920
Are you hiding something from me?

147
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,839
I want to know, now!

148
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:37,900
Dongzhi.

149
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:40,279
He’s the Second Prince
of Yongqing State.

150
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,200
He’s afraid to admit it,

151
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,640
so I’ll speak it out for him.

152
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,720
After all, he’s my little brother.

153
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,720
Miss Li, please excuse him.

154
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,775
He kept it from you

155
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:53,359
for the benefit of

156
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,279
the south march of our state.

157
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,200
You’re Li Changqing’s daughter.

158
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,320
We can get endless

159
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,920
new information from you

160
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,640
so that Yongqing cavalry

161
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,600
can break open the gate of Jinxi.

162
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,799
Qing Tai, shut up!

163
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:06,760
Is it true?

164
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,679
Are you the Second Prince of
Yongqing State or not?

165
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,600
I...

166
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,600
I see.

167
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,160
What’s the hold-up?

168
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,440
Invite Miss Li to our place.

169
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,750
Seize them.

170
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,320
Dongzhi, sorry.

171
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,440
I’ll explain it to you later.

172
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,239
Don’t.

173
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,119
Qing An,

174
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,280
our relationship ends right here.

175
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,919
Dongzhi, just go.

176
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,880
Leave!

177
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,000
Congratulations, Your Highness.

178
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,200
Everything

179
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,359
has been under your control.

180
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,679
Muster all the clan leaders,

181
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,000
and announce Qing An’s crimes.

182
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:50,000
Then, I’ll offer his blood to God.

183
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:53,280
By then, you’ll be unstoppable.

184
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,080
That’s how it is supposed to be.

185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,925
Never!

186
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,400
Try me.

187
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,200
I hate to be deceived.

188
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,760
Qing An,

189
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:17,880
our relationship ends right here.

190
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:32,880
Your Highness.

191
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,640
Your Highness.

192
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,119
His Majesty sent me to rescue you.

193
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,760
Father.

194
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,679
Son.

195
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,760
What happened to you?

196
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:05,719
That bastard!

197
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,919
It appears he really wants you dead.

198
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,479
Father,

199
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,919
you must take care of yourself.

200
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:14,840
Here.

201
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,840
Where is he?

202
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,000
Sorry, Your Highness!

203
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,520
Where is he?!

204
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,599
Sorry, Your Highness!

205
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,719
Find him!

206
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:31,840
Dead or alive.

207
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,359
Yes.

208
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:32,925
Go.

209
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:33,440
Go!

210
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,599
My days are numbered.

211
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,440
I have no strength to stop him.

212
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,440
I have to count on you.

213
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,000
Father,

214
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,640
what’s this?

215
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,960
This is the badge to command
the Dark Force.

216
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:01,719
As I hand it to you,

217
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:04,599
I entrust you with Yongqing State.

218
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,119
Qing Tai is callous and bloodthirsty.

219
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,479
He can’t bring
peace and stability to Yongqing.

220
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,359
Make good use of the Dark Force,

221
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,679
and overthrow him.

222
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,760
Father, please stop.

223
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,280
You’ll get better.

224
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,400
Yongqing

225
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,919
and its people are yours,

226
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,840
and they should be saved by you.

227
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,760
Son,

228
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,679
do you still hold a grudge against me?

229
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,599
Do you still hate me for being
cold to you all these years?

230
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,200
Yes,

231
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,320
the moment I see you,
I think of your mother,

232
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,239
I think of her betrayal.

233
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,200
My heart is filled with hate

234
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,239
and agony.

235
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:04,719
I don’t believe she betrayed you.

236
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,239
Son,

237
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,000
Death has shown me

238
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,239
what it’s like to be dead.

239
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,719
What else can I not let go of?

240
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,440
The fact is, over the years,

241
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:25,159
I never really let go of her.

242
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,520
I miss her

243
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,799
as much as you do.

244
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,559
Father.

245
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,440
I’ll find Mother,

246
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,239
and I’ll let you know that

247
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,119
she would never betray us.

248
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,679
Your Majesty,

249
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,880
bad news.

250
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,000
Qing Tai is coming with his men.

251
00:13:58,975 --> 00:13:59,719
Son,

252
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:02,159
you must keep what I said in mind.

253
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:04,440
Siqin,

254
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,119
take care of my son.

255
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,500
(Qingyan Hall)

256
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,150
Where is Qing An?

257
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:30,744
He’s your brother.

258
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,760
He’s gone, huh?

259
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:44,119
Well, it doesn’t bother me.

260
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
All clan leaders have arrived.

261
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,520
Tomorrow, they shall be told

262
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:56,880
that Qing An, the Second Prince,
has committed treason

263
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
and escaped from punishment.

264
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
I’ll issue an arrest warrant
to hunt him statewide.

265
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,880
He’ll be living like a rat.

266
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,679
He’ll never see daylight again.

267
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:09,880
You bastard!

268
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,559
I can’t believe you’re so heartless.

269
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,440
As long as I’m still breathing,

270
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,575
you won’t get what you want.

271
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Father,

272
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,159
I suggest you stay calm.

273
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,239
Maybe you get to
live a few days longer.

274
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,440
You bastard!

275
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,640
Take this!

276
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:40,479
Father,

277
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
you should get rid of your temper.

278
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,239
I told you so many times.

279
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,119
Wu Man. Wu Man.

280
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,125
Quickly.

281
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:16,159
Your Highness,

282
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:20,960
God has taken His Majesty away.

283
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:45,080
Yes.

284
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,840
I am now King of Yongqing.

285
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,159
Whatever I want,

286
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,359
I’ll get it.

287
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,970
I won’t need to ask Father
for anything anymore.

288
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,960
Wu Man.

289
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,159
Here.

290
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,319
Go find the badge of Dark Force.

291
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:06,800
Yes.

292
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,920
Be careful.

293
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,560
This is the border between two states.

294
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,520
Yongqing scouts often appear
around here.

295
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,839
Don’t worry, my lord.

296
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,839
Two groups will be on patrol in turns.

297
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,359
We’ll make sure of
Supervisor Li’s safety.

298
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,250
Okay.

299
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,160
Baoning.

300
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,025
Qian.

301
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,520
Qian, you’re awake.

302
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,880
Great.

303
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,479
Qian.

304
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,479
Where is Baoning?

305
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,560
Where is she?

306
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,479
She...

307
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,280
You didn’t bring her back?

308
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,239
Did you get her to draw
Yongqing soldiers away?

309
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:08,920
No, Qian.

310
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,800
She made the choice on her own.

311
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,079
And given that situation,

312
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,560
we couldn’t help her.

313
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,400
So you watched her
plunge into her own demise?

314
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,200
Qian.

315
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,700
Don’t touch me!

316
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:27,959
Qian.

317
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,680
I know that you feel bad.

318
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,160
As long as you’re alive,

319
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,160
I don’t care how you swear at me.

320
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:37,160
I once promised you,

321
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
no matter what happens,

322
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,959
I’ll be there for you.

323
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:42,760
When did you say
something like this?

324
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,280
Qian, have you forgotten

325
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,640
the year the Guards of Li
were almost annihilated?

326
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:58,560
Mother.

327
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,479
Don’t go.

328
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,439
Qian, don’t worry.

329
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:06,959
I won’t leave you.

330
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:07,920
Don’t leave me.

331
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,479
Don’t leave me.

332
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,680
- I promise.
- Don’t leave me.

333
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,680
- I’ll never leave you.
- Don’t leave me.

334
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:13,920
Don’t leave me.

335
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,680
Forever.

336
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:15,800
Mother.

337
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,160
Do you know why I chose to
study medicine?

338
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,119
Because I don’t want to

339
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,079
watch you get injured

340
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,479
while I can’t be of help anymore.

341
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,760
When you’re injured,

342
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,479
I’ll treat your injury.

343
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,520
When you’re hungry,

344
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,040
I’ll cook for you.

345
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,400
When you head to the capital city
in pursuit of achievements in career,

346
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:42,000
I’ll go with you.

347
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,000
Qian,

348
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,599
my promise to you

349
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,680
is something I shall never forget.

350
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,800
Miaorong,

351
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,160
don’t be silly.

352
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,920
I’m already married to
the Commandery Princess.

353
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,439
You married her
because the situation forced you.

354
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,359
You had no choice.

355
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,680
You married her because it helps
with your career.

356
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,800
I never blamed you for that.

357
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,680
It... It’s like God

358
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,640
has played a prank on us.

359
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,160
Miaorong,

360
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,119
I’ll tell you this one last time.

361
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,199
All along,

362
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,359
I see you as my sister,

363
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,119
just like Dongzhi.

364
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
There’s no promise between us.

365
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,160
All my heart goes to Baoning,

366
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,959
and her alone forever.

367
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:40,680
No.

368
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,719
You’re lying to me. You’re lying.

369
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,280
I don’t want to lie to you.

370
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,760
I also don’t want
you to lie to yourself.

371
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,000
Yun Lin.

372
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,119
Supervisor Li, you’re up.

373
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,839
Order two men to send Miss Gao home.

374
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,520
You and I will go
get the Princess in Yunyang.

375
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,850
No.

376
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,319
Qian, you’re still injured.

377
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,680
And Yunyang is
dangerous at the moment,

378
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,439
you can’t go there.

379
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:06,719
You, too, know it’s dangerous.

380
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,119
Baoning is in peril,

381
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:09,319
how can I rest here?

382
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,000
She may be dead by now.

383
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,719
Shut up!

384
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:12,920
I’m being honest.

385
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,280
When we got out of the city,
you saw, too,

386
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,760
that Yongqing soldiers had come.

387
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,000
How could the Princess

388
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,520
escape from them on her own?

389
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:21,680
Qian, please

390
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,520
stop lying to yourself, okay?

391
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,400
Please!

392
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,239
No matter how much you love her...

393
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:26,199
Shut up!

394
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,239
Yun Lin.

395
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:32,650
Go.

396
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:34,680
Miss Gao.

397
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,599
You should consider yourself lucky

398
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,040
because Supervisor Li doesn’t hit women.

399
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:46,319
We tried to find it, but we couldn’t.

400
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:49,079
Your Highness...

401
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,199
No, Your Majesty.

402
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:01,560
Well.

403
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,040
In the end,

404
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:07,239
you still favored him.

405
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:15,040
I’ll let you know

406
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,160
which son of yours is the best.

407
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,319
You just wait and see.

408
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:26,239
Make the announcement.

409
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:31,079
Qing An committed treason,
and murdered our father.

410
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,800
Here’s my order.

411
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,920
Kill him on sight.

412
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,825
Supervisor Li,

413
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:54,920
we’re here at a post house.

414
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,100
Let’s get some water inside.

415
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,959
Fill the waterskin,
and we set out at once.

416
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,800
But your injury...

417
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,719
Just go.

418
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:13,839
Hey.

419
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:14,479
Supervisor Li.

420
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:15,640
Zhao Zhong?

421
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,000
You’re here, too.

422
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,000
Did you see Commandery Princess Jia’nan?

423
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,719
Master Zhao took her away,

424
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:25,119
and asked me to return to Nanmin
to inform the Marquis.

425
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,400
Is she okay?

426
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:30,050
Yes,

427
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,040
she’s fine.

428
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:32,040
Don’t worry.

429
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:32,975
Great.

430
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:34,319
It’s wonderful.

431
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:35,725
Here.

432
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,599
Take them. For your journey.

433
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,760
Thank you, my lord.

434
00:23:39,325 --> 00:23:40,550
- No, thank you.
- There’s a long journey ahead of me.

435
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,025
Goodbye.

436
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:42,550
Okay.

437
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:46,920
Supervisor Li,

438
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:48,359
you gave him all the waterskins.

439
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,479
How do we drink water?

440
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,599
When we find the Princess later,

441
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,359
I’ll buy everybody booze.

442
00:23:54,675 --> 00:23:55,225
Let’s go.

443
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:16,800
Weird.

444
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,040
If they’re going back to Jinxi,

445
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,959
they have to take this path.

446
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,439
Why don’t we see anyone?

447
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,079
It looks like someone’s
moving in circles.

448
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:39,925
Baoning,

449
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,479
are you hungry?

450
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,719
Do you need something to eat?

451
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,500
No.

452
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:46,199
Drink some water, then.

453
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,319
Your lips are dry.

454
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:52,599
Give it to me.

455
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,479
Baoning,

456
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,400
why do you keep a distance from me?

457
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,880
If it weren’t for Li Qian,

458
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,280
you and I would have been married.

459
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,800
Master Zhao, you know

460
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,800
that the reason why we can’t be together

461
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,119
isn’t Li Qian.

462
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:15,119
Hadn’t he secretly taken you to Jinxi,

463
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,250
I would have

464
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,560
rescued you from Qing Tai.

465
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,439
Baoning, you and I both know that

466
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,160
the Grand Empress Dowager

467
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,520
- wants us to be together.
- Master Zhao,

468
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,839
I’m grateful that you saved me.

469
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,959
But the past

470
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,199
is the past.

471
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,199
I’m now Li Qian’s wife.

472
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,119
Please behave yourself.

473
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,520
Baoning, you know that

474
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,599
I don’t need you to thank me.

475
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,719
When will we arrive in Bingzhou?

476
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:50,640
You aren’t fully recovered.

477
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,040
Let us not be hasty.

478
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,880
But trust me,

479
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,479
I will take you back

480
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,400
safe and sound.

481
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,760
Thank you.

482
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,950
Yun Lin, which way?

483
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,760
Supervisor Li, we’ve been
looking for them for days.

484
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Both our men and the horses are tired.

485
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,239
There’s an old temple ahead.

486
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,359
How about we

487
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,599
get some proper rest?

488
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,959
We’ll continue looking for
the Princess tomorrow.

489
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,175
Okay.

490
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,319
Good work, everybody.

491
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,325
Who goes there?

492
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,880
Go, go!

493
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:36,750
Chase them.

494
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
Spare us, good lords.

495
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:40,839
Spare us, please.

496
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,400
We...

497
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,040
We are all

498
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,400
honest merchants.

499
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,319
Please spare us, good lords.

500
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,079
Since you’re honest merchants,

501
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,079
why did you run away?

502
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,119
What mission did Qing Tai
assign to you?

503
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,479
I’ll come clean. I’ll come clean.

504
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:02,719
His Majesty asked us...

505
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,160
He asked us to catch
the Second Prince Qing An.

506
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,839
Qing An murdered his father
and committed treason.

507
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,439
He’s the greatest criminal in Yongqing.

508
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,599
It’s family business.

509
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,319
It has nothing to do with you.

510
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,680
We’re in Mu’an’s territory.

511
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
How come it has nothing to do with us?

512
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:16,000
Arrest them,

513
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,359
and turn them over to Mr. Jin.

514
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:18,725
Yes.

515
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,239
Let’s sleep here for the night,

516
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,719
and set out tomorrow morning.

517
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,319
Yes.

518
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,280
I... I’m telling you everything I know.

519
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,239
Xiaowu, get the ropes.

520
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,250
Come here.

521
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,040
Be good.

522
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,719
Baoning, where are you?

523
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,359
Are you doing okay?

524
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:51,319
Li Qian, where are you now?

525
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Have you made it home safely?

526
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:07,760
(Changqing Post House)

527
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,079
Isn’t it the one we

528
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:09,700
stayed in a few days ago?

529
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,640
Sir, give me the horses.

530
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,280
Baoning, sorry.

531
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,680
I took a detour days ago

532
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,800
and got the direction wrong.

533
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,640
Sorry for the uncomfortableness.

534
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:20,439
Now that we’re here at the post house,

535
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,000
we get some rest.

536
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,825
Baoning,

537
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,839
why are you staring at me?

538
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,079
It was in this post house where

539
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:56,160
you asked Zhao Zhong to take
the bodyguards back to Nanmin.

540
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,680
You left no one with you.

541
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,319
Why?

542
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,680
I told you,

543
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,079
there was some business in Nanmin,

544
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,640
so I had them go back to deal with it.

545
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:06,199
If you aren’t willing to tell me,

546
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,359
I’ll have to guess.

547
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:08,800
There are two reasons.

548
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:09,875
Reason one.

549
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:12,520
Zhao Zhong took
a large group of people away.

550
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,959
If Li Qian comes to find me,

551
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,239
he’ll follow them,

552
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,719
and be drawn away.

553
00:29:21,175 --> 00:29:21,839
Reason two.

554
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,959
If Li Qian isn’t drawn away,

555
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:25,640
hiding two people is

556
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,359
easier than hiding a group of people,

557
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,599
and it’ll be harder for him to find me.

558
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:32,640
Baoning, you’re still clever as ever.

559
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,199
Why did you do it, though?

560
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:36,920
Since you’ve guessed it,

561
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,599
I’ll just be honest with you.

562
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,280
Baoning, I’d like to take you away.

563
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,800
Far away from Jinxi, from Li Qian.

564
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,839
What are you talking about?

565
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,599
I know what happened
back in the palace.

566
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,760
The Grand Empress Dowager said
your body wasn’t in a good condition,

567
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:57,560
and forbade you from
sleeping with Li Qian.

568
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,839
Baoning,

569
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,479
you’re still intact.

570
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,400
You two aren’t real husband and wife.

571
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,800
Go back to Nanmin with me.

572
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,959
Nanmin is warm.

573
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:10,119
We’ll play the zither and flute.
We’ll watch the Moon and flowers.

574
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,800
We’ll be a heavenly couple.

575
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,719
Wouldn’t it be nicer?

576
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:14,400
What nonsense are you talking about?

577
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,400
Li Qian and I are married.

578
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:18,000
You’re irrelevant.

579
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:20,640
Just take me back to Bingzhou.

580
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,719
- Or I’ll...
- Or what?

581
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:25,839
I used to scruple too much,

582
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,560
that’s why I lost you.

583
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,319
But now, I won’t let you
be away from me again.

584
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,479
I swear I’ll take you to Nanmin.

585
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,040
You’re unbelievable.

586
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,119
Baoning.

587
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,199
Baoning.

588
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,239
Just go with me.

589
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:37,040
Go back to Nanmin with me, Baoning.

590
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,880
- Let go.
- Go back to Nanmin with me.

591
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,239
- Let go of me! Let go!
- Baoning, please!

592
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:40,025
- Let me go!
- Let her go!

593
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:48,550
Are you okay?

594
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,359
I’m okay.

595
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,880
I warn you,

596
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,079
stay away from my wife.

597
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:55,959
When in Yongqing State,

598
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,239
you left her behind

599
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,359
and escaped.

600
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,520
Now you remember

601
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,560
you have a wife?

602
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,680
I can’t believe you said it.

603
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:04,280
Baoning, he left you behind once,

604
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,520
and he’ll do it again.

605
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,575
Just come with me.

606
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:07,239
Zhao Xiao,

607
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,640
stop harassing my wife,

608
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,920
or I won’t be civil.

609
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,119
Who the hell do you
think you are?

610
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:13,839
You’re but a supervisor.

611
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:14,800
She’s out of your league.

612
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,359
Only I am worthy of her.

613
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:37,359
Stop!

614
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,319
Stop fighting.

615
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:39,560
Are you okay?

616
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:40,680
I’m fine.

617
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:44,760
Zhao Xiao,

618
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,599
you saved my life several times,

619
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,880
and I’ll repay you.

620
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,560
But please take a good look.

621
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,040
Li Qian and I are married.

622
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,800
I trust him. I love him.

623
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,119
I’ll be with him forever.

624
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,319
I won’t go with you.

625
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:58,119
Not before, not now,

626
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,359
not ever.

627
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,839
If this farce doesn’t stop now,

628
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:03,479
I’ll fall out with you.

629
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,479
Do you hear her?

630
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,439
If you do it again,

631
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,640
you won’t get away with it so easily.

632
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,250
Let’s go.

633
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,599
You trust him, you love him.

634
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,160
Does he trust and love you?

635
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,719
If anything bad happens,

636
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:16,520
will he protect you

637
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,479
the way you protect him?

638
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,800
No, he won’t.

639
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,719
Shut up!

640
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,719
The future is unpredictable.

641
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,839
No one knows what will happen.

642
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,839
But right here, right now,

643
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,079
if there’s any man who

644
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,800
deserves my unconditional
trust and love,

645
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,000
that’s Li Qian.

646
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,600
Let’s go.

647
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,280
Why?

648
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,520
Why?

649
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,959
You open up your eyes and look!

650
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,160
The only perfect match
for you in this world

651
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:04,959
is me.

652
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:07,959
It’s me.

653
00:33:09,775 --> 00:33:13,125
(Changqing Post House)

654
00:33:15,275 --> 00:33:17,150
Lanterns for sale. Lanterns for sale.

655
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,959
The injury on the back of his head

656
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,359
was fortunately treated timely.

657
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,839
It has now healed.

658
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,239
The injury on his chest

659
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,359
is the dehiscence of an old wound.

660
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,319
Boil and drink the medicine.

661
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,040
Ensure his peaceful convalescence.

662
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,719
He mustn’t fight anyone again.

663
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,119
Or his disease will turn chronic.

664
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,475
Doctor, let’s talk outside, please.

665
00:33:43,475 --> 00:33:44,100
Sure.

666
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,959
Baoning.

667
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:00,520
You look emaciated.

668
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,520
Does your injury still hurt?

669
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,880
Compared to yours, my injury is nothing.

670
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,750
Sorry

671
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:14,760
that I failed to protect you.

672
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,040
Zhao Xiao was right.

673
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,479
As your husband,

674
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,040
I left you in danger alone.

675
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,399
I can’t be forgiven.

676
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,000
That’s not true.

677
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,639
You didn’t leave me behind.

678
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,520
I chose to do it.

679
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:31,320
Don’t say this.

680
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,199
The more you say it,
the worse I feel.

681
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:36,075
Sometimes, I think to myself,

682
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,919
if you were married to Zhao Xiao,

683
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,560
you would be in Nanmin

684
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,760
living an easy life
as a marchioness-to-be.

685
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,919
You wouldn’t need to put your life
on the line along with me.

686
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,560
You’re jealous.

687
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,159
Jealous?

688
00:34:57,439 --> 00:34:58,399
No way.

689
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,760
I just want the best for you.

690
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,959
There is no Zhao Xiao.

691
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:04,000
There has never been any room
in my heart for Zhao Xiao.

692
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,520
Who takes up your heart, then?

693
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:12,919
A fool covered in injuries.

694
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,200
Stop there.

695
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,040
What are you doing?

696
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,080
No... Nothing.

697
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:44,520
I just wanted to move my legs.

698
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,760
- I saw that.
- I wasn’t going to do anything.

699
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,879
Have you forgotten
what the doctor said to you?

700
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:50,800
Peaceful convalescence.
Peaceful convalescence.

701
00:35:50,919 --> 00:35:51,840
Don’t you understand?

702
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,600
You don’t want to get better, do you?

703
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,080
With you by my side,

704
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:01,840
even if I was going to be sick forever,

705
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:03,760
I’d be glad.

706
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,675
Smile?

707
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,479
Why do you smile?

708
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,560
I’m thinking, I can’t

709
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,450
lie in bed forever, right?

710
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,840
My supreme martial arts
will be squandered.

711
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:29,300
(Li’s Mansion)

712
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,875
You’re home, my lady.

713
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:33,425
Yes.

714
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:37,025
Master, Madam, your daughter is home.

715
00:36:37,025 --> 00:36:37,750
Ah.

716
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,225
Mother.

717
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,120
Dongdong,

718
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,040
I was so worried.

719
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,280
You’re home at last.

720
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,320
I need some water.

721
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,239
You naughty girl.

722
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:51,520
You just left.

723
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,639
You didn’t even leave a notice.

724
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:55,280
Do you care about your father

725
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,080
and your mother

726
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,840
or not?

727
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,120
I do, I do.

728
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,199
All right.

729
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,650
She’s home now, isn’t she?

730
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:03,879
Dongdong,

731
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,080
where is the Commandery Princess?

732
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:07,919
She didn’t come back?

733
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,159
Wasn’t she with you all the time?

734
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:11,959
No.

735
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:12,800
What?

736
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,159
Where’s my brother?
He didn’t come home, either?

737
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:15,800
No.

738
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,679
Yun Lin and I had

739
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,360
rescued Qian.

740
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,639
The Commandery Princess...

741
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,040
She might be gone.

742
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,000
What?

743
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,040
Gone?

744
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:26,919
- We barely managed to rescue Qian.
- You...

745
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,399
The Commandery Princess ran slowly.

746
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,000
It’s likely that

747
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,639
she got surrounded by
Yongqing soldiers at the time.

748
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,280
My god.

749
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,479
This is... It’s just...

750
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:38,760
The Commandery Princess is lost.

751
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,679
What do we do?

752
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,679
If the Grand Empress Dowager is mad,

753
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:43,725
- the Li Family will be in real trouble.
- Master.

754
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,800
- Master, Madam.
- What?

755
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Look who came home.

756
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,280
Father, Mother.

757
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,875
Qian.

758
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,479
- You’re both home.
- Sorry

759
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:51,879
- Baoning.
- that I concerned you.

760
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:54,800
I’m glad you’re home. I’m glad.

761
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:55,439
Right.

762
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,959
False alarm.

763
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,320
Miaorong said the Commandery Princess

764
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,760
was seized by Yongqing people.

765
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:01,560
We were so worried.

766
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,120
Yeah.

767
00:38:02,439 --> 00:38:03,800
Now, you’ve made it home
safe and sound.

768
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,159
Thank God.

769
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,560
Honestly, God bless us.

770
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,879
It’s true that I was almost seized
by Yongqing soldiers.

771
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,959
But thankfully, the son of
Marquis Jinghai saved me.

772
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:19,239
Baoning.

773
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:19,850
Butler,

774
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:21,719
- get a big gift ready for me.
- Come.

775
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,639
- We must thank Master Zhao properly.
- We were so worried.

776
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,625
- Yes, Master.
- Worried that you might be in danger.

777
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,275
Uncle Li,

778
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,486
- there’s something you may not know.
- What?

779
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,239
In the beginning,

780
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,080
the Grand Empress Dowager meant

781
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,560
to marry the Commandery Princess
to Master Zhao.

782
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,040
And his strong love for her

783
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,439
is known to everybody
in the capital city.

784
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,639
In my humble opinion,

785
00:38:36,919 --> 00:38:38,040
Master Zhao saved her

786
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,040
because he still loves her.

787
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,520
I believe he never wanted
any gift from us.

788
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,760
And if we give him anything,
that’s too contrived.

789
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,959
How about Her Grace
personally hands the gift to him?

790
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:48,879
That’s a better way for Master Zhao
to accept the gift.

791
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,679
What Master Zhao did
is not our business,

792
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,919
but he did save the Princess.

793
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,479
So Her Grace can thank him

794
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:00,600
the way she likes

795
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:03,719
whereas the Li Family will thank him

796
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,239
in our own way.

797
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:08,479
Yes, you’re right, Uncle Li.

798
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,760
It’s ignorant of me.

799
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:13,159
It was a long journey from
Yongqing State to Jinxi,

800
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:16,040
they stayed together day and night
through so many dangers,

801
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,199
and never got separated.

802
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,320
Maybe the Princess

803
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,120
has already expressed her gratitude.

804
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,199
We

805
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,719
don’t need to worry too much.

806
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,719
Let’s just get our big gift ready.

807
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,520
Miaorong, what are you suggesting?

808
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:30,760
It sounds acerbic to me.

809
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,239
I mean Uncle Li is right.

810
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,600
We do need to
thank Master Zhao with sincerity.

811
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,520
It’s appropriate that
we give him a gift.

812
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:39,150
Okay.

813
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
Enough, enough.

814
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,650
Come, come, come.

815
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:42,175
Baoning.

816
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:43,439
Why did you cut in?

817
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,919
A big gift?

818
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:49,800
What? A big gift

819
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,360
to thank him for

820
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,280
staying together with my
daughter-in-law day and night

821
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,639
through dangers?

822
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,840
Isn’t it shameful?

823
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:00,280
Also, Your Grace,

824
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,399
I think you should behave.

825
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,800
You’re now a married woman.

826
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,639
You need to pay attention to

827
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:06,840
what you say and do.

828
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:07,500
Mother.

829
00:40:09,925 --> 00:40:10,879
Baoning put herself in danger

830
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:12,399
in order to save me.

831
00:40:12,879 --> 00:40:14,560
Her love for me is genuine.

832
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,959
If anyone in this house

833
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,399
judges or

834
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:19,600
attacks her,

835
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,360
I won’t let them off.

836
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,560
Father, Baoning is tired.

837
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:27,919
I’ll take her back to our room.

838
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,679
Go get some rest.

839
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:31,840
Let’s go.

840
00:40:36,075 --> 00:40:36,825
Stop giggling.

841
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,840
Just look at your brother.

842
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,760
Unbelievable.

843
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:42,959
His wife was with another man,

844
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,840
and he didn’t even say a word.

845
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,719
She didn’t behave like a proper wife,

846
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:48,959
and I couldn’t tell her off?

847
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,675
Mother.

848
00:40:49,675 --> 00:40:50,900
You need to behave, too.

849
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,040
Are you done, He Cuihua?

850
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:55,639
I said you were a shrew,
but you never admitted it.

851
00:40:56,399 --> 00:40:57,479
As a mother-in-law,

852
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,120
you didn’t defend your daughter-in-law,

853
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,280
instead, you kept attacking her.

854
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,239
- Was it appropriate?
- I...

855
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:01,919
Enough!

856
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,925
Dongdong, come with me.

857
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,719
I didn’t attack her.

858
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
I was telling the truth.

859
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,959
- Why are you carrying me?
- Hey, look.

860
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,350
- We are watched by so many eyes.
- The Young Master loves Her Grace so much.

861
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,120
- I want everybody to see
- Yes.

862
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,800
that my allegiance belongs only to you.

863
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:31,120
Whoever touches you touches me.

864
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,000
You’ve been carrying me
quite a while,

865
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,159
are you tired?

866
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,900
Quite heavy, right?

867
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,600
Ouch.

868
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:42,600
What?

869
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,125
Ouch.

870
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,959
Now that you said it,
it does kind of hurt.

871
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,120
I told you to put me down, didn’t I?

872
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,320
Lie down. Just lie down.

873
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,025
Quickly.

874
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:00,679
Are you okay?

875
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:03,040
Sir, Your Grace.

876
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,320
Your Grace, you’re home at last.

877
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:09,159
Get up.

878
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,679
Get up. Get up.

879
00:42:11,439 --> 00:42:12,239
Your Grace,

880
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,000
please don’t do it again.

881
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,600
No matter where you go,

882
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,000
I’ll follow you.

883
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:20,959
You should be glad I’m back.

884
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:23,239
You have no idea how worried I was.

885
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:25,080
The Grand Empress Dowager
even sent someone to question me.

886
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:27,360
It took me so much effort to
handle the man.

887
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,360
Alright.

888
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,879
I’ll write a letter to Grandmother now

889
00:42:30,879 --> 00:42:31,479
about my return.

890
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:32,075
Come on.

891
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,679
Son.

892
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,560
Father.

893
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,600
Why are you here?

894
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,840
How is your recovery going?

895
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:46,080
I’m basically fine now.

896
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:47,280
Father,

897
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,080
I have an important matter
to report to you.

898
00:42:49,325 --> 00:42:49,850
Okay.

899
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,040
It’s about the massacre

900
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,399
of the Li Family.

901
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,600
Miss Gao, what’s this for?

902
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,679
Qian is heavily injured.

903
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:05,639
He suffered great blood loss.

904
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:06,959
I’ve cooked some nutrients for him.

905
00:43:07,275 --> 00:43:07,879
Okay.

906
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:09,120
Thank you for your kindness.

907
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,800
Qingke,

908
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,000
we need to appreciate
Miss Gao’s kindness.

909
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,199
When my husband wakes up,

910
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:13,750
serve the nutrient to him.

911
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,600
Qian and I grew up together.

912
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:17,360
He had always been a naughty boy.

913
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,320
He would always get himself injured.

914
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:21,280
And I would look after him every time.

915
00:43:21,439 --> 00:43:23,479
So I’m more experienced than Qingke.

916
00:43:23,479 --> 00:43:24,399
I’ll do it.

917
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,239
The past is the past.

918
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,600
While now is now.

919
00:43:29,879 --> 00:43:31,840
Li Qian didn’t have a wife in the past.

920
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:33,679
You’re meticulous, Miss Gao.

921
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:35,399
Indeed, you’re a better caretaker

922
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:37,159
than Wei Shu and the others.

923
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:39,000
But you see,

924
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,639
Li Qian has got me, now.

925
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,120
So you shouldn’t be

926
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,080
bothered by such trifles.

927
00:43:44,399 --> 00:43:46,679
This is what I’m used to doing.

928
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,360
It’s not bothering me.

929
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,360
What you’re used to doing

930
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,560
isn’t necessarily the right thing to do.

931
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,800
You aren’t Li Qian’s family,

932
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:55,919
nor are you his servant.

933
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:58,879
You don’t need to be humble.

934
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,575
Just leave it to Qingke.

935
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:01,600
Qingke.

936
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,750
You have a point, Your Grace.

937
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,199
It’s just it’s been nearly twenty years,

938
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:16,719
Qian and I are always together.

939
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,000
We are closer than family.

940
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,399
Qian’s injuries

941
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:22,879
pain me more than anyone else.

942
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,800
Your Grace,

943
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,679
can I please at least pay him a visit?

944
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,679
I appreciate your care, Miss Gao.

945
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:30,280
But Li Qian just fell asleep,

946
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,879
so it’s not a good hour.

947
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:34,975
Okay.

948
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,199
I’ll visit him some other day.

949
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:39,360
Li’s Mansion isn’t that big after all.

950
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:42,239
I can always go see him if I want.

951
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,399
Am I right, Your Grace?

952
00:44:45,325 --> 00:44:46,025
Hmm.

953
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:47,560
Good point.

954
00:44:48,959 --> 00:44:49,959
See you around.

955
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,320
Son, are you sure you’re not mistaken?

956
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:01,679
I couldn’t believe it, just like you.

957
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:03,639
But I was trapped in the palace,

958
00:45:03,919 --> 00:45:05,439
King of Yongqing could
have killed me easily.

959
00:45:05,479 --> 00:45:06,760
He didn’t need to lie.

960
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,959
It wasn’t Yongqing people.

961
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,520
Who could it be?

962
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:17,959
This matter requires
a careful investigation.

963
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:19,520
But trust me,

964
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,639
I’ll dig out the truth
as soon as possible.

965
00:45:22,425 --> 00:45:23,150
Okay.

966
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,360
Once I find the murderer,

967
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,439
I’ll cut him into pieces.

968
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:32,300
Jewelry.

969
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,300
Pendants.

970
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:34,694
Check out the jewels

971
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:35,450
and pendants.

972
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:38,520
Your pulse is normal now, my lady.

973
00:45:39,399 --> 00:45:41,399
And you look much better.

974
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,280
Your cold-body illness has been cured.

975
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,280
Really?

976
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:46,479
I’ll prescribe

977
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:48,080
you a diet.

978
00:45:48,399 --> 00:45:50,439
Please convalesce well

979
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:52,879
to replenish your energy
and strengthen your health.

980
00:45:53,479 --> 00:45:54,479
Thank you, doctor.

981
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:57,320
My lady,

982
00:45:57,399 --> 00:45:58,879
Her Highness asks to see you.

983
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:01,800
Okay. We’re going to the palace now.

984
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,375
Okay.

985
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:04,250
Done.

986
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:06,439
Here.

987
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,600
Thank you, doctor.

988
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:09,700
Let’s go.

989
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,275
(East Warmth Chamber)

990
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,239
Greetings, Your Highness.

991
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,679
Su, come.

992
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:23,879
It’s Baoning’s letter.

993
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:26,360
Li Qian went home safe and sound.

994
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,000
I’m relieved at last.

995
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,919
Terrific.

996
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:33,760
Baoning and Lord Li

997
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:35,360
are both blessed by God.

998
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,006
Yes.

999
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,575
Buddha blesses us.

1000
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,800
Amitabha.

1001
00:46:40,399 --> 00:46:41,439
Come, Su.

1002
00:46:42,439 --> 00:46:45,879
Follow me to the Buddha hall
to burn an incense stick.

1003
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,840
Unbelievable!

1004
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,199
What makes you mad, Your Majesty?

1005
00:46:55,959 --> 00:46:56,575
Now.

1006
00:46:57,399 --> 00:46:58,280
Draft the imperial edict.

1007
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,320
Zhao Xiao performed poorly
as a commander, so we were defeated.

1008
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,959
He’s a piece of trash.

1009
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:06,600
Demote him to
Military Supply Commissioner.

1010
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,879
From now on,

1011
00:47:08,919 --> 00:47:10,080
he is to manage provisions.

1012
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,439
Yes.

1013
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:16,975
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)

1014
00:47:23,399 --> 00:47:24,040
Young Master.

1015
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,120
Li.

1016
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,600
Look who’s here.

1017
00:47:29,399 --> 00:47:30,320
When did you arrive?

1018
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,425
Today.

1019
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,479
I tried everything I could.

1020
00:47:33,479 --> 00:47:35,000
I almost tried hanging myself.

1021
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,080
My old man finally agreed to

1022
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,040
transfer me back.

1023
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,399
How are you doing lately?

1024
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:42,479
I heard about your narrow escape
in Yongqing State.

1025
00:47:42,479 --> 00:47:43,239
How is your body doing?

1026
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:46,280
I’m not sure if your martial arts

1027
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,520
still remain.

1028
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,679
Just try it out.

1029
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,800
I haven’t sparred with you for long.

1030
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:53,050
Come on.

1031
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:13,360
Put me down.

1032
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,000
Are you okay?

1033
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,399
I’m fine.

1034
00:48:27,879 --> 00:48:29,239
Kind of painful.

1035
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,040
Let me help you go back to your room.

1036
00:48:38,879 --> 00:48:39,679
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1037
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,639
Mr. Jin, Lord Li hasn’t healed.

1038
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:43,159
How could you be so hard on him?

1039
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:44,639
Do you see him as your bro or not?

1040
00:48:52,825 --> 00:48:53,525
Ouch.

1041
00:48:57,425 --> 00:48:58,175
Ouch.

1042
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:02,159
Did you have enough fun with Jin Xiao?

1043
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:04,000
Jin Xiao forced me to fight.

1044
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,159
He insisted on testing me.

1045
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,159
Here’s the thing.

1046
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,520
You’ve been taking care of me
for quite some time,

1047
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,320
and my body has recovered a lot.

1048
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:19,760
No,

1049
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:21,080
almost fully recovered.

1050
00:49:21,439 --> 00:49:22,639
The credit all goes to you.

1051
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,199
Thank you, Baoning.

1052
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:28,600
Sorry.

1053
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,439
I’m all fine.

1054
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,840
As good as new.

1055
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,600
If you hadn’t got caught,

1056
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,600
how much longer would you be faking?

1057
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,479
I just thought

1058
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,320
if you could take care of me forever,

1059
00:49:41,439 --> 00:49:42,840
it would be nice, too.

1060
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:43,700
I...

1061
00:49:45,439 --> 00:49:46,025
Ouch!

1062
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,360
It hurts!

1063
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:48,280
It really hurts!

1064
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,760
Stop! Stop!

1065
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,120
Taverns here in Bingzhou are good.

1066
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:53,760
Prince Qing An,

1067
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,719
is it where you used to live?

1068
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,600
I’m not a prince anymore.

1069
00:49:59,439 --> 00:50:00,399
Everybody now

1070
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,600
sees me as a sinner

1071
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:06,360
who murdered his father,
and committed treason.

1072
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,959
It’s because Qing Tai framed you.

1073
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:11,840
Your Highness,

1074
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:14,975
if you continue to be dispirited,

1075
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,719
it’s exactly what he wants.

1076
00:50:22,439 --> 00:50:23,239
I’m unfilial.

1077
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:25,120
I never did what a son

1078
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,760
needs to do to Father.

1079
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:29,120
Do you remember what His Majesty
told you to do?

1080
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:32,479
He asked you to gather
the Dark Force to bring Qing Tai down.

1081
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,760
It’s his last wish.

1082
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,560
If you want to be a filial son,

1083
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,120
just fulfill it.

1084
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:38,639
That’s the true meaning of filial piety.

1085
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:45,525
You’re right.

1086
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,399
I can’t fail Father again.

1087
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,875
It’s the first time Master Zhao fought
in war, so accidentally making a mistake

1088
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,959
is natural.

1089
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,320
Please don’t give yourself a hard time.

1090
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,719
Military supply is essential in war.

1091
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,639
It may seem demotion,

1092
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,080
while in fact,
the weight on your shoulder

1093
00:51:20,439 --> 00:51:21,520
has become heavier.

1094
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:22,919
Trust me, Mr. Jin.

1095
00:51:23,919 --> 00:51:25,840
I’ll do everything I can

1096
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,360
to recover the lost provisions

1097
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,475
that I’m held accountable for.

1098
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:29,600
Enough.

1099
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:31,399
Now that you have all returned,

1100
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:32,959
from this day now,

1101
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,120
we fight against the enemy
shoulder to shoulder.

1102
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:39,560
Qing Tai is the new king now.

1103
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,320
He will take action.

1104
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,239
We should take precautions.

1105
00:51:44,425 --> 00:51:45,025
Yes.

1106
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:51,600
One.

1107
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:53,800
Two.

1108
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:56,800
Three.

1109
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:00,325
Four.

1110
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:03,275
One.

1111
00:52:03,399 --> 00:52:04,080
My lord.

1112
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,399
- We heard you are a good warrior.
- Two.

1113
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,600
- Could you please give us instructions?
- Three.

1114
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,025
Four.

1115
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,520
You’re from Xuanjia Battalion, right?

1116
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,760
- Yes, we are.
- Yes.

1117
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,375
One.

1118
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:16,000
Follow me.

1119
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,625
Two.

1120
00:52:19,175 --> 00:52:19,840
Three.

1121
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,360
Let’s go.

1122

all our brothers that you sent to death.

1126
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,800
This one

1127
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,639
is for the wages that you docked.

Go.

Master Zhao.

1132
00:53:20,919 --> 00:53:21,560
Master Zhao.

1133
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,159
It seems his ribs are broken.

1134
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:25,725
Call the paramedic.

1135
00:53:25,919 --> 00:53:26,525
Yes.

1136
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:28,375
Master Zhao.

1137
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:30,080
