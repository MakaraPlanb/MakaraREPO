Mother.

00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,680
Stop.

29
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,319
Tell me.

30
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,360
Why did you leave Mr. Shao alone

31
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,239
and left yourself?

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,575
I don’t like him.

33
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:11,880
You don’t?

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,675
Mm.

35
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,240
Mr. Shao is such a good man.

36
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,199
But you don’t like him?

37
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,800
Who do you want to marry then?

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,720
Are you deliberately

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,839
going to be single

40
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,119
so that everyone in Bingzhou

41
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:22,039
will laugh at me?

42
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,225
Will it satisfy you?

43
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,360
Mother, stop bothering me with that,

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
will you?

45
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,880
It gives me so much trouble!

46
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,479
I’ve been looking for
well-matched men for you,

47
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,320
but you don’t like

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,199
- any of them.
- I just don’t like them.

49
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,080
- Dongzhi,
- What kind of man do you...?

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,600
you’re summoned to the Battalion.

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,559
Yes.

52
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,650
Come back!

53
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,639
- Will you cut it out?
- Come back!

54
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,511
Why are you yelling in the day?

55
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,080
You’re making such a noise.

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,720
Isn’t it ridiculous?

57
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,039
Li Changqing,

58
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,919
do you know

59
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,440
what your daughter did?

60
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,199
I’ve found a good man for her,

61
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,720
but she ruined it quickly.

62
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,600
Do you have any idea?

63
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Say no more.

64
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,600
Unbelievable.

65
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,479
Master, Madam,

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,679
you’ve got visitors.

67
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,119
A lady and her daughter.

68
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:01,199
She’s a Mrs. Zhang from Hedong.

69
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,919
She said you would recognize them

70
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,320
after I said so.

71
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,850
Oh.

72
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,039
I’ll be right there.

73
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,119
Yes.

74
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:25,559
The house is too small.

75
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,199
It’s not even as big as my house.

76
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,360
Your house is really luxurious, then.

77
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,450
It surly is.

78
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,800
My house

79
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:46,119
has the floor of jade
and pillars of gold.

80
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,960
Even the tables and chairs

81
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
are made of silkwood.

82
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,639
You know silkwood, don’t you?

83
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,839
It’s even more valuable than gold.

84
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,839
Mrs. Zhang.

85
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,650
Commandant Li.

86
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,039
Mrs. Zhang, long time no see.

87
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,399
I’m glad you still remember us.

88
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,360
I certainly do.

89
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,948
- Duolan.
- Mm.

90
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:11,948
Come and meet Commandant Li
and Madam He.

91
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,000
Greetings, Commandant Li.

92
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,919
Greetings, Madam He.

93
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,640
Mm.

94
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,200
You’ve grown up.

95
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,359
Mrs. Zhang, where’s Mr. Zhang?

96
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,839
He died several years ago.

97
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,900
Ah?

98
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,440
Only my daughter and I live now.

99
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,640
I packed our things in our hometown

100
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:33,480
bought several mansions
out of Bingzhou

101
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,720
and opened some shops in Bingzhou.

102
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,959
We’ve been doing a lot of business.

103
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:40,279
But our house hasn’t finished
its decoration yet.

104
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,959
It’s not convenient to live in it now.

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,525
See?

106
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,875
Then I came to you with my daughter.

107
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,600
Mm.

108
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,920
Don’t be cold to us.

109
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:50,000
What are you talking about, Mrs. Zhang?

110
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,880
Darling,

111
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,480
Mr. Zhang saved my life.

112
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:57,320
Mrs. Zhang,

113
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,160
make yourselves at home.

114
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,839
Be seated, please.

115
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,275
Mother.

116
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,040
Mrs. Zhang, you’re doing great business.

117
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,550
That’s for sure.

118
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,000
In Bingzhou,

119
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,399
three of ten shops belong to our family.

120
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,040
Sounds great.

121
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,600
Just so-so.

122
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,799
We’re just a bit richer

123
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,700
than officials like you.

124
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,760
Madam He,

125
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,679
my daughter has a loose tongue

126
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,959
and she’s always straightforward.

127
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:32,320
By the way,

128
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,040
my daughter

129
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,640
is at the age of marriage.

130
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:37,519
I came to Bingzhou

131
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,920
to visit you

132
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:42,239
and to find a good husband

133
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:43,239
for her.

134
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:44,799
You did?

135
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:48,040
What kind of son-in-law do you want?

136
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,000
Well,

137
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,725
the best, of course.

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,279
My daughter is gorgeous.

139
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,679
My family is rich, too.

140
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,640
She’s even good enough
for an imperial relative.

141
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,600
She’s gorgeous?

142
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,920
And she wants an imperial relative?

143
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,040
Bah.

144
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,825
What do you think, Madam?

145
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:15,920
Oh.

146
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,700
Yes. You’re right.

147
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:19,119
I think

148
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,279
we should look for a good man.

149
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,119
Right?

150
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:22,750
Mm.

151
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,839
Butler.

152
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,079
Master.

153
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,480
What’s the noise out there?

154
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,760
Young Master
and Commandery Princess are back.

155
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,359
They’ve brought back many things.

156
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,320
We’re helping them move the things in.

157
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,175
Oh.

158
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:40,200
Mrs. Zhang,

159
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,320
please stay for a moment.

160
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,075
Mm.

161
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,799
Do make yourselves at home.

162
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,519
I’ll go with you, Master.

163
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,279
- All right.
- Enjoy yourselves.

164
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:50,975
Mm.

165
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,640
Master.

166
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,150
Ah?

167
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,239
What kind of relatives are they?

168
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:59,359
They’re not my relatives.

169
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,160
I only know Mr. Zhang.

170
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,880
I didn’t expect his wife and daughter

171
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:04,880
to be like this.

172
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,600
Enough.

173
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,519
They sound quite scary already.

174
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:08,225
Let’s go.

175
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,640
- Mother.
- Mm?

176
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,959
The Commandery Princess.

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,239
I haven’t met one before.

178
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,239
I want to see her.

179
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:15,720
All right.

180
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,920
Let’s go.

181
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:18,160
Go, go, go.

182
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:18,880
Go.

183
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,399
Who’s that?

184
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,480
Li Qian. The eldest young master
of the Li Family.

185
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,720
(Li’s Mansion)
So, he’s Commandant Li’s son.

186
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,359
He looks so handsome.

187
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:43,239
Here it is.

188
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:45,760
You can have a good rest here.

189
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:46,800
Go.

190
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,480
Here we are. Come on in.

191
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,920
Mother,

192
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,480
did you see Li Qian?

193
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,279
He’s such a handsome man.

194
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,320
He rides very well, too.

195
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,399
Did you see how cool he was

196
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,600
when he got off the horse?

197
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,640
I saw that.

198
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,160
But unfortunately,

199
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:04,760
he’s got a wife.

200
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,239
And she’s a Commandery Princess.

201
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,760
It proves that Qian is

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,160
indeed one good man in a thousand.

203
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,040
However,

204
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,480
we all have a cross to bear.

205
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,160
Her Grace

206
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,519
has a weak body.

207
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,559
They’ve been married for months,

208
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,480
but they haven’t consummated yet.

209
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,880
Uncle Li keeps worrying

210
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,080
about Qian’s offspring.

211
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,159
Miss Gao, tell me.

212
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,320
What do you think of my daughter?

213
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Miss Zhang looks pretty and gorgeous.

214
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,479
Everybody will like her.

215
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,799
Daughter,

216
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,400
considering your appearance and talent,

217
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,679
if you marry Li Qian

218
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,000
and have a son in a year or two,

219
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,760
you can take over the Li Family.

220
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,919
How great it will be!

221
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,559
Sounds good.

222
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,280
But I don’t want to be a concubine.

223
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,159
You won’t.

224
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,679
Now that Her Grace can’t consummate,

225
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,359
she can’t be a legal wife.

226
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:17,840
Even when you marry Qian,
you’ll be the second wife.

227
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,640
You won’t be a concubine.

228
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,080
That’s more like it.

229
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:24,960
Madam,

230
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,080
as you saw today,

231
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,599
Her Grace is noble.

232
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,039
She isn’t close to us

233
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,599
and she’s unapproachable.

234
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,320
If Miss Zhang can be my sister-in-law,

235
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,919
I’ll be very happy.

236
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,039
If you need anything,

237
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,719
don’t hesitate to tell me.

238
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,359
I’ll try my best to help.

239
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:46,919
All right.

240
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:49,679
You’re such a sensible girl.

241
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,799
I’ll leave you alone, then.

242
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,039
Take a rest early.

243
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:53,550
Mm.

244
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,440
Thank you, Miss Gao. See you.

245
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,150
- Duolan.
- What?

246
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,400
I’m telling you.

247
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,719
First, you should attract
Li Qian’s attention.

248
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Whenever you’re free,

249
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,880
appear in front of him.

250
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,640
Beautiful as you are,

251
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,799
all men will like you.

252
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,919
You make sense.

253
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,479
All right! Let’s do this.

254
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,520
Liuhe,

255
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,239
are you done making the bed?

256
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,520
Yes, I’m done.

257
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Look how stupid you are.

258
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,200
I want to take a bath.

259
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,200
Get some water for me.

260
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,039
Yes.

261
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,960
Let’s talk about Li Qian.

262
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,599
Ignore her.

263
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,599
- Oh, yes.
- Let’s go.

264
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,559
Let’s talk. You know what?

265
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,750
(Keep Good Moral Character)
Are eggplants ready?

266
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,799
Yes. They’re ready.

267
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,125
We need chicken soup to simmer it.

268
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:41,880
Mm.

269
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,840
Are dishes mostly ready for dinner?

270
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,440
- Excuse me...
- Yes.

271
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,159
Be very careful.
Don’t make any mistakes.

272
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,159
I’m so stupid.

273
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,840
I can’t find the kitchen,

274
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,080
and even ask the way.

275
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,400
Are you all right?

276
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,525
Come on.

277
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,000
Excuse me,

278
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,799
do you know where the kitchen is?

279
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,599
Let me take you there.

280
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,440
- It’s right ahead.
- All right.

281
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,080
Go.

282
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,359
Look, the latrine is in the south.

283
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,400
The kitchen is in the north.

284
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:18,760
The corridors connect
the south and north.

285
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:20,479
If you have any other confusion,

286
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,760
let me know.

287
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,919
Qingke, let me do it myself.

288
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,640
Don’t be shy.

289
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,960
According to Miss Zhang,

290
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,679
she used to have many servants
in her hometown

291
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,799
and you could be helped.

292
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,799
But now you’re all alone

293
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,440
and have to take care of the two.

294
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
It must be hard.

295
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,000
You look young,

296
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,200
but have to worry a lot.

297
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,080
Here.

298
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,320
No.

299
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,960
It’s my luck to serve Madam
and Miss Duolan.

300
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:50,520
Are they nice to you?

301
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes, for sure.

302
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:56,000
Then what about the bruise on your hand?

303
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,200
It’s the shadow
of the candlepower, I guess.

304
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:00,799
There’s no bruise.

305
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,520
Thank you for your concern.

306
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:05,159
In case Madam and Miss
become impatient,

307
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,960
I’m going back first.

308
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,000
When you talk,

309
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,159
you need skills.

310
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,640
If you seduce him directly,

311
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,239
there’ll be no fun.

312
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,799
If you do it too indirectly,

313
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,640
most men can’t understand.

314
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:28,080
Oh.

315
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,799
Mother, you make sense!

316
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,400
Let me have a try.

317
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,025
Mm.

318
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,919
What a coincidence, Qian!

319
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,559
How did I sound?

320
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,000
Come on, Liuhe, listen to me.

321
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,960
There he is.

322
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,640
What a coincidence, Qian!

323
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,760
Qian.

324
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:58,919
Qian!

325
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,960
The provisions
haven’t been distributed yet.

326
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,679
Many soldiers are complaining.

327
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,000
The situation is not good.

328
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,960
Young Master, what do we do?

329
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,559
Master Zhao Xiao takes care
of military supplies.

330
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,280
We can’t interfere.

331
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,440
If there’s any difficulty in the camp,

332
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,359
use some of my private savings.

333
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:19,880
Yes.

334
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,960
Qian.

335
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:24,900
Ouch.

336
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:30,159
Miss Zhang, are you...?

337
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,960
She’s absorbing the essence of earth,

338
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:35,280
namely feeling the earth.

339
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,200
It’s beneficial to beauty and health.

340
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,719
Don’t stand in her way.

341
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,390
Oh.

342
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,520
How about this?

343
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,239
Guard here.

344
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,039
If someone comes,

345
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,599
ask him to go away

346
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:50,039
and not interfere with Miss Zhang.

347
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:51,200
Oh.

348
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,200
Be careful.

349
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,119
Don’t disturb her.

350
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:07,000
I see.

351
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,359
Gosh, I’m exhausted.

352
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:13,400
Who can help me?

353
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:16,599
Miss Gao.

354
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,000
Young Master commanded that

355
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,719
no one should disturb Miss Zhang.

356
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:21,400
Wei Shu,

357
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,479
you know Qian’s temper.

358
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,239
He was just scaring her.

359
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,599
He wouldn’t really torture her.

360
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,559
It’s so cold.

361
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,799
If Miss Zhang stays here,

362
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,119
she’ll catch a cold.

363
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
I’ll leave her to you, then.

364
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,679
Get to your business.

365
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,475
Mm.

366
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,080
Miss Zhang,

367
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,159
let me get you back to your room.

368
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:43,440
Miaorong.

369
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,300
What happened, Miss?

370
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,080
Liuhe!

371
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,679
Where did you go?
What took you so long?

372
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,919
You made me a disgrace!

373
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,479
Miss, you asked me not to follow you.

374
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,559
How dare you talk back!

375
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,039
How dare you find an excuse!

376
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,200
It’s all your fault! Your fault!

377
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,479
My waist.

378
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,400
What bad luck I had!

379
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,100
Ouch.

380
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:10,919
Miaorong,

381
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,119
now I understand.

382
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,239
No one in the Li Family is good!

383
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:16,479
No, no, no.

384
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,000
You’re good. You are.

385
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,280
Don’t blame Qian.

386
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,880
You didn’t see how cruel he was

387
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,239
during the military drill.

388
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,520
He showed

389
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,239
some mercy to you.

390
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,559
Qian doesn’t like others

391
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,760
to play tricks with him.

392
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:38,679
So, it’s no use pretending to be weak.

393
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,000
What kind of girl does he like?

394
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,719
Tell me.

395
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,359
What kind of girl does he like?

396
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,559
He likes Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

397
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,359
If you want to please him,

398
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,559
learn from Her Grace.

399
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,880
No matter what she does,

400
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,919
he loves that.

401
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,039
It’s no big deal!

402
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,159
I’ll go learn from her now.

403
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:03,700
I...

404
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,400
Miss.

405
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,520
Isn’t it inappropriate?

406
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,599
How can you learn
from such a noble princess?

407
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,000
What a traitor you are!

408
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:13,119
Are you discouraging me?

409
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,359
(Elegance and Quietness)

410
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:15,359
(Elegance and Quietness)
No, no.

411
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,599
I just don’t want you

412
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,119
to get unnecessarily hurt.

413
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:21,039
Get hurt?

414
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,760
Why will I get hurt?

415
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,599
You just don’t want me
to live a good life!

416
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,599
Go away!

417
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,760
I’m sorry, Miss.

418
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,400
You asked me to go away.

419
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,520
But where can I go?

420
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,719
Miss Zhang,

421
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,599
don’t get angry for such a little thing.

422
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,320
Miaorong.

423
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,799
Liuhe keeps upsetting me.

424
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,559
Get her out of here!

425
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,559
Stand up.

426
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,119
I’ll find a new place for you.

427
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:59,039
Tonight,

428
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,840
don’t stay to disturb your lady.

429
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,319
Don’t be overcautious.

430
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,000
Live your life here

431
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,079
as you did in Zhang’s Mansion.

432
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,199
As for your lady...

433
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,239
Don’t try to stop her.

434
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:20,560
Let her do whatever she wants.

435
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,439
When she’s happy,

436
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,199
you’ll suffer less.

437
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,079
Besides,

438
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,520
helping others is a good thing

439
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,199
and a blessing.

440
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,520
How great it is!

441
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,000
You’re so young.

442
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:37,079
Don’t be too stubborn or dull.

443
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,760
I’m indeed too dull.

444
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,920
It’s so kind of you, Miss.

445
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,239
Let’s go.

446
00:17:44,975 --> 00:17:45,600
Mm.

447
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,780
(Erudition)

448
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,439
Miss Liuhe,

449
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,079
your lady kicked you out.

450
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,199
You’re poor
when you have nowhere to live.

451
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,000
However,

452
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:08,560
there aren’t too many rooms here.

453
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:12,359
Sorry to have you stay here for days.

454
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,479
Please don’t mind.

455
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,640
If there’s a reason,

456
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,479
it’s only because
I’m not the hostess of the Li Family

457
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:22,920
and I can’t help you too much.

458
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,200
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)

459
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,400
Your Grace, lunch is ready.

460
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,439
Please enjoy it.

461
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,199
What’s going on?

462
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,920
Miss Zhang insists on having lunch here.

463
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,959
We failed to stop her.

464
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,800
It doesn’t matter. Leave us.

465
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,625
Come on.

466
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,280
Your Grace, what took you so long?

467
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,800
Dig in. The dishes are getting cold.

468
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,599
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

469
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,750
Mm.

470
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,350
Liuhe,

471
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,640
go get me another set of tableware.

472
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,479
Liuhe!

473
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,239
What did you say?

474
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,959
Go get me another set of tableware!

475
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,280
Why can’t you even understand?

476
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,920
I’ll go get it.

477
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,719
I’ll go.

478
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,479
You’re so oblivious.

479
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,199
Why haven’t you got dishes for me?

480
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,600
I...

481
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:48,079
Qingke,

482
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,839
take care of Miss Zhang.

483
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,680
Qingke, let me do it.

484
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,599
You’re indeed the Commandery Princess.

485
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:03,520
It’s sensible of you.

486
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,160
You!

487
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:06,959
What?

488
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,760
Miss Zhang, enjoy yourself.

489
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:22,520
What?

490
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,280
She’s done eating?

491
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,079
Her Grace eats very little.

492
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,280
We’ll leave you alone.

493
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,959
Miss Zhang, enjoy yourself.

494
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,680
No, no, no.

495
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:33,000
I’m full, too. Wait for me.

496
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,959
Liuhe, go.

497
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,160
What did she come for?

498
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:11,560
She hasn’t made trouble, anyway.

499
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,359
Let her be.

500
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,959
Oh, my God.

501
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,800
I had meals with Her Grace
the whole day.

502
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,040
I’m starving.

503
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,119
Miss Zhang, how was your learning?

504
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,719
Perfect, without doubt.
I’ve learned everything.

505
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,640
You don’t believe me? Let me show you.

506
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:32,479
Watch.

507
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,920
It’s so hot, Mother!

508
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Be careful.

509
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,199
- Mother!
- Blow it before you drink.

510
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:43,880
It doesn’t count.

511
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,920
Blow it. Blow it.

512
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:46,199
There’s something more.

513
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,280
Let me show you how I paint.

514
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,599
Come on. Let me show you.

515
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,920
What shall I paint?

516
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
Her Grace, then.

517
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:00,959
Looks good.

518
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:02,950
Look.

519
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:06,439
Doesn’t it look like her?

520
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:07,400
Isn’t it great?

521
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,680
I’m starving.

522
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,880
No way. I’ll eat more.

523
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,199
Jiang Baoning,

524
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,000
now that I can’t get him,

525
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,359
I won’t let you have him alone.

526
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,319
I’m giving you a thorn in your side

527
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,280
to torment you.

528
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,239
Your Grace, what did you come for?

529
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,439
I came to visit Mrs. Zhang
and Miss Zhang.

530
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,640
What?

531
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,400
What are you doing here?

532
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:41,775
Oh.

533
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:43,319
Nothing.

534
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,560
I’m just curious

535
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,839
about why you came to visit them.

536
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:49,119
Look. Look.

537
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Do I look like her?

538
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,560
The sickly Commandery Princess.

539
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,800
They’re the guests of the Li Family.

540
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,000
I should treat them with our manners.

541
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,520
It’s getting cold, isn’t it?

542
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
I’m bringing them a quilt

543
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:06,920
and see if they need
more clothes for tomorrow.

544
00:24:12,425 --> 00:24:13,280
Mother, look

545
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,479
- how I’m walking.
- Be careful.

546
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:18,439
What?

547
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,560
You didn’t salute me that day,

548
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,839
and you’re making it up now?

549
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,400
Get up. Get up.

550
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,400
Now that you came,
we’re a family.

551
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,439
Don’t bother about rules.

552
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,160
Make yourself at home.

553
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,680
Be careful.

554
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,280
It’s getting cold in the afternoon.

555
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,239
This guest room faces north.

556
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:41,199
It must be damp and cold.

557
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,079
So I’m bringing you a quilt.

558
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,800
Hope you’ll like it.

559
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,959
This is my care for you as the hostess.

560
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,160
Who knows what she’s up to?

561
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,239
Why is she bringing a quilt?

562
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,640
Don’t talk nonsense.

563
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,800
Qingke,

564
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,160
don’t be rude!

565
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,119
You want Miss Zhang
to make the bed herself?

566
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:03,920
Yeah. I hate it most.

567
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,520
The maid doesn’t behave like one.

568
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,280
- You!
- Qingke!

569
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:15,880
I think

570
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,479
your maid Liuhe

571
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:18,520
does a good job.

572
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,839
I want Qingke to learn from her

573
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,280
so that I can enjoy my life like you.

574
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:24,920
Where’s Liuhe?

575
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,160
Liuhe?

576
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,040
She upset me

577
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,000
and I kicked her out...

578
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:30,599
To boil some hot water.

579
00:25:31,725 --> 00:25:32,350
Oh.

580
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,560
Look, when Liuhe is away,

581
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,719
no one takes care of you.

582
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,920
I’ve got a poor arrangement.

583
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,959
Shall I give you more

584
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:41,119
maids or servants?

585
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,119
- No.
- No, no.

586
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:42,839
Don’t bother.

587
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,040
Liuhe is enough.

588
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,439
It’s getting late.

589
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,839
Your Grace, why don’t you
go get some sleep?

590
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,250
Mm.

591
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,520
Qingke.

592
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,920
Liuhe isn’t in their room.

593
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,079
She must have been kicked out
to some corner for sleep.

594
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,400
It’s autumn.
I don’t want her to catch a cold.

595
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,839
Go ask about it

596
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,839
and see where she is.

597
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,725
Mm.

598
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:22,839
So, you asked me to bring the quilt

599
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,359
not for Miss Zhang,

600
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,839
but for Miss Liuhe.

601
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,680
After you told me about her bruise,

602
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,920
I paid attention to her.

603
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,680
Mm.

604
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,839
Liuhe is quite scared of Zhang Duolan.

605
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,359
Looks like she often tortures Liuhe.

606
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,959
I can’t tolerate that.

607
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,160
All right. Go ask about her.

608
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:39,839
Yes.

609
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,959
What are you thinking about?

610
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:59,280
I’m thinking why Dongzhi isn’t back yet.

611
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,239
It’s been days
since she went to the military camp.

612
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:03,719
She’s quite outgoing.

613
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,199
Sorry to keep you worried.

614
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,800
You don’t worry at all?

615
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,319
Maybe she’ll be back tomorrow.

616
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,760
I’m also worrying about Liuhe.

617
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,079
Liuhe?

618
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,439
Who’s Liuhe?

619
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,319
You keep worrying

620
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,079
about girls.

621
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,760
Why don’t you worry about me?

622
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,520
Why should I worry about you?

623
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
Don’t be jealous.

624
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,920
- I’m at least your...
- Your Grace.

625
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:33,800
Your Grace.

626
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,359
Here.

627
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,520
I found her.

628
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,560
You did?

629
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,599
Let’s go.

630
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,119
Let’s go with the quilt.

631
00:27:39,503 --> 00:27:44,800
(Erudition)

632
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,119
What, Your Grace?

633
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:59,719
If Liuhe is kicked out by her masters

634
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,800
to this place,

635
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,319
after I go in,

636
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,719
won’t she suffer more?

637
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,479
But she has you.

638
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:06,640
Why will she be scared?

639
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,520
When I can’t see or protect Liuhe,

640
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,560
what will they do?

641
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,359
They may lose their temper

642
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,479
on her.

643
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,439
You make sense.

644
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:19,880
Well,

645
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,400
take the quilt in

646
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,839
and put it on her with an excuse.

647
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:26,640
Go, Qingke. You can do it.

648
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,599
You... you...

649
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,479
What’s this?

650
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:57,640
It’s...

651
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,560
It’s useless.

652
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,839
I don’t want to throw it away.

653
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,760
So I want to cover the firewood.

654
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,719
Cover the firewood?

655
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,520
Yeah.

656
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,439
Look, it’s damp at night.

657
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,959
If the firewood gets wet,
it can’t be used.

658
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,880
What a waste, then!

659
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,640
Can’t be used?

660
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,920
So, I brought the quilt here.

661
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,800
I didn’t know you were here, too.

662
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:28,319
How about using the quilt with firewood?

663
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,175
Thank you!

664
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:36,799
Thank Her Grace.

665
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,239
And thank you, Qingke.

666
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,599
You’re not too stupid.

667
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,400
Why didn’t you leave
Mrs. Zhang and her daughter?

668
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
It’s been years.

669
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,680
I’ve taken them as my family.

670
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,280
But they don’t take you as their family.

671
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,839
What a silly girl you are!

672
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,000
What did you do?

673
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,400
Didn’t I ask you not to expose me?

674
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:18,560
You’re not good at lying.

675
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,119
Learn from me later.

676
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,599
Go.

677
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,000
Why am I so sleepy?

678
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,680
Come over.

679
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,575
Tell me.

680
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,439
Where did you go
in the middle of the night?

681
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,920
I...

682
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,040
I found a little cat.

683
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,599
It’s autumn now.

684
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:14,800
I went to build a nest for it.

685
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,920
So late?

686
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,040
I didn’t want it to have a cold.

687
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:26,680
Listen. Can’t you tell any truth?

688
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:30,599
It’s Liuhe.

689
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,920
Liuhe was exiled to the woodshed.

690
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,280
She doesn’t even have a quilt.

691
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,359
So, I was in a hurry to give it to her.

692
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:39,079
Wait, wait.

693
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,800
Look.

694
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,599
It’s such a cold day.

695
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,760
I’ve been waiting for you
until midnight.

696
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,520
Do you think

697
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:46,719
this is appropriate?

698
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:51,520
Don’t only complain about me.

699
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,520
Tell me about you.

700
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:54,599
What happened in the Battalion today?

701
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,920
Anything interesting?

702
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Clever girl.

703
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:04,319
I was on duty today.

704
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,959
The horse of my subordinate was startled

705
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,119
and it rushed into the crowd.

706
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,000
Luckily, no one was hurt
and the horse was all right, too.

707
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,560
But lately, Wei Shu seems...

708
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:47,680
She said she would get up early
and she really did?

709
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,719
Awesome, darling.

710
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,600
Qian.

711
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,100
Ow!

712
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,399
Go check if she’s dead.

713
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,959
If she isn’t, send her back to her room

714
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,000
and ask her mother to watch over her.

715
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:29,479
Yes.

716
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,760
Miss, are you all right?

717
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,040
You just came?

718
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,239
You just came!

719
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:45,760
How dare you!

720
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,439
- Miss Zhang,
- How dare you!

721
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,760
Young Master asked me
to walk you back to your room.

722
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,360
Don’t pretend to be kind!

723
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:06,600
Are you moving or not?

724
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,000
Thank you.

725
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,560
Your Grace, I saw that with my eyes.

726
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I’m serious!

727
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,120
Shame on her.

728
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,479
What are you whispering about?

729
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,175
What happened?

730
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,919
A beautiful girl threw herself into you.

731
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:33,719
What good luck you have!

732
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,840
Your Grace,

733
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
when I was out there,

734
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,000
I was nearly flirted with.

735
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,800
Luckily, I was agile

736
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,679
and she didn’t touch me at all.

737
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,239
I kept myself clean.

738
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:56,040
Your Grace, please defend me.

739
00:35:57,479 --> 00:36:00,159
Fine, I’ll just...

740
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,175
...let you go.

741
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,280
Thank you, Your Grace,

742
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,360
for being generous.

743
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,159
Your Grace, Miss Dong has come.

744
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:11,959
Shanhu?

745
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,840
Sorry to disturb you.

746
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,239
Please forgive me, Commandery Prince.

747
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,600
I’ll leave after giving Her Grace
the invitation.

748
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,840
Shanhu, come on in.

749
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,479
No, thanks.

750
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,560
Fine. What invitation?

751
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:25,840
Have you met Miss Qi Dan,

752
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,679
Mr. Qi’s granddaughter?

753
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:28,760
Not yet.

754
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,239
Miss Qi Dan

755
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,919
is a master
of growing plants in Bingzhou.

756
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,600
She can raise

757
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,000
all kinds of flowers,
however delicate they are.

758
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,959
I’d like to meet her.

759
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,399
Look, my family will hold

760
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,000
the flower feast this year.

761
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,760
Also,

762
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:47,040
it’s my little sister
Dong Zhenzhu’s birthday.

763
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,360
You’re a distinguished guest of mine.

764
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,000
Thank you for inviting me.

765
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,239
That’s right, Baoning.

766
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,840
Go out and meet more friends.

767
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,399
When I’m away,

768
00:36:58,399 --> 00:36:59,959
they can talk to you
and divert you from boredom.

769
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,679
Shanhu is my friend.

770
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,800
She’s well-rounded

771
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,959
and familiar with all families.

772
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:08,120
It’s enough to have her
as my friend in Bingzhou.

773
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,280
You flatter me, Your Grace.

774
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,879
I’m grateful.

775
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,080
Now that I’ve given you the invitation,

776
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,959
I won’t stay

777
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,760
in case of disturbing you.

778
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,639
See you.

779
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,350
Let me walk you out.

780
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:19,925
All right.

781
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:20,959
I’ll walk her out.

782
00:37:26,075 --> 00:37:26,971
Ouch!

783
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:28,560
Miss, I’m sorry.

784
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,719
Why is Qian so merciless?

785
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,919
Qian has gone through wars.

786
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,080
In case of unusual move,

787
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,800
he’s always responsive.

788
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,040
It’s natural.

789
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,879
How is it natural?

790
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:43,000
He doesn’t have a tender heart
for girls at all.

791
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:45,159
He’s just a rude man!

792
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,560
Mother, I don’t want to marry him.

793
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,679
Don’t talk nonsense.

794
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,199
He fights wars with his power.

795
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,320
What’s wrong with being rude?

796
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,520
Think about it.

797
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:54,439
In Bingzhou, who else

798
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,840
can be as good as Li Qian?

799
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,199
Besides Li Qian,

800
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,439
who can be good enough for you?

801
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,159
I think Qian was rude to you

802
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,520
because he didn’t want Her Grace
to hear anything.

803
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,120
Miss Zhang,

804
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,159
next time,

805
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,439
don’t do it in a busy place.

806
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,760
Then Qian will be gentle to you.

807
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,300
Mm.

808
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,199
I get it now.

809
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:17,520
I’m such a beautiful girl.

810
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,679
He wouldn’t really be so rude to me.

811
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:20,560
Yeah.

812
00:38:20,919 --> 00:38:22,120
However daring he is,

813
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,399
he doesn’t dare to hug you in the yard.

814
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:25,075
Mm.

815
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:26,239
Next time,

816
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,840
we must have a careful plan,

817
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,600
instead of rushing carelessly.

818
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,239
Understand?

819
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:31,825
All right.

820
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,000
Can’t you be gentle?

821
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,080
Stupid girl!

822
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,159
Go get the new medicine.

823
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,040
All right.

824
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,280
I’m bleeding.

825
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,239
What? Let me check.

826
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:46,479
I feel sick when I see blood.

827
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:47,399
It’s all right. It’s all right.

828
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:49,719
- I’ll wipe it for you.
- Will I die?

829
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,360
Miss Liuhe, just go.

830
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:53,000
- Yes.
- I’ll wipe it for you.

831
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:53,800
Come on.

832
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,750
It’s no longer bleeding.

833
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,875
(Li’s Mansion)

834
00:38:58,399 --> 00:38:59,639
- Don’t say that.
- Enjoy the tea.

835
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,360
You’re welcome.

836
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,159
Mother,

837
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:03,320
there’s a flower feast
in Dong’s Mansion today.

838
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,439
I’m invited.

839
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,080
I’ll go now
and come back in the afternoon.

840
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:08,080
Flower feast?

841
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,600
All right. I know that.

842
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,840
I hear

843
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,320
young men and ladies

844
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,760
from official families

845
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,239
will attend the feast.

846
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,479
I had planned

847
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:21,360
to let my daughter go there.

848
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,760
But she’s just gone.

849
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,159
I can’t even find her.

850
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:28,479
All young men of official families
will be there?

851
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,679
That’s for sure.

852
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,040
There’ll be fun.

853
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,600
I want to go, too.

854
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,239
Take me with you.

855
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,399
You’re the Commandery Princess.

856
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,679
When you take a relative,

857
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,280
you’re bringing honor to them.

858
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,600
Besides, my daughter

859
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,399
is pretty and generous.

860
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,679
She’ll make you proud.

861
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:55,639
Duolan, have fun with Her Grace.

862
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:56,520
All right, Mother.

863
00:39:56,879 --> 00:39:58,479
Let’s go.

864
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,719
I’m leaving, Mother.

865
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,280
- Go, go, go.
- Let’s go.

866
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,719
Go. Go.

867
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,639
Greetings, Your Grace.

868
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,120
Stand up, please.

869
00:40:12,439 --> 00:40:14,080
So showing off.

870
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,639
Miss, you look so beautiful.

871
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,439
Who are you?

872
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:22,679
You have good taste.

873
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,199
I don’t mean you.

874
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:27,320
I mean this lady.

875
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,950
You!

876
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:31,560
Zhenzhu is my uncle’s youngest daughter.

877
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,399
She’s spoilt.

878
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Please don’t mind.

879
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
You’re so lovely.

880
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:41,760
It looks good.

881
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,439
Do you like it?

882
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,360
Yes.

883
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:45,879
This is for you, Miss.

884
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,159
Thank you.

885
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,399
She’s the youngest girl in your family.

886
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:51,439
But why didn’t I see her before?

887
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,280
Usually,

888
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,600
she goes traveling with her uncle.

889
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,320
So, she’s daring.

890
00:40:59,175 --> 00:41:00,239
I see.

891
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:03,320
She’s a naughty girl
of a business family.

892
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,040
- This way, Your Grace.
- Mm.

893
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,959
Miss Zhang is a distant relative
of the Li Family.

894
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,959
She just came to Bingzhou.

895
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:28,399
Please kindly care for her.

896
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:30,639
Now that she’s your relative,

897
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,040
let her take the seat, then.

898
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,400
Mm.

899
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:39,919
Miss Qi.

900
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:40,479
Mm.

901
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:42,679
You’re the protagonist
of this flower feast.

902
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:44,080
Accompany our guests.

903
00:41:45,725 --> 00:41:46,300
Mm.

904
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:52,399
Now that Her Grace has come,

905
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,840
let’s get started.

906
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,439
Your Grace, in the Imperial Palace,

907
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:02,280
you must have been
fed up with delicacies.

908
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,280
We don’t have expensive dishes.

909
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:06,679
My grandfather likes to grow
flowers and vegetables.

910
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,600
He grew such vegetables.

911
00:42:08,919 --> 00:42:09,800
It’s a simple diet.

912
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,360
Please don’t mind.

913
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,520
You offer such cheap vegetables
for your guests?

914
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:18,639
Even beggars don’t eat them.

915
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,840
This is horseradish,

916
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,520
the best among the top five vegetables.

917
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,000
This kind of vegetable tastes special

918
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,439
and is with high nutritional value.

919
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,320
It’s also a kind of herb.

920
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:33,919
Miss Zhang,

921
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:35,360
can you do something else

922
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,719
instead of complaining?

923
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:40,000
What a naughty girl!

924
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:43,719
Miss Zhenzhu, you’re young,

925
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:46,199
but you know quite a lot. Awesome.

926
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,639
Thank you, Your Grace.

927
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,639
My grandfather got the horseradish
from the mountain.

928
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,239
It can only be cooked
after being grown for five months.

929
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,199
Miss Zhang, don’t only care about
its appearance.

930
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:58,239
When you state it,
you’ll feel different.

931
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,040
All right. I’ll taste it, then.

932
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,399
What the hell is it? Tastes so bitter.

933
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:15,925
Mm.

934
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:19,879
It tastes smooth and delicious.

935
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,399
Compared to it,

936
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:24,679
wild horseradish tastes rough

937
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,600
while the ordinary horseradish

938
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,679
tastes too mild.

939
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,120
It’s quite a good dish.

940
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:33,000
You flatter us, Your Grace.

941
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,879
I find it delicious, too.

942
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:38,840
Why do you think

943
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,919
such vegetables are delicious?

944
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:41,250
I won’t have any!

945
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,600
Don’t bother about her.

946
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:46,639
Let her leave.

947
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,159
Miss Qi,

948
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,199
Miss Zhang is straightforward.

949
00:43:53,439 --> 00:43:54,560
Please forgive her.

950
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,360
It doesn’t matter, Your Grace.

951
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,239
Let’s make a toast to Her Grace.

952
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,600
Enjoy yourselves.

953
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,775
Let’s enjoy the flowers later.

954
00:44:00,775 --> 00:44:01,375
Mm.

955
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:05,159
What kind of people are they?

956
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:06,439
A guest has left the table,

957
00:44:06,439 --> 00:44:07,760
but the hostess doesn’t catch up!

958
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,320
Now that you don’t get me back,

959
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:30,550
I’ll take a walk alone.

960
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,919
You can just enjoy your vegetables.
