27
00:01:58,279 --> 00:01:59,080
Your Grace,

28
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:01,199
do you have any solid evidence

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,559
to prove Nanny Tian is the thief?

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,559
Xiaoman, take her in.

31
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,400
Yes.

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,320
Kneel.

33
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:16,000
Greetings, Master, Madam.

34
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,759
Your Grace, Miss Li.

35
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:22,399
Aren’t you Nanny Tian’s foster daughter,
Jiaoxing,

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,600
who serves tea in Father’s study?

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes, I am.

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,800
Jiaoxing, tell us everything you know.

39
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,800
Her Grace is here. Don’t be afraid.

40
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:35,440
I lost my parents when I was little.

41
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,720
I became homeless.

42
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,559
When I first came,

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,679
the servants often bullied me.

44
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,800
Nanny Tian took pity on me.

45
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,960
She punished them

46
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,479
for my sake

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,839
and also adopted me.

48
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,360
She helped me in every way

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,679
and promised to marry me to a good man.

50
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,360
I thought she was honest with her care,

51
00:02:57,679 --> 00:03:00,520
however, her ultimate purpose

52
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,800
is to steal from the mansion through me.

53
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,520
Jiaoxing, you’re like my own daughter!

54
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,320
How could you be so ungrateful?

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,559
Aren’t you afraid of retribution?

56
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:10,279
Be quiet!

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,800
How dare you!

58
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:14,720
Keep talking.

59
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,559
Nanny Tian is a gambling addict.

60
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,240
Later, she gambled a lot

61
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,559
and seldom won.

62
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,279
Thus, she’s in enormous debt.

63
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,919
To pay up for the debt,

64
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,639
she took advantage of Miss Li’s absence

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,119
and sold a lot of precious things

66
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,800
in her chamber.

67
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,759
Then she dared not steal more

68
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,960
in case someone found out.

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,839
So she figured out another way.

70
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:40,119
Many people would pay a handsome price

71
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,960
for information from our mansion.

72
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,320
So she forced me

73
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,679
to steal official files
from Master’s study,

74
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,039
in exchange for pocket money.

75
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,080
You’re lying!

76
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,199
If I didn’t do it,

77
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,639
Nanny Tian would marry me

78
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,320
to her retarded son.

79
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,080
That’s outrageous!

80
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,639
How could we have such a vicious maid
in the family?

81
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,160
Anything else except thievery?

82
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,440
Nanny Tian,

83
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,360
Madam has been generous to you.

84
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,000
Is that how you show

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,440
your gratitude to her?

86
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,600
I can’t believe

87
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,480
you’re such a rotten woman.

88
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,239
You’re senior in age.

89
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,119
How could you do such a thing?

90
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,160
Hurry, take her out.

91
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,700
Yes.

92
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,425
- Yes.
- Quickly.

93
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,279
Take her out, go!

94
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,399
Get up!

95
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,200
Madam!

96
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,959
- What a shame!
- Madam, I’m sorry!

97
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,720
Madam!

98
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,025
What a shame on our family!

99
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:35,750
Madam!

100
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,850
- Gladly today
- Madam!

101
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,525
- Her Grace found the truth,
- Madam, I’m genuinely sorry.

102
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,160
otherwise, it’d lead to a huge disaster.

103
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:46,920
Miaorong,

104
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,000
we have an infamous thief in the house.

105
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
You’re such a disappointment!

106
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,320
Uncle Li...

107
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,040
Enough!

108
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,880
From now on,

109
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,880
Her Grace takes over all family affairs.

110
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:02,480
It’s time to restore integrity
in the family.

111
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,359
Your Grace.

112
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,760
That was impressive.

113
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,040
You’re the woman in charge now.

114
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,239
I’m sure you must feel triumphant.

115
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,839
You and my husband grew up together.

116
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,440
I have no intention of offending you.

117
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,079
But Miss Gao, you’d better stop it.

118
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,239
Don’t cross the line again.

119
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,559
Your Grace,

120
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,839
you’re powerful and decisive.

121
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,239
How dare I say no to you?

122
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:43,519
You gained control of the house so soon.

123
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,920
One day if I annoy you,

124
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,760
will you kick me out of the house

125
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,239
like what happened to Nanny Tian?

126
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,239
We choose our own paths.

127
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,839
And respect is earned.

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,440
To stay or go,
it depends on what you do.

129
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,679
Miss,

130
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,200
Mr. Li is here.

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,839
Qian, you’re back.

132
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,000
Just now...

133
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,440
I already know what happened,

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,839
and I heard your conversation
with my wife.

135
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,600
I’m shocked

136
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,399
by your terrible manners
when I’m not around.

137
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,720
It’s not like that, Qian.

138
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,679
I’ve always wanted to be friendly.

139
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,279
But Her Grace...

140
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,200
She’s always on guard against me.

141
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,880
Aren’t you venting on Her Grace

142
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,640
because of your failure

143
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,799
in instigating trouble?

144
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
I dare not, Qian...

145
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,200
I think you do.

146
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,839
Qian,

147
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,959
am I such a wicked person

148
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,799
in your eyes now?

149
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,679
Perhaps that’s who you are.

150
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,320
It’s just I failed to see your nature.

151
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,119
Qian!

152
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,799
Miaorong, weeping is bad for health.

153
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,119
Since we were children,

154
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,640
Qian had never

155
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,519
talked to me like that.

156
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:11,839
He’s already married.

157
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,040
He has a woman he wants to protect.

158
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,119
No.

159
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,799
He’s not like that.

160
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,720
He’s bewitched by Jiang Baoning.

161
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,920
It’s temporary.

162
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,640
There’ll be a day...

163
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,200
There’ll be a day when he realizes

164
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,519
who the most important woman
in his life is.

165
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,600
You’re really not going to let her in?

166
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,679
My little sister

167
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:00,959
is a simple girl.

168
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,320
The revelation about her nanny’s doing

169
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,640
is a big blow to her.

170
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,519
Defending her nanny

171
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,839
for old time’s sake,

172
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,720
your sister is a loving girl.

173
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,720
But she has to know
what’s right or wrong.

174
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,440
If someone takes advantage of it,

175
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,880
she’s the one
to take the responsibility.

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,320
Yes, you’re quite right, my darling.

177
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,880
We have to

178
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
let the silly girl stand
a little longer outside.

179
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:28,959
Get Miss Li in.

180
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,079
Yes.

181
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,840
Miss Li.

182
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:37,599
Hey,

183
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,640
what are you waiting for?

184
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,159
Your sister-in-law has
something to tell you.

185
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:41,440
Come on in.

186
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,880
Baoning.

187
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:00,479
Baoning, I’m sorry.

188
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,760
It’s my fault.

189
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,599
I crossed the line and offended you.

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,159
For the sake

191
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,799
that I admit my mistake,

192
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,880
please don’t be angry with me.

193
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,679
I’m not really angry.

194
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,440
Really?

195
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,239
Well, I learned from my husband

196
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,640
that my sister-in-law is a heroine

197
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,799
with distinguished martial skills
and courage.

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,239
She was just deceived
by people close to her.

199
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:27,559
Baoning, it won’t happen again.

200
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,500
Baoning, are you serious
about me being a heroine?

201
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,239
Mm-hmm.

202
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,679
Don’t you find it weird for a girl

203
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:33,679
to dress in men’s garment?

204
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,960
It’s not weird at all.

205
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,679
Back when I lived in the palace...

206
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,039
Baoning,

207
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,400
what do you like about my brother?

208
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,400
He’s not good enough for you.

209
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,919
Actually, it’s against my will.

210
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,239
I was abducted.

211
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:54,900
Huh?

212
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,760
Seriously?

213
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,239
Let me tell you.

214
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:02,159
My brother was headstrong
when we were little.

215
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,000
He always got what he wanted.

216
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,000
He’d never let go of a piece of meat.

217
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,719
I never thought he’d dare mistreat you.

218
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:08,280
Mm-hmm.

219
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,239
Baoning, don’t worry.

220
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,440
I’ll take it out for you.

221
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,446
Mm-hmm.

222
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:12,679
Li Qian...

223
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,000
Li Dongzhi.

224
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:14,760
Brother.

225
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:15,919
I should have kicked you out.

226
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,239
- Then you wouldn’t have badmouthed me.
- I’m sorry.

227
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:18,135
- Right? Out!
- Baoning!

228
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:18,919
Baoning!

229
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,080
- Get out!
- Dongdong, Dong...

230
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,760
Unbelievable.

231
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,799
You were abducted, huh?

232
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,479
Not really.

233
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,599
It was against your will
to marry me, huh?

234
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:28,280
No, no.

235
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,200
Stop right there!

236
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:32,119
- Explain it.
- Listen to me.

237
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,960
Jiang Baoning, tell me what it means.

238
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,550
I mean...

239
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,840
- I want an explanation today.
- I’ll listen to you.

240
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,025
Explain what?

241
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,119
Qian has never laughed so happily.

242
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:41,880
Jiang Baoning, come to me.

243
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,200
I guess it’s not a bad thing

244
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:45,960
to have a sister-in-law.

245
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:50,200
These servants are carefully chosen

246
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,640
according to your requirements.

247
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,760
Though many servants are dismissed,

248
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,520
once these servants are in position,

249
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,080
they’ll learn the rules
in just half a day

250
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,599
and start working.

251
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,599
I’m right to trust you, Miss Dong.

252
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,400
I’d like to take this opportunity

253
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,760
to impress Your Grace.

254
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:08,840
Your Grace, pick from them.

255
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,159
If you like someone,

256
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:12,280
write her name down.

257
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,760
I trust your choices.

258
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,039
The girls here

259
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,320
must be the best.

260
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,719
We’re short of hands. They all can stay.

261
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,159
Alright.

262
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,640
No stealing.

263
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,200
No fighting in the house.

264
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,799
No drinking in private.

265
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,559
No gambling.

266
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Know your duty and no passing bucks.

267
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,960
There will be reward and punishment.

268
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,200
Doubled wage for those
who serve for 5 years.

269
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,880
Diligent and loyal servants

270
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,440
will be removed from slavery
after ten years’ service.

271
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,919
Her Grace really impressed me.

272
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,440
The palace taught her well.

273
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,679
I heard

274
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:55,000
Her Grace made new house rules

275
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,799
and had every servant memorize them.

276
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,760
There’ll be an assessment
every other month.

277
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,200
Those who fail

278
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,000
will be dismissed forever.

279
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:06,000
What a mess she’s

280
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,000
made of our house?

281
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,599
It’s a different time.

282
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,825
Our families are no longer

283
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,400
bandits in mountains.

284
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,760
We do need a set of rules.

285
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,840
Or how can we manage the servants?

286
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,159
By the way,

287
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,799
a word to you.

288
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:23,475
What?

289
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:25,599
Stop thinking about getting the jewels

290
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:26,679
in stores home.

291
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,239
Look at the jewelry you’re wearing.

292
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,719
Aren’t you afraid
you’ll sprain your neck?

293
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,159
No, I’m not! What are you gonna do?

294
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,840
It makes me happy.
None of your business.

295
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,440
I...

296
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,840
Try to learn from Her Grace.

297
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,479
What did I say wrong?

298
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,919
Look at the house under her control.

299
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:53,599
I’m satisfied with these servants.

300
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:54,880
Greetings, Your Grace.

301
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,799
It’s a relief at last.

302
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,200
Your Grace.

303
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Those servants switched sides

304
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,919
in such a short period of time.

305
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:03,039
You were once

306
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,599
like their mistress.

307
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,200
And now they don’t

308
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,880
even greet you when they see you.

309
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,679
Madam,

310
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,479
it’s this month’s revenue from usury.

311
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,479
Take it.

312
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:27,400
Miaorong,

313
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:30,200
why are there 300 taels
more than last month?

314
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:31,760
Madam,

315
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:33,799
except for your share,

316
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,359
the rest is a little gesture from me.

317
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,559
Good girl.

318
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,880
Last time,

319
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,239
our business was nearly
affected by Nanny Tian.

320
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:43,840
Thanks to your decisiveness,

321
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,239
or the business would be exposed.

322
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,559
Servants on our side

323
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,799
are all dismissed by Jiang Baoning.

324
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:52,039
If Uncle Li finds out about this,

325
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,080
we’ll lose the last means of income.

326
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,799
Stop.

327
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:58,799
Since Jiang Baoning took over
family affairs,

328
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,960
Master has been treating me
worse and worse.

329
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,880
He praises her intelligence

330
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,440
and calls me a stupid pig.

331
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,039
I think Jiang Baoning

332
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,919
was born to curse me.

333
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,119
Madam,

334
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,039
Uncle Li and Qian are both men.

335
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:15,039
Men know little about house management.

336
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,359
But now we’re facing a huge deficit.

337
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:20,679
Madam,

338
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,599
you have to make a long-term plan
for the family.

339
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,919
The usury income

340
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,119
is just a small amount.

341
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,679
Miaorong,

342
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,280
do you know other ways to make money?

343
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,760
Madam,

344
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:37,919
if you trust me,

345
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,559
I do know another way.

346
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,559
Yes, I do.

347
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,919
You’re the smartest.

348
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,239
I can trust you with everything.

349
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:46,520
Thank you, Madam.

350
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,640
Uncle.

351
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,640
Miaorong,

352
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,880
I left the family affairs to you
in these years

353
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,440
because I trusted you.

354
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,919
How could you collude with servants

355
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,640
to conduct usury?

356
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,000
Before Master finds out,

357
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,919
stop it.

358
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,799
Or you can wait

359
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:34,880
to be driven out of the mansion.

360
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,840
Uncle,

361
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:43,280
I’m not doing all these

362
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,239
for my own interest,

363
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,039
but for the Li family.

364
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,919
I know you couldn’t understand.

365
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,840
But give me some time.

366
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,320
I will prove with facts

367
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,520
that I’m the biggest help to the Li’s.

368
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,640
Miaorong,

369
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:12,039
are you jealous of Her Grace

370
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,159
because Qian abandoned you

371
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,280
and married her?

372
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:19,880
Uncle,

373
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:21,719
am I such a petty woman

374
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,799
in your mind?

375
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,159
You’ve been Uncle Li’s follower
for years.

376
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,919
You know Uncle Li’s ambition.

377
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,159
Qian is a talented man.

378
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,479
He’d never be satisfied with

379
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:33,679
this tiny fish pond of Bingzhou.

380
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,440
Uncle,

381
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,200
please believe me.

382
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:40,760
When have I ever let you down?

383
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,799
You’re thinking
about an underground bank?

384
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,359
Lin,

385
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,640
only through an underground bank

386
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,039
can we get a steady stream of wealth.

387
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:03,479
Lin,

388
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,920
I seldom ask you for anything.

389
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,000
As you know,

390
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,479
since Princess Jia’nan came in charge,

391
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,000
all the servants have been loyal to her.

392
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,959
All my moves are under watch.

393
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,760
In this case,

394
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,959
I won’t have a place

395
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,079
in this big mansion soon.

396
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:21,959
My uncle is a kind person.

397
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,359
What you’re worried about won’t happen.

398
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,880
Lin,

399
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,880
in terms of seniority,

400
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,920
you’re the eldest son of the family.

401
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,680
But now,

402
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,239
you’re doing a servant’s job

403
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,040
and helping Uncle Li and your cousin
manage the chores.

404
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,000
Are you

405
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,479
willing to live under their roof?

406
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,280
Actually,

407
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,040
I think,

408
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,680
Lin,

409
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:06,640
it’s time you make a plan

410
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,199
for your future.

411
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,640
Where does this kite come from?

412
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,760
Madam, Miss Li.

413
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,439
Oh, it is her.

414
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,319
Yes.

415
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:32,560
Miss Li.

416
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,040
How did she get to the roof?

417
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:35,760
Li Dongzhi!

418
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,959
Come down from there!

419
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:38,599
Mother!

420
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,239
Are you going to tear the roof

421
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:41,520
off the house?

422
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,760
Get down quickly!

423
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,520
Or you’ll be sorry!

424
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:48,079
Hurry up, do you hear me?

425
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,160
Hey, don’t run!

426
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,520
Don’t run away!

427
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,439
Miss Li, get down, please.

428
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,079
Stop! Come back!

429
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,239
Madam! Madam!

430
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,079
You... you get down now!

431
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,439
Hurry up!

432
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,439
Stop right there!

433
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,040
Where do you think you’re going?

434
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,479
- My kite!
- Leave it.

435
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:14,079
Stop! Look at the way you’re dressed.

436
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,079
Mother, let me redo your hair.

437
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,599
It’s a mess because of you.

438
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,880
Are you trying to kill me
by exhausting me?

439
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,599
Listen, right now,

440
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,400
take her to change clothes.

441
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,000
(Farm and Study)
- Yes. - I’m exhausted.

442
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,199
- Miss!
- How dare you?

443
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,400
Stop right there!

444
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,839
If you didn’t ask me out today,

445
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,599
I’d have invited you out for a drink.

446
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,520
Thank you for helping me at the wedding

447
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,079
in your mansion.

448
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:39,000
Here’s a toast to you.

449
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,040
You’re welcome, Cai.

450
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,560
You’re good at arithmetic.

451
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,719
You manage the finance of the garrison.

452
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,719
I found it overwhelming just to manage

453
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,839
house chores.

454
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:55,439
I’d like to learn from you
in the future.

455
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:58,239
Mr. Li, this isn’t

456
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,719
what you asked me out for, is it?

457
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,000
I invited you out today

458
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,400
to talk about a lucrative business.

459
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,280
Tell me about it.

460
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,680
I want to put the soldiers’ pay
in an underground bank

461
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,199
to produce interest.

462
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,439
That’s the military budget.

463
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,239
This is a great opportunity for us.

464
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,640
As long as you’re willing to help,

465
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,920
in a few days,

466
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,760
there’ll be a large number
of silver taels

467
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,199
going into your pocket.

468
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,359
Cai, your future

469
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:38,119
will be beyond imagination.

470
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,239
Madam,

471
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,439
here are 20,000 taels of silver.

472
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,160
Please check it.

473
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,719
So many.

474
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,400
As you know,

475
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,079
our small bank

476
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:59,439
can only make a little pocket money

477
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:00,680
for the madams and ladies.

478
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,599
Madam, you’re a successful banker.

479
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Everyone in Bingzhou knows
you’re good at what you do.

480
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,599
These are the first deposit.

481
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,920
There’ll be more coming in.

482
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,000
More?

483
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:19,000
What? You don’t like the money?

484
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,000
Well,

485
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,400
if you cannot take such a large sum,

486
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:26,839
I’ll inquire of the Dong’s.

487
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,040
I can’t take it?

488
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,719
No matter how much you can give me,

489
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,119
I’ll take it.

490
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:39,640
Well, I’ll take that as a yes.

491
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:49,680
Dried fruit and peanuts!

492
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,959
Hey, make way, move!

493
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,160
Dongdong!

494
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:03,825
Hi,

495
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,000
Shanhu!

496
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,599
Where are you going?

497
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,359
I’ve just finished work at the store.

498
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,959
Now I’m going
to check around Qinfang Pavilion.

499
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:16,199
Qinfang Pavilion?

500
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,239
Take a look!

501
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:19,359
The biggest brothel in Bingzhou?

502
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,280
Little girl,

503
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:23,450
you know too much for your age.

504
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:24,950
You’re not much older than me.

505
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,119
Don’t treat me like a child.

506
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,319
Shanhu,

507
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,640
I never drink wine in a brothel.

508
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:33,280
Can you take me with you?

509
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,479
Absolutely no.

510
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,880
If your mother finds out,

511
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,199
she’ll eat me alive.

512
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:43,275
Take a look.

513
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:44,640
- Don’t worry, Shanhu.
- Take care.

514
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,959
My mother can’t do anything about me.

515
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,400
Go!

516
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,744
(Qinfang Pavilion)

517
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,950
Alright, put it here.

518
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,900
(Qinfang Pavilion)

519
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:12,040
Miss Dong, we’re looking forward to you.

520
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,599
Mr. Zhang is waiting to report to you.

521
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,950
(Singing Phoenixes and Dancing Fairies)

522
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,400
Who is this young master?

523
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,040
He’s so handsome.

524
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,199
This is a distant…

525
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,400
cousin of mine.

526
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,400
Oh.

527
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,719
He just came. So I took him out for fun.

528
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:28,419
Mm-hmm.

529
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,225
Dongdong.

530
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:30,850
Please come in.

531
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,719
I’m going upstairs to audit the account.

532
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,119
Are you going to be fine

533
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,319
to be left alone?

534
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:37,000
Go ahead, Shanhu. Don’t worry about me.

535
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,600
Mm-hmm.

536
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,079
This way, please.

537
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:00,000
Sir,

538
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:01,880
nice to meet you.

539
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,350
Do you want me to keep you company?

540
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:05,239
No, thanks.

541
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:06,719
Sir,

542
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,079
where are you going?

543
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,199
Don’t go.

544
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,479
Don’t go, sir.

545
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:12,920
You have fair skin.

546
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,119
More tender than our girls.

547
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,079
Let me see.

548
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,479
I’m no better than you.

549
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:19,425
So handsome.

550
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:20,560
He’s shy.

551
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,160
Leave us.

552
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,125
How generous!

553
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:27,625
Come on.

554
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:28,600
Alright, let’s go upstairs.

555
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,200
Come on.

556
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,239
(Qing An)
Is this your first time in a brothel?

557
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,319
That’s right.

558
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,400
You’re not here
just for a drink, are you?

559
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,725
Huh?

560
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,225
No.

561
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,680
Come.

562
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,239
Sit.

563
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,319
Man,

564
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,839
there’s a first time for everything.

565
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,719
I can totally understand

566
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,199
how you feel.

567
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,359
Here.

568
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:04,359
Since you’re not here just for a drink,

569
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,680
you have to make yourself comfortable.

570
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:08,479
Drink up.

571
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,319
Look,

572
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,199
the girl in red and the girl in yellow,

573
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:29,280
- which is prettier?
- Don’t.

574
00:25:30,225 --> 00:25:31,075
Come on.

575
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,175
The one in red?

576
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:35,000
Good eye.

577
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:37,880
The girl in red is the most popular
courtesan here.

578
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,560
A real beauty.

579
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:42,359
Jade-like shape, snow-like skin,

580
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:43,750
- blooming face,
- Look.

581
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,250
and willow-like posture.

582
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:53,950
Go.

583
00:25:56,225 --> 00:25:57,697
How could I lie to you?

584
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:00,975
Hey.

585
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,900
Am I pretty?

586
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,520
Yes.

587
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,560
You’re… gorgeous.

588
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,920
Then get a little closer.

589
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:14,560
Take a good look.

590
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,760
I... I...

591
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,719
saw you clearly.

592
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:29,160
Man, how could you wimp out in a pinch?

593
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,000
The beauty takes a fancy to you.

594
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,756
You’re a good drinker, sir.

595
00:26:34,756 --> 00:26:35,760
Come on. One more cup.

596
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,400
Man.

597
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,200
I’ll give you a big reward.

598
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,600
Is the girl in red beautiful?

599
00:26:41,025 --> 00:26:41,625
Huh?

600
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,599
One more. One more.

601
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:43,199
Yes.

602
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,439
Then do you know
she’s someone else’s girl?

603
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,350
Huh?

604
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,880
She is?

605
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,319
She’s my girl!

606
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,319
How dare you
set your filthy eyes on her?

607
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,959
We’re in a brothel.

608
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,479
Why can’t we look at her?

609
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,839
Right.

610
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:58,640
That’s so domineering of you.

611
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,839
Alright, alright.

612
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,680
You’re dead meat.

613
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,119
You don’t know what you’re doing!

614
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:02,880
Somebody!

615
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:05,600
Yes.

616
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,119
Brothers!

617
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,319
Let’s go!

618
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,959
- Boss!
- He kicked me. Get him!

619
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:15,000
Go! Stop!

620
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
- This way!
- Stop!

621
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:22,100
Candied haws!

622
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,680
- Stop!
- Stop right there!

623
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,599
This way!

624
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,079
Come on!

625
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,160
- Stop!
- Excuse me!

626
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,119
Stop!

627
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,680
Stop!

628
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:40,760
Make way!

629
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,680
Don’t run!

630
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,640
Move!

631
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:46,359
Run!

632
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,839
Excuse me, please!

633
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,275
Come.

634
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:53,959
Where are they?

635
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:54,479
Come here.

636
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:55,125
Get him!

637
00:27:55,575 --> 00:27:56,325
- Yes.
- Go!

638
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,280
Don’t let him get away! Go!

639
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,225
Candied haws!

640
00:28:04,575 --> 00:28:05,250
Sure!

641
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,400
Pendants!

642
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,680
Over there.

643
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:16,599
Go.

644
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,040
Get them!

645
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:20,825
Hurry!

646
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,680
Up.

647
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:28,680
Let’s go.

648
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:35,125
- Hurry!
- Over here!

649
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,839
- There they are! Come!
- Over here!

650
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:37,625
Stop!

651
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:38,500
- Go!
- Seize him!

652
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,520
What are you waiting for? Kick him!

653
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,079
Come on!

654
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:54,760
Excuse me!

655
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:57,199
Go after them!

656
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:58,000
Go, go!

657
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,350
(Fragrance Bath)

658
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,359
Why...

659
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,880
Why did you take me here?

660
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,000
It’s crowded and steamy here.

661
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,560
They’ll never find us.

662
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,640
No, no, no.

663
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,439
I’d rather hide somewhere outside.

664
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:15,119
Hey, man.

665
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,359
Come on.

666
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,275
Come here.

667
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,475
There they are!

668
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:40,560
What’s your problem?

669
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,119
Get out
if you’re not here to take a bath.

670
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:43,800
Boss, I didn’t find them.

671
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,199
Maybe they’re not here.

672
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,359
Shall we get out of here?

673
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,800
Nobody wants to see you naked.

674
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,199
Gross!

675
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,040
Sorry, I forgot.

676
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,280
They’re gone?

677
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,680
What are you doing?

678
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,439
Taking a bath.

679
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,959
After the long run, isn’t it about time
to take a bath?

680
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:22,880
Join me.

681
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,439
No, thanks.

682
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,680
Come on. You’re blushing due to heat.

683
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,119
Come and have a bath.

684
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,680
You’ll have a heatstroke.

685
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,359
Take off your clothes.

686
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,839
I’m injured.

687
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:34,920
I can’t take a bath or get in the water.

688
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:36,400
Take your time.

689
00:30:36,975 --> 00:30:37,500
Hey,

690
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:39,280
I won’t bathe either.

691
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,800
We’re brothers now after the fight.

692
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,400
Hey, wait for me.

693
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,800
Bravo!

694
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,645
Fantastic!

695
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:48,880
Bravo!

696
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:50,839
Great!

697
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,199
Baoning, are you alright?

698
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,719
Yes, it’s just a kid.

699
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,119
Why is it so bustling
on the street tonight?

700
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,520
It’s the night market on the first day
of each month.

701
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,239
It’s an old tradition of Bingzhou.

702
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,119
Today is my day off.

703
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:08,280
So I want to take you out and relax.

704
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:10,560
Recently,

705
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,239
you’ve been busy with house chores.

706
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,439
It must be hard for you.

707
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,680
You know I’ve had a hard time?

708
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,520
So?

709
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,150
So many people are watching.

710
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,875
Let’s keep going.

711
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,280
Here.

712
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:48,319
I’m sorry, buddy.

713
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:50,119
I ruined your great day.

714
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,800
Don’t make fun of me.

715
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,560
Cheers!

716
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:04,560
My name is Li Dongzhi.

717
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,000
And I’m turning 19 years old.

718
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:09,119
Judging by your look and clothes,

719
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,599
you’re not from here, are you?

720
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,239
Qing An,

721
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:15,760
a merchant who travels
between Yongqing and Mu’an.

722
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,400
Mm-hmm.

723
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,359
My father is from Yongqing State.

724
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,520
My mother is from Mu’an State.

725
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,000
I’m a few years older than you.

726
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:23,000
Look, you can call me An.

727
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,079
Are you married, An?

728
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,719
We’re in a troubled time.

729
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,680
Traveling alone in the world,

730
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:34,160
sometimes I can’t afford a meal.

731
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:36,800
Why drag someone into my suffering?

732
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,700
Mm-hmm.

733
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,199
Don’t you want an heir

734
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,680
to pass on your business?

735
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:47,239
We were born without material property

736
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,920
and we can’t take anything when we die.

737
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,319
No matter how much land

738
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:53,040
or how many estates a man has,

739
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,920
he can only eat three meals a day
and sleep in one bed at night.

740
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,280
My offspring

741
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,680
might worship a tablet with my name on

742
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,400
in the ancestral hall.

743
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,359
But by then, I’d have become
a handful of loess,

744
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,479
why would I care about the worship?

745
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,719
Well said.

746
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,160
What you said is inspiring.

747
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,599
I wish we could meet earlier.

748
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,640
Well, you don’t want to get married,
either?

749
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,079
You’re right.

750
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,839
My mother has been urging me every day.

751
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:24,040
I never thought about it.

752
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,719
So I’m quite against it.

753
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:27,359
Besides, I think I’m still young.

754
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,079
There are lots of important things
for me to do.

755
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,560
When I get married,

756
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,439
it’s like I’m tied up at home.

757
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:33,319
I won’t be able to go anywhere.

758
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:37,280
Does your mother want you
to marry a shrew

759
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,599
who’ll lock you at home every day?

760
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:42,760
We’re men.

761
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:43,959
Even if we’re married,

762
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,775
how could we get trapped at home

763
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:46,675
and let time slip by?

764
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:47,300
Mm-hmm.

765
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,359
That’s right.

766
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,175
Mm-hmm.

767
00:33:54,975 --> 00:33:55,807
Right here?

768
00:33:55,807 --> 00:33:56,375
Sure.

769
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,280
In the old days,

770
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,760
fishermen would put candles

771
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:13,360
and offerings on a sailboat
made of colored paper

772
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,800
and leave it to drift about at sea

773
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,199
and pray to the god of the ocean
for safe sailing.

774
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,120
I used to believe

775
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,040
it’s superstition.

776
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,120
But now I can understand.

777
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,479
I would pray to the Buddha and gods

778
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,719
as long as the people I love

779
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,520
can be safe.

780
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,679
River lantern, river lantern,

781
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,800
if you carry the blessings of gods,

782
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,399
please keep Mu’an State

783
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:53,360
free from warfare.

784
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:54,425
It’s coming.

785
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,120
I pray for a lifetime of happiness

786
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,679
with my beloved.

787
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:21,250
(Bamboo Sways in Wind)

788
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,280
Madam Dong’s birthday banquet.

789
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,800
The invitation just came in.

790
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,479
There’ll be a grand banquet
at Dong’s Mansion.

791
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:46,800
Many guests are invited.

792
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,360
If you don’t want to go,

793
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:51,080
just make an excuse that you can’t go.

794
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,520
But Dong Shanhu

795
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,000
did our family a great favor.

796
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,959
It’s Madam Dong’s birthday.

797
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:57,639
It’s ungrateful if I refuse to go.

798
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,360
Anyway, I’ve already given them a reply

799
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,280
that I’ll attend it.

800
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,479
If you feel uneasy about it,

801
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,919
I can go with you.

802
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,439
That’s an event for women.

803
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,360
It’s not appropriate for you to go.

804
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,760
Don’t worry. I can handle it.

805
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,040
Your Grace,
Madam’s maid comes with a word

806
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,479
that she wants you to take Miss Li

807
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:17,120
to Madam Dong’s birthday banquet.

808
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,080
Mother isn’t going?

809
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,800
My mother

810
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,879
loathes such events.

811
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,320
The purpose she wants you
to take Dongzhi along

812
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,600
is probably to take this opportunity

813
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,800
to hunt for eligible men for Dongzhi.

814
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,120
Take her with you.

815
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
She fights well.

816
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,000
If you’re in danger,

817
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,479
she can protect you.

818
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,080
You’re a terrible brother.

819
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,760
Dongdong is your sister.

820
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:42,080
She has come of age.

821
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:44,360
If you meet a perfect man for her,

822
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,639
as her sister-in-law,

823
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,719
you’ll help her out, won’t you?

824
00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:50,050
I... I...

825
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,199
I’m not going.

826
00:36:58,879 --> 00:36:59,879
Dongdong,

827
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,159
you’re my flesh and blood.

828
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,520
Those snobbish women

829
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,479
despise me.

830
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,360
Or I wouldn’t have been so brazen

831
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,800
as to beg your sister-in-law
to take you with her.

832
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,120
If you go with her,

833
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,040
the matchmakers

834
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,239
will recommend some good men to you.

835
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:19,239
Look, you hate such occasions too.

836
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,479
Why do you have to make me go?

837
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,159
Besides, I said I don’t want
to get married.

838
00:37:22,919 --> 00:37:24,399
You don’t want to get married?

839
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:25,800
Do you think you’re still a child?

840
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:26,959
When you want to get married,

841
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:27,879
do you think there’d be a line

842
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:30,040
of good men waiting
for your good graces?

843
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,600
I’m telling you now.

844
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,840
You are going.

845
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,439
Quit standing there.

846
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,800
Take her to change.

847
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:36,800
- No.
- Yes.

848
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:39,719
Miss! Miss!

849
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:40,919
I’ll hang myself!

850
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,919
- Miss! Miss!
- Miss!

851
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:43,800
Li Dongzhi!

852
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,825
Hey!

853
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:48,600
Fine.

854
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,639
I’ll change, alright?

855
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:51,719
Go now!

856
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:53,879
Come, Miss.

857
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,150
Let me see.

858
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:03,520
You’re a natural beauty
in women’s clothes,

859
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,320
no worse than any of the noble ladies.

860
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,560
Look at your face.

861
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,080
Alright, sit down.

862
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,879
I’ll put some make-up on you.

863
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,050
Go get the Unifon Her Grace gave me.

864
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:20,875
Let me tell you.

865
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,025
(Unifon)

866
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:24,320
The Unifon

867
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,040
is for the royal family only.

868
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,875
I only use it on special occasions.

869
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,000
Today,

870
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,250
I’m going to perform magic on you.

871
00:38:34,325 --> 00:38:35,085
- Mother,
- Alright.

872
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,325
isn’t it a waste

873
00:38:36,325 --> 00:38:37,950
to apply it on my face?

874
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,500
Who says it’s a waste?

875
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,280
The only one who deserves it

876
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,760
is my daughter.

877
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,850
I’ll make you look prettier

878
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,760
than any of the noble ladies.

879
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,399
Alright, turn around.

880
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,520
I told you.

881
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,080
My daughter is gorgeous.

882
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:10,679
I have to say

883
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:13,850
Princess Jia’nan’s stuff is the best.

884
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,000
Let me see your pretty face.

885
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:20,125
What a natural beauty!

886
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,560
Listen to me, Dongdong,

887
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,000
before the end of the year,

888
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,199
I want you to marry a man

889
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,199
of equal background.

890
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,040
Do you hear me?

891
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,050
Bear it in mind.

892
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,800
My daughter is so beautiful.

893
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,080
I think

894
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,760
you’re no worse than the princesses.

895
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,320
Dongzhi, you rarely dress up.

896
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,919
Take a few steps for me.

897
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:43,800
- Oh.
- Come.

898
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,840
Oh, you can stop.

899
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,679
- What’s up?
- No girls march as you do.

900
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,760
Watch me.

901
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,825
Let me show you.

902
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,159
Take smaller steps.

903
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,479
And wiggle.

904
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:01,646
Does it look better?

905
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:02,525
Mm-hmm.

906
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,439
Have you learned it?

907
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,560
Show me.

908
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,159
Stop smiling.

909
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,959
Is that how I taught you?

910
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,479
Look how terrible you look.

911
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,040
Let me show you again. Focus.

912
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,280
My sister-in-law is calling me.

913
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,525
Li Dongzhi!

914
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,159
Welcome. Come in.

915
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:24,639
- Miss Dong.
- Madam.

916
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:25,760
(Dong’s Mansion)

917
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,275
A rare pearl just arrived
from the south.

918
00:40:28,275 --> 00:40:29,919
- Really?
- Then I have to go and take a look.

919
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,725
Take Madam to see it.

920
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,280
Miss Dong.

921
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,120
I haven’t seen you in Bingzhou
for a long time.

922
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,479
You made trouble as soon as you came.

923
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,600
I spent a lot of money

924
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,320
clearing up your mess the other day.

925
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,399
I’ll pay you back double.

926
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:47,080
I want the best horses

927
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,560
and iron ores from your merchandise.

928
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,520
Miss Dong,
you’re a shrewd businesswoman.

929
00:40:51,879 --> 00:40:52,560
Make yourself at home.

930
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,520
Thank you.

931
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:56,525
Miss Dong.

932
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:57,399
Your Grace,

933
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:59,080
(Dong’s Mansion)
it’s such a great honor

934
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,159
(Dong’s Mansion)
that you can come.

935
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,040
- It’s Madam Dong’s birthday.
- Sir, what a pleasure!

936
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,800
I have to give my best regards.

937
00:41:08,575 --> 00:41:10,655
Today, we’re going to have
a hearty drink.

938
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:13,416
What’s your present?

939
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:15,360
That’s quite a surprise!

940
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:17,416
I knew it was a lame idea.

941
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,919
Baoning, let’s go home.

942
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
If you go home,

943
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,199
- what about me?
- Let’s go.

944
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,350
- Be a good girl.
- Let’s get in.

945
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,320
The banquet is about to begin.

946
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,600
Please, Your Grace.

947
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:26,300
Mm-hmm.

948
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:26,919
Let’s go.

949
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:27,450
Mm-hmm.

950
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,560
Guys, chin up.

951
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,350
Sure. Bottom up. Cheers!

952
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,760
Li Dongzhi,

953
00:41:36,879 --> 00:41:38,959
the way you walk is so funny.

954
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,320
You look like a duck just got ashore.

955
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,450
What’s so funny about it?

956
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,879
Everyone in Bingzhou knows that

957
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:50,200
Miss Li has always dressed as a man.

958
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,569
Now you’re wearing girls’ clothes.

959
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:55,320
Are you having
the first awakening of love

960
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,350
so you’re here to hunt for a husband?

961
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:01,525
- Right.
- Unfortunately,

962
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,199
though you’re wearing girls’ clothes,

963
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,039
you don’t have

964
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,239
the slightest manners of a lady.

965
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:09,866
Well,

966
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,250
unless this man is blind,

967
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,670
otherwise

968
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,840
no one would dare marry you.

969
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:17,775
That’s right.

970
00:42:17,975 --> 00:42:18,925
I agree.

971
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:19,765
Zhuang Furong.

972
00:42:23,525 --> 00:42:25,845
Watch your tongue. Don’t push your luck.

973
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,471
Why do you care if I can get married?

974
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,320
I look like a duck just got ashore.

975
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:33,360
Do you think you’re better than me?

976
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,879
In my opinion...

977
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,975
What is she talking about?

978
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:38,159
The gorgeous and graceful singers

979
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:40,200
of Qinfang Pavilion are better than you.

980
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,325
Nonsense!

981
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:42,120
At least they play better music

982
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,520
than you do.

983
00:42:43,919 --> 00:42:46,175
How dare you compare me to the singers
of Qinfang Pavilion?

984
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:47,616
Not compare you to them.

985
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,120
You’re no match, alright?

986
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,320
Do you think the fine clothes and jewels

987
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,639
make you a beauty?

988
00:42:55,798 --> 00:42:57,719
Have you ever seen a real beauty?

989
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:59,159
A real beauty

990
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,479
has jade-like shape, snow-like skin,

991
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:04,520
blooming face and willow-like posture.

992
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,760
Zhuang Furong,

993
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,120
except that your name means a flower,

994
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,080
the rest of you

995
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,239
isn’t even close to a blooming beauty.

996
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,025
You...

997
00:43:18,439 --> 00:43:19,350
Help!

998
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,500
Let’s go.

999
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:22,000
Help!

1000
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,350
Go help her!

1001
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:24,950
Go, go, go!

1002
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:25,700
Hurry up!

1003
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,625
Someone’s in the water!

1004
00:43:35,959 --> 00:43:36,625
Come on!

1005
00:43:43,575 --> 00:43:45,696
You... are a girl.

1006
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,159
Hi, An.

1007
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,850
Your Grace, do you like the food?

1008
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:00,400
Mm-hmm.

1009
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,560
- Dongdong!
- Baoning.

1010
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
Why are you wet all over?

1011
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,639
Miss Li fell into the water.

1012
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:09,639
She must have been used
to men’s clothes.

1013
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,320
Now in women’s clothes,

1014
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,560
she can’t even walk.

1015
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,325
Silence!

1016
00:44:15,841 --> 00:44:17,040
Take her somewhere she can change.

1017
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,959
Yes.

1018
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:18,879
Baoning.

1019
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,590
I know, go on.

1020
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:22,850
Mm-hmm.

1021
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:25,951
I’ll go give her a hand.

1022
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,120
Sure.

1023
00:44:56,879 --> 00:44:57,950
- Mother.
- Mm-hmm.

1024
00:44:57,950 --> 00:44:59,300
Why don’t we go watch the opera?

1025
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,120
- Oh, you remind me.
- Let’s go.

1026
00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:04,000
I’ve been waiting

1027
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,981
for an explanation and apology.

1028
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,925
Your Grace, I don’t understand.

1029
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,280
Mrs. Zhuang,

1030
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,550
shall I

1031
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,000
get everyone in the garden here

1032
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,719
and ask them one by one

1033
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:17,959
what happened?

1034
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,000
In that case,

1035
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:21,879
if someday,

1036
00:45:21,879 --> 00:45:23,520
there are rumors about a young lady

1037
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,919
being imperious

1038
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,520
that bring disgrace to Miss Zhuang,

1039
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,120
I hope you don’t blame me.

1040
00:45:30,879 --> 00:45:33,080
Your Grace, is it necessary?

1041
00:45:33,479 --> 00:45:36,919
It’s just a joke
between two young girls.

1042
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,360
Besides, it takes two

1043
00:45:39,439 --> 00:45:41,000
to tangle.

1044
00:45:41,399 --> 00:45:42,679
If rumors spread out,

1045
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:46,080
my daughter isn’t the only one
to bear the disgrace.

1046
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,525
Mrs. Zhuang,

1047
00:45:51,441 --> 00:45:53,040
my husband’s families are all loyalists.

1048
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,325
They despise treacherous schemes.

1049
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,439
If anyone hurts my sister-in-law,

1050
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:00,800
I’ll make her very sorry.

1051
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,525
Are you absolutely sure

1052
00:46:06,879 --> 00:46:08,650
that your daughter is innocent?

1053
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,760
Um...

1054
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,925
Mother.

1055
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,080
It’s said a child is better unborn
than untaught.

1056
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,399
Today,
in front of your daughter at fault,

1057
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:23,080
you described
a life-threatening situation

1058
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,159
as a girls’ bicker.

1059
00:46:25,439 --> 00:46:26,879
Judging by her behaviors,

1060
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,280
I doubt that after marriage,

1061
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,439
she’d show any respect for her in-laws.

1062
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,050
Miss Zhuang,

1063
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,400
do you know why you’re wrong?

1064
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:38,879
I...

1065
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,959
I’m not wrong!

1066
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:43,280
What if I did push Li Dongzhi
into the beck?

1067
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,879
I was just teasing her a bit.

1068
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,560
And she compared me to a singer.

1069
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:47,879
And you!

1070
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:50,000
Don’t put on airs, Princess.

1071
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,239
I don’t believe that you...

1072
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,639
Kneel down.

1073
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,779
It was your fault.

1074
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,399
Her Grace is right.

1075
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,479
How dare you talk back to Her Grace?

1076
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:00,719
You’re going to bow

1077
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:02,360
to Her Grace and admit your mistake.

1078
00:47:02,879 --> 00:47:03,679
In a while,

1079
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,879
you’ll ask for Miss Li’s forgiveness.

1080
00:47:09,479 --> 00:47:10,840
I’m sorry, Your Grace.

1081
00:47:13,575 --> 00:47:15,175
Are you a mosquito?

1082
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,475
Louder!

1083
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:20,564
I’m sorry, Your Grace.

1084
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:24,479
Your Grace,

1085
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,374
now can you forgive her?

1086
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,769
I can spare you

1087
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,110
for being rude.

1088
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,320
But my sister-in-law is shocked.

1089
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:38,560
I can’t forgive you for her.

1090
00:47:38,825 --> 00:47:40,065
I’ll apologize to Li Dong...

1091
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,390
To Miss Li.

1092
00:47:56,175 --> 00:47:57,014
The white one.

1093
00:48:23,479 --> 00:48:25,840
I heard Dongzhi fell
into the water today

1094
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,679
and someone taught Miss Zhuang

1095
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,950
a painful lesson at Dong’s Mansion.

1096
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,639
She bullied my sister-in-law.

1097
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:32,919
That makes her our family’s foe.

1098
00:48:32,919 --> 00:48:34,000
I can’t let her go unpunished.

1099
00:48:36,439 --> 00:48:37,520
My beloved princess,

1100
00:48:37,919 --> 00:48:38,760
you’re so cool!

1101
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,100
Mm-hmm.

1102
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,040
What did you do to the poor sachet?

1103
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,199
It was torn
during the drill at the camp.

1104
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:47,919
It’s fine.

1105
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:50,040
Why didn’t you get a new one?

1106
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,280
You gave me this.

1107
00:48:51,439 --> 00:48:52,520
I don’t want to replace it.

1108
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,720
I’ll make you a new one.

1109
00:48:58,159 --> 00:48:59,199
But my needlework is terrible.

1110
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:00,600
I hope you don’t mind.

1111
00:49:01,325 --> 00:49:02,886
You gave this to me.

1112
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,159
It’s the one and only in the world.

1113
00:49:04,439 --> 00:49:05,520
I don’t want to get rid of it.

1114
00:49:19,575 --> 00:49:20,855
Young Master. Sir!

1115
00:49:21,439 --> 00:49:22,575
There’s a military emergency.

1116
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:32,268
(King of Yongqing is ill.)
Sir, info from the scout.

1117
00:49:32,292 --> 00:49:33,320
(Qing Tai seizes the military.)
Sir, info from the scout.

1118
00:49:33,325 --> 00:49:34,275
(Army assembled and ready to march south.)
The King of Yongqing is ill.

1119
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:35,479
Qing Tai seizes the military.

1120
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:37,994
The army is assembled and ready
to march south.

1121
00:49:39,639 --> 00:49:40,479
Go back to the barracks.

1122
00:49:40,479 --> 00:49:41,239
Yes.

1123
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,680
Yongqing State broke our convention,

1124
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,719
and their troops are to march south.

1125
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,080
He wants war.

1126
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,159
Then I’ll give him one!

1127
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:04,080
This isn’t a good time
to come into the war.

1128
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,919
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

1129
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,289
When if not now?

1130
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,420
This is the first warfare
since I took over the reins.

1131
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,131
Not only must we fight,

1132
00:50:17,725 --> 00:50:19,525
but we also have to win,

1133
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,000
so that Yongqing State won’t dare

1134
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,840
attack us in two decades.

1135
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:24,959
Councilor Wang.

1136
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,679
Yes, Your Majesty.

1137
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:27,800
Prepare the edict for me.

1138
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,600
Order the Border Battalion
to hit the enemies hard.

1139
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

1140
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,410
Qing Tai, the First Prince of Yongqing,

1141
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:49,360
tore our convention and commanded
troops south.

1142
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,520
They intend to encroach on our homeland.

1143
00:50:52,358 --> 00:50:54,679
This is a matter of His Majesty’s honor

1144
00:50:54,679 --> 00:50:56,679
and the civilians’ lives!

1145
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:00,239
Soldiers of Mu’an State,

1146
00:51:00,439 --> 00:51:01,959
we cannot allow it!

1147
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:04,450
His Majesty’s edict

1148
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:06,316
is to wipe out

1149
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,760
Yongqing army at all costs!

1150
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,839
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1151
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,719
Li Qian!

1152
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,679
Yes, Commander.

1153
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:22,879
I appoint you as the first vanguard.

1154
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:26,070
Lead Xuanjia Battalion to the front.

1155
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:27,731
Yes, Commander.

1156
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,439
Commander, in face of a state crisis,

1157
00:51:30,975 --> 00:51:33,616
Huben Battalion would like to stand
together with Xuanjia Battalion.

1158
00:51:34,479 --> 00:51:35,360
Granted!

1159
00:51:38,825 --> 00:51:40,146
I will defeat you

1160
00:51:40,399 --> 00:51:43,040
on the battlefield in a fair manner.

1161
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,710
From the capital of Yongqing, Yunyang,

1162
00:51:53,075 --> 00:51:54,515
to the border,

1163
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:57,390
it’s at least a 20-day march,
a month maximum.

1164
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,280
Barring unforeseen problems,

1165
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,440
in three days, Qing Tai’s troops

1166
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,120
will arrive at Dayanshan Camp.

1167
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:05,266
Mount Dayanshan
is in a low-lying region.

1168
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,360
The pass is narrow and easy to defend.

1169
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,280
I’ll lead 500 cavalries to attack here
at night,

1170
00:52:10,825 --> 00:52:12,666
and set an ambush at the pass.

1171
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:15,639
Then we’ll take them by surprise.

1172
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,239
With 500 light cavalries,

1173
00:52:17,925 --> 00:52:20,445
you wish to catch them by surprise?

1174
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:24,565
Do you know Yongqing cavalries
are unbeatable?

1175
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,481
You’re over-optimistic.

1176
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,831
I know we’re outnumbered.

1177
00:52:29,075 --> 00:52:30,274
Thus, after the raid,

1178
00:52:30,479 --> 00:52:31,600
I will feign a retreat

1179
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:33,560
and lure them into the valley.

1180
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,479
Then Yun Lin and the rest of the men

1181
00:52:35,479 --> 00:52:37,679
will eliminate their advance troops

1182
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:39,000
with rocks and arrows
on the mountain top

1183
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,840
and destroy their provisions and fodder.

1184
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,760
When Mr. Jin’s troops arrive,

1185
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,919
we’ll box them up.

1186
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,000
I don’t like this textbook tactic.

1187
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,399
Do you know that Yongqing invaders

1188
00:52:49,675 --> 00:52:50,875
never fight in a specific formation?

1189
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,331
Their cavalries are indeed invincible,

1190
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,759
but the terrain is more suitable
for infantry.

1191
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,930
Our infantry and armored soldiers

1192
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,419
are way stronger than them.

1193
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,040
By then, I can have men

1194
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,479
deliver the provisions and fodder first.

1195
00:53:04,975 --> 00:53:06,535
When the provisions are in position,

1196
00:53:06,879 --> 00:53:08,879
I’ll deploy the heavy armors

1197
00:53:08,879 --> 00:53:11,600
and soldiers of Xuanjia Battalion here.

1198
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,520
But in light of the current situation,

1199
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:16,030
it’s not wise to start a long haul
with Yongqing State.

1200
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,760
Commander Zhao,

1201
00:53:21,441 --> 00:53:23,040
the military supply will slow us down.

1202
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,919
If anything goes wrong
with the provisions,

1203
00:53:25,558 --> 00:53:27,199
the whole troops could be annihilated.

1204
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:27,959
Li Qian,

1205
00:53:29,175 --> 00:53:30,734
are you questioning my tactic?

1206
00:53:30,879 --> 00:53:31,919
I’m just talking
about the possibilities.

1207
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:33,816
Please take our men’s lives seriously!

1208
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
This is an order.

1209
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:38,080
Anyone who disobeys will face
a military penalty.

1210
00:53:44,479 --> 00:53:45,600
- Yes.
