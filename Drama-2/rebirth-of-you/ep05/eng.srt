00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:16,479
I’m sorry.

00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:20,960
Wait, you...

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,600
Take this.

32
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:34,399
Remember to use it.

33
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,399
I don’t need him to care about me.

(Hall of Heavenly Kings)

35
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,559
Sir,

36
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,240
here are their birthday horoscopes.

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,000
(Divination)

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,839
What have you got, sir?

39
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,880
This girl has the best fate

40
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,360
and everybody will be supporting her.

41
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,360
Her future husband

42
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,440
is awesome.

43
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,520
Sir,

44
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,199
when should she get married, then?

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,720
Let’s go.

46
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,175
Go.

47
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,440
Her fate of spouse is far-off.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,479
It means she’ll get married late.

49
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,839
I’m afraid it still takes a while.

50
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,880
Greetings, my lady.

51
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,360
She isn’t in a hurry to get married.

52
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,960
A late marriage will bring prosperity
to her and her husband.

53
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,000
Fine.

54
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,759
Now that you say so,

55
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,400
we’ll do this.

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,950
Mm.

57
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,160
Wendie.

58
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,039
Greetings, my lady.

59
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,479
Greetings, Marchioness.

60
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,759
What a coincidence!

61
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,320
We all came to pray for blessings.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,479
Are you here to pray
for marriage for your son?

63
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,040
Marriages are made in heaven.

64
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,559
We can’t force it.

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,959
I just came to pray for my family

66
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,079
and have some divination.

67
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,679
Su,

68
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,519
let’s go.

69
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,559
What do you want to divine for,
fate or marriage?

70
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:38,679
- Don’t forget to think about it.
- All right.

71
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,839
Do the rest as the fortune-teller said.

72
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,279
Sorry. Sorry.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,920
- What bad luck!
- Let’s go.

74
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,720
Let’s go.

75
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,825
(Hall of Heavenly Kings)

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,754
Yeah.

77
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,025
I’ve also heard about it.

78
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,839
Su,

79
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,875
what’s wrong?

80
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,160
Nothing.

81
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,040
Let’s go.

82
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:06,700
Mm.

83
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,875
(Hall of Heavenly Kings)

84
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:17,480
Baoning,

85
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,959
why are you still in the mood
for painting?

86
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,119
In a couple of days,

87
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:23,559
the Empress Dowager will issue
a decree for your marriage.

88
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
I know how to deal with that.

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,320
Empress Dowager Cao has made a move.

90
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,839
I’ll have to turn her trick
into my own use.

91
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,799
She has made a move?

92
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:34,925
Mm.

93
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,519
District Princess Qingyi.

94
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:40,959
Han Tongxin hasn’t visited the Palace
in the past ten years.

95
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,679
Some days ago, Empress Dowager Cao

96
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:45,000
asked Lord Jian to take her here
and meet Zhao Yi.

97
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,359
These days,

98
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,160
she arranged her in the palace school.

99
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,399
Isn’t that obvious that
she wants her to approach Zhao Yi?

100
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:55,119
Looks like the Empress Dowager thinks

101
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,279
if you become the Empress,

102
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,880
she must plant

103
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,799
some of her spies

104
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,320
around His Majesty.

105
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,880
Look at how Han Tongxin behaves
in the palace school.

106
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,799
She’s arrogant and impulsive.

107
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,160
I should take a little advantage

108
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,239
of her jealousy.

109
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,119
I’ll cooperate with her

110
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,320
to screw my marriage within days.

111
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:22,875
(Shoukang Palace)

112
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,559
(Speak and Behave Wonderfully)

113
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,279
My palace hasn’t been so boisterous
for a long time.

114
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,399
Try some of the chilled fruit
from my kitchen.

115
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,200
Grandmother, if you enjoy the fun,

116
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,239
I will

117
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:39,119
hold more banquets in your palace.

118
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,119
Good idea.

119
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,359
When you care for me,

120
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,839
I’m happy enough.

121
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,399
After you marry Baoning,

122
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:50,320
and have a great-grandson for me
in a couple of years,

123
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,600
I’ll be happier.

124
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,399
Grandmother, people are watching.

125
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,959
Your Highness,

126
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,079
Baoning is very sensitive.

127
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,920
You’re making her shy.

128
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:03,440
All right.

129
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:04,880
I’ll say no more.

130
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,279
Later,

131
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:09,519
you’ll move to Ciyuan Hall
where the Empress lives.

132
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:13,679
I’ll feel lonely in my palace.

133
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:15,760
Even after I move there,

134
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,160
I’ll come and see you three times a day.

135
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,799
Good.

136
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:22,600
Grandmother,

137
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,399
I’ve prepared a gift for you.

138
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,160
What is it?

139
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:28,150
Du Sheng.

140
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,799
I hear you love flowers, Grandmother.

141
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,519
I’ve bought the azaleas
from the Qi Family in Jinxi

142
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,399
and had them planted in Shoukang Palace

143
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,920
so that you can enjoy them.

144
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,720
These flowers look unique.

145
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,650
Awesome.

146
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,839
Thank you, Grandson.

147
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,399
I’m delighted.

148
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:57,119
Azalea is said to be
the most beautiful flower.

149
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,839
These buds look quite charming.

150
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,850
Come on.

151
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:07,239
District Princess, Su,

152
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,359
shall we paint the flowers

153
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:11,440
and give the paintings to Grandmother?

154
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,600
Now that we’ll paint,

155
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,040
how about having a competition?

156
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,799
She’s hooked.

157
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,200
She really doesn’t let me down.

158
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,760
Sounds interesting.

159
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:22,799
Fangling,

160
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,600
go get everything prepared.

161
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:25,700
Yes.

162
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,519
That’s great.

163
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,279
I just need to pull the trigger.

164
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,520
But,

165
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,000
a competition is quite boring.

166
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,719
How about...?

167
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,280
Your Majesty,

168
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,080
how about giving

169
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,880
one of your belongings as a reward?

170
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,799
I’ll give the winner

171
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,520
a turquoise as the reward.

172
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,400
Hey.

173
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,760
Paint it poorly.

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Baoning’s painting looks so vivid.

175
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,799
I indeed have no gift for painting.

176
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,278
I might win
if we competed in embroidery.

177
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,760
Everybody has her talent.

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,599
I love them all.

179
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:22,479
Praise her.

180
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,599
I had thought Baoning’s painting

181
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,119
could be vivid enough.

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,559
But the flowers
District Princess Qingyi painted

183
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,520
not only look real,

184
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,359
I feel I can even smell them.

185
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,479
I lose.

186
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,000
All right.

187
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,080
Looks like the turquoise

188
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,479
will be awarded
to District Princess Qingyi.

189
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,875
Du Sheng.

190
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,000
Come, Grandmother.

191
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,679
Thank you, Your Majesty.

192
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,239
I didn’t get such a good turquoise.

193
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,280
Baoning,

194
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:16,080
it’s just a turquoise.

195
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,599
In my treasury,

196
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,000
there are many gems like that.

197
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,919
Shall I give you a water-clear bead?

198
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,880
Du Sheng, go.

199
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,840
Go get it to Baoning.

200
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,960
Jiang Baoning sounded so backhanded.

201
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,039
Shame on her!

202
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,599
She lost her parents

203
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:40,359
so that she became a Commandery Princess

204
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,520
and lived in the Palace
with Cousin Yi for a longer time.

205
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,359
Baihe,

206
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:44,650
tell me.

207
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,960
What talent makes her as good as me?

208
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,400
Yeah, my lady.

209
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,000
She isn’t as good as you at all.

210
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,479
Think about your painting.

211
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,039
Everybody likes it.

212
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,559
You won the competition today

213
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,550
and showed more splendor than her.

214
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,119
Something’s wrong.

215
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,919
I won the competition.

216
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,359
But why did she get something

217
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,799
much better?

218
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,599
My lady,

219
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,559
this is a reward
from His Majesty, after all.

220
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,559
If I can’t make him love me,

221
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,320
such a gem

222
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,960
is just like a useless rock!

223
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,250
Baihe,

224
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,960
keep a close eye
on the Three Abodes of the East.

225
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,200
Yes.

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,919
Your Highness,

227
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,840
in the temple that day,

228
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,919
I picked up your jade pendant.

229
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,919
This is my favorite jade pendant.

230
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,000
I thought I couldn’t get it back.

231
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Thank you, my lady.

232
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,799
Well,

233
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,280
I’m going back
to the Three Abodes of the West.

234
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:55,760
By the way,

235
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:57,559
in the temple,

236
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,919
why did you bribe the fortune-teller?

237
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,119
You taught him what to say, didn’t you?

238
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,275
Mm.

239
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,200
I didn’t expect

240
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,679
you could deceive others like that.

241
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,320
I just don’t want to get married early.

242
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,559
If I get married early,

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,840
Baoning will feel bored in the Palace.

244
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,200
But all girls want to get married.

245
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,119
As the lineal daughter
in a noble family,

246
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,559
my marriage will only be

247
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,919
a strong link

248
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,000
between two families.

249
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,799
This is the fate of big families.

250
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:38,239
Every member has to share
the family honor and disgrace.

251
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:41,280
If only I didn’t need
to live for my family

252
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,559
and I could marry the man I adored,

253
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,960
regardless of his family background.

254
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,375
Yeah.

255
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,760
If I can get a soul mate,

256
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,039
I’ll feel contented.

257
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:00,320
Your Highness,

258
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,880
this is a place
where people like to gossip.

259
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,359
I’ll leave you alone.

260
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,225
Mm.

261
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:06,280
Thank you for the jade pendant.

262
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:07,950
Mm.

263
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,960
She braided a new string

264
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,880
for the jade pendant.

265
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,159
Eunuch,

266
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,840
please sell this for me.

267
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,880
But...

268
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,159
If you stole a hairpin

269
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,239
or a bracelet,

270
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,119
it would be easier to sell it.

271
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,039
But it’s the water-clear bead
from His Majesty.

272
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,559
Even if I sell it out of the Palace,

273
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,960
no one dares to buy it.

274
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,559
Not even at a low price?

275
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,640
Please don’t embarrass me.

276
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:56,640
I...

277
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,960
Greetings, my lady.

278
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:02,039
Lord Min has assigned a job to me.

279
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,799
I’ll leave you alone.

280
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,840
My lady.

281
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,559
How daring!

282
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,320
You stole the water-clear bead
from His Majesty.

283
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:20,719
I...

284
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:21,919
My lady,

285
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,760
my mother is badly sick.

286
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,559
I didn’t have a choice,

287
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,719
but to steal the water-clear bead
from Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

288
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,119
Jiang Baoning has lost the bead.

289
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,320
If Cousin Yi knows about it,
he’ll certainly blame her.

290
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,719
The bead...

291
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,119
I’ll take it.

292
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,440
You take the money

293
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:44,039
for your mother

294
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,239
and have her treated.

295
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,760
But remember.

296
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,960
From this day on, no matter what
Jiang Baoning does,

297
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,640
you should tell me honestly.

298
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,159
I can’t, my lady.

299
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:56,640
If Commandery Princess Jia’nan
knows it, I’ll be...

300
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,039
Do you think she’ll let you go

301
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,799
when she knows you stole the bead?

302
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
From now on,

303
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,039
I’ll report to you

304
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:13,919
whatever Her Grace does.

305
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,039
All right. Qingke.

306
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,719
Off you go.

307
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,400
Thank you, my lady.

308
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,520
My lady,

309
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,599
everyone in the Palace is cunning.

310
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,440
Be on guard against her.

311
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,559
I’ve got a handle

312
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,400
against her stealing.

313
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,400
Do I need to worry about her tricks?

314
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,000
Tomorrow in the Imperial Garden,

315
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,599
His Majesty will entertain
the imperial relatives.

316
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,640
It will be a grand banquet.

317
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,880
Go get me the Lyuqi Zither

318
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,200
my grandfather gave me
on my last birthday.

319
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,080
Yes.

320
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,079
My lady.

321
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,280
What brings you here?

322
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,520
Is Jiang Baoning

323
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,000
having a new plan?

324
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,560
My lady,

325
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,959
Her Grace hurt her wrist.

326
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:35,920
I’m afraid...

327
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,359
At all banquets,

328
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,880
there’s always nothing to enjoy,

329
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,160
but music and dances.

330
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:26,760
How boring!

331
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,525
Your Majesty,

332
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:31,920
as early as I was home,

333
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,319
I heard that Commandery Princess Jia’nan
played the zither very well.

334
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,719
When I’m in the Palace these days,

335
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:37,079
I haven’t got a chance to enjoy it.

336
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,560
I wonder

337
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,839
if you can play a song, Your Grace.

338
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:48,160
It’s been a long while
since I last listened to her song, too.

339
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,400
Baoning,

340
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,640
how about

341
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:54,359
playing a song for us?

342
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,119
But today,

343
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,800
I haven’t brought my Jiaowei Zither.

344
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:00,959
I’ve brought one.

345
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,319
Baihe.

346
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,760
This is the dowry of my grandmother.

347
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,359
It’s also a famous zither.

348
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,439
It’s as good as yours, Your Grace.

349
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,520
I always keep it carefully.

350
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,959
Today, I’d like to lend it to you.

351
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,400
She even wants to lend me
her grandmother’s dowry.

352
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,199
She’s so eager to embarrass me.

353
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,479
Your Grace, why is it you?

354
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:18,880
How is your wrist wounded?

355
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,479
I sprained it just now, I guess.

356
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:21,239
It’s fine.

357
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,925
Your Majesty,

358
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,520
I’ve learned to play the zither
since I was little.

359
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,760
I’ve heard about how well
Her Grace plays, too.

360
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:40,959
No offense,

361
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,040
but may I play with her today?

362
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:44,775
What?

363
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,075
You’d better not.

364
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:49,079
We can enjoy a song
by Marquis Jinghai’s son and Her Grace.

365
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,079
That’s great.

366
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:50,880
Great.

367
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:52,880
That’s awesome.

368
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,425
Fine.

369
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,800
Get another zither for him.

370
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:56,725
Don’t bother.

371
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,359
I’ll use the zither with Her Grace.

372
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,160
I’m screwed.

373
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:11,775
Mm.

374
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:16,839
Forget it.

375
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,680
I’ll just do it.

376
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,760
Sounds wonderful.

377
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,760
How dares he

378
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,439
exchange glances with Baoning!

379
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:49,760
See how I’ll deal with you.

380
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,000
They played so well.

381
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,040
I didn’t expect you

382
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,880
to play so well
with Commandery Princess Jia’nan

383
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,240
though it was the first time.

384
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,400
How lucky Jiang Baoning is!

385
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,800
Why is she helped every time?

386
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,959
My lady.

387
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,239
Cousin Yi.

388
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:21,400
Cousin Yi,

389
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,239
what do you want from me?

390
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,319
Baoning used your zither at the banquet.

391
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,280
I found it good.

392
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,280
May I have a look?

393
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,925
Baihe.

394
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:30,450
Mm.

395
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,800
Cousin Yi,

396
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:35,599
I’ve also learned to play the zither
since little.

397
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,839
If there’s a chance,

398
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,000
I’d like to play a song for you.

399
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,959
I lost hold of it.

400
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,119
I’m sorry.

401
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,760
No, no, no, Cousin Yi.

402
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:56,680
It’s my fault.

403
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,560
I didn’t hold it tightly.

404
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,959
Did it startle you?

405
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:02,625
Ah.

406
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,319
You didn’t?

407
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,479
It’s so careless of you.

408
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,959
Darn it, Jiang Baoning.

409
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,000
I won’t let you go!

410
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,160
Your Grace!

411
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:23,975
Mm?

412
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:26,760
Your Grace,

413
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,280
you hurt your wrist
when falling off the horse.

414
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,280
It’s not recovered yet?

415
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,920
Not really.

416
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,680
I just haven’t practiced it
for a long time.

417
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,520
Thank you for helping me out just now.

418
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:38,680
Let’s go.

419
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:40,839
Go.

420
00:23:45,568 --> 00:23:48,719
(Memorial to the throne)

421
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:49,719
Your Highness,

422
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,520
this is from the censors
for the empress coronation.

423
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,000
Please view it.

424
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:08,479
Without the Grand Empress Dowager
and the Archduke,

425
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:09,880
Jiang Baoning

426
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:11,450
is never qualified

427
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,825
(March 9, the 15th year of Yuanding Reign)
to be the Empress!

428
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
What a pity!

429
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,280
The decree for the Empress
will be issued tomorrow.

430
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,920
What’s the good of Jiang Baoning?

431
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,760
Cousin Yi is partial to her,

432
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,599
but is quite cold to me.

433
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,439
I must let him know

434
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:31,319
that she has lost the water-clear bead

435
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,280
so that she’ll be severely punished.

436
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,800
Where’s Qingke?

437
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:38,560
Why are you back alone?

438
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,119
Bad news, my lady.

439
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:42,719
Commandery Princess Jia’nan
found the bead was missing

440
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:44,400
and Qingke stole it.

441
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,199
Under torture,

442
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,079
Qingke confessed that you had it.

443
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,520
What did you say?

444
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,000
Is that true?

445
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,439
I heard them clearly.

446
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,280
Eunuch Liu asked other eunuchs

447
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,599
to come here
with Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

448
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,640
They will catch you having the bead

449
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,959
so that you have no time to hide it.

450
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,599
Baihe.

451
00:25:11,275 --> 00:25:11,800
Mm.

452
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,839
Give this back
to the Three Abodes of the East.

453
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:27,000
Now that they’re coming to me.

454
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:29,160
Few people will be there
in the Three Abodes of the East.

455
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,640
Then get the Empress Dowager to us.

456
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:33,400
Yes.

457
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,199
Xiaoman, search it.

458
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:43,800
Yes.

459
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,880
Jiang Baoning? What are you doing?

460
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:49,079
The bead His Majesty gave me is lost.

461
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,280
You stole it, didn’t you?

462
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,800
Don’t sling mud at me!

463
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,920
Have your room searched
and we’ll know.

464
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,425
You!

465
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,319
Here comes the Empress Dowager.

466
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,280
Look what you’re doing.

467
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,920
Please defend me, Your Highness.

468
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:12,119
Without evidence,

469
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:14,319
Commandery Princess Jia’nan
has her eunuchs search my bedroom,

470
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,119
accusing me
of stealing her water-clear bead.

471
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,239
Yes. The bead is precious.

472
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,959
But I’m a District Princess
and Lord Jian’s granddaughter.

473
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,280
I never lack precious things.

474
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,239
Now that she does me wrong,

475
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,439
I’ll have no choice, but to kill myself

476
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,599
to prove my innocence.

477
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:34,959
Your Grace,

478
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,839
have you found

479
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,920
the water-clear bead you’re after?

480
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,719
I haven’t yet.

481
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,400
But I’m sure Han Tongxin stole it.

482
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:58,680
Your Grace,

483
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,239
you’re always naughty

484
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,479
and don’t obey rules.

485
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,800
I don’t care

486
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,040
and let you go.

487
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,520
But now you accuse Tongxin

488
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,079
of having stolen your bead.

489
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,800
Aren’t you going too far?

490
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
Your Highness,

491
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,800
Her Grace claims that

492
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,199
her ladyship has stolen her bead.

493
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:22,760
But she doesn’t have any evidence.

494
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,640
I can also say that

495
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,599
she’s jealous of her ladyship’s talent

496
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,239
and frames her up.

497
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,400
All right. Stop arguing.

498
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
I will

499
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,319
find out the truth

500
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:41,640
and solve the case with justice.

501
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,000
What happened?

502
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,160
Why didn’t you tell me
when you lost something?

503
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:52,800
For your information,

504
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,479
Your Highnesses,

505
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,560
we found this
in Commandery Princess Jia’nan’s room.

506
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,040
Commandery Princess Jia’nan,

507
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,199
this is irrefutable evidence.

508
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,760
What else would you like to explain?

509
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:11,880
Since I came to the Palace,

510
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:14,800
I’ve never thought about
stealing the thunder from Her Grace.

511
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,119
But she hates me so much.

512
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,199
Your Highnesses,

513
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,719
please defend me.

514
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,439
Commandery Princess Jia’nan
made a big mistake

515
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,319
and she must be severely punished!

516
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,319
Severely punished?

517
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,839
It’s just a little conflict
between girls.

518
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,920
Don’t make a fuss over it.

519
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,040
Mother,

520
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,880
I know you always spoil Baoning.

521
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:45,319
As a noble Commandery Princess,

522
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,800
shouldn’t she behave herself
more carefully?

523
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,800
But without a reason

524
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,719
or any evidence,

525
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,160
she slandered District Princess Qingyi.

526
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,119
If I just let her go,

527
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,359
then

528
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,439
I can hardly convince people.

529
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,000
Lord Jian will be displeased.

530
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:10,359
Other officials
will be disappointed, too.

531
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:13,239
Considering she did it
for the first time,

532
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,680
I’ll punish her to kneel
in the Introspection Chamber for a night.

533
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,375
That’s all?

534
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,000
Just a little punishment.
What do you think?

535
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:23,800
But the decree of the Empress
will be issued tomorrow.

536
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,239
Let’s reconsider

537
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,439
the Empress thing

538
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,599
after my birthday.

539
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,359
That’s more like it.

540
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,640
Empress Dowager Cao
has got a handle on her.

541
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,239
Even the Grand Empress Dowager
failed to defend her.

542
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:43,160
Tomorrow is the birthday
of Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

543
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,839
Looks like she’ll spend it
in the Introspection Chamber.

544
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:46,760
It’s said to be a very cold chamber.

545
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,680
Her Grace is a weak girl.

546
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,640
How can she go through the night?

547
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,560
Yeah.

548
00:29:52,775 --> 00:29:53,350
Wait.

549
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,920
You mentioned that
Commandery Princess Jia’nan was punished.

550
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:57,040
What happened?

551
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:58,880
Everyone in the Palace knew about it,

552
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,760
but you didn’t?

553
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,479
Yeah.

554
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,119
Her Grace slandered
District Princess Qingyi

555
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,359
for stealing her water-clear bead.

556
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,920
She also made a scene
in the Three Abodes of the South.

557
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,359
Even the Grand Empress Dowager
was startled.

558
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,319
But in the end, the bead

559
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,599
was found in her own bedroom.

560
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:11,839
The Empress Dowager was going
to issue the decree

561
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:13,400
to make her the Empress tomorrow.

562
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,560
Looks like the decree can’t be issued.

563
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:16,719
Say no more.

564
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,725
Her Graces are waiting for us.

565
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:18,350
Mm.

566
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,750
(Introspection Chamber)

567
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:33,719
Isn’t that Guard Li
who assisted Baoning?

568
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,119
He must be coming for a reason.

569
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:41,719
My lady.

570
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,760
Your Highness,

571
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,439
I lost the bracelet
the Grand Empress Dowager awarded me.

572
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,280
Could you look for it with me?

573
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,599
Do you remember

574
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,680
where you lost it?

575
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,640
On my way here, I guess.

576
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,525
Let’s go, then.

577
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:53,075
- Go.
- Mm.

578
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:28,439
I don’t think it’s here.

579
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,680
What, Your Highness?

580
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,959
You got your hand dirty
when looking for the bracelet.

581
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,599
Now,

582
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,400
you’ve got your face dirty.

583
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:54,239
Actually, you don’t need to do this.

584
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,800
What do you mean?

585
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,280
You’re close
to Commandery Princess Jia’nan.

586
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,319
I guess

587
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,000
you just want to send me away

588
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,400
so that she can sneak out

589
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,040
for some fresh air.

590
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,040
You knew what I wanted.

591
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,359
I won’t

592
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,040
tell anyone else.

593
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,079
Thank you for the new string

594
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,280
you’ve made for my jade pendant.

595
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,119
You know it’s new?

596
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:29,520
You’ve made a very nice string.

597
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:37,239
It’s getting late.

598
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,760
Let me walk you back.

599
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,400
By the way,

600
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,760
I’ll be guarding this place.

601
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,560
I won’t let Her Grace suffer.

602
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

603
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,376
Mm.

604
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,560
Oh,

605
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,119
let’s go.

606
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:06,890
Mm.

607
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,160
Why did you come?

608
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:31,975
Your Grace.

609
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,479
I didn’t expect you

610
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,680
to be so leisure

611
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,119
even when you’re punished
in the Introspection Chamber.

612
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:40,760
Luckily, my grandmother cares for me.

613
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,319
Looks like the quilts,

614
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,560
book, and candles

615
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,199
are from the Grand Empress Dowager.

616
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:47,900
Mm.

617
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,680
Actually, you never

618
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,479
want to marry His Majesty.

619
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,119
You said you and His Majesty
loved each other.

620
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,319
You lied about that, didn’t you?

621
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:03,680
Han Tongxin was in the limelight
in front of His Majesty.

622
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,359
I was so enraged!

623
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:10,199
Others may not be aware.

624
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,840
But I witnessed

625
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,439
how brave and talented you were.

626
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:15,600
If you really got jealous

627
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,320
because His Majesty awarded
District Princess Qingyi

628
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,600
and tried to frame her up,

629
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,959
you wouldn’t have yourself caught

630
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,040
and nullified the decree for tomorrow.

631
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,239
So,

632
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,439
you don’t want to marry His Majesty.

633
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:30,959
He’s the emperor.

634
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:31,800
Mm.

635
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,439
All girls throughout the nation
want to marry him.

636
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,399
But you’re different
from all the other girls.

637
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,600
When you were sure

638
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,439
that Fang Yiru had a baby
of His Majesty,

639
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,919
you didn’t argue with His Majesty

640
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:43,919
about this.

641
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,600
Instead, you calmly planned

642
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,439
how to make use of the baby

643
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,919
to balance Empress Dowager Cao
and His Majesty.

644
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:51,840
Judging from this,

645
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,239
you don’t want to marry him at all.

646
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:55,919
What happened today

647
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,639
was also your plan.

648
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,320
You’re sharp-eyed.

649
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,840
I indeed don’t want to marry Zhao Yi.

650
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,479
That’s why I helped Han Tongxin
when she framed me up.

651
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:13,040
She first got the water-clear bead

652
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,520
because I tricked her.

653
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,840
Then, I let her know

654
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,320
that I would catch her in the act.

655
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
She would certainly put the blame on me

656
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,320
for framing her up.

657
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:27,080
So, everything

658
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,120
is under your control?

659
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,850
Mm.

660
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,959
Now, she must be very pleased

661
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,560
with her wisdom.

662
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:35,919
Tongxin,

663
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:38,959
you didn’t let Empress Dowager down

664
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:41,800
for getting you to study in the Palace.

665
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:45,320
Her Highness praised you greatly.

666
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:48,199
When Jiang Baoning is punished
and has no way out,

667
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,320
I’m pleased, too.

668
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:52,760
However,

669
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,479
the Grand Empress Dowager defends her.

670
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,199
How can I totally get rid of her?

671
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,840
Commandery Princess Jia’nan

672
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,360
has done such an immoral thing.

673
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,439
It’s quite embarrassing.

674
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,959
She can’t be the Empress

675
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,600
simply as she wishes.

676
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:12,760
Even if the Grand Empress Dowager
brings it up again,

677
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,639
the Empress Dowager will be too busy
for her birthday to care about that.

678
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:18,959
Grandfather.

679
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:19,534
Mm.

680
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:22,840
The Empress Dowager said

681
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:26,919
she wanted me to be a Noble Consort.

682
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,000
Can I still be it?

683
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,159
After what I did today,

684
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,439
will His Majesty hate me?

685
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,000
What you did today

686
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,560
has helped the Empress Dowager.

687
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:43,679
She said

688
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,239
she would make you the Empress

689
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,760
at her birthday party.

690
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,520
Grandfather,

691
00:36:58,399 --> 00:36:59,120
is that true?

692
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:04,760
Tongxin,

693
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:08,280
you’ve got a bright future for yourself.

694
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,879
I feel happy for you,

695
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:18,239
but I also worry about you.

696
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:25,879
So, you hate to marry His Majesty?

697
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:28,479
I don’t want to spend my whole life
in the Palace.

698
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,320
In life,

699
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,199
happiness matters most.

700
00:37:37,175 --> 00:37:37,775
Come on.

701
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:38,550
Mm?

702
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,560
My grandmother visited me
with some useful things.

703
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,439
But you came without anything.

704
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:42,360
Why did you come, then?

705
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,320
I climbed over the wall to get in.

706
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,481
I couldn’t take many things with me.

707
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:49,959
But I’ve got two eggs for you.

708
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,159
How can I have it?

709
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,399
Are you crazy?

710
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:06,275
Come on.

711
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:09,959
It’s already midnight.

712
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:10,959
As an apology,

713
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,239
let me take you somewhere.

714
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,239
Come on.

715
00:39:09,439 --> 00:39:10,879
Enjoy the noodles before they get cold.

716
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,840
What do you mean?

717
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,959
The bell has struck.
It’s already a new day.

718
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,840
I know today is your birthday.

719
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,600
I’ve made you some birthday noodles.

720
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:33,080
Mother, you made the noodles, right?

721
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,520
How do you know?

722
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,320
Because

723
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,280
I taste no salt in the noodles.

724
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,239
It can’t be the cook who made them.

725
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,280
Um...

726
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,959
I’ll ask the cook to make some for you.

727
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,239
You only cook once a year

728
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:54,000
to make noodles for my birthday.

729
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,760
I’ll eat them up.

730
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,000
Your Grace!

731
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:03,760
What happened?

732
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,239
During the hunting,

733
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,919
the bear that was tranquilized

734
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:10,000
suddenly went crazy for no reason.

735
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,439
To save His Majesty,

736
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:15,399
Zhenying died on the Hunting Ground.

737
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:20,120
Take me there immediately!

738
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,560
What exactly happened?

739
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:35,320
What exactly happened?

740
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,159
Tell us, Duke Jiang!

741
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:37,879
Your Highness,

742
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:41,479
when Princess Yong’an knew
her husband died,

743
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,479
she rushed to the Hunting Ground.

744
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,239
Unexpectedly, roads are slippery
on the rainy day

745
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,600
and her carriage fell off the cliff.

746
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,360
Your Highness.

747
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,439
Poor Baoning.

748
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,159
Your Highness,

749
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:55,919
we will take good care

750
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,239
of Baoning.

751
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,640
Baoning, good girl, don’t cry.

752
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,282
Mm.

753
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,120
You’ve lost your mother.

754
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,000
Go live with me in the Palace.

755
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,239
What do you think?

756
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,080
- I’ll always protect you.
- Mm.

757
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:29,879
What?

758
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,399
The noodles taste bad?

759
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:47,239
Thank you.

760
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,120
Since my mother died,

761
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:53,719
no one has made birthday noodles for me.

762
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:04,320
In Jinxi,

763
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,080
we eat noodles with garlic.

764
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:06,840
Here.

765
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,080
Don’t push it.

766
00:42:10,472 --> 00:42:10,936
Oh.

767
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:13,719
How dirty!

768
00:42:16,478 --> 00:42:17,439
