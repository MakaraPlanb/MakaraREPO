1
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,880
-Cha.
-Huh?

2
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,280
The one wearing the checked shirt
is pretty cute.

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,360
I like the other one.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,880
Dark and sweet. Exotic.

5
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,000
But, you already have Ardhan. Let me
have one. Don't take all the boys.

6
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,640
It's okay for me to admire
another boy's looks once in a while.

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,520
It's just for a little bit.

8
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,680
He looks so sweet.

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,240
Okay. Let me ask you this.

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,640
Who is more handsome? Him or Ardhan?

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,960
My boyfriend is more handsome,
of course.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,280
But if it's sweet looks,
there's something about him.

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,720
Karissa, one boy is enough.
Don't try to get other boys' attention.

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,040
You have to remember
that you already have Ardhan.

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,120
Oh, my gosh. I really don't know
how to continue this.

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,400
Don't try to get other boys' attention.

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,640
-He's not...
-One boy is enough!

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,400
Ardhan's not here! It should be okay.

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,840
Baby. When did you get here?

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,760
-She's doomed.
-I've been here for a while.

21
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,080
Girls. When they see a handsome boy,
their eyes go wide right away.

22
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,520
-Don't keep staring at him.
-Hey!

23
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,440
-A handsome boy is right here too.
-No!

24
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,920
He left because of you.

25
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Don't blame me.
He's not confident enough.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,480
He's afraid
that he's not as handsome as me.

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,200
Babe, I'm sorry.

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,240
I was just looking.
No emotions were involved.

29
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,240
"I'm disappointed with you.
You messed around with me.

30
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,400
Rather than having this broken heart,...

31
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
it's better for me to die."

32
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,520
But, I'm on a diet.

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,040
So it's better that you give this
to someone else.

34
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,040
Oh, yeah. And...

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,720
you don't need to send gifts
to my house anymore.

36
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,280
Fino.

37
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,120
Zea isn't on the same level as you.

38
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,200
Zea is messing around with you.

39
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,920
Fino.

40
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,880
Please, don't be reckless.

41
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,360
I'm sorry for making you wait
a long time.

42
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,800
I'll forgive you,...

43
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,600
as long as you agree to join me
on this rooftop.

44
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,200
Okay. I agree to join you.

45
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,640

46
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,880
Let's take a photo.

47
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,000
One, two, three.

48
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,960
Hey.

49
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,120
Is it true?

50
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,640
Zea and Fino are dating now?

51
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,920
I never thought that
the Frog Prince fairy tale was real.

52
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,480
Yeah. Zea's the princess.
The Frog Prince is Fino.

53
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,000
But, why didn't Zea just choose me?

54
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,840
Hey. Don't you already have Fiona?

55
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,000
You haven't even made it happen
with one girl,...

56
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,760
and you're going for another person.

57
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,440
You frog.

58
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,320
-You're too confident.
-Why are you calling me a frog?

59
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,120
-You're so noisy.
-Frog.

60
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,680
Hey.

61
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,400
Are you jealous?

What are you saying?

63
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,120
Here you go.

64
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,880
Good morning, Zea.

65
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,000
Zea.

66
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,560
Have you seen Fino's post?

67
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,360
I haven't seen it yet. Why?

68
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,440
Were you really alone on the rooftop
with him, Zea?

69
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,840
Zea. I don't think I believe it.
That edited, right?

70
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,080
So, what happened was...

71
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,160
Yesterday, he was being reckless
and was going to kill himself.

72
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,160
Because I broke his heart.

73
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,440
Seriously?

74
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,160
See? That's because you all
took the joke too far.

75
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,520
I'm so sorry, Zea. I really didn't know
Fino would be like that.

76
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,000
You took the joke too far.
I already told you.

77
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,160
-But, you also agreed with it.
-But, it was your idea!

78
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,320
But, the problem is that you
also agreed with it!

79
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,480
-Don't blame each other.
-Yeah, it's already happen.

80
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,800
It's okay.

81
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,800
Oh, my gosh, Ares.

82
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,720
That's just Fino's little trick
to mess around with Zea.

83
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,000
Why would he go and say
he was going to kill himself?

84
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,160
What a loser.

85
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,840
This is going to be dangerous for Zea.

86
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,880
First, he'll try to pretend
to commit suicide.

87
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,600
And he could do more than that to Zea.

88
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,040
We can't let this happen.

89
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,520
This is about Zea.

90
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,280

and an asset of this school.

93
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,200
Don't let this happen, Ares.

94
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,880
Just say you're jealous
because Fino can get Zea.

95
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,760
"Jealous."

96
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,720
I'm a gentleman.
I won't use any trick like that.

97
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,320
Come on.

98
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,920
-Is he not going to ask us too?
-I don't know.

99
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,200
Let's go.

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,080
How could you?

102
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,000
Just because Fino likes you,
you did whatever you pleased...

103
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,200
and made him wait
in the cafeteria that long?

104
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,040
Unacceptable.

105
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,000
What does this have to do with you?

106
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,120
Do you like Fino? I support you.

107

Fighting.

108
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,560
That's so gross if I'm with him.
Zea, I like Ares.

109
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,400
That's why I never gave any hope
to other boys.

I want to apologize to you
for what happened before.

126
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,680
I did all of that to get
your attention, Zea.

127

You're such a hypocrite.

I promise I won't bother you again.

win your heart. In a fair way.

It's okay, Fin. I forgive you.

134
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,480
Thank you so much, Zea.

135
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,960
Why are you still here? Go.

don't you feel
that something's off with Fino?

139
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,160
Why did he suddenly apologize?

140
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,240
No. Let's go.

141
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,400
I already apologized to Zea.

142
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,320
Did Ares tell Fino to apologize?

143
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,160
There's no way.
And Ares is a nice person.

Next time, tell me if Fino
or someone else bothers you.

147
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,120
Ares told Fino to apologize, didn't he?

148
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Because after he apologized,
he went to Ares right away.

178
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,400
Let's give them our best
and do the best, okay?

179
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,560
Okay!

180
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,920
-I'm scared.
-One, two, three.

181
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,117
Girls' power!

182
00:15:22,157 --> 00:15:25,797
Without further ado, here they are.

183
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,160
Wait, it looks like there's a bomb here.

184
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,600
Come with me.

185
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,920
A bomb?

186
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,440
Something's wrong.

187
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,440
If it's really a bomb,
we have to get out of here.

188
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,440
But, we still don't know what it is.

189
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,880
Let's go!

190
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,400
I think we need to bring it outside.

191
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,720
Come on.

192
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,560
I have a bad feeling about this.

193
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,080
Let's go outside now.

194
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,720
Get out!

195
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,600
What's going on?

196
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
What was that?

197
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,720
Wasn't that just fireworks?

198
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Fireworks?

199
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,480
So it means that our event is a failure
because we got pranked, guys.

200
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,600
We have to find who did this.

201
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,240
Calderioz, come with me.

202
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,880
Security, come here.

203
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,680
-Check the whole school. Hurry.
-Yes, sir.

204
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,840
I'm so angry, guys.
We already practiced so hard,...

205
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,640
but we only performed half of the song!

206
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,600
It's okay, Sel.

207
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,720
What's important is that
we gave a great performance, right?

208
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,000
It's okay. What matters now is Calderioz
trying to find the one who did this.

209
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,680
-Okay?
-Okay.

210
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,960
You're okay, right?

211
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,080
Are you okay?

212
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,040
I'm okay.

213
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,240
Who are you?

214
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,360
Who ordered you to do this?

215
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,280
I'm asking one more time.

216
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,080
I'm a new member of Retro.
Our leader told me to do this.

217
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,800
Why did you terrorize our school?

218
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,800
Retro wants revenge against Calderioz.

219
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,400
Were you the ones
who attacked me that time?

220
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,800
Were you?

221
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,080
Hey, what is this?

222
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,200
Arka.

223
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Explain everything to me now.

224
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,360
How rude.

225
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,640
You came into someone's place
without asking permission.

226
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,160
You ordered two of your members
to terrorize Calderioz, right?

227
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,920
Don't tell lies.

228
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,280
They're all looking for trouble!

229
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,160
We're not looking for trouble!
You started this!

230
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,440
Shut up!

231
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,960
You shut up!

232
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,360
Retro...

233
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,720
wouldn't look for trouble
without a reason.

234
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,600
-Just shut up!
-What's wrong with you?

235
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,440
-What?
-What?

236
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,360
Take that!

237
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,240
Hey!

238
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,720
Stop.

239
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,400
You're their friends, right?

240
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,560
Pay for the damages first.

241
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,320
Pay for the damages.

242
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,480
Where are you going?
Pay for the damages first.

243
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,560
How much do I have to pay?
For your wife and children at home?

244
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,240
Just for today. How much, mister?

245
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,520
Okay, 2,5.

246
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,320
Here.

247
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,760
Hey, this isn't enough.

248
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,160
I'm a member of the Retro gang.

249
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,120
I'm the one who set up the bomb here.

250
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
You can trust my words.

251
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,080
Those two aren't from Retro.

252
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,760
That means you have an intruder
in your headquarters.

253
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,600
I apologize...

254
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,920
for blaming the wrong people.

255
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,840
Come here, bro.

256
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,081
I have a feeling...

257
00:24:03,121 --> 00:24:05,280
that there's going to be a huge war
between motorcycle gangs.

258
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,120
With Calderioz being pitted
against other motorcycles gangs.

259
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,640
Lio?

260
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,600
Lio!

261
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,120
Zea.

262
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,960
How are you? I missed you so much.

263
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
I'm fine, as you can see.

264
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,280
Then, let's talk inside.
It's not comfortable out here.

265
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,640
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

266
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,840
-Auntie...
-A new one?

267
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,920
"A new one"?

268
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,000
No. Auntie, please bring some drinks
to my room.

269
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,960
My friend has come from far away.
Bring some snacks too.

270
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,080
-Okay, Zea.
-Thank you.

271
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,520
Lio, let's talk upstairs.

272
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,800
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

273
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,880
Wasn't Zea's boyfriend
the one from before?

274
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,480
The cute one?

275
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,480
This one's handsome too!
Really handsome!

276
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,000
I've tried looking for information.
They're trying to...

277
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,560
You have a new boyfriend?

278
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,480
No, I don't. Why?

279
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,840
She said that you have a new boyfriend.

280
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,000
No, she just misunderstood.

281
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,920
Because yesterday,
I got into an accident with Ares.

282
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,040
And he brought me home.

283
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,000
And maybe she thought
he was my boyfriend.

284
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,720
What's certain is that I won't approve
if you dated Ares.

285
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,080
There's no way that I would date him.
I'm still loyal to the Wolves.

286
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,640
Zea.

287
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,880
Be careful with Ares.

288
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,040
He's the one from the very beginning...

289
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,080
who didn't want the Wolves and Calderioz
to be rivals in Jakarta.

290
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,680
And that's what caused your brother
to fall into a coma.

291
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,440
Ares has to be punished
for what he did to Eros.

292
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,640
Zea.

293
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,040
I need your support
with the mission that we agreed on.

294
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,840
Okay?

295
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,840
Okay, Lio.

296
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,160
This man of yours
isn't going to stay the night, right?

297
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,760
Of course not, Auntie.

298
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,280
Then I'm relieved.

299
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,240
Because your mother had told me...

300
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,400
that I have to look after you
while you're here.

301
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,960
Yes, Auntie.

302
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,720
Lionel is like my own big brother.

303
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,840
He's also the one taking care
of Eros in Bandung.

304
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,720
I see.

305
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,120
Thank you for taking care of Eros.

306
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,560
I was really sad when I heard
that Eros is in a coma.

307
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,040
Eros really cared about me.

308
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,640
Auntie, Eros will recover. He will.

309
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,080
I'm sure that Eros will recover soon.

310
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,120
Amen.

311
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,440
Okay. Eat the snacks, okay?
And have your drinks.

312
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,040
-I'm going to the kitchen.
-Thank you, Auntie.

313
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,120
Aiden.

314
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,320
Huh? Your face looks terrible.

315
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,640
Do you want me to treat
your injuries first?

316
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,640
-How sweet of you.
-I'm serious.

317
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,560
So sweet.

318
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,560
What's with you? What I need
is Serra's attention, not yours.

319
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,760
-I'm going.
-Where are you going?

320
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,520
My face is all beat up.

321
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,400
My heart is tired
and needs to be "charged".

322
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,680
Do you get it?

323
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,240
Just seeing Serra
already makes me happy, Mor.

324
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
I'm going. Another high five.

325
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,640
-I'm going.
-Take care.

326
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,000
Oh, my gosh.

327
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Is the sun still in your eyes?

328
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,000
Don't do that. It's embarrassing.
People will stare at us.

329
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,200
So what? Just let them.

330
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,880
So you won't feel hot. Go on and study.

331
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,960
-So you'll be smart.
-And what if you get tired?

332
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,520
I'm not tired.

333
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:24,280
-Say yes!
-Say yes!

334
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,360
I love you.

335
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,560
I love you too.

336
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,840
