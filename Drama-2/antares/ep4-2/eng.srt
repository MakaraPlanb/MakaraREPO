1
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,920
Can't sleep?

2
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,600
I know a better place to see the stars.

3
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,080
You want to go there?

4
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,800
Okay.

5
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,320
-It's so beautiful.
-I know. Just like you.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,320
Drink this.

7
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,360
I don't want you to get a cold.

8
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,215
I don't want your parents
yelling at me for getting you sick.

9
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:33,716
You're not my private doctor.
Nobody's going yell at you.

10
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,850
Drink this.

11
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,840
Coffee is the best aid
for a night like this.

12
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,120
Especially when you're gazing
at the stars.

13
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,640
Do you have to drink from the spot
where my lips touched the mug?

14
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:19,101
It's called an indirect kiss.

15
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,680
Save me a little.
I spent so much time brewing it.

16
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,160
-Can I ask you something?
-What's that?

17
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,240
Why are you in a bike gang?

18
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,200
Initially, I was just curious.

19
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,480
I thought people fear them.

20
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:07,801
Once I dug deeper, I was hooked.

21
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,681
Because Calderioz
is nothing like the stereotype.

22
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,320
From then on,
I tried to change that stigma.

23
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:26,169
I'm going to show that bike gangs
are not all about parties and trouble.

24
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:35,320
They can also be about dignity,
morals. and helping others.

25
00:03:37,563 --> 00:03:40,483
I have a big dream about Calz.

26
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I want to unite all the bike gangs
in Jabodetabek and Bandung.

27
00:03:58,491 --> 00:04:03,051
I know it's not going to be easy.

28
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,800
-Come on, let's play a prank on them.
-Count me out.

29
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,480
I'm out too. Come on.

30
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,560
-Don't worry. I'll back you up. Yes.
-Seriously?

31
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,640
We'd better sleep.
Leave them alone. Okay?

32
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,480
I just want to say hello to them,
that's all.

33
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,400
I'm going to protect them from satan
who looks exactly like you.

34
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,282
What are you doing?

35
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:49,202
Go to your tent.

36
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,160
-Anya, you're invading my space.
-No, I'm not.

37
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,240
-Move!
-In your dreams!

38
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,560
If you two keep fighting,
we won't be able to sleep.

39
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,480
-Karissa, wake up!
-Pocong!

40
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,800
Aiden?

41
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Ghost!

42
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,360
-What happened?
-We saw pocong.

43
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,840
-What are you doing in here?
-There's a ghost in our tent.

44
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:52,397
What's that?

45
00:05:55,836 --> 00:06:01,276
Moreo! It was you all along!

46
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,840
How could you?
You think that's funny?

47
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:13,240
Where am I?

48
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,401
We caught you.

49
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,731
Just stop it.

50
00:06:17,364 --> 00:06:19,128
Laskar made me do it.

51
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:23,680
What? You're alone in this one.
I'm going to bed.

52
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,680
Are you kidding me?
What if somebody got hurt?

53
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,280
Would you still think it's funny?

54
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:37,160
-Are you okay, Serra?
-Yeah, I'd better go back to sleep.

55
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,080
But, tell Moreo to stop pranking us,
nobody's laughing.

56
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,880
-He spooked us.
-On his behalf, I apologize.

57
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,640
Bye. Good night.

58
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,240
-Babe, don't ever prank me like that.
-I will never do that to you.

59
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,120
-Promise?
-I promise.

60
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,720
-I'd better go now.
-Bye.

61
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Come here.

62
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,320
Go to your tent and don't come out
for the rest of the night.

63
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,960
-Sorry!
-Good night!

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,640
I love you, Selina!

65
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,080
Hello, Lio.

66
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,680
Zea, Aeros' condition last night
has become worse.

67
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,480
-How is he now?
-He's getting better now.

68
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,440
Where were you last night?
My calls couldn't get through.

69
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,520
I went hiking with my schoolmates.

70
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,480
There was no network coverage
on the mountains.

71
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,200
Zea, don't get carried away
with your feelings for Ares.

72
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,520
We don't have much time left.

73
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:18,160
I know if Aeros could speak,
he'd tell us who did that to him.

74
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,920
What are you writing? Let me see.

75
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,480
-No, Aiden.
-Just a peek.

76
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,040
-Aiden, please.
-Let me see.

77
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,080
-I'm just going to peek.
-No.

78
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:14,339
What's wrong? Did you guys have a fight?

79
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,459
What do you think about Ares?

80
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:25,819
He's the best buddy I've ever known.

81
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:29,880
He's so loyal to the gang.

82
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,320
He never lets anyone down.

83
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,262
He has done so much for us.

84
00:09:40,302 --> 00:09:42,921
He's the opposite
of what he's showing to us,...

85
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:46,120
being solemn and cold.

86
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,666
But deep down, he has gentle heart.
That's why we respect him.

87
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:54,306
If we find any traitor,...

88
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,400
we'll end him.

89
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,400
Let's go.

90
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,840
Thank you for fighting the bike gang
who has been extorting us every day.

91
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,400
If you didn't come here to save us,
we won't have anything left.

92
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,680
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

93
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,200
Why are you asking about him?

94
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,360
Do you curious about him?

95
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,400
-Show it to him.
-What are you talking about?

96
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,520
How about your relationship with Serra?

97
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,760
We were talking about Ares, not Serra.

98
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,280
She knows how I feel about her.

99
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,000
But you know her.

100
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,960
What if...

101
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,800
As her best friend,...

102
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,440
can you help me
to get back together with her?

103
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,440
-Do you have any suggestions?
-Let me think.

104
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,320
How about a gift that you think
she would like?

105
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,360
It doesn't have to be expensive,
but it has to be personal.

106
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,960
Okay. Can you help me pick the gift?
How about after school?

107
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,920
Okay.

108
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,800
Did I hit her with the ball?

109
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,800
Keep playing.

110
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,440
Nurse!

111
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,960
Lay down.

112
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,960
-It really hurts.
-Really?

113
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,277
I'm going to go and find Miss Dina.
She'll know what to do.

114
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:10,037
Please don't go.
I just want you to stay with me.

115
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,560
Are you sure?

116
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,040
My head hurts.
I just want you beside me. Please?

117
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,680
I swear, it hurts and I'm dizzy.

118
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,960
I'm okay now,
but please stay here with me.

119
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,624
Sit here.

120
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:32,600
-I'd better leave since you're okay now.
-Where are you going?

121
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,680
-You don't need me.
-Wait! Stay with me! Ares!

122
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,720
This is Serra's favorite store.

123
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,560
Just go and look around.

124
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,800
Zea.

125
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,200
Found your gift already?

126
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,280
Why don't you choose a nice dress,
a bag or a hat?

127
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,240
She'll look very beautiful
when she wears this.

128
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,240
A sunflower is a symbol of faithfulness.

129
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,600
Look.

130
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,760
Yellow represents warmth and happiness.

131
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,800
Those are the things I miss in Serra.

132
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,074
Now she always looks sad,
gloomy and angry.

133
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:18,754
Unlike before.

134
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,360
I want her to be happy and cheerful.

135
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,320
I want to be by her side.

136
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,800
Waiting for her heart to melt,
so she can take me back.

137
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,280
Just like a sunflower.

138
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,200
It always faces the sun.

139
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,880
What are you doing?

140
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,440
I just wanted to see how it looks.
Don't flatter yourself.

141
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,520
I thought...

142
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,880
Thank you.

143
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,560
(I'm waiting for you in the alley.
Come now or else.)

144
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,400
(Okay.)

145
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,960
Do want to go to a concert with us?
I have five tickets.

146
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,920
Aiden gave them to me.

147
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,600
Sorry, I'm not feeling well.

148
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,960
But, go ahead and have fun.

149
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,440
-This is for you, Ares.
-What's that?

150
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,640
It's okay, I'm giving it to you.

151
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,000
-You shouldn't have.
-Take it. I made this myself.

152
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Thanks.

153
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,360
-Why didn't you come to the alley?
-I was busy.

154
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,480
Do you really expect me to come
everytime you want me to?

155
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,000
I don't work for you.

156
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,360
-But you said, "okay".
-I did.

157
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,201
And now I have better things to do.

158
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:00,760
What I said to you earlier
no longer applies.

159
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,320
Sorry for that.

160
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,840
(I'm outside.)

161
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,120
(I want to tell you something
and also want to give you something.)

162
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,560
(It'll be quick.)

163
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,920
A sunflower is a symbol of faithfulness.

164
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,440
It always faces the sun.

165
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,720
Look at the color,
it's warm and cheerful.

166
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,520
I'm giving you this
to represent my faith in you.

167
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,920
I want to see you smile again.

168
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,800
And I will be faithful to you
just like a sunflower.

169
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:08,850
Till your heart melts
and you are ready to take me back.

170
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,530
Actually, I asked you to meet me
because I wanted to put it on your hair.

171
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Wear it, please.

172
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:21,400
As a symbol that you want me back too.

173
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:29,280
And I know you will look prettier
wearing it.

174
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,320
-Thank you for the lunch.
-Thanks, Aiden.

175
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,160
-No problem.
-Make it everyday.

176
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,240
I'm collecting rewards from God.
I want to go to heaven.

177
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,480
Why don't I hear "amen"?
I just paid for everybody's lunch!

178
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:57,544
I'm very happy you eat in my cafeteria.

179
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:59,920
So many customers.

180
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,120
Keep the happy spirit.
It will help you stay young.

181
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:09,080
I know.
I may be old, but I'm young at heart.

182
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,720
That's the reason I hang with you boys.
I want to stay young.

183
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,440
I was once like you,
I too belonged to a bike gang.

184
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,480
I looked just like Ares, very handsome.

185
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,520
Don't compare yourself to Ares.
It's like night and day.

186
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,560
But it's okay if you compare him to me
because I'm as good looking as him.

187
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,521
As good looking
as a pair of flip-flops maybe.

188
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:37,080
Stop comparing yourself to him.

189
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,680
You're being delusional.

190
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,600
Hey, Mor, even pregnant women
are not allowed to see your face.

191
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,280
What the...

192
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,760
Do you realize
that we're in 12th grade now?

193
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,640
I remember my first day in school.

194
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:02,240
I remember Moreo came late,
wore the wrong uniform,...

195
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,920
and he looked terrible.

196
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,160
And he got punished by the seniors.

197
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,920
Admit it, you're the king of tardiness.
When will you change?

198
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,881
I don't think he will.

199
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:18,440
He's still waiting
for his tooth to grow.

200
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,440
Sorry, dude.
My tooth is special plug-and-play.

201
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,440
-Put it back on.
-Careful, I don't want to lose my tooth.

202
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,600
-Just put it back on.
-Okay.

203
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,560
Why are you discriminating
against my tooth?

204
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,360
That's the reality.

205
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,480
Then it's been two years
since I started dating Karissa.

206
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,720
She put a spell on you
to keep you from cheating on her.

207
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,760
-I know you want to cheat on her.
-Are you crazy? Never!

208
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,400
Do you remember
how romantic you were with Serra?

209
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,440
-You were the favorite couple.
-See, we're not the only couple.

210
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,160
We're in 12th grade,...

211
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,840
and Mang Oji is one of many people
who has witnessed our silliness.

212
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,801
How about we take a wefie,...

213
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:26,080
and put the printed
photo on that board,...

214
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,462
so Mang Oji can see the picture
whenever he misses us. Well?

215
00:23:29,502 --> 00:23:31,720
-Let's do it, man.
-Let's go.

216
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,400
I'm happy I can be in the same picture
with you boys, for memory.

217
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,080
-Sit down, Mang Oji.
-Sit here.

218
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,880
-Look handsome, okay?
-I was born handsome.

219
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,560
-With or without my tooth?
-With, please.

220
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,800
Ready? One, two...

221
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,280
Zea!

222
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,320
-Do you know where Serra is?
-Serra? I don't know.

223
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,160
-My pick-up's here. See you.
-Are you sure?

224
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,440
-I swear, I haven't seen her.
-All right.

225
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,160
-I'll go now. Bye.
-Take care. Bye.

226
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:25,332
-Take care!
-Okay!

227
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,800
You're going home or going to the club?

228
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,520
What's wrong with him?

229
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,720
Who are you?

230
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Pull over!

231
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,280
Aiden!

232
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,920
Okay. Get up.

233
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,240
Aiden.

234
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,560
Aiden.

235
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,160
Aiden!

236
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,480
Wake up, Aiden. Look at me.

237
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,240
Aiden, wake up!

238
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,960
Please.

239
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,240
You have to know that I love you, Serra.

240
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,800
Please forgive me.

241
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,000
I failed to make you happy.

242
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,560
-Aiden...
-I love you, Serra.

243
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,880
-Aiden...
-Forgive me.

244
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:01,200
Wake up, Aiden!

245
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,520
Aiden!

246
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,880
Aiden!

247
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,920
