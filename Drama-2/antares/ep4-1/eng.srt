00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,240
(Previously)

2
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,200
Your hand.

3
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,000
It's nothing.

4
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,160
Don't trust Ares.

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,160
He just doesn't want Wolves
and Calderioz together in Jakarta.

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,040
And that's the reason
why your brother is in a coma.

7
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,680
I want us all to be careful.

8
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,120
I know they're going to make
a bigger scene.

9
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,560
They might have already planned for it
and they will do it too.

10
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,800
-Are you okay?
-Sorry. It's nothing.

11
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,280
Focus!

12
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,400
Laskar, I want you to brief
all the Calderioz chiefs,...

13
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,160
and list all of the members.

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,000
Keep an eye on those new recruits.

15
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,880
While it's Sunday,
so you'll have more free time to do it.

16
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,680
-Who are you?
-Please, don't.

17
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,320
-What are you doing here?
-Are you from the Retro Gang?

18
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,000
-I don't think so.
-Take off your helmet.

19
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,560
I'm here...

20
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,960
-to deliver a package.
-Hey!

21
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,640
Is that a bomb?

22
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,840
A package for Moreo?

23
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,760
Let me handle it. Move.

24
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,080
Don't move.

25
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,040
Weight loss supplement?
Who ordered this?

26
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,720
For God's sake, Mor!

27
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,320
(Speedy Delivery Services)

28
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,000

I'll send the pictures...

48

from the Art Performance
on the group chat.

49
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,240
(You should tell the world about it.)

50
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,560
(She's an angel. I'm speechless.)

51
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,920
(Can't even imagine what
your future children would look like.)

52
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,400
What are you guys doing?
You look so busy.

53
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,160
What's the noises
coming from your phones?

54
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,640
Look at this picture.

55
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,360
(Have you checked yourself out
in the mirror?)

56
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,120
(Even Fiona doesn't want you,
let alone Zea.)

57
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
(Ares.)

58
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,600
(Look at this!!
It's National Heartbreak Day!)

59
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,600
I can't believe a picture can create
that much excitement.

60
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,240
Can somebody upload my picture?
I want to be famous too.

61
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,680
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

62
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,840
Let's take a selfie.
Stand here, I like the background.

63
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,680
One, two...

64
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,360
-So she's Ares' new girlfriend?
-She's only after his money.

65
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,840
Hey! What did you just say?

66
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,800
Watch your mouth!

67
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,600
-Why are they giving me that look?
-Are you that clueless, Zea?

68
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,200
The whole school is talking about you.

69
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,240
Zea, check Ares' IG.

70
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,840
(Ares is so focused.)

71
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,840
(Delete the picture, Ares!)

72
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,600
(No way!)

73
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,240
(Delete it!)

74
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,960
(No way!)

75
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,840
(Please, delete it.)

76
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,320
(No, Dear.)

77
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,440
Look who's smiling by himself.
It's a sign.

78
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,760
Congrats for making it official.
Can't wait for the celebration.

79
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,200
-Right, Mor?
-We're not officially dating. Okay?

80
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,160
I don't believe it.

81
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,520
You're a lousy liar.
Be honest. Just say it.

82
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,361
You don't have to be embarrassed
about it.

83
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,640
Well, it's not.

84
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,920
Ares.

85
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,841
Oh, man.

86
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:15,440
Looking at both of you
breaks my heart already.

87
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,520
There goes my chance
to make you my girlfriend.

88
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,520
Congrats
for being Ares' 100th girlfriend.

89
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,360
A hundred already?

90
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,880
Let's go. Hurry!

91
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,160
He's following her.

92
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,161
Delete the picture right now.

93
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:42,280
I'd rather die
than be your 100th girlfriend.

94
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,920
You're not going to be
my 100th girlfriend.

95
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,760
Then?

96
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,200
If you do become my girlfriend,
you would be the 231st.

97
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:02,080
What? Are you upset? Jealous?

98
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,320
Don't worry.
I don't have that many exes.

99
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,680
The correct number will be...

100
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,440
You jerk. Delete the photo.

101
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,600
I will, after you delete yours.

102
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,640
Okay.

103
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,160
Done.

104
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,400
Now, it's your turn.

105
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,240
Nope.

106
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,000
Ares' girlfriend is so beautiful.

107
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,040
Well done.
Your attention seeking strategy worked.

108
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,040
But, don't get too excited yet.

109
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,720
Because you can't beat
our gang leader, Anya.

110
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,440
Where's she anyway?
Why isn't she here?

111
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,200
Is she too afraid
to confront me in person?

112
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,320
Or maybe she's sleeping
because she's daydreaming.

113
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,160
You're arrogant. Wait till we tell Anya.

114
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,080
Where are you going, Ares?

115
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,000
Following the love of his life.

116
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,800
Why are you following me?

117
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,960
I'm looking for some reference books
for my assignment.

118
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,080
Okay. But, please keep your distance.
People are watching us.

119
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,440
If somebody dares to try to hurt you,
let me know.

120
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Why?

121
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,400
I'm going to recruit them
to join the Calderioz Gang...

122
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,680
to let them know who's the leader,
and to respect me,...

123
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,200
and they wouldn't dare to hurt you.

124
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,560
Right. Now can you please leave?
I want to be alone.

125
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,560
Okay, on one condition.

126
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,600
You have to come on our touring event.

127
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,240
I'll take your silence as a yes.
Okay, see you.

128
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,120
-Hello, Zea.
-Hello, Lio.

129
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,000
Listen, the Wolves and I
are here to see Aeros.

130
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,720
Are you coming? We miss Aeros.

131
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,320
Me too.

132
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:32,360
-Okay, let me know if you're here.
-I'll entrust Aeros to you.

133
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,720
Bye.

134
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,280
Zea.

135
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,280
Zea.

136
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,280
Huh?

137
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,520
Go take a shower.

138
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,600
Wake up, Miss.
Or you're going to be late.

139
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:18,709
Did you think I was Ares?

140
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,000
Maybe this is what people call love.
Love is stronger when you're apart.

141
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,000
Just leave me alone.

142
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,920
I'm going to shower.

143
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,720
Do you want me to prepare
an extra lunch box for Ares too?

144
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,400
So, both of you can eat together.

145
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,040
Leave me alone!

146
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,120
♪If love is blind...♪

147
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,600
Fiona...

148
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,240
Fiona.

149
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't like you.

150
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,580
Fiona.

151
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:19,880
Serra.

152
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,440
This is for you.

153
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,080
I don't want that bouquet.

154
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,760
Huh? Why?

155
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,280
It was someone else's.

156
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,760
But, my intention is pure. Okay.

157
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,040
There goes another chance.

158
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,874
Miss...

159
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:52,434
Happy Teacher's Day.

160
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,200
It's still months away.

161
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:04,219
Are you coming tomorrow?
Touring with Calderioz.

162
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,320
-I don't think so.
-Why not? You should.

163
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,600
It will be the first time
we're going out as a gang.

164
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,960
Aren't you tired of studying?
You need refreshing.

165
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,440
-Fine.
-There you go.

166
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,600
You're coming, right?

167
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:39,058
I think I'll pass.

168
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,240
My dad just got home
from his business trip abroad.

169
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,640
Usually, after he comes home,
We go out together.

170
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,360
But, have fun, guys.

171
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,800
Serra, you'll be the only one
from the gang who won't be there.

172
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,720
Could you come with us, please?

173
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,040
I have a great idea.

174
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,240
-What if I ask your dad's permission?
-Please don't do that.

175
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,960
-Fine, I'll go with you.
-There you go.

176
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,120
Guys, I think I want to make
a silly pose.

177
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,520
Do you think we are on the beach
or camping on the mountains?

178
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,400
Yeah, a family gathering?

179
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,280
No, it's okay.

180
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,320
Yeah.

181
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,440
I'm not pressing you. But,
it would be nice if you can make it.

182
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,801
-Hello, Anya.
-Ares,...

183
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:50,320
I'm so happy you answered my call.

184
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,640
What do you want? I'm busy.

185
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,440
Calm down.

186
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,320
I just want to make sure about the news
about your bike tour.

187
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,280
Can I come?

188
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,880
Please.

189
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,040
Sorry, all seats are filled.
Next time maybe?

190
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,680
Hey, Anya. This is Moreo.

191
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,840
-I have a free seat.
-Really?

192
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,360
-Yeah, you can ride with me. Okay?
-Okay, count me in.

193
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,520
-Great. I'll see you at 06.00.
-Okay, bye. See you.

194
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,360
Okay, bye.

195
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,800
-Why did you invite her?
-Don't you feel sorry for me?

196
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,760
You're all going to ride
with girls on the back seat.

197
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,880
And the only thing I have on my back
would be my backpack.

198
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,200
Do you know what brand my backpack is?

199
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,960
Ser!

200
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,080
-Thanks.
-Are you okay, right?

201
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Ouch.

202
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,160
Why won't you help me?

203
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,038
You want to help me,
but you also fell. Annoying!

204
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:17,334
-Why are you angry?
-I don't care.

205
00:18:17,374 --> 00:18:19,374
Ser?

206
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,419
Ser.

207
00:18:22,307 --> 00:18:24,307
Ser.

208
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,760
Who ask you to chase me?

209
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
Someone is playing tag.

210
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,920
No need to jump in.
That's not funny.

211
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,800
Serra!

212
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,440
It's all because of you.

213
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,360
-What are you doing?
-Well, okay.

214
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,680
Guys, before we start the tour,
let's pray together in silence.

215
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,240
Let's start praying.

216
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,200
Amen.

217
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,240
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

218
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,560
Can I ride with you?

219
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,520
Sorry. I'm going to ride with Selina.

220
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,360
Let's go, Sel.

221
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,400
(Calz Social Service 2021)

222
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,720
-Is it 60 centimeters?
-Yes, it is.

223
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,800
We collected money
to help people in need...

224
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,680
-Here you go. You're welcome.
-Thank you.

225
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,760
Thank you.

226
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,840
Here you go.

227
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:12,899
-What's wrong, Zea?
-I'm not sure.

228
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:24,765
-Is your foot okay?
-I think I have a splinter in my foot.

229
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,377
-Huh?
-A splinter.

230
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:32,520
Let me see.

231
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,000
-We're going to make a bonfire tonight.
-That's right.

232
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,080
I'm going to tell horror stories
by the fire.

233
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,200
-Why?
-Why not?

234
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,280
What if I get scared?

235
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,240
If you get scared,
I will be there with you.

236
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,720
-What's wrong?
-Huh?

237
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,960
Nothing. Never mind.

238
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,840
I'll be there to protect you.

239
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,160
-What's wrong, babe?
-Moreo did this to me.

240
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,560
-Why are you blaming him?
-Because he always disturbs us.

241
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,560
-Ares is looking for you.
-Speak of the devil!

242
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,760
Are you here to bother us again?

243
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,200
You always bother us
when we want to be alone.

244
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,960
And now it is messing with our minds.

245
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I thought you're here with Anya.
Why don't you go and find her?

246
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,800
Let's go.

247
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,320
I'm so mad!

248
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,680
Why were we assigned to fetch water?
Why didn't they tell Anya to do it?

249
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,640
She's the unwanted member
of this tour. Why us?

250
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,200
Don't get mad. We're helping people.

251
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,680
I know, but why us, Cleo?

252
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,360
-You look so nervous.
-I need to pee.

253
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:29,760
-Pee? I wonder where the toilet is.
-Do you know?

254
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,080
How about behind the tree?

255
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,560
Don't forget to ask permission first.
You're not scared, are you?

256
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,040
Do you want me to guard you?

257
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,120
I think this place is spooky.
Stay close to me.

258
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,800
Okay.

259
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,360
Don't forget to ask permission.

260
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,560
Over there! Is that a river?

261
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,720
-Yes.
-Yes.

262
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,720
You go there.

263
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,080
I'm scared.
There can be crocodiles there.

264
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,240
-Crocodiles?
-You're a brave girl, aren't you?

265
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,680
I love you. Good luck.

266
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,960
-Crocodile!
-Where?

267
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,560
Hey, Cleo. You didn't see...

268
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,680
-my "crocodile", did you?
-No, I promise!

269
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,480
Maybe a little.

270
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,120
-Sit here.
-Okay.

271
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
Slowly.

272
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,680
-Does it still hurt?
-Just a little.

273
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,960
Let me have a look again.

274
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,920
I think I'm okay now.

275
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,938
For God's sake!

276
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,720
Will you stop imitating scenes
from a Korean drama?

277
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,080
Everywhere I look!

278
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,800
Mor, where are the others?

279
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,040
Megan!

280
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,080
Why did he run away?
Say hello maybe? "Hello."

281
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,760
Why are you closing your eyes?
Did you see a ghost?

282
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,040
I saw a crocodile.

283
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,960
A crocodile?

284
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay now.

285
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,440
-Does it sting?
-Are the ants still on my shirt?

286
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,200
Are you saying
Cleo saw your "crocodile"?

287
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,480
It was all his fault.

288
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,120
I told him to watch my six,
but he bailed out on me.

289
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,040
You can't expect Aiden
to guard your "crocodile".

290
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,240
He can't even guard a betta fish.

291
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:42,160
It was all your fault.
I was attacked by weaver ants.

292
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,040
Listen, after this,
you should have marry Cleo.

293
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,400
There's no more secret between you two.

294
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,600
-She's leaving, man.
-Cleo!

295
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,528
-That's too far, man. I'm out of here.
-She's leaving.

296
00:27:07,568 --> 00:27:10,448
I'm going to take care
of my own "crocodile".

297
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,040
I want to thank you guys
for your participation...

298
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,054
in our social service program today.

299
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:23,720
We're going to do it
once every three months.

300
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,520
And I hope we can help more people
with this kind of program.

301
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,760
-Go, Calz!
-All the way, Calz!

302
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,640
-Go, Calz!
-All the way, Calz!

303
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,960
So, in three months,...

304
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,480
how about we help 300 orphans?

305
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,440
I'm all for it.
Round of applause for him!

306
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,240
-You're the best!
-He's my friend.

307
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,160
You've got my support.

308
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,600
Ladies and gentlemen,...

309
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:14,200
I'm going to entertain you all
with something.

310
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,880
Just tell us what is that.

311
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,960
Can you be serious
for one second, please?

312
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,320
-I'm going to recite a poem.
-A poem?

313
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,440
Let's hope it wouldn't end up
with a stand-up comedy act.

314
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,000
It's late at night.

315
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,760
But, getting your attention...

316
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,160
is oh so right.

317
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,280
Family is my number one priority.

318
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,160
Being in the Calderioz family.

319
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,400
And you're going to be
a part of my own family someday.

320
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:17,120
I have a dream
about the future Aiden junior.

321
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:25,600
It's going to be small in size,
about 50 millimeters inside your womb.

322
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:43,680
With you as my shore.

323
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,920
Calz is where I find joy,...

324
00:29:53,318 --> 00:29:58,278
cry, and awaken from my sleep.

325
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,400
And you, are where I find comfort.

326
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,896
Someday,...

327
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,400
or later on tonight,...

328
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,880
after I have made you all speechless
with my poem.

329
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,600
I'm sure that...

330
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,761
your heart...

331
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:51,680
and your eyes are talking to the cloud.

332
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:58,520
To the sky and to the universe.

333
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,160
And I'm sure...

334
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,760
you will remember this night
for the rest of your lives.

335
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
But, I will always be...

336
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:22,219
a prisoner in your heart
till the day that I die.

337
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,360
That's my buddy!

338
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,800
Good job, man.

339
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,360
♪Ramadan is here♪

340
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,440
-I can't stand the mosquitos!
-Here, let me spray the repellent.

341
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,880
-Me too.
-My hands too, please.

342
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,320
What?

343
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,440
A mosquito can't ask for a repellent.

344
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,600
All right, here you go.

345
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,920
Now we know that Aiden
has a noble dream. How about you?

346
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,920
I'm dreaming of marrying Fiona someday.

347
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,960
You got my support.

348
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,560
I hope she would be drunk enough
to accept your proposal.

349
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,240
How could you? You're my friend.

350
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,400
Mor, I'll always be there for you.
Whatever you do.

351
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,280
-I love you, baby.
-I love you more.

352
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,640
-But she's out of your league, Mor.
-Why, do you like Fiona too?

353
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,240
She made a move on me...

354
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,360
when she asked me
to give her a ride home.

355
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,680
-What can I say?
-Say no more.

356
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,080
Stop it, man.

357
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,040
Can't sleep?
