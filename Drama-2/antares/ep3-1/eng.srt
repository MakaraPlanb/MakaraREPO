1
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,320
(Previously)

2
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,801
You're the only girl who dares...

3
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:38,200
go against the Calderioz gang
and Anya's gang.

4
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,880
I don't know if it's you or I
who should be careful.

5
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,080
Sandra.

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,480
You?

7
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,960
What are you doing?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
You're doing something perverted,
aren't you?

9
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,160
Taking a picture of someone
without their consent,...

10
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,200
is violating their privacy.

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,200
Why is Zea taking such a long time
in the bathroom?

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,640
Zea?

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,800
I'm pretty surprised
that you know martial arts.

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,560
Who are you actually?

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,520
(Do Not Attempt To Reenact This)

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,000
Hey!

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,520
Where do you think you're going?

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,720
Where do you think you're going?

19
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,920
Oh, my gosh.

20
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,320
Kids.

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,720
Are you okay?

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,640
Zea.

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,560
Zea.

24
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,080
Zea.

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,640
Zea, wake up.

26
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,520
-Zea.
-Call an ambulance. Help them.

27
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,280
Zea.

28
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,640
Are you okay?

29
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,320
I'm fine.

30
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,720
Get up.

31
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,320
Kids, are you sure you're okay?

32
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,560
-May we use those chairs?
-Get the chairs.

33
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,520
Thank you.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,720
-Here.
-Thank you, sir.

35
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,600
Drink this.

36
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,480
Thanks.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,440
Let's go to the hospital.

38
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,840
No need for that. I'm fine.

39
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,080
Hello? Can you come here right now?

40
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,440
It's important.
I'll share my location with you. Okay?

41
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,280
Okay.

42
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
Who were those people?

43
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,440
Your enemies?

44
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
I don't know.

45
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,040
Did you sprain it?

46
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,360
-Sir, do you have some tissues?
-I have some.

47
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,000
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

48
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,560
It's a good thing we fell
on top of those boxes.

49
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,280
If we didn't, it would have been worse.

50
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,920
Are you worried about me?

51
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,600
Yes, I'm worried.

52
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,240
Ares, what happened to you?

53
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,840
Ares, tell me who did
this to both of you.

54
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,920
There were three motorcycles
that got really close to me.

55
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,480
Find out who dared to do all of this.

56
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,640
Okay, I'll look for them.

57
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,560
The license plate number is B 1775 SUB.

58
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,040
But, remember, not to accuse anyone
without proof.

59
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,840
Okay.

60
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,040
I'll take Zea home first.
Take care of my motorcycle.

61
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,120
Gan, find a taxi.

62
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,560
I can go by myself.

63
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,360
I'm taking you home. Come on.

64
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,600
You don't have to. I can go by myself.

65
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,440
-I'm taking you home.
-You don't have to.

66
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,360
I can take a taxi by myself.

67
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,240
You're so noisy
even when you're in pain.

68
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,520
What more when you are fine.

69
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,320
I'm taking you home now.

70
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,600
Okay?

71
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,200
I'm sure there's a new gang
that's looking for attention.

72
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Come on, man. Ares already told us.

73
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,120
We can't accuse anyone without proof.

74
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,520
This could be someone pitting people
against each other.

75
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,040
So that the motorcycle gangs
would fight each other.

76
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,080
Be patient.

77
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,120
-What is that?
-A license plate number.

78
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,120
We have to find information right away.

79
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,520
Okay. I want you, you, and you...

80
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,240
to gather the members.

81
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,600
What happened to you?

82
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,400
There was an accident.
She fell off a motorcycle.

83
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,560
Oh, my gosh! How did that happen?

84
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,480
-Her mother has to know about this.
-Auntie, don't.

85
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,640
Don't tell my mom and dad.

86
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,080
-But, you're...
-Don't. I'm fine.

87
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,360
Okay. Fine, come inside.

88
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,280
Be careful. Come on. Sit down, okay?

89
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,160
Slowly.

90
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,520
Thanks.

91
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,880
You can go home now.

92
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,960
You're not offering him a drink?

93
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,800
Why does it feel like I know you?

94
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,240
You're an artist, aren't you?

95
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,520
Seo Joon, right?

96
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,080
-Is there a first aid kit here?
-There is.

97
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,160
-I'll bring it along with the drinks.
-Okay. Thank you.

98
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,640
-You're welcome.
-Where's Zea's room?

99
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,440
-Why?
-Her room is on the second floor.

100
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,080
Oh, no.

101
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
You won't be able to go upstairs
by yourself.

102
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,560
It's okay.

103
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,360
Seriously, it's okay.

104
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,680
Ares, seriously.

105
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,760
Zea, I also want to be carried!

106
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,400
Don't go there. This is the room.

107
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,120
Put me down here.

108
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,640
Okay. I'm fine. I'm here.

109
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,200
Thanks. You can go home now.

110
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,640
Let me see your arm.

111
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,040
Go inside.

112
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,440
What are you doing?

113
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,800
Go inside and rest.

114
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,040
Your room is really like a boy's room.

115
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,440
There's nothing cute about it.

116
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,800
You should go home now.

117
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,240
Is this you?

118
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,160
What's the problem?

119
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,840
Here are the drinks.

120
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,200
Isn't this room...

121
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,600
I meant, if it's just going to be
the two of you in the room,...

122
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,720
don't close the door, okay?

123
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,520
-Right. It wasn't closed, right?
-Right. It wasn't.

124
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,240
That was what I meant. You're right.

125
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,960
Okay, then.

126
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,120
I'm fine.

127
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,480
Seriously.

128
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,880
This is my responsibility.
You got hurt because of me.

129
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,560
Your hand...

130
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,280
My hand's fine.

131
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,120
Zea!

132
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,920
There are people out here
selling chicken noodles and satay!

133
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,440
Sorry, mister. Who called you
to come here?

134
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,280
I don't know them, miss.
But they've already paid for all of it.

135
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,560
Okay, then, call the others here too.

136
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,080
Okay, miss.

137
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,240
-Is it good?
-Free stuff is always good.

138
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,520
Who do you think ordered all of this?

139
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,400
-Oh, well.
-Let's just eat?

140
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,920
-Let's just eat.
-Okay.

141
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,480
Why is Ares so nice?

142
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,800
His body might be all macho.

143
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,680
But, his heart...

144
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,440
It's making me emotional.

145
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,280
Zea, don't be deceived
by just satay and chicken noodles.

146
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,400
Don't get affected by Ares's lame bribe.

147
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,760
Remember that you have to stand firm.

148
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,961
The person who sent all of this food...

149
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:12,920
is the handsome boy
who was here earlier?

150
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,200
Zea, have a drink.

151
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,080
Here's your porridge.

152
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,760
How's your leg?

153
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,760
Just ask permission to not go
to school today.

154
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,800
I already did. I'm still feeling sore.

155
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,760
-Thanks for the porridge.
-You're welcome.

156
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,000
No wonder it seemed like
I've seen him before.

157
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,520
He's more handsome
in person than in photos.

158
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:03,760
Okay, I know why you
took him to Eros's room.

159
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:10,360
Because you don't want him
to see that you're a huge fan.

160
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,160
His photos are on the wall.

161
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,000
Auntie, be careful not to let it slip
if he comes here again.

162
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,720
Okay. I'll keep my mouth zipped.

163
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,720
Do you know this one?

164
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,400
-I do.
-Okay.

165
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,120
I don't know.

166
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,160
But, it's no fun because Zea's not here.

167
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,320
Okay, then. When Zea's here,
we can make it again.

168
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,640
Let's just make it first now.

169
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,480
-Okay. One, two, three.
-I'll just follow you guys.

170
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,600
-Sorry, I said I didn't know.
-One more time.

171
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,440
-Okay.
-One more time. One more chance.

172
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,240
Okay.

173
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,840
One, two, three.

174
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,240
Cle, you're off-beat!

175
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,720
Serra! Come on, let's do TikTok!

176
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,280
Yeah, Ser. It's better
than me getting it wrong all the time.

177
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,360
Yeah, please take Cleo's place.

178
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,760
Come on.

179
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,640
I'm not interested in that anymore.

180
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,080
I'm going to the restroom.

181
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,440
What's wrong with Serra?

182
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,440
Maybe she's thinking about Aiden.

183
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,560
Zea, I found this in front of the house.
I think this is for you.

184
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,760
But I don't know who sent it.

185
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,440
-Okay. Thank you, Auntie.
-You're welcome.

186
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,200
Who sent this?

187
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,040
Zea, you have to focus
on your main objective.

188
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,880
And that is to investigate
Ares and Calderioz.

189
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,840
It's okay, Zea. Get rid
of all your grudges.

190
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,320
Because it's not certain that Ares was
the one who caused Eros to get hurt.

191
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,480
Weren't you feeling emotional
when Ares carried you?

192
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,080
I'm sure you were! Right?

193
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,040
I think Ares likes you too.

194
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,160
It could also be that it wasn't Ares
who gave this to you.

195
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Is there proof that it was him?
Where's the proof?

196
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,520
Hey, don't just state an opinion.

197
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,360
Then don't make an assumption.

198
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,400
Okay, Zea.

199
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,400
You have to remember
that you're getting close to Ares...

200
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,000
so that you can get the evidence
that Ares caused Eros to get hurt.

201
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,680
We'll follow Ares's little game...

202
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,240
so that we can get the evidence.

203
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,320
Oh, my God. Zea, I'm really sorry.

204
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,640
I'm really in a rush
and I'm on the phone.

205
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,200
I'll get going, okay?

206
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,440
Here, let me help you.

207
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,600
Sorry.

208
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,680
-Does it hurt?
-How sweet, Aiden!

209
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,280
Just confess to her!

210
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,240
Zea is my friend.

211
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,520
And you know that my love
is only for one person.

212
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,640
Thanks, Aiden.

213
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,680
Ser.

214
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,160
Be careful. Usually from being friends,
it could become love.

215
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,120
But, be even more careful,...

216
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,320
because being in the friend zone
isn't a good feeling.

217
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,880
Yes, it's not a good feeling.

218
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,400
Or maybe friends with benefits.

219
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,880
That's right.

220
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,480
What are you saying?
I'm not dating Aiden.

221
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,800
Hey, don't act like children.
Don't gossip.

222
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,360
Ser, don't be jealous.

223
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,600
Who's jealous?

224
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,640
Okay, I'm going. Serra.

225
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,040
Serra.

226
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,440
If Aiden is with Zea,
will you be okay with it?

227
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,280
What are you saying?

228
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,920
What are you saying?
There's nothing between me and Aiden.

229
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,320
-Seriously. But are Serra and...
-Serra is Aiden's ex-girlfriend.

230
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,840
Really?

231
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,800
Who is that from?

232
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,720
Is it from Ares or Aiden?

233
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,561
Oh, my gosh. Zea,
you have a lot of fans.

234
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:55,240
Doesn't it make you dizzy?

235
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,800
(Love is like the wind.
You can't see it.)

236
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,280
(But you can feel it.)

237
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,080
If you like chocolate,
I could give you some every day.

238
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,720
This is from you?

239
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,080
Oh, yeah. The sketch
I sent you yesterday,...

240
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,400
do you like it?

241
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,240
That was also from you?

242
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,040
Thank you, Fino. But, I'm on a diet.

243
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,760
So it's better that you give this
to someone else.

244
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,600
So, that it won't be wasted.

245
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,520
Oh, yeah. And...

246
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,360
you don't need to send gifts
to my house anymore.

247
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,800
Again, thank you.

248
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,240
-Guys, let's go to the cafeteria.
-Let's go.

249
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,280
Zea, let's go to the cafeteria.

250
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,720
I'm not coming
because I have a lot of assignments.

251
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,480
It's okay not to work
on assignments once in a while. Right?

252
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,720
Just enjoy your life.

253
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,800
Zea, do you want us
to bring you something?

254
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,000
No, thank you.

255
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,240
Bye.

256
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,160
Just go ahead.

257
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,960
Zea.

258
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,920
There's something I want to talk about.

259
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,400
Sorry, I'm busy working on my homework.
So, I can't talk right now. Sorry.

260
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,040
But, Zea...

261
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,240
Hey.

262
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,960
What is it?

263
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,440
-Are you scared of me?
-Who's scared of you?

264
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,760
I wanted to work on my homework here.
But, you have taken up all the space.

265
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,680
So I'm going to look for another place.

266
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,920
Sit down.

267
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,280
Do you still have a lot
of homework to do?

268
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,080
There's still a lot.

269
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,760
Oh, my gosh.

270
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,520
It's only two problems.

271
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,080
If you need a table, here.

272
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,640
It's free.

273
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,440
Hurry, before I change my mind.

274
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,040
Okay.

275
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Don't hold it if you miss him.

276
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,280
There you go. That's how to do it.

277
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,560
-That's enough for now. That was great.
-Okay.

278
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,240
Zea.

279
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,240
This is for you.

280
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,080
Oh, my gosh. What's going on?
This rarely happens.

281
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,040
-Thank you, Fin.
-You're welcome.

282
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,360
Are you thirsty?

283
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,520
What? Here.

284
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,320
-Just have some if you want.
-Thank you.

285
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,000
Here you go.

286
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,680
Thanks.

287
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,440
(Fino)

288
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,120
Why didn't you pick that up?

289
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,920
It feels like Fino is stalking me.

290
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,080
But, in real life, not online.

291
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,880
Even though I don't think
that I gave him any sort of hope.

292
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,400
I don't know why he's like that.

293
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,560
How about we mess with Fino?

294
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,520
-That's a good idea.
-Sure.

295
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,000
Right? It'll be so much fun.

296
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,480
-Give me your phone.
-But, what if he gets mad?

297
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,200
He won't get mad.

298
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,920
How could he get mad just because
we messed around with him a little?

299
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,640
That'd be so sensitive of him.
What a boring person.

300
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,840
-I'll borrow your phone for a bit.
-What are you going to do?

301
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,640
Here.

302
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,080
"Fino, I'll wait for you
in the cafeteria at 4 o'clock."

303
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,680
-Sent!
-Sel!

304
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,120
(Fino, I'll wait for you
in the cafeteria at 4 o'clock.)

305
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,360
Guys!

306
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,160
Let's watch the girls dance.

307
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,440
-Oh, my goodness. Serra's there.
-Let's go!

308
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,200
I'm not watching.

309
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,040
-Oh, you...
-Come on.

310
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,640
Come on.

311
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,600
Oh, my gosh.

312
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,520
Serra is so pretty.

313
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,200
Watch out.

314
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,960
Okay, I'll be waiting for you here.

315
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,520
Okay, bye.

316
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,880
Fino.

317
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,840
You even brought a flower bouquet.

318
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,040
Who is this for?
Are you going to propose to a girl?

319
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,320
Who is it?

320
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,280
I'm going to meet Zea.

321
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,000
Fino.

322
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,920
Zea isn't on the same level as you.

323
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,080
Listen to me. I'll tell you this.

324
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,640
Zea is messing around with you.

325
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,160
Believe me. Zea won't come.

326
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,760
Good luck, Fino! Bye.

327
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,890
I still remember that this is
your favourite place to study.

328
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:35,330
I'll cover you up so you
won't get exposed to direct sunlight.

329
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,320
Ser?

330
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,520
-Cha.
-Huh?

331
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,920
The one wearing the checked shirt
is pretty cute.

332
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I like the other one.

333
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,520
Dark and sweet. Exotic.

334
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,640
But, you already have Ardhan. Let me
have one. Don't take all the boys.

335
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,280
It's okay for me to admire
another boy's looks once in a while.

336
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,160
It's just for a little bit.

337
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,320
He looks so sweet.

338
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,880
Okay. Let me ask you this.

339
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,280
Who is more handsome? Him or Ardhan?

340
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,600
My boyfriend is more handsome,
of course.

341
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,920
But if it's sweet looks,
there's something about him.

342
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,360
Karissa, one boy is enough.
Don't try to get other boys' attention.

343
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,680
You have to remember
that you already have Ardhan.

344
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,760
Oh, my gosh. I really don't know
how to continue this.

345
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,040
Don't try to get other boys' attention.

346
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,280
-He's not...
-One boy is enough!

347
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,040
Ardhan's not here! It should be okay.
