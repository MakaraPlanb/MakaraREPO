1
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:11,664
Ares!

2
00:00:16,904 --> 00:00:20,184
Ares, pick up the books.

3
00:00:22,704 --> 00:00:25,584
Zea. You, too.

4
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:27,464
Me?

5
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:28,944
Now!

6
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,784
Yes, Ma'am.

7
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:07,904
You should've answered my question.
We wouldn't have had to do this.

8
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:13,304
Why is it my fault? You're the one
who should be cleaning this mess.

9
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:16,544
Stop complaining.

10
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:21,744
Just think of it as your dedication
to this school, and to our country.

11
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,504
What is it?

12
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:38,464
I pricked myself.

13
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:44,584
Did you know that you can get
an infection if the pin is rusty?

14
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:47,704
Let me clean that for you.

15
00:01:57,664 --> 00:01:59,064
Hold this.

16
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:09,104
Babe.

17
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,984
The view's gorgeous.

18
00:02:14,104 --> 00:02:17,424
Feel the breeze. It's so calming.

19
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:20,824
And you're calming my heart.

20
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:29,824
Zea, watch out!

21
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:33,704
Sorry, Zea!

22
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:35,304
Thank God it didn't fall on her head.

23
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:37,304
You're too hasty.

24
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:39,464
No, I was not.

25
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:44,184
-That's crazy.
-Who did that?

26
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:46,504
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

27
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:44,744
-Sania.
-Yes?

28
00:03:44,784 --> 00:03:47,584
Do you want to hear a poem?

29
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:49,344
-Sure.
-Really?

30
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:50,744
Go ahead.

31
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:59,824
"A shark goes for lunch,...

32
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:05,664
I love you so much."

33
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,424
That's it?

34
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:12,144
I can make a poem for you, too, Moreo.

35
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:13,824
Want to hear it?

36
00:04:13,864 --> 00:04:15,464
Wait a minute.

37
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:29,464
Here, a poem for you.

38
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:32,384
I bet you'll love this.

39
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:33,864
Read it.

40
00:04:39,704 --> 00:04:43,664
"Like a rainbow after the rain."

41
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:49,344
"Or snowflakes when the sun is high."

42
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:54,344
"That is the most precise
picture of us."

43
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:56,344
Isn't it good? Continue reading.

44
00:04:57,344 --> 00:05:01,424
"With your attempt to create a rhyme
that you called a poem,...

45
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:05,624
you should just give up...

46
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:09,984
because we will never be together."

47
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:13,104
It's good, isn't it?
Don't even bother to try next time.

48
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:39,984
Why do you look so gloomy?

49
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:43,384
Why do I keep failing?

50
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,104
With Sania?

51
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:51,544
She's not the only girl in the world.
Forget about her.

52
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:54,824
Here, look at this.

53
00:06:00,304 --> 00:06:02,704
-Isn't she cute?
-Who is she?

54
00:06:03,744 --> 00:06:06,784
Ros Tatiana Wijaya. 10th grade student.

55
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,904
-So?
-What?

56
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:12,024
So, how should I approach her?

57
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:14,224
She loves chocolate.

58
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:18,664
Bring her some expensive chocolate,
not the cheap ones.

59
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:26,384
The ending is just going to be the same.

60
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:30,544
Come on, how many times
should I tell you?

61
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:37,264
You're one of the front men
of Calderioz.

62
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:39,704
You shouldn't be ashamed
to make a move on girls.

63
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:46,024
Quit it already.

64
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:49,304
If you never try,
you won't know what's going to happen.

65
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:50,984
Just try it.

66
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:52,464
So, chocolate, huh?

67
00:06:52,504 --> 00:06:54,624
Yes, chocolate.

68
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,504
See you.

69
00:06:56,544 --> 00:07:00,104
Hey, light or dark chocolate?

70
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:02,824
Light chocolate!

71
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,944
Tatiana...

72
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:07,584
Tatiana!

73
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:16,784
Want to grab the tasty dessert that we
ate together in the café the other day?

74
00:07:16,824 --> 00:07:19,904
What was it called? I forgot.
Do you remember?

75
00:07:22,784 --> 00:07:25,704
How long are you going to keep this up?

76
00:07:27,544 --> 00:07:29,824
Pretending like we are fine.

77
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:35,304
You know we're not doing okay.
And you knew that.

78
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:44,944
But you know what I want.

79
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:50,224
Listen, Serra.

80
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:56,224
I love you so much.

81
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:04,304
You know that, right?

82
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:07,904
I'm prepared to marry you.

83
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:12,544
I'm not forcing you to do anything.

84
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:14,864
I'm just waiting for you.

85
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:37,584
You still owe me two promises.

86
00:08:41,584 --> 00:08:43,024
Fine, tell me.

87
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:48,184
Dress up for tonight...

88
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:49,824
and come with me.

89
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:53,424
Okay.

90
00:08:53,464 --> 00:08:55,984
But don't you dare
try to pull another trick on me...

91
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:58,264
like what you did in your headquarters.

92
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,024
I won't just stay silent.

93
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:46,344
Ares?

94
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:50,464
Are you ready?

95
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:52,184
What do you think?

96
00:09:58,424 --> 00:09:59,744
Thanks.

97
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:27,544
Whose house is this?

98
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:32,184
Zea?

99
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:35,184
Come on in, everyone is waiting for you.

100
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:38,024
Come on. Hurry up.

101
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:39,544
Okay.

102
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:43,024
-Hi, Sandra.
-Hurry.

103
00:10:51,104 --> 00:10:55,064
Hi. Is this your friend, Sandra?

104
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:57,864
This is Ares's friend.

105
00:10:57,904 --> 00:11:01,144
Good evening, Ma'am. I'm Zea.

106
00:11:01,184 --> 00:11:02,624
Hi, sir.

107
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:04,664
You're so gorgeous.

108
00:11:08,144 --> 00:11:10,184
How do you know Ares?

109
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:12,184
We're schoolmates.

110
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:16,144
How long have you known him?

111
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:19,744
Since I moved to Jakarta.

112
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:22,104
I'm actually his junior.

113
00:11:22,144 --> 00:11:25,944
-You just moved? From where?
-From Bandung.

114
00:11:27,024 --> 00:11:28,944
No wonder.

115
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:32,584
Bandung girls are the prettiest.

116
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:35,184
-You're right.
-Honey!

117
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:38,344
-Come on, let's have a seat.
-Yes.

118
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:47,304
Zea is the one who saved me that night.

119
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:51,104
So it was you who saved Sandra
the other night?

120
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:54,064
-Thank you so much, Zea.
-It was my pleasure.

121
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:59,264
So when are you going to continue
your karate lessons, Sandra?

122
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:01,744
Come on, mom. Not that again.

123
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:06,424
That is for your own good,
so you can defend yourself.

124
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:09,864
I completely agree that you should
continue your karate lessons.

125
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:11,264
Excuse me for a bit.

126
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:19,264
-Sandra, can I use the bathroom?
-Let me take you.

127
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:22,464
No, I can go myself. Where is it?

128
00:12:22,504 --> 00:12:25,024
-Over there.
-Okay.

129
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:27,344
-Excuse me.
-Yes please go ahead.

130
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:36,304
Where are you going?

131
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:39,184
Bathroom.

132
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,744
It's right there.

133
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:54,824
Zea, the dinner is ready.

134
00:13:10,064 --> 00:13:11,544
What is it, mom?

135
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:15,904
Zea is pretty.

136
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:20,624
I like her, too.
She's very friendly and nice.

137
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:24,504
Look who just got an instant blessing.

138
00:13:25,544 --> 00:13:27,184
What are you talking about?

139
00:13:30,264 --> 00:13:35,504
-You made this, honey?
-This is special.

140
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:40,464
-What's the occasion, mom?
-Let's wait for Zea before we start.

141
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:43,104
Hey, that's my favourite.

142
00:14:23,184 --> 00:14:26,184
What's taking her so long?

143
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:29,624
Maybe she is lost in Ares' heart.

144
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,224
Honey...

145
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:36,264
-Let me go check on her.
-Yes.

146
00:14:39,224 --> 00:14:41,424
So how's your school?

147
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:46,424
Zea?

148
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:51,864
Do you still need more time?

149
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:52,464
There she is.

150
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:55,544
What took you so long?

151
00:15:55,584 --> 00:16:00,464
Sorry. But my stomach was hurting,
so I needed some time.

152
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:03,224
It's okay.

153
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:06,384
-Okay. Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

154
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:13,224
-You should eat a lot. Have this.
-Sure.

155
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:19,024
Seriously! My hobby was climbing.

156
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:22,104
I used to climb anything.

157
00:16:22,144 --> 00:16:27,384
I climbed the mango tree, the banana
tree. Then, I picked the fruits.

158
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:29,824
-Seriously?
-Yes.

159
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,584
-What a hobby!
-Please don't tell anyone about this.

160
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,024
You're as strong as Wonder Woman.

161
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:39,584
Thank you so much for having me.
I have to go now.

162
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,864
You're welcome.

163
00:16:41,904 --> 00:16:44,424
-You should come to visit us again.
-Sure.

164
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:48,504
-Visit us again, Zea.
-Okay.

165
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:50,784
-I'm going to give her a ride home.
-Okay.

166
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:53,704
-Bye.
-Bye.

167
00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:06,224
I can't believe you're so good
at winning over my parents' hearts.

168
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:11,944
Did I?

169
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:20,424
But, seriously,...

170
00:17:20,464 --> 00:17:22,744
I think my parents like you.

171
00:17:24,024 --> 00:17:25,384
Really?

172
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:28,904
But, you don't, right?

173
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:34,624
What do you prefer?

174
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,384
Thanks.

175
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,304
For what?

176
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:50,344
For coming to my house.

177
00:18:11,664 --> 00:18:14,264
I think my parents like you.

178
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:16,064
But, you don't, right?

179
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,744
What do you prefer?

180
00:18:39,624 --> 00:18:43,144
I can't believe you're so good
at winning over my parents' hearts.

181
00:18:43,184 --> 00:18:45,824
Did I?

182
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:03,984
Why can't I stop thinking about her?

183
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:11,944
It's already 3 a.m.!

184
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:37,384
Get yourself together!

185
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:47,464
Five, six, seven, eight.

186
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:54,264
One, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven, eight.

187
00:19:54,304 --> 00:20:01,344
One, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven, eight.

188
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:04,264
-One, two...
-Ouch!

189
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:07,384
Sorry. Are you guys okay?

190
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:09,864
You look distracted today.

191
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:13,144
I saw Megan just now.

192
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:21,664
Megan? Where is he? Are you sure?

193
00:20:47,544 --> 00:20:49,104
What do you want?

194
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:52,584
What are you doing here?
Leave me alone.

195
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:55,144
This is my favorite spot.

196
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:56,864
You're the one who should leave.

197
00:20:56,904 --> 00:21:00,304
I was here first. Why should I go?

198
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:01,544
Is this your school?

199
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:03,824
Ever since I stepped my foot
in this school...

200
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:09,144
this whole spot below the tree...

201
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,424
is my territory.

202
00:21:11,464 --> 00:21:13,544
Territory? Please.

203
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:16,144
Are we in a war or something?
We already got our independence.

204
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:18,264
Shut up.

205
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:21,544
I want to take a nap.
Don't you dare disturb me.

206
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:23,944
And wake me up in 15 minutes.

207
00:21:40,304 --> 00:21:43,664
Wake up, Ares.
It's already been 15 minutes.

208
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:45,344
The class is about the start.

209
00:21:46,784 --> 00:21:48,304
Ares?

210
00:22:28,384 --> 00:22:29,904
What time is it?

211
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:37,184
-Why didn't you wake me up?
-I did, but you didn't wake up.

212
00:22:49,624 --> 00:22:51,024
Let's go.

213
00:22:53,024 --> 00:22:55,544
-Okay, meow!
-Let's go.

214
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:57,104
What's wrong?

215
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,864
What is it?

216
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:04,384
Have you been possessed or something?

217
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:08,184
Ares, is it Halloween already?
What's with the make-up?

218
00:23:09,904 --> 00:23:12,144
What are you talking about?

219
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:15,264
"Let's go to the class, meow!"

220
00:23:26,064 --> 00:23:27,984
Ares!

221
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:34,744
There's only one person
who could ever do this to you.

222
00:23:39,504 --> 00:23:41,104
You mean only Zea?

223
00:23:43,064 --> 00:23:45,384
But this makes me
even more curious about her.

224
00:23:49,904 --> 00:23:51,344
You're curious about her?

225
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:57,424
You know where that leads to.

226
00:23:59,184 --> 00:24:02,544
To your heart. Be careful.

227
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:04,304
Hey!

228
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:07,624
-Here's your order.
-Thanks.

229
00:24:09,504 --> 00:24:12,064
-Is there anything wrong?
-You took the wrong one.

230
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:15,424
These are mine and Aiden's.

231
00:24:15,464 --> 00:24:17,144
Sorry.

232
00:24:26,104 --> 00:24:27,824
Serra.

233
00:24:31,184 --> 00:24:33,064
-Here.
-Thank you.

234
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:35,984
Thank you.

235
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:42,864
Are you okay, Cleo?

236
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:44,384
Nothing.

237
00:24:46,624 --> 00:24:49,144
Tell us. Why are you being like this?

238
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:55,184
Why do I always act stupidly
whenever Megan is around?

239
00:24:55,224 --> 00:24:56,784
I'm so embarrassed.

240
00:24:58,264 --> 00:24:59,744
Maybe it's destiny.

241
00:24:59,784 --> 00:25:05,584
Usually starting with destiny,
it ends with love. Right, guys?

242
00:25:05,624 --> 00:25:07,024
What are you talking about?

243
00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:13,144
Megan is watching you.
I think he has a crush on you.

244
00:25:13,184 --> 00:25:14,704
Really?

245
00:25:38,224 --> 00:25:39,664
I'm tired!

246
00:25:53,224 --> 00:25:55,384
-Do you know where Regina is?
-She has typhoid.

247
00:25:55,424 --> 00:25:56,904
She hasn't come to school
since yesterday.

248
00:25:56,944 --> 00:25:58,744
Typhoid, really?

249
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,744
We're just a few days away
from the school festival.

250
00:26:01,784 --> 00:26:04,984
We can't change the formation again.

251
00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:06,544
What should we do?

252
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:13,144
I have an idea.
What if we find a substitute?

253
00:26:13,184 --> 00:26:14,904
You think it's that easy.

254
00:26:14,944 --> 00:26:18,224
I never said it was easy.
But do you have any other solution?

255
00:26:18,264 --> 00:26:20,904
Can't you think of something
that makes more sense?

256
00:26:20,944 --> 00:26:22,944
Then you tell me.

257
00:26:22,984 --> 00:26:25,504
What if we ask for Zea's help?

258
00:26:28,264 --> 00:26:32,384
It's okay if you can't pick me up.
I can take a cab.

259
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:35,024
Okay.

260
00:26:36,224 --> 00:26:38,744
Zea!

261
00:26:38,784 --> 00:26:40,344
What is it?

262
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:41,824
Something's wrong?
You girls look nervous.

263
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:45,264
We are. Can you join us
in the dance club?

264
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:47,784
Please, I need you.

265
00:26:47,824 --> 00:26:50,864
Gosh, I thought something's happened.

266
00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:56,904
I'm sorry but I don't think I can do it.
Besides, dance doesn't suit me.

267
00:26:56,944 --> 00:27:00,024
Zea, please. You have to help me.

268
00:27:00,064 --> 00:27:03,104
I wouldn't ask for your help
if we're not short on people.

269
00:27:03,144 --> 00:27:05,024
It could mess up our routine.

270
00:27:05,064 --> 00:27:09,384
-Yeah, Zea. Please?
-Please.

271
00:27:09,424 --> 00:27:12,744
Listen, do you still remember
when you were running away from Ares...

272
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:15,504
and then you ran into our practice?

273
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:17,424
And then you somehow danced with us.

274
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:20,664
Now you say dance doesn't suit you?

275
00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:25,267
I don't want to talk
about doing a favor,...

276
00:27:25,307 --> 00:27:28,584
but friends should help each other.
Right?

277
00:27:28,624 --> 00:27:31,304
Do you girls remember when Anya
and her gang confronted her?

278
00:27:31,344 --> 00:27:33,424
-I remember!
-Didn't we help her?

279
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:35,744
All right, fine. I'm in.

280
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:40,904
-Nice decision.
-Thank you, Zea!

281
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:54,984
No one is coming to pick you up?

282
00:27:55,024 --> 00:27:58,464
I'm going home by myself.
I'm waiting for my ride.

283
00:28:00,784 --> 00:28:04,144
Get on the back. I'll take you home.

284
00:28:05,744 --> 00:28:08,544
No, thanks. I'll take the cab.

285
00:28:08,584 --> 00:28:10,824
Don't be so stubborn.

286
00:28:10,864 --> 00:28:15,144
First, take this as a way
of me saying thanks.

287
00:28:15,184 --> 00:28:19,904
Second, you should do what I say
since you drew on my face.

288
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:27,224
No.

289
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,104
Get on.

290
00:28:31,624 --> 00:28:33,744
Fine.

291
00:28:49,264 --> 00:28:51,064
Hold on tight.

292
00:28:53,824 --> 00:28:55,784
I said, hold on tight.

293
00:29:17,144 --> 00:29:19,264
Hi!

294
00:29:19,304 --> 00:29:20,624
You must be waiting for me.

295
00:29:20,664 --> 00:29:22,824
Wear this. Let me take you home.

296
00:29:23,824 --> 00:29:26,264
You don't have to. My driver is coming.

297
00:29:28,864 --> 00:29:32,064
Okay, then let me
follow you from behind.

298
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:36,224
So you'll be safe. Okay?

299
00:29:36,264 --> 00:29:37,984
I don't need you to do that.

300
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:44,704
You don't?
Then when is she going to need me?

301
00:29:44,744 --> 00:29:46,064
Aiden.

302
00:29:46,104 --> 00:29:48,184
If Serra doesn't want you
to take her home,...

303
00:29:48,224 --> 00:29:50,264
then why don't you take me
to your headquarters?

304
00:29:50,304 --> 00:29:54,864
And then you can help me to ask Ares
to see me, okay?

305
00:29:57,904 --> 00:30:00,064
I'm not a bike taxi.

306
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:02,984
Aiden!

307
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:16,224
Stop there!

308
00:30:19,664 --> 00:30:21,864
Where are you going?

309
00:30:32,304 --> 00:30:33,784
Don't you run away!

310
00:30:35,664 --> 00:30:37,664
This kid is looking for a fight!

311
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:42,584
Get him!

312
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:45,024
