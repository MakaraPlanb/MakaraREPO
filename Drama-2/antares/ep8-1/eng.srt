1
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,720
(Previously...)

2
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,520
Hey!

3
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,560
Is it true that you were the one
who gave the order to hurt me and Ares?

4
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,040
Answer me!

5
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,600
There's an enemy inside Wolves,
and you have to be careful.

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,920
Especially with Lionel.

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,720
I did all of that to destroy Calderioz.

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,840
You're saying
that Lio is behind all this?

9
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,120
You're all stupid!
You couldn't even take care of that.

10
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,560
Aeros is inside.

11
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,480
We have to get him out.

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,760
Before Aeros was kidnapped,...

13
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,680
he regained consciousness,
and gave me a warning.

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,840
Aeros.

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,640
You're awake?

16
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,080
I'll call the doctor! Wait.

17
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,720
Ares.

18
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,800
-Ares.
-What is it, Aeros?

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,600
-I need your help.
-I'll call the doctor first, okay?

20
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,280
I need your help.

21
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,400
What is it?

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,880
Please investigate Lio.

23
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,480
He has committed so many crimes.

24
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,240
I have proof of it.

25
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,920
There are two people that you can trust.

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,640
Zea and Bara.

27
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,880
I trust you.

28
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,360
Aeros.

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,920
Aeros!

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,680
When everyone had their guard down,...

31
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,200
members of the Wolves under Lio's orders
continued the horrible plan,...

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,480
and kidnapped Aeros.

33
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,520
Dhan.

34
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,160
Gather the Calderioz boys.

35
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,360
Meg. Mor. Guard the front, okay?

36
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,480
If Zea comes, stop her.

37
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,840
-Bar, call the police.
-Okay.

38
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,800
You come with me, okay?

39
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,480
After this, we'll settle things
with Lionel.

40
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,440
Doctor!

41
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,320
Zea!

42
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,520
Help!

43
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,480
Help!

44
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,640
Now, play.

45
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,640
Listen, bro. I'll tell you
how to play this the right way.

46
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,160
-And then? I already did that.
-Let me be. I'll do what I want.

47
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,040
Aeros, can you open this?

48
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
-How are you doing? Okay?
-Yeah.

49
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,720
Let's go.

50
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,440
Who are you?

51
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,240
What are you doing here?

52
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
(Do not try to reenact this scene.)

53
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,880
Hey! You!

54
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,840
Where did he go?

55
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,240
Answer me! Look at me!

56
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,880
Hey.

57
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,960
Whom did you come here with?

58
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,800
Answer me!

59
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,120
Nel! At the front...

60
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,280
It's Calderioz!

61
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,240
Calderioz?

62
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,280
This is all your fault.

63
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,480
What a surprise! Welcome, Calderioz.

64
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,320
-Zea.
-Ares.

65
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,400
Hey.

66
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,480
Aeros.

67
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,360
Hey, if you dare take one step forward,
I'll kill your sister!

68
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,920
-Let go of my sister!
-It's great that you all are here.

69
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,400
Including you, Aeros.

70
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,160
You have no idea
how I'm going to hurt your sister.

71
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,880
Please do it gently, nurse.

72
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,080
Let me take care of her, nurse.

73
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,080
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

74
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,080
-Do it gently.
-Yeah. Sorry.

75
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,080
Sorry.

76
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,680
Turn this way.

77
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,080
Thank you.

78
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,720
Aeros.

79
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,280
-I'm fine.
-Really?

80
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,480
-Okay?
-Yeah.

81
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,760
I never thought
Lionel could be like that.

82
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,680
Let me borrow your phone. I'll show you.

83
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,680
-My phone?
-Yes.

84
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
Here.

85
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,880
We have to report this
to the police right away.

86
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,520
Wait.

87
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
-Aeros.
-Yes?

88
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,640
Let's report this to the police later.

89
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,760
Because that's my friend.

90
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,720
Hey.

91
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,280
But, you're so annoying.

92
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,080
This means that you were fooling
with me, right? Since yesterday.

93
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,240
You're so annoying!

94
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,800
You're all beaten up,
but you could still throw a punch.

95
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,240
-Of course I can.
-We're even. One to one.

96
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,241
You dared fool Calderioz.

97
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:03,720
Now it's my turn to
mess around with you.

98
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,640
You're still annoying.

99
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,760
Stop sulking. Okay?

100
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,880
We all care about you, Zea.

101
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,200
Thanks, Aeros.

102
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,120
-Ares.
-Yeah.

103
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,120
A member of a motorcycle gang
charged with kidnapping...

104
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,440
has successfully been arrested
by the police.

105
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,520
The perpetrator with the initials LK...

106
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,520
is suspected to have kidnapped
the victim with the initials EB...

107
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,200
from one of the private hospitals
in Bandung last Friday.

108
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,000
It turns out that it wasn't Ares.

109
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,680
I was wrong to have accused Calderioz.

110
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,840
And I'm very disappointed in Lio.

111
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,920
But, if it wasn't for this incident,...

112
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,840
I wouldn't have known Calderioz.

113
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,920
I wouldn't have known...

114
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,920
Ares.

115
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,440
Zea!

116
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,760
Zea!

117
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:37,520
-What is it? Why are you so happy?
-Look, who's outside.

118
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,360
-Who?
-Just look.

119
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,160
Ares.

120
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,920
You two are dating now, aren't you?

121
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,360
Zea, hurry and go out there!
Your handsome prince is waiting for you.

122
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,000
Go!

123
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,521
Hey, Zea.

124
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:20,080
He hasn't confessed to you yet.
You should play hard to get.

125
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,880
You two, just be quiet. Don't be noisy.
Don't argue. Okay?

126
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,720
What are you doing here?

127
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,080
I was just passing by here.

128
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,280
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

129
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,240
It's a good thing Ares
sent me a text message.

130
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,920
So I had time to prepare lunchboxes
for both of you.

131
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,880
So, now you have an informant?

132
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,600
Here. Take your lunchboxes.

133
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,160
Remember that you have to eat it
because I made it with love.

134
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,440
With my whole heart!

135
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,600
-Yes. Thank you.
-You're welcome, Handsome Ares.

136
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,000
-Thank you.
-You're welcome, Zea.

137
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,240
Since you're already here...

138
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,040
All right. Let's go.

139
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,920
Just put the lunchboxes in my backpack.

140
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,840
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

141
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:24,400
Zea! You were so happy when Ares came
that you forgot to wear your shoes.

142
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,280
Thank God that Zea's brother woke up
from his coma.

143
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,760
Yes. And Lionel, the one who made
Aeros fall into a coma...

144
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,200
has already been arrested.

145
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,840
Don't.

146
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,520
I recorded everything that we did.
I have photos too.

147
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,800
If you tell anyone,
I'll spread it on social media.

148
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,520
Ares.

149
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,200
I'm sorry...

150
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,481
that I accused you and Calderioz...

151
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:24,600
of being involved
with what happened to Aeros.

152
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,240
Until now, I still don't understand
how Lio could do such a terrible thing.

153
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,240
Okay.

154
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,160
I'll tell you.

155
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Hey, Serra. Let me remind you again.

156
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,560
If you tell anyone,
I'll tell your parents.

157
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,480
I'll spread these videos on social media
and send it to your friends.

158
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,200
Do you understand me?

159
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,160
Aeros told me that
in the Wolves headquarters,...

160
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,040
he happened to hear Lionel
calling Serra and threatening her...

161
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,080
to not report the rape to other people.

162
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,440
Lio threatened that he would spread
the photos and videos of Serra...

163
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,480
who had no clothes on.

164
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,160
What are you doing,
threatening someone like that?

165
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
-"Threatening"?
-Yes.

166
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,120
-What am I threatening?
-I know.

167
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,880
-What do you know?
-I heard it.

168
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,880
-What did you hear?
-My ears are everywhere.

169
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,840
I heard you making a call here.

170
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,680
-You don't know anything, Aeros.
-I heard it!

171
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,800
-You coward.
-What's wrong with you today?

172
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,720
What's wrong with you?

173
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,480
-Get over here!
-Aeros told Lio not to do...

174
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,480
something so terrible to girls.

175
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,280
But, Lio didn't accept it.

176
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,120
And in the end,
they argued with each other.

177
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,160
And they fought.

178
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,520
You!

179
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,080
Go against me, one on one.

180
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,960
What?

181
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,960
Listen.

182
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,840
Stop playing the hero!

183
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,720
I already know everything
that you've done.

184
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,000
-The things you did.
-How could you do that to a kid?

185
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,000
-The Wolves are ruined because of you!
-You're the one who ruined it!

186
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,920
What? Coward!

187
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:44,440
Lio, who didn't want his secret
to be exposed, felt threatened.

188
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,120
And Aeros's goals
were the opposite of Lionel's.

189
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,601
That's why Lio started
gathering supporters...

190
00:21:50,641 --> 00:21:52,960
and provoked the other Wolves members.

191
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,081
It was him and his supporters
that beat up Aeros...

192
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:58,840
until Aeros lost his consciousness.

193
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,920
Lio had the ambition of becoming
the Wolves' leader, replacing Aeros.

194
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,360
And if you had stayed in Bandung,
with Aeros being in a coma,...

195
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,240
the person who would have replaced him
as the leader of the Wolves was you.

196
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,921
That's why Lio made you
a nonactive member...

197
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:26,400
and sent you from Bandung to Jakarta.

198
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,040
So, Lio could take advantage
of that chance...

199
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,560
to take over the Wolves.

200
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,960
And to destroy Calderioz through you.

201
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,400
But, thankfully, it's all over now.

202
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,760
And finally,...

203
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,800
the Wolves and Calderioz can unite.

204
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,200
Pick me up now.

205
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,800
Please. Hurry.

206
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,000
Please.

207
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,280
Please. Stop!

208
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,000
What are you going to do?

209
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,120
Ser.

210
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,720
We want to talk about...

211
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,680
Lionel.

212
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,360
I don't know him. Please.

213
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,760
Ser.

214
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,760
We already know.

215
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,720
We understand how you feel, Ser.

216
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,360
You understand?

217
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,920
How would you understand
how it feels to be me?

218
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,680
Serra.

219
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,560
Ser.

220
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,200
That person is the same person
who made my brother fall into a coma.

221
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,920
Ares and I won't force you to talk.

222
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,080
But, it's only you
who can make him suffer a lot more.

223
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,280
Even though it won't be equal
to what you have gone through.

224
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,000
No one knows except Aiden.

225
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,520
And even he didn't know who did it.

226
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,800
One and a half years,...

227
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,280
I tried to keep it in and forget it all.

228
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,400
I just want to forget it all.

229
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,440
I'm sorry, Ser. But, can I know...

230
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,440
what have you done to forget it all?

231
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,520
You're not the only victim.

232
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,080
The culprit
is right in front of our eyes.

233
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,080
You don't want to punish him?

234
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,280
If I exposed his secrets,
would that bring my life back?

235
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,880
Could that bring back my dad
who was imprisoned...

236
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,880
because he accused the wrong person
as his daughter's rapist?

237
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,720
Could it? Could it bring Aiden
back to life?

238
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,320
Ser.

239
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,640
Since the beginning
when Aeros fell into a coma,...

240
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,240
I was really sad...

241
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,040
seeing someone
who was a superhero to me...

242
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,680
lie unconscious with hospital equipment
attached to him.

243
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,960
And that person,
who was like a brother to me.

244
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,880
He was the one who made the accusation
that this was all Calderioz's doing.

245
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,720
He made me move to Jakarta
to look for proof.

246
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,240
He made me go far away from Aeros.

247
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,520
He isolated me...

248
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:02,280
so he could take over
what Aeros had built.

249
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,880
And what's even more horrible,...

250
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:11,960
he did all of that
to hide his own crimes.

251
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,560
Now everything has been exposed.

252
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:27,040
I know that any punishment,
even death...

253
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,480
won't bring back the time you lost.

254
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,920
But, at least, Ser,...

255
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:40,040
he can suffer and spend years
being stuck in prison.

256
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,360
Your testimony won't just make his time
in prison longer.

257
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,640
But, it will also make him
stop hurting other victims, Ser.

258
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,320
For one and a half years,
you tried to forget it all.

259
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,480
But, did he stop hurting other victims?

260
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,720
He didn't, Ser.

261
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:21,240
Whatever your decision is, don't worry.

262
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,040
We're the same as Aiden.

263
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,080
We'll keep your secret safe.

264
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,000
Zea.

265
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,840
Where are you going?

266
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,680
We haven't succeeded
in persuading Serra to testify.

267
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,800
From the very beginning,...

268
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,120
I didn't have the intention
of forcing Serra to testify, Ares.

269
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:06,400
I'm only obligated
to make her know what the situation is.

270
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,600
And she's the one
with the right to decide.

271
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,800
Whatever that decision is for this case.

272
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,280
Not us.

273
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,680
Okay.

274
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,920
I'll testify.

275
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:48,000
You guys didn't see
how I went against those people!

276
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,000
Gosh, Mor. That's the only part
you keep telling us.

277
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,000
He hid behind me the rest of the time.

278
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,440
Don't do that, I also want to be
complimented by girls.

279
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,680
But, it's okay.
It's okay if you can't fight.

280
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,560
But, I have to admit,...

281
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,440
the story of you fighting against them
by throwing your shoe is epic.

282
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,080
-It's epic, right?
-It's creative!

283
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,600
You're such a mood booster.

284
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,920
Language isn't only described
as a set of sounds.

285
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,680
Language can also be defined
as a form of expression.

286
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,520
It says here that language
can also be discussed.

287
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,961
While as a form,...

288
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:41,160
language is a formalization
of parts in a concept.

289
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,200
As an expression,
language is a physical media...

290
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,600
-(Let's have lunch at the rooftop.)
-And also as content.

291
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,600
Aeros will return as the leader
of the Wolves.

292
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,961
I will strengthen the security...

293
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:05,080
so there won't be fights
between members of the Wolves.

294
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,040
Just like what Lionel did.

295
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,920
I promise I'll fix the Wolves' image.

296
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,600
And I'll arrange a meeting
between the motorcycle gangs in Jakarta.

297
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,040
I'll make our goals and plans clear.

298
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,600
That we're young men
who can take care of ourselves.

299
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,840
And we're useful to other people.

300
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,240
-Wolves!
-Wolves!

301
00:31:54,280 --> 00:32:01,000
-Wolves!
-Wolves!

302
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,960
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

303
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,400
-I really am sorry.
-What do I get if I forgive you?

304
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,080
I'll do anything you ask of me.

305
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,240
Five requests.

306
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,200
-Two requests.
-I'm not interested.

307
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,120
Okay. Three requests.

308
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,360
Deal.

309
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,360
Don't be careless.
And keep searching for evidence.

310
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,560
Remember that your purpose of coming
to Jakarta is to look for evidence...

311
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,720
that Ares is the one who made Aeros
go into a coma for a whole year.

312
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,120
I won't ever forget my mission.

313
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,080
And I promise that I won't give up
until we find evidence,...

314
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,120
and get our revenge against Ares.

315
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,120
You can do it.

316
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,800
Lio, you're terrible!

317
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,000
Starting from today,...

318
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,960
never trust anyone.

319
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,800
Except me.

320
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,800
Because I promise
that I'll never hurt you.
