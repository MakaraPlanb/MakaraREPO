1
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,320
(Do Not Attempt To Reenact This)

2
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:44,206
Come on!

3
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:37,296
Let's go! Come on!

4
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:46,720
Moreo.

5
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,120
-Why didn't you fight back?
-I did.

6
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,360
But...

7
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,920
You know how it is.

8
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:05,080
Wait up, my leg hurts.

9
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,080
Oh, my gosh. You're ruining the moment.

10
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,640
Come on.

11
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,840
What was that?

12
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,640
I think it came from the front.

13
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,600
Let's go check it out.

14
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,440
Why are you just sitting there?
Come on, Ser!

15
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,600
Hey.

16
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,640
Where are you going?

17
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,320
You're supposed to take responsibility
but you're running away.

18
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,880
Hey, who do you think you are?

19
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,000
Use your eyes!

20
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,520
This is crazy.
It took me months to order this.

21
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,520
-Now it got scratched.
-It's okay.

22
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,000
Let them solve this problem
by themselves.

23
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,840
-But...
-It's okay.

24
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,360
-But...
-No!

25
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,960
Your motorcycle
got the most damage, Ares.

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,760
This is crazy.

27
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,240
Oh, my God!

28
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,640
When someone's talking to you,
you have to look at them.

29
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,240
Do you think the asphalt
is more handsome than me?

30
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,880
"Handsome"?

31
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:01,920
How much money
do you need me to transfer to you?

32
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,480
This girl thinks she's so rich.
Just send it straight to my account.

33
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,440
-570...
-Stop speaking nonsense. Hey!

34
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,400
Do you know who I am?

35
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,280
The money that you have
and the money that I have...

36
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,160
You have more money than me.

37
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,920
But it's okay.
If we combine it together, we...

38
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,360
You're not funny.

39
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,880
Do you want to input
the number yourself?

40
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,080
I don't need your money.

41
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,640
-I need your apology.
-I was going to do that...

42
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,560
before you roughly pulled my hair.

43
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,640
Who is that girl?

44
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,400
Oops.

45
00:05:06,163 --> 00:05:09,360
Apologize to me right now.

46
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,120
Not that easy.

47
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Apologize to me right now.

48
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,400
Not that easy.

49
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,040
Okay.

50
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,080
Wait.

51
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,200
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,880
Not that easy.

53
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,960
Wait.

54
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,999
-I really am sorry.
-What do I get if I forgive you?

55
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,777
I'll do whatever you wish.

56
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,800
I'll ask five wishes.

57
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,640
-Two wishes.
-I'm not interested.

58
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,120
Okay. Three wishes.

59
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,400
Deal.

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,680
Girls.

61
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,400
Here we go.

62
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,400
You're so cool.

63
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,680
Until now, no one has dared
to go against Calderioz.

64
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,520
Let alone a girl. You're the only one.

65
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,840
That means...

66
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,160
you deserve to join our group!

67
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,880
Congrats!

68
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,720
Okay, I'm Karissa.

69
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,600
-I'm Zea.
-Selina. But you can call me Selin.

70
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,400
I'm Cleo.

71
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,680
Hi.

72
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,840
I'm Serra.

73
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,280
I'm Zea.

74
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,760
From the ABC triangle,
we know that angle A is 120 degrees.

75
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Angle B is 30 degrees.
From A to C is 5 centimeters.

76
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,520
We're looking for the length
between B to C.

77
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,520
-Does anyone know the answer?
-Widows really are more tempting.

78
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,720
(Widows really are more tempting)

79
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,800
Anyone?

80
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,560
Hello, everyone.

81
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,680
My name is Zeanne Queensha Bratadikara.

82
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,920
You can just call me Zea.
I've just moved from Bandung.

83
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,760
She's from Bandung.
No wonder she's pretty.

84
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,160
Zea, you can sit on the empty chair
over there.

85
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,240
Please move to the other seat.
Hurry.

86
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,320
Zea, you can sit here.

87
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,520
Good morning, baby.
You're so beautiful today.

88
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,116
Did you sleep well?

89
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,560
Wake up! Wake up and solve
the problem on the board!

90
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,120
What's the answer?

91
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,440
(Trigonometry)

92
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Ares is also sleeping.

93
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,788
Ares, wake up.

94
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,640
Ares.

95
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,374
Why were you sleeping?

96
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,640
You must have been studying
till late at night, right?

97
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,720
That's why you're sleepy.

98
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,241
No wonder you've got the highest grades.

99
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,468
Moreo, you should be like Ares.

100
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,080
He's got the highest grade
in this school...

101
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,080
because he's the most enthusiastic
when it comes to studying.

102
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,240
Come on, come to the front now.
Come on!

103
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,680
Miss...

104
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,440
I can't solve that problem.

105
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,726
Okay, fine.

106
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,160
Then, I'll give you a punishment.

107
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,265
Go to the other classes now
and apologize to everyone.

108
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:49,320
That includes your juniors
so that you'll stop sleeping in class.

109
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,040
Do you understand?

110
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,600
Then I should receive
the punishment too.

111
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,827
I also fell asleep.

112
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,936
-Are you being serious?
-It's okay, to make it fair.

113
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,835
We both came here to apologize...

114
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,440
because we both fell asleep in class
during the lesson.

115
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,640
It's okay if you fall asleep
in class, Ares.

116
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,560
We still like you. Right?

117
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,080
Especially if you dreamt about me.

118
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,800
But I also want to...

119
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,040
Ares. Stop!
I'm a human being!

120
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,680
-Do you see?
-No.

121
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,760
Ares and I want to apologize
because we fell asleep in class.

122
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,680
Ares, let's take a photo.

123
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,680
Take a picture with Moreo, okay?

124
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:38,080
Let's take a photo.

125
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,280
We have to hurry
because I'm really busy today.

126
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,760
Smile!

127
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,080
Oh, my gosh. This is so entertaining.

128
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,480
I want to apologize because Moreo and I
fell asleep in class during the lesson.

129
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,720
I also want to apologize.

130
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,120
I fell asleep in class
too just like Ares.

131
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,840
I think apologizing
is really important...

132
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,840
because there are three stages
to apologizing...

133
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,640
Meet me at the cafetaria...

134
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,040
in the second break.

135
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,080
I didn't know, so I'm apologizing.
Because I didn't know.

136
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,680
But the point is,
apologizing is really important.

137
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,240
I'm apologizing. That's how it is.

138
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,200
Looks like someone wants
to join our gang.

139
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,160
No, thanks.

140
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,360
Zea.

141
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,240
Come here.

142
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,840
Sit down.

143
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,840
I was the one
who told her to meet me here.

144
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,600
Because this new kid...

145
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,920
wants to treat us
in order to get to know us better.

146
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,560
Thank you!

147
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,840
Ares, why are you doing this?
Zea already apologized to you.

148
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,600
It's okay, Ser. Let's just say
this is us getting to know each other.

149
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,720
So, what do you guys want to order?

150
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,160
Not just us...

151
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,840
but also all the students
in the cafeteria.

152
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Do you understand me, new kid?

153
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,360
What do you guys want to order?
Just tell the cafeteria lady.

154
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,320
The new kid.

155
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,440
This will be sold out
in an instant, Mang Oji.

156
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,320
Zea.

157
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,640
-Don't get too close to them.
-Yeah.

158
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,920
They're members of the Calderioz gang.

159
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,000
You must have heard of them.
There are so many members in it.

160
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,760
And the six most powerful members
are in this school.

161
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,080
I'll tell you about them.

162
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,720
The one sitting at the edge.

163
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,520
His name's Megan.

164
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,120
(Date of birth, April 3, 2003.
Zodiac, Aries.)

165
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,960
He's one of the members of Calderioz
who is the coolest and talks the least.

166
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,440
And the one over there is Laskar.

167
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,000
(Date of birth, November 2, 2003.
Zodiac, Scorpio.)

168
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,240
(Character, the toughest
who is good at melting people's heart.)

169
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,640
He's the strongest member of Calderioz.

170
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,760
He's a fighter, also known as the guy
who beats people up.

171
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,400
And that one sitting on the table.

172
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,120
That's Moreo.

173
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,840
He's the weakest member of Calderioz.

174
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,360
(Character, class clown, but not cute.)

175
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,563
They're all handsome except him.
Just look at how ugly he is.

176
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,400
Now, the one using his phone is Aiden.

177
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,760
(Date of birth, July 4, 2003.
Zodiac, Cancer.)

178
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,880
(Character, nice, humorous,
has the sweetest smile.)

179
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,040
Calderioz wouldn't be fun without him.

180
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,400
That one is my baby, Ardhan.

181
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,520
He's handsome, isn't he?

182
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,120
(Date of birth, May 27, 2003.
Zodiac, Gemini.)

183
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,120
(Character, flirty,
but his heart is for Karissa.)

184
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,800
He's mine.

185
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,800
Now...

186
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,416
last but not least, him.

187
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:37,760
Antares.

188
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,760
Or you can call him Ares.

189
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,120
(Date of birth, August 4, 2003.
Zodiac, Leo.)

190
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,360
(Character, got perfect charm,
smile, and gaze.)

191
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,680
He's the leader of the Calderioz gang.

192
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,080
Just like the God of War, he's
well-respected by a lot of people...

193
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,880
and admired by all the girls
in this school.

194
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,880
My advice is if you want
to have a safe life here,...

195
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,640
don't get involved with them.

196
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,240
Here's your drink.

197
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,560
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

198
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,280
-Miss, where's Ares's food?
-It's being prepared.

199
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,800
-Please wait a bit, okay?
-It's fine.

200
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,840
-Just give it to someone else.
-Okay. Wait a bit, okay?

201
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,880
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

202
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,985
Where's the food I ordered?

203
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,880
You haven't got yours?

204
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,961
All right. Then order it yourself, okay?

Hey.

225
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,920
Can you not be so lovey-dovey
in front of Laskar?

226
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,160
-Why me?
-Of course, you.

227
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,840
Why me?

228
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,440
Why?

229
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,800
-How much is the total?
-The total is 2,050,000 rupiah.

230
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,040
-I'll pay for my own meal.
-Okay, please wait a second.

231
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,720
I'm not used to eating free food.
I'm usually the one treating people.

232
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,320
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

233
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,120
Your card, please.

234
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,600
Seriously, that new kid is so annoying.

235
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,080
She's being such a snob and she's
so bravely getting close to Ares.

236
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,160
We really can't let her do this.

237
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,680
We need to teach her a lesson.

238
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,840
Hey.

239
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,440
Wait.

240
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,520
-Come here.
-I want to go back to class.

241
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,520
Back to class?

242
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,240
What did you hear?

243
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,320
I didn't hear anything. I'm sorry.

244
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,720
"I'm sorry."

245
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,280
Get over here.

246
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,920
Come here.

247
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,400
-What are you doing?
-Stay still.

248
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,200
Stay still.

249
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,880
So pretty.

250
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,360
Don't clean it up, okay?

251
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,120
Bye.

252
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,160
May I know the reason you moved
from Bandung to Derlangga High School?

253
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,360
I know the answer!

254
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,000
I know the reason
you moved to this school.

255
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:30,105
I'm sure it's because...

256
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,240
-Because I'm here, right?
-Oh, my gosh.

257
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,680
-I actually...
-She's speaking sweetly.

258
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,360
We just met. We need to get to know
each other more...

259
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,760
That's not how it is.

260
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
It's my habit.

261
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Be strong, Mor.

262
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,543
I want to talk to you.

263
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,080
Come with me.

264
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,240
She's the only one who's like that.

265
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,840
No one's here.

266
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,320
Zea just treated everyone.

267
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,240
Maybe everyone's still at the cafeteria.

268
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,280
Do people still do that?
Being a secret admirer?

269
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,320
You should just talk to him directly.

270
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,360
For the sweetest person,...

271
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,317
I need to use the most romantic method.

272
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,440
Whatever.

273
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,600
Excuse me, Ares.

274
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,440
Why do you keep avoiding me?

275
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,320
I want to you to keep your promise.

276
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,280
I needed to go to the toilet.

277
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,400
I'm not done talking to you!

278
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,520
Zea!

279
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,360
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

280
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,200
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

281
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,600
Why didn't you bring me along
to watch the girls dance from the start?

282
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,040
I also didn't want to
because of Karissa.

283
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,240
-And then?
-But after I saw my baby,...

284
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,960
I got excited.

285
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,800
Lame.

286
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,160
What's Ares doing?

287
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,560
I just knew that Ares
wants to join the dance.

288
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,680
Zea's pretty good at dancing.

289
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,920
What's wrong with that person?
He's asking for trouble.

290
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,840
Zea.

291
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,280
Why did you laugh at me?

292
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,720
You're such a sensitive person.

293
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,400
We weren't laughing at him, right?

294
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,200
-You were clearly laughing at me.
-What?

295
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,600
-We weren't.
-We weren't.

296
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,080
Now, dance.

297
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,200
You're always talking nonsense, Ares.

298
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,120
-Me too?
-Do you want to?

299
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,960
-I don't want to. Just you.
-Hey, you two!

300
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,960
You too, Ardhan. You should dance too!

301
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,200
Sorry, Ares. But seriously,
I wasn't laughing at you too.

302
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,880
Me and Megan were playing games, right?

303
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,320
And Ardhan too.

304
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,720
You're in trouble again.

305
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,800
Mang Oji would say,
"Not your loyal friends."

306
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,793
Not your loyal friends.

307
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,880
-"Not loyal."
-I'm playing the song now.

308
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,000
-Are you serious?
-Whatever.

309
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,120
I'll treat you at Mang Oji later.

310
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,720
Come on.

311
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,360
Karissa would love this.

312
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,640
Zea, wait.

313
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,000
Zea.

314
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,880
I want you to join the dance club.

315
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,360
Usually, if someone wants
to join the dance club...

316
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,640
they have to take the test first.

317
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,360
But since I'm the club president,
you can join right away.

318
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,950
Okay?

319
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,080
I'm really sorry.

320
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,920
I was just dancing along
because I was running away from Ares.

321
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,680
I see.

322
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,280
So, you don't want to join
the dance club?

323
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,680
Okay, then.

324
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,560
Why are you like that?

325
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,920
I'm passing over!

326
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,160
Ares!

327
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Hey!

328
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,080
Over here.

329
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,280
Come on! You're so noisy! What?

330
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,920
Where are you going?

331
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,480
I'm so embarrassed
because the girls saw me.

332
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,400
-Now I'm like a...
-And the color is yellow.

333
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,400
-And it had cartoons on it.
-Did you like it?

334
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,720
You're sick.

335
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,240
Hey.

336
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,840
-So arrogant.
-Oh, you.

337
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,720
What is it?

338
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,360
I think someone moved my bag.

339
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,680
Seriously?

340
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,640
If x is 5...

341
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,000
You took your time
going to the restroom.

342
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,000
Can I borrow your notes later?

343
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,240
Which is 2 times 125...

344
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,120
plus 4 times 25...

345
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:21,360
plus 2 will give us the total of 337.

346
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,120
Hey, guys.

347
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,560
Have you tried the new shumai
at the cafeteria?

348
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,920
It's the most delicious shumai
I've ever tried in my life.

349
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,120
-It's really...
-You're exaggerating.

350
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,680
-Just take it easy.
-Seriously.

351
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,160
-It's so good.
-Okay, girls, I'm heading back.

352
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,520
My ride's here.

353
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,080
Bye.

354
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,560
But it's really good.
The meat is like...

355
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,120
Can you introduce me to her?

356
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,520
-Her?
-Her.

357
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,440
Zea.

358
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,400
Someone wants me to
introduce you to him.

359
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,400
Hi.

360
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,880
I'm Zea.

361
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm Fino.

362
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,160
Zea, can I have your phone number?

363
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,880
Sure.

364
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,040
Thank you.

365
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,640
I'll send you a message sometime.

366
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,920
-How sweet.
-What is it?

367
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,440
It's your first day here
and you already have a fan.

368
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,840
Stop it.

369
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,200
Okay.

370
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,800
-Sel, are you coming with me or not?
-Let's go.

371
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,880
We're going home, guys.

372
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,520
-Bye bye, I love you, guys.
-Love you.

373
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,320
Is she kidding?

374
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,160
Babe, let's go home.

375
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,800
Are you sure you want to go home?

376
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,968
Are we going somewhere?

377
00:30:19,008 --> 00:30:21,360
You don't want to go
somewhere else first?

378
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,200
Of course, I do.
Where are you taking me?

379
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,680
-Let's go to a cafe.
-Sure.

380
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,360
Hold on.
Is it going to be the two of us...

381
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,800
or are the others
going to be invited too?

382
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,600
Of course just the two of us.

383
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,960
You know it yourself
that they're all single.

384
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
-They'll be jealous.
-What are you saying?

385
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,480
-Let's go.
-Okay.

386
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,120
Wait up.

387
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:47,480
Hey, babe. Put my cardigan
in your backpack.

388
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,120
My bag's heavy.

389
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,680
-What is that?
-It's for you.

390
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,240
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

391
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,440
Babe.

392
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,920
You always know how to make me happy.

393
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,920
Wait. You didn't do
anything wrong, right?

394
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,440
Of course not, babe.

395
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,080
I just want to remind you
how special you are to me.

396
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,080
Very smooth.

397
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,240
I'm going to open it, okay?

398
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,760
-There's a letter? That's rare.
-There's a letter?

399
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,520
Hold it.

400
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,640
Why is there a letter?
