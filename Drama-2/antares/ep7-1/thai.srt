1
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,560
(Previously...)

2
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,600
We've done everything we could,...

3
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,720
but your son couldn't be saved.

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,600
He didn't make it! What should I do?

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,160
I'm more confident now that she has
something to do with Aiden's murder.

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,040
-That's for sure!
-We don't know that for sure.

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,720
Don't defend her
because you like her, Ares.

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,960
What if she really did it?

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,600
-You killed Aiden!
-Don't! She's a girl!

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,120
Hypocrite!

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,200
I did all that to ruin Calderioz...

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,560
because they put Aeros in a coma.

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,240
Lio is behind all this.

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,000
He tried to harm me and Ares.

15
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,560
And he pit Retro against Calderioz.

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,200
Are you looking for this, Dad?

17
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,640
Stay away from my daughter!

18
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,280
This is your last warning!

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,520
Mr. Damar?

20
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,120
Sir, I'm in love with Serra.

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,800
It wasn't Aiden who raped me.

22
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,520
In fact he wanted to take responsibility
for a mistake he didn't make.

23
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,680
After killing my baby,
why did you have to kill Aiden too?

24
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,480
Who did it?

25
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,960
Tell me!

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,560
I don't know him.

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,280
I don't know.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,520
Good afternoon, sir.

29
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,240
My name is Damar.

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,840
I want to report a murder
of a guy called Aiden.

31
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,720
Dad...

32
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,040
Dad!

33
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:43,102
Ser...

34
00:03:44,462 --> 00:03:46,515
What's wrong, Serra?

35
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:48,242
Who was that, Ser?

36
00:03:48,282 --> 00:03:50,399
Why was there police at your house?

37
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:52,703
Serra.

38
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,973
Does it have to do with Aiden?

39
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:01,000
My dad killed Aiden.

Serra's absent again. Is she sick?

59
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
Try to call her.

60
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,080
Okay, I'll call her.

61
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,000
She's not picking up.

62
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,120
Should we go to her house? I'm worried.

63
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,520
-I'm coming with you.
-Me too.

64
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,040
Cleo...

65
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,760
-You want to join us?
-Cleo, come on.

66
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's go.

67
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,800
Zea.

68
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,960
What is it?

69
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,320
Nothing.

70
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,321
I just wanted to test your ear,...

71
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:49,280
to know if it's still capable
of hearing.

72
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,240
What? It was Serra's dad
who killed Aiden?

73
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,680
And then?

74
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,760
The police has arrested him?

75
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,280
But, don't tell anyone yet.

76
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,040
Well, Serra had the courage
to reveal it this quick.

77
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,600
So, you knew?

78
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,320
A few days ago,...

79
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,280
me,...

80
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,560
Serra...

81
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,760
We checked the evidence together.

82
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,480
I'm sorry...

83
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,040
that I didn't tell you guys.

84
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
Serra told me not to.

85
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,120
She wanted to take care of it
by herself.

86
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,080
Because it was about her dad.

87
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,000
Serra's dad.

88
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,480
My attitude towards Zea was outrageous.

89
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,480
Okay.

90
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,680
To redeem myself,...

91
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,360
I'll clear Zea's name.

92
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,520
I told you.

93
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,760
-Sorry, Res.
-Don't apologize to me.

94
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Serra, don't ever be afraid,
we're all here for you.

95
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,440
I don't think I can bear it anymore.

96
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,920
I don't understand
why all of this happened to me.

97
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,640
I want to follow Aiden
to the other side.

98
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,640
Serra...

99
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
Don't say that.

100
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,640
Serra...

101
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,440
You're allowed to cry.

102
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,080
You're allowed to be weak.

103
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,520
You're allowed to be crushed
and devastated.

104
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,480
But, there's one thing you can't do.

105
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,400
You can't give up.

106
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,040
Karissa's right.

107
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,960
We'll always be there for you.

108
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,680
What if we stay here for a while?

109
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,400
It's okay, my aunt is coming.

110
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,640
We'll stay here until she arrives, okay?

111
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,200
You don't have to think about it.
We're staying, okay?

112
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,960
Love you, Serra.

113
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,200
Thank you very much.

114
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,080
Remember, we also have to apologize
to Zea. She did nothing wrong.

115
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,840
Okay?

116
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,720
Okay.

117
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,880
Wolves?

118
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,400
Maybe you don't know
the meaning of friendship and love yet.

119
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,520
I was never suspicious of Zea.

120
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,640
Because when we love someone,...

121
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,720
we will know their character.

122
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,440
We'll know our loved one is innocent,...

123
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,280
even when the rest of the world
blames them.

124
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,360
Thanks.

125
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,680
Who would've thought
that you could understand love?

126
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,640
Why do you look so serious?

127
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,600
A friend of mine
is going through a misfortune.

128
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:01,480
God have mercy.
I hope God gives your friend patience.

129
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
Amen. Thanks.

130
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,680
Oh, I'm going to Bandung tomorrow
to visit Aeros.

131
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,520
And I'm thinking
to go back there permanently.

132
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,560
But, the end of the semester is near.

133
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,840
Can't Ares make you feel comfortable
at school?

134
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,480
He's annoying.

135
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,680
Okay. So, you're fighting.

136
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,880
Shhh!

137
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,160
I'm sorry.

138
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,520
I'll admit that I did you wrong.

139
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,880
Forgive me if my words hurt you.

140
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,000
I thought you killed Aiden.

141
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,760
If you want to be mad at me
and vent your anger at me,...

142
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,320
I'll take it.

143
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,360
But, don't ever go away from me.

144
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,160
Because I...

145
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,760
Because I want you to be by my side.

146
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,160
You get what I mean, right?

147
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,840
What is Ares trying to say?
He's been typing for so long.

148
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,840
That means he's confused.

149
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,760
That's typical of guys.
They're too proud, but they want it.

150
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,560
Whatever.

151
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,560
Why are you mad at the guy
who hasn't stopped typing, then?

152
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,920
Miss!

153
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,080
(Unknown number.
We can give you a loan. Contact us.)

154
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,800
When you need an assurance,
yet you are offered a loan instead.

155
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:54,982
Okay.

156
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,160
(To Calderioz.
Have you eaten yet, dear?)

157
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,040
Since when do you talk
to us this sweetly?

158
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,680
Since he got more
than he had wished for.

159
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,680
Aeros,...

160
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,240
aren't you tired of sleeping?

161
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm tired.

162
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,960
I miss you.

163
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,960
About Ares, I've tried to find out...

164
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,240
Excuse me. The CT scan result is ready.

165
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,640
Okay, Nurse.

166
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,880
Hold on, okay?

167
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,400
Please.

168
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,640
We need to act immediately.
We don't have much time.

169
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,120
-Do what I told you to.
-Okay. Done.

170
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,680
How are you?

171
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,560
Aeros,...

172
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,680
I promise...

173
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,920
I'll help Zea to find the person
who dared to do this to you.

174
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,400
I also promise...

175
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,560
to always be on Zea's side...

176
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,560
and protect her.

177
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,960
Although she brazenly infiltrated
Calderioz's headquarters.

178
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
Get well soon, okay?

179
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,520
I will always pray for you.

180
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,040
Good bye, Aeros.

181
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,240
Keep the evidence you have
in your grave.

182
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,160
Who pulled out the IV?

183
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,840
Your brother!

184
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,520
What's wrong?

185
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,081
Someone pulled out the IV
and turned off the machine.

186
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:29,800
How can that be?

187
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,080
I don't know.

188
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,160
How is he, Doc?

189
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,200
How's he doing, Doc?

190
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,040
He's stable.

191
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,920
Ares!

192
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,240
Who are you?

193
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
(Don't try to reenact this scene.)

194
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,400
We need to apologize to Zea.

195
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,320
Do you have any idea how to do it?

196
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,360
Just apologize, as simple as that.

197
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,720
But, I'm embarrassed.

198
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,840
I feel bad.

199
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,280
You're the only one who feels that way.
I'm not.

200
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,520
Where's Ares anyway?

201
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,600
He is rejecting my call.

202
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,160
What's wrong with him?
Why is he acting like this?

203
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,680
Just forget it.

204
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,120
Maybe he needs some time alone.

205
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,480
And I bet he also feels bad about Zea.

206
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,680
Then we need to get Ares' relationship
with Zea back on track.

207
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,040
Mor...

208
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,600
You were the cruelest one to Zea.

209
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,280
Should I send her a message?

210
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,080
Don't be lame, talk to her face to face.

211
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,440
Don't be a chicken.

212
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,960
Okay, I'll apologize directly to her,
but you come with me, okay?

213
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,720
Whom are you texting?

214
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,920
I'm sharing our location to my driver.

215
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,400
And I'm asking the guys
to take care of my bike.

216
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,600
How's Aeros?

217
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,920
The doctor said he was stable.

218
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,000
Why were you at the hospital?

219
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,560
I was visiting Aeros.

220
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,200
I wanted to tell him...

221
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,280
that his little sister had the nerve
to deceive Calderioz.

222
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,280
And I told him...

223
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,520
that his little sister
has a crush on me.

224
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,400
Not the other way around?

225
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,480
But, who wants to kill him?

226
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,040
He's in a coma, but someone still wants
to harm him even further?

227
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,240
If we connect it to what happened
the other day...

228
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,920
when you were beaten up
by the Wolves at their headquarters,...

229
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:44,480
there's a chance that today's incident
has something to do with that.

230
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,680
You mean Lio is behind all this?

231
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,040
That's possible.

232
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,000
But, we don't have any solid evidence.

233
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,760
One thing is for sure,...

234
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,560
there's an enemy inside of Wolves.

235
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,560
And you need to be careful.

236
00:26:12,582 --> 00:26:14,142
Especially with Lionel.

237
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,040
Remember, he tried to hurt you.

238
00:26:26,982 --> 00:26:31,262
The best way to defeat the enemy is...

239
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,840
to be their friend,
their best friend,...

240
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,000
and even be just like their brother.

241
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,600
Hello, Bara?

242
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,640
Aeros is stable.

243
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,320
Okay. Thanks.

244
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,280
But, I'm begging you,...

245
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,760
guard him.

246
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,080
I don't want this to happen again.

247
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,120
Okay, Zea.

248
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,480
I'm going to make sure
they're really loyal to Aeros.

249
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,560
Okay.

250
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,560
I gotta go. Bye.

251
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,680
I'm exhausted. I'm tired after fighting
with many people.

252
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,160
I'm going to take a short nap.

253
00:28:19,502 --> 00:28:23,462
With this, I feel my burden's lifted.

254
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,120
You are my sun eternally.

255
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,000
But, that sun is gone now.

256
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,920
How could I live without my sun?

257
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,920
Aiden, I'm sorry.

258
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,480
I'm sorry.

259
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,800
I'm sorry for what my dad did to you.

260
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,840
Know this,...

261
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,200
living with guilt and regret...

262
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,000
is much more painful than death.

263
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,560
But, I never regretted knowing you.

264
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,080
And I never regretted loving you.

265
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,920
And it will always be like that.

266
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,360
Aiden forgives you, I'm sure of that.
This isn't your fault.

267
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,800
No.

268
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,280
Regardless, his death is my fault.

269
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,440
This is all my fault.

270
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,360
-I'm sorry.
-There, there.

271
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,760
This is fate.

272
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,840
This is fate.

273
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,120
I'm heartbroken, too.

274
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,080
You know he was my only son.

275
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,240
But, I can't hold a grudge.
I can't do that to Aiden.

276
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,360
Aiden needs to be in peace over there.

277
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,400
The legal proceeding...

278
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,280
is none of our business.

279
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,520
Let the police do their job.

280
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,680
But, you have to know
that I forgive you.

281
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,760
Okay?

282
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,760
Thank you so much. Thank you.

283
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,880
You're young.
You still have a lot of to live for.

284
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,240
You can't live with regret like this.

285
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,240
You need to be tough.

286
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,400
You can do this.

287
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,960
You need to love those who love you.

288
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,720
Got it?

289
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:48,320
And you need to forgive those
who have done you wrong.

290
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,720
Okay?

291
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,760
Okay.

292
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,520
Thanks.

293
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,360
You said it's a short nap.

294
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,200
I can't feel my legs.

295
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,240
It was short.

296
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,280
It wasn't.

297
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,800
Well, okay.

298
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,800
I'll call you, okay?

299
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,360
Ares, how did you know
where Aeros is hospitalized?

300
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,880
Your maid.

301
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,760
My maid.

302
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,880
From now on, you don't need
to call me like I'm your senior.

303
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,400
Just Ares.

304
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,720
Why, Senior?

305
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Are you in love with me?
