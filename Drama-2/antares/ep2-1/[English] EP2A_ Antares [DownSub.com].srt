1
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,280
(Previously...)

2
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,920
Say sorry, now.

3
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,440
Not that easy.

4
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,800
They are from Calderioz.

5
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,920
You've heard of them, right?

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,800
There are so many members.

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,880
And six of the top members
are in this school.

8
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,200
I'm really sorry.

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,440
What's the benefit for me?

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,000
I will do everything you wish.

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,240
Five wishes.

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,680
You have to fulfill my first wish today.

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,040
Come to the Calderioz's headquarters.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,320
One wish is done.

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,800
I won't give up until we find proof.

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,800
And get our revenge on Ares.

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,600
I know you can do it.

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,440
Hurry up, the gate's closing.

19
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,080
It's all wet.

20
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,120
Why do you have to piss me off
this early?

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,160
You followed me into the toilet?

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,680
-I'm following you?
-What do you call this, then?

23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,240
Isn't it the other way around?

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,440
Oh, my God!

25
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
-Res.
-Hey.

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,360
Look who's here.

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,280
I think I don't want to know.

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,800
-Zea?
-Fino?

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,920
What are you doing here?

30
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,680
It's none of your business.

31
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,160
Get out of here.

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,360
Now tell me, what were you doing?

33
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,560
Nothing.

34
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,080
Did you two...

35
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,000
Get your hands off me!
You're disgusting.

36
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,960
But, maybe we can do it next time.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,520
Should we do it over there?
Or maybe we do it now?

38
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,680
-Continue what you're doing.
-What, are you jealous? Just say it.

39
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,120
-Let's do our business.
-What are you doing?

40
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:26,200
Ionized energy is required to release...

41
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,680
To release... What was it?

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,760
Ionized energy is an energy
from an atom...

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,680
in its gas phase
to release an electron.

44
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,920
So embarrassing!

45
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:59,800
A principal idea is the idea
behind a paragraph.

46
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,680
It's also contained in the beginning
or the last part of the paragraph.

47
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,600
Ares, can you tell me an example
of a storyline idea?

48
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,320
Hey!

49
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,680
What?

50
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,760
-Ares, you should go wash your face.
-Okay, Ma'am.

51
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,960
All right, class, let's continue.

52
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,000
You followed me into the toilet?

53
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,480
-I'm following you?
-What do you call this, then?

54
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,080
Isn't it the other way around?

55
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,240
Oh, my God!

56
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Look who's here.

57
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,640
Ares!

58
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,080
Zea?

59
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,120
What were you thinking just now?
Focus on the subject!

60
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,360
Sorry, Ma'am.

61
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,960

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,200
-That's correct.
-Thanks.

82
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,520
What are you doing, you pervert?

83
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,320
Are you crazy?

84
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,000
-No, I'm not doing anything.
-Just admit it.

85
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,560
We caught you red-handed!

86
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,840
-Admit it.
-I was just taking her pictures.

87
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,280
That means you're stalking,
and it's a crime, you stupid.

88
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,920
Give me your phone.

89
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,200
-This is my privacy.
-Give it to her.

90
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,200
-Or maybe...
-What?

91
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,000
-He has our pictures, too!
-Oh, my god!

92
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,760
-Do you have our pictures?
-You pervert!

93
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,160
-I swear, I don't!
-Grab his phone!

94
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,400
-I can't reach it!
-Grab his phone, quick!

95
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,360
Look, he ran away.
You should've taken it from him.

96
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,400
What do you want?

97
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,840
Huh?

98
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,520
There's quite a lot of pictures.

99
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,600
You know, taking pictures of people
without their permission...

100
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,720
means that you violated their privacy.

101
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Are you going to delete them,
or should I do it for you?

102
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,240
Can't talk?

103
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,960
Don't you ever do that again.

104
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,000
That's a crime, you know?

105
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,800
All you do is dating.
Do your homework for once.

106
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,000
-That's my business.
-Get a girlfriend, then.

107
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,360
-I have one.
-Where is she?

108
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,720
Right here.

109
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,200
Res, I'll see you later.

110
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,080
I have to take my baby Carissa home.

111
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,400
Cut that out.

112
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,360
I'll catch up with you guys.

113
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,360
Don't you have anything better to do
than dating?

114
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,120
-Bye.
-Bye.

115
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,280
Serra.

116
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,360
Want me to take you home?

117
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,480
I will take you anywhere,
even to the wedding altar.

118
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,880
No, thanks.

119
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,200
Okay. Maybe next time?

120
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,960
Cleo. It's fine if you want
to go with them.

121
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,720
No, it's okay.

122
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,600
Aren't you going to look for Zea?

123
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,600
Maybe she's waiting for you
in the bathroom.

124
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,720
Peace be with you!

125
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,280
Hey, where did you get your muffler?

126
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,280
-At a shop near my house.
-Your muffler's nice.

127
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,680
Mor, close your mouth. You look ugly.

128
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,040
Shut up!

129
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,641
Res, I still remember her face...

130
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:08,200
when she saw me
come out of the bathroom.

131
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,280
She freaked out.

132
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,080
-Do you mean Zea?
-Yeah, her!

133
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,200
She looked so cute,
which makes me want to...

134
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,720
Give her a ride on my bike, Res.

135
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,440
-He's jealous!
-He is.

136
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,880
I think you like her.

137
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,960
Because I can see it from your gestures.
You always do this when she's around.

138
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,800
Mor.

139
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,800
But, you know what I mean, right?

140
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,080
That's why...

141
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,840
Why is it salty?

142
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,840
What are you doing?
Are you recording me?

143
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,760
Guys, look at this guy.

144
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,800
All the girls in Jabodetabek
are crazy about him.

145
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,280
He looks even better
when he's doing his magic trick.

146
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,040
Are you recording me?

147
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,560
-Delete the video.
-No way.

148
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,440
Dan, give me the phone!

149
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,200
What if the girls from school see that?
How am I supposed to save my face then?

150
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,280
Delete that!

151
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,200
It's live, how can I delete it?

152
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,800
-I have to go.
-Who's going to pay the bill?

153
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,040
-Thank you, son.
-You are welcome.

154
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,840
Sorry for troubling you.
Thank you.

155
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,240
-Thank you.
-Don't mind that.

156
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,280
I'm too old for this.

157
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,840
I don't think I have the strength.

158
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,480
You're walking on a slope, that's why.

159
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,960
Have you eaten your lunch?

160
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,800
Not yet.

161
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,320
-Let me buy you one.
-Sure, thank you.

162
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,600
Sir, can I have a bowl, please?

163
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,720
Again, sorry for troubling you.

164
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,040
-Thank you very much.
-It's okay.

165
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,920
-Here's your order.
-Thank you.

166
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,720
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

167
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,480
-Drink this.
-Thank you, son.

168
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,400
I got a pair of slippers for you.
You can use this.

169
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,280
Thank God.

170
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,160
Thank you so much.

171
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,480
-I have to go now.
-Okay.

172
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,360
Bara?

173
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,360
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

174
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,880
You never called me since you moved out.

175
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,800
Want to meet tonight?

176
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,840
I'll share my location,
so you can meet with The Wolves.

177
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,200
Of course! I miss you guys.

178
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,000
-All right, see you.
-See you, Zea.

179
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,081
Guys, Zea will be joining us
in a minute.

180
00:18:13,121 --> 00:18:14,280
Seriously?

181
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,040
-It's been a while since I met her.
-Me, too.

182
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,800
Same as me.

183
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,280
Is she staying in Jakarta now?

184
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,360
-Just recently.
-Okay.

185
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,600
So listen up, Kar.

186
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,241
Find out information
on the activities that we can do...

187
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:38,840
when we go for our tour
to the villages.

188
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,240
I'm on it.

189
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,680
I think we should help the locals
with the problems in their village.

190
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,840
Like repairing a broken bridge,
or something like that.

191
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,360
What do you guys think?

192
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,640
-Sounds good to me.
-I agree.

193
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,160
We are now having our meeting.

194
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,840
And these two are playing games.

195
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,040
Look at these champions.
How are you guys doing?

196
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,760
We're good.

197
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,240
I died.

198
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,040
Hello, Bara?

199
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,960
I'm sorry, something just came up.

200
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,320
I can't meet you guys.

201
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,040
I see. All right, Zea. Take care.

202
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,200
She can't make it.

203
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,280
I'm here to collect on your promise.

204
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,840
You said you're going to give me
my money tonight.

205
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,840
If you don't have the money,
I can pay it off for you.

206
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,000
But your girlfriend Sandra
has to be with me tonight.

207
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,000
You should pay your debt.
And not just make empty promises.

208
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,640
I know, but...

209
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,280
Boy.

210
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,640
-What do you mean by this?
-It's nothing. I just...

211
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,080
Did you use me to pay off your debt?

212
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,080
Sandra. Speak of the devil.

213
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,040
We were just talking about you.

214
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,520
Should we go now?

215
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Leave her alone.
Your business is with...

216
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,320
-Sandra.
-Wait.

217
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,440
I told you, leave her alone!

218
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,520
-Leave me alone!
-Sandra!

219
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,320
-Leave me alone! Help me!
-Relax.

220
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,840
-Help!
-Shut up!

221
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,200
Let her go.

222
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,280
We have a pretty girl right here.
Want to join us?

223
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,440
I think you're interested.

224
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
Are you okay?

225
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,760
I'm so scared.

226
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,040
It's alright now.

227
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,160
They can't harm you anymore.

228
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,960
Thanks.

229
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,320
I'm Sandra.

230
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,400
I'm Zea.

231
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,760
Let's get out of here first.

232
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,440
I think we're safe.

233
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,880
Can I ask what happened back there?

234
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,320
My boyfriend put me up for a bet.

235
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,160
I thought he was a nice guy,
but turns out he's not.

236
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,200
-Be careful next time, okay?
-Thank you.

237
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,200
Sandra, are you okay?

238
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,160
Thank God. I was so worried about you!

239
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,320
Where have you been?

240
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,800
Sorry I left you back there,
but I told Ares about this.

241
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,480
I think he's on his way.
Just relax, okay?

242
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,240
What? You called my brother?

243
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,200
What were you thinking?

244
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,120
If he knows I'm still outside
at this hour, I'm dead!

245
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,480
Sandra.

246
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,840
Are you okay?
Who's trying to mess with you?

247
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,320
Where are they?

248
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,720
You?

249
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,000
You know Zea?

250
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
What are you doing here?

251
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,520
She saved me from my useless boyfriend.

252
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,080
And she fought those guys.

253
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,160
Thanks for helping my sister.

254
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,000
You're welcome.

255
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,960
But, why are you here?

256
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,960
I was meeting a friend.

257
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,320
And I heard someone call for help.

258
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,040
Turns out it was your sister.

259
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,360
Are you really okay now?

260
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,400
-I'll go now.
-Thanks again.

261
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,520
Which one of you
was trying to mess with my sister?

262
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,200
Ares.

263
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,840
So she was your sister?

264
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah, she is.

265
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,760
What's up?

266
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,600
You should tell me if there is a fight.

267
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,960
I mean...

268
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,280
Sorry, I mean...

269
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,440
-What?
-I mean...

270
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,560
If only I knew she was your sister...

271
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,840
There's no way I would...

272
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,080
I was just kidding. There's no way
I'd do that to your sister.

273
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,880
Sorry.

274
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,440
Just kidding, huh? Huh?

275
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,640
I swear I didn't know
she was your sister.

276
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,000
I will spare you,...

277
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,000
but on one condition.

278
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,280
One condition?

279
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,640
What condition?

280
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,080
-Are you done?
-I'm done here.

281
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,480
-We're done.
-You think so?

282
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,360
There's still more.

283
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,200
-Do it.
-I'm going to lose a lot of weight.

284
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,440
Be my guest.

285
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,320
Let's make a vlog.

286
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,360
Hello, guys! We're from Calderioz!

287
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,480
Check out our vlog.

288
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,480
-We got someone to clean our bikes!
-Clean our bikes!

289
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,320
Hope you don't catch a cold.

290
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,720
If any of you want a free bike wash,
just come down here.

291
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,960
The usual place. Come on!

292
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,200
Enough. Turn it off.

293
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,280
Let's go.

294
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,160
Make it shiny.

295
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,480
Zea.

296
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,320
-Yes?
-This is for you.

297
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,240
I hope you like it.

298
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,280
Thanks, Fin.

299
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Oh, so sweet! She has an admirer.

300
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,680
Okay, that's enough.

301
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,880
But I don't really like this.
You want this?

302
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,080
-I prefer strawberry juice.
-Give me. Thanks.

303
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,240
Love you.

304
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,640
Fino!

305
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,880
-I'm surprised Zea can fight.
-Me, too.

306
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,560
She's cute and can defend herself.

307
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,080
-The best match for Ares, am I right?
-I agree.

308
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,560
Or, the best match for me.

309
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,240
You should look in the mirror.

310
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,760
Who knows?
I haven't made my move on her.

311
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,600
I'll give her some ice tea.

312
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,560
You should sit with us.

313
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,920
We still have empty seats.

314
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,840
Of course! But, can you feed me?

315
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,960
Of course, babe.

316
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,560
Oh my gosh.

317
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,640
My stomach is suddenly hurting.

318
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,320
Serra!

319
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,520
Why is she leaving, too?

320
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,040
Have you heard the gossip
about that new kid at school?

321
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,880
Have you seen Zea?

322
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,600
No, we haven't.

323
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,040
(Dear, Zea.)

324
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,961
(Please know that you are
the most beautiful girl in the world.)

325
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:49,440
(I fell in love with you
the first time I saw you.)

326
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,360
I'm curious...

327
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,000
Who are you, really?

328
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,840
Let me introduce myself.

329
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,640
Zea.

330
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,240
I'm quite surprised...

331
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,400
that you know how to fight.

332
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,560
Do I need to explain that to you?

333
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,320
Be quiet.

334
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,840
Sorry, Ma'am.

335
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,360
I'm here...

336
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,360
to say thank you for saving my sister.

337
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,920
This is coming from my heart.

338
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,960
But, our agreement...

339
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,880
is still on.

340
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,720
It's not negotiable.

341
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,800
Ares!

342
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,320
Ares, pick up the books.

343
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,720
Zea. You, too.

344
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,600
Me?

345
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,080
Now!
