1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,400
From now on, you don't need
to call me like I'm your senior.

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,920
Just Ares.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,240
Why, Senior?

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,280
Are you in love with me?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,960
Serra, don't ever be afraid,
we're all here for you.

6
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,400
Forgive me, Serra.

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,240
Forgive me.

8
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,640
Serra.

9
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,640
Come on.

10
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:43,082
"To Fiona.

11
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:49,266
You're the secret I can't crack.

12
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:54,681
You're the question
I haven't found the answer yet.

13
00:01:55,653 --> 00:02:00,051
So, with your eyes,
I hope you give me a sign.

14
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:05,464
I just need one.

15
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:08,105
One sign that I couldn't say.

16
00:02:08,707 --> 00:02:15,066
With that sign, I could wait for you
until you're sure of your feeling...

17
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:19,293
until then,
when our feelings meet each other.

18
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,621
From someone who waits
for your sign. Moreo."

19
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:35,316
-Why can't you be patient?
-Is it done yet?

20
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:40,059
It is. Done.

21
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,698
What?

22
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:49,426
What?

23
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:51,847
Are you sure this will work?

24
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:54,972
How do I know?

25
00:02:55,012 --> 00:02:56,879
Just try it and see how it works out.

26
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:00,502
You better try it first,
or else you'll be sorry.

27
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:01,894
Okay?

28
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:08,261
Smells good.

29
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:10,582
Let's go.

30
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,636
-Where do you live?
-Bekasi.

31
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:35,142
-Bekasi? Not far from here.
-Really?

32
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,144
-It is. You want me to take you home?
-Is it okay?

33
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,877
Of course.

34
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:42,824
We can eat together first,
if you want to.

35
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:45,994
-But with this bike.
-That's okay.

36
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:48,182
-You want to sit back there?
-Okay.

37
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:50,291
Come on. Watch your step.

38
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:53,252
-Thank you.
-Can you get there?

39
00:04:02,237 --> 00:04:05,002
Mor...

40
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:07,346
Why did Fiona go with Laskar instead?

41
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:10,746
Get up! You're so heavy.

42
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:15,217
We're sorry. Because of us...

43
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:19,284
Don't apologize.

44
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:22,272
It won't change anything.

45
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,600
It's crazy.

46
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,916
Laskar...

47
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,502
I'm his best friend,
but he snatched my chance!

48
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:42,323
-Be patient.
-He snatched it!

49
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:45,462
It's okay...

50
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:48,127
-There, there...
-Relax.

51
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:52,087
-It's okay. We've tried. If it fails...
-Tried?

52
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:58,330
-I'm your guinea pig?
-No!

53
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,810
-I'm your guinea pig?
-No, we...

54
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:05,416
I'm your guinea pig?

55
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,800
Kar, come here.

56
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:30,432
What's wrong with you?

57
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:32,072
What do you think?

58
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:34,002
You tell me what's wrong.

59
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,986
You rode with Fiona.

60
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:38,705
You know I like her.

61
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:40,225
You know!

62
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:42,442
Are you trying to steal her from me?

63
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:45,280
Enough. He's your friend.

64
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,221
Don't get too upset.

65
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:48,932
A backstabbing friend.

66
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Hey, Mor.

67
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:53,361
Listen.

68
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:55,252
Fiona asked me to drop her home.

69
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:58,666
I couldn't say no to that.

70
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:02,463
How about this?

71
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:04,502
I promise,...

72
00:06:05,018 --> 00:06:06,830
I will never drop her home again,...

73
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,080
and I will not get close to her anymore.

74
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:11,101
That's right.

75
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:17,219
-You're supposed to be supportive to me.
-I know.

76
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:21,342
I've put my biggest effort
to get close to Fiona.

77
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:23,424
-Ask him what I've done.
-I get it.

78
00:06:23,464 --> 00:06:24,697
-Ask him.
-I get it.

79
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:26,588
Okay, then.

80
00:06:26,628 --> 00:06:29,026
You two better make up. Come on.

81
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:31,096
Make up.

82
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:59,809
I think he's maintaining his reputation
in Jakarta,...

83
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:03,222
although he kissed you back in Bandung.

84
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:06,502
But, here in Jakarta,
he pretends he doesn't know you.

85
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:16,302
Zea, a girl should be pursued by a guy,
not the other way around.

86
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:19,849
I agree with that!

87
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:24,849
Guys, I have an idea.

88
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,649
What if our two gangs...

89
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,289
make a joint plan
to unite Ares and Zea?

90
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:37,169
They look so in love,
but they need our support, right?

91
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:42,329
She's so smart. My baby.
What do you think?

92
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:46,049
Why are you asking me?
Of course I agree.

93
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:50,689
I'm the expert on romantic things.
Right, babe?

94
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:54,089
Okay, deal. Everyone agrees?

95
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:55,889
-Agree!
-Come on!

96
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:21,507
Dear, Dad. How are you?
I hope you're doing well.

97
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:27,306
I'm working on myself to be tough
and trying to live better.

98
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:32,876
I can't believe that our relationship
has become like this.

99
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:38,314
Dad, honestly, I was mad
at you at first.

100
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:39,874
I was disappointed.

101
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:46,200
But, I realized that you meant well,
you just wanted to protect me.

102
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,363
And I realized that I love you so much,
and also Aiden.

103
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:55,006
Let time heal our wounded hearts.

104
00:08:55,046 --> 00:09:00,022
Forgive me for being silent
and hiding my problems...

105
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:05,723
which made you, who loves me so much,
act out of control.

106
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:10,563
I know you did it out of love.

107
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:15,483
What happened is in the past.
I forgive you. Be well.

108
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:18,681
I'm waiting for you to come
and hold me again...

109
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:21,843
the way you used to do every day.

110
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:30,473
You're useless!
You can't even do your job!

111
00:09:30,513 --> 00:09:35,753
You have to find a way to get in again!
Got it?

112
00:09:37,564 --> 00:09:39,404
You're all stupid!

113
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:43,193
You can't even do an easy task.

114
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:53,229
Hey! What can you actually do? Huh?

115
00:10:05,622 --> 00:10:09,582
Hey, have you seen Selina,
Cleo, and Karissa?

116
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,382
I mean, Ares.

117
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:14,881
I haven't seen them.

118
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:18,702
I'm waiting for the Calderioz.
I don't know where they are.

119
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:23,513
Just sit here.

120
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:24,753
Okay then.

121
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:40,130
Hello, ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to Mang Oji's Stall.

122
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,930
I'm bringing this special menu for you.
Here you go.

123
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,890
Here is a portion of tteokbokki,
two donuts, and juice.

124
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,730
Juice For Life Better,
especially for you.

125
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,130
-We haven't ordered yet.
-Calm down, everybody.

126
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,930
It's all been paid for by Raskai.

127
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,730
Zea, do you know why donut
have a hole in the middle?

128
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,330
Because what's whole
is Ares' love for Zea.

129
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,250
What are you talking about?

130
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,290
Res, what are you waiting for?
Ask her to be your girlfriend.

131
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,330
It's not that simple,
she's not an ordinary girl.

132
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,330
-I support you anyway.
-What is this?

133
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,690
Why are you guys whispering?

134
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,890
Nothing.

135
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,850
Why are you whispering to Mang Oji
in front of me?

136
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,730
-Nothing.
-What?

137
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,250
Nothing.

138
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,530
Okay then.

139
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,290
I'll go find them.

140
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,170
Wait.

141
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,610
Stay here.

142
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,730
Eat these. Such a waste to leave them.

143
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,850
Sit. Okay?

144
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,490
Okay.

145
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,690
What's wrong?

146
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,970
You shouldn't eat too fast.
It is making you choke on the food.

147
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,570
What's wrong with you?

148
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,690
Why are you so mean?
Can't you be nicer?

149
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,610
You made me lose my appetite.

150
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,290
Such a wishy-washy.

151
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,330
What?

152
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,210
Think for yourself. Introspect yourself.

153
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,930
I can't stand looking at them.

154
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,361
They keep on fighting,...

155
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:07,210
although it's so clear
that they are in love.

156
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,330
I don't get it. They just need to say,
"I love you", "I love you too."

157
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,490
-That's it!
-Right.

158
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,170
Ares needs to learn a lot from us.

159
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,890
Guys, plan A failed.
We continue to plan B.

160
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,730
-Thanks, Mang.
-You're welcome.

161
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,930
-Thanks, Mang.
-No problem.

162
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,241
"Invitation for a match...

163
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:51,610
at the Calderioz
headquarters boxing ring."

164
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,370
What does it mean?

165
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,690
It means...

166
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,170
Calderioz is challenging
Wolves' capo to a boxing match.

167
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,610
Against the leader of Calderios.

168
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,570
You accept the challenge?

169
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,410
Why should I be afraid?

170
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,570
Okay. Get ready to lose.

171
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,290
Just talk to yourself.

172
00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:41,899
What should we do now?

173
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:45,480
They're like Tom and Jerry.

174
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,240
There's no way Zea's coming.

175
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm sure Zea will come.

176
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,800
Let's wait and see.

177
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,520
That's them. Zea!

178
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,400
Welcome, contestants.

179
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,702
This is a match between Wolves
and Calderios...

180
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:21,782
that has never happened before.

181
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,080
Are you ready?

182
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,822
Get in here.

183
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,502
Ladies first.

184
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:34,862
Zea...

185
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:36,902
You can do it!

186
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:49,760
Here you go.

187
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,622
Wear this.

188
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:55,902
You have to defeat Ares
for accusing you of killing Aiden.

189
00:15:58,182 --> 00:16:03,800
-Have a good fight.
-Zea! You can do it!

190
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,862
Go, Zea!

191
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:09,640
Calm down.

192
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,280
Okay, let's start this.

193
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,502
Ready... And fight!

194
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:27,862
Ares!

195
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,800
Zea!

196
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,680
Nice, Zea!

197
00:16:56,022 --> 00:17:00,702
I'm going to bet. If Zea wins, I will
give my bike to the girls gang.

198
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:02,120
-Okay!
-But...

199
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,280
-What?
-But, if Ares wins...

200
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,720
one of you must go on a date with me.

201
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,560
Okay! I accept it. I believe Zea
will win. See for yourself.

202
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:16,222
Zea...

203
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,840
Are you ready to lose?

204
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:28,542
Res...

205
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,222
I'm actually...

206
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:44,502
Okay.

207
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,840
Not bad.

208
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,160
I did that on purpose.
You want to know a trick?

209
00:17:51,742 --> 00:17:53,062
Hold on.

210
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,440
For your moves to get better.

211
00:17:57,704 --> 00:17:59,104
When my hand is here...

212
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,320
-Oh, no!
-Yes!

213
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,840
You...

214
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:12,622
-Go, Zea!
-Ares is just kidding, right?

215
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:21,608
And the winner is...

216
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,662
Zea!

217
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:28,622
-Zea!
-Amazing!

218
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,440
The bike registration
and ownership document!

219
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:35,622
Don't cheat!

220
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,240
Hurry! Keep your promise.

221
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,360
Yes!

222
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,262
-Aceept it, okay?
-It's okay.

223
00:18:53,302 --> 00:18:55,262
In life, there are lots of problems.

224
00:18:58,182 --> 00:18:59,520
Take good care of my bike.

225
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,160
Your bike? You mean, my bike!

226
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:06,942
Bye!

227
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:11,462
It's your own fault! Come on!

228
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:17,702
-Zea, you're skillful!
-You can do anything! Such a dream girl!

229
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:22,422
-You're amazing!
-Girl crush.

230
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:29,456
-I'm...
-I'm...

231
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,240
You first.

232
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,160
I'm sorry...

233
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:41,702
for my misunderstanding.

234
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:46,742
I'm sorry, too.

235
00:19:56,624 --> 00:19:58,144
I was outrageous.

236
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:00,864
Forgive me.

237
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,630
Me, too.

238
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:08,001
I'm sorry.

239
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:15,882
-I feel bad...
-No problem.

240
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:18,942
It's okay.

241
00:20:24,382 --> 00:20:26,222
You're all forgiven.

242
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,862
Kak, where's your bike?
Come on, I want to see it.

243
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,622
-That's right.
-I want to see it too.

244
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,222
Hey, but did you actually...

245
00:20:51,262 --> 00:20:52,822
What?

246
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:55,502
Did you try to...

247
00:21:29,552 --> 00:21:30,912
Sit.

248
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:49,022
What's this?

249
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:52,062
I don't know.

250
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,182
When I arrived, I was told to sit here.

251
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:01,808
Where are the others anyway?

252
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,080
I'm happy to see them get along.

253
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:13,102
They're so sweet.

254
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:16,822
Do you envy them, Cleo?

255
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,560
Maybe they did this on purpose.

256
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,520
But, it's not a bad place.

257
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:41,474
I think the food will be great.

258
00:22:41,514 --> 00:22:42,674
We'll see.

259
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,662
Here it is.

260
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:55,462
I envy them.

261
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,120
Poor guy!

262
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,502
How could you say that?

263
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,342
Enough.

264
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,761
Why can't you all stop talking?

265
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,902
If they know we're here,
we'll ruin this for them.

266
00:23:14,222 --> 00:23:15,462
Hey.

267
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,720
But, did you do it on purpose yesterday?

268
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:22,222
We're still talking about yesterday?

269
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:23,502
That's right.

270
00:23:25,662 --> 00:23:28,022
-Did you do it on purpose?
-What do you think?

271
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,040
You didn't need to pity me
and pretend to lose.

272
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,742
I could win it fairly.

273
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,982
You think I did it on purpose?

274
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:43,742
Do you think that you lost
or you won yesterday?

275
00:23:43,782 --> 00:23:45,302
Of course, I won.

276
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,582
Okay, then.

277
00:23:47,622 --> 00:23:49,382
What do you mean, then?

278
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,880
Forget it. Stop talking about the past.

279
00:23:59,382 --> 00:24:03,942
But, watch out,
don't try to do that again.

280
00:24:03,982 --> 00:24:06,342
I can win fairly.

281
00:24:06,382 --> 00:24:07,982
Because I really can.

282
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,520
Please, can you not point
the fork at me?

283
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,222
It's your fault.

284
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,361
Enough of this, babe.

285
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:28,600
Instead of watching
other people's date,...

286
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,040
we better find somewhere else
to be together, just the two of us.

287
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,960
I would love that.
Take me to Serra's afterwards, okay?

288
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,360
-Of course.
-You're so adorable.

289
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,662
Tell the others to find Aeros.

290
00:24:50,702 --> 00:24:52,662
-Find him now!
-Let's go!

291
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:07,142
Look, a pretty girl.

292
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,422
-What are you doing here?
-Don't touch me!

293
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:17,222
-Hey, baldy!
-Help!

294
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:24,502
Moreo!

295
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:37,280
Are you okay, Sel?

296
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,680
Are you okay?

297
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,680
I'm fine.

298
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,822
Mor,...

299
00:25:43,862 --> 00:25:45,760
I swear,...

300
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,702
I can't imagine what could have happened
if you were not here.

301
00:25:48,742 --> 00:25:50,920
It would be bad. Thank God I'm here.

302
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,360
Thank you.

303
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,400
Well, let me buy you something to eat.

304
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,022
Oh, no. When I'm exhausted like this,
I don't need to eat.

305
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,422
What I need is love.
What if we go on a date?

306
00:26:09,382 --> 00:26:11,182
You mean, we hang out,
just the two of us?

307
00:26:11,222 --> 00:26:13,121
Of course! We can't do it
with other people.

308
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:14,539
It would be a group study then.

309
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,142
Come on, are you in?

310
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:20,342
-Okay!
-Let's go.

311
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,400
Is it good?

312
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,982
-It is.
-Seriously?

313
00:27:09,022 --> 00:27:11,502
-What are you eating?
-Spaghetti.

314
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:13,680
Oh, spaghetti!

315
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,200
I thought that's vermicelli.

316
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,862
Do you want this? It tastes good. Here.

317
00:27:27,902 --> 00:27:30,840
-I'll feed you.
-You don't need to. You eat that.

318
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,480
-I want to feed you.
-You eat that.

319
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,480
Don't be shy.

320
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,960
You eat that. I'm already full.
This tastes amazing!

321
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,222
-It's okay. Don't be shy.
-No, thanks.

322
00:27:41,262 --> 00:27:43,280
Okay, then.

323
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,280
-It tastes good.
-Yeah.

324
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,182
Hello, guys.

325
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:02,742
I'm having dinner with...

326
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:05,480
Mor, I don't want to be in your video.

327
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,680
-Just a bit.
-No way!

328
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,622
-I'm shy!
-It's just for the opening.

329
00:28:11,662 --> 00:28:14,560
-I don't want to.
-I'll edit it.

330
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,840
-Just a bit.
-Turn that off!

331
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,000

your comatose brother,...)
