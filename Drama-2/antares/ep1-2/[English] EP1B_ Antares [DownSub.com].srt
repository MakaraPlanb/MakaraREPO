1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,080
-There's a letter? That's rare.
-There's a letter?

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,840
Hold it.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,960
Why is there a letter?

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,520
"For you who've made my days
feel lonely...

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,880
when you're far from my sight."

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,640
"From Anya"?

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,360
Anya? Why is it from Anya?

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,080
What does this mean?

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,640
So there's something going on
with Anya?

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,520
-No, there isn't.
-Then what is this?

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,520
Listen to my explanation first, babe.
Listen to me.

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,320
I don't need to. This is so obvious.
There's something between you and Anya?

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,280
You were playing around with me
this whole time?

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,040
No, babe. This is from Ares.
Ares was the one who gave it to me.

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,720
You're really good at making excuses.
Don't involve Ares into this.

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,440
Don't involve other people.
This is our relationship!

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,040
Babe, this is a misunderstanding.
So, please calm down and listen to me.

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,600
I can't calm down, Ardhan!
You're playing around with me!

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,240
Look at this!

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,120
I don't know what else to tell you.

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,880
Okay, then. I'll go ask Anya myself.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,280
Don't do it, babe.

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,720
It'll be embarrassing.

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,640
Is it? Or you don't want me
to know the truth?

25
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,520
I don't know what to do.

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,720
Hey.

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,320
Why did you give perfume
to my boyfriend?

28
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,720
You're an eleventh grader,
but you're so rude.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,840
Can you be a little more polite?

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,080
Stop making excuses. Answer me!

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,360
Don't fight here.

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,720
Wait. And why is the perfume with you?

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,360
Babe. Let's go.

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,080
I already told you this perfume
is from Ares. Let's go.

35
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,760
Why is this with you? It's for Ares.
Why did you take it?

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,000
Ares doesn't like it if people give
things to him secretly like this.

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,786
Do you get it?

38
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,040
Whatever. Just go.

39
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,130
Anyway, it's all clear, right?

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,960
-Go.
-You go.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,622
You should go, of course!

42
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,280
You're still here?

43
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,520
I'm waiting for my ride.

44
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:42,067
You?

45
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,000
Hello? You're here?

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay, wait for me.

47
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,280
Fin, I have to go.

48
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,960
-Okay. Take care.
-Okay.

49
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,880
Who is this?

50
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,190
-Give it back to me.
-Stop it.

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,920
Answer me. Who is this?

52
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,800
-Answer her.
-Zea.

53
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,800
Oh, you.

54
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,680
-It'd look better if we did this.
-Don't do that.

55
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,080
Stop bothering us.

56
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,400
It'd look better if we did this.

57
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,320
It suits her.

58
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,120
It suits her, right? It suits her.

59
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,640
-Bye, Fino.
-Bye.

60
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,720
You have to grant my first wish tonight.

61
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,840
Come to Calderioz headquarters.

62
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,127
I can't. I have something to do.

63
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Hey.

64
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,520
Give it back.

65
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,480
What are you doing?

66
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,240
Save my number.
I'll share you the location.

67
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,640
Don't be late.

68
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,320
Treating everyone at the cafeteria
wasn't your first wish?

69
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,080
Then that's done.
There's just two wishes left.

70
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,520
That was just a warm-up.

71
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,080
It doesn't count.

72
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,520
Welcome to Calderioz headquarters!

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,240
Awesome.

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,960
-Boss, here are the fans.
-What is it?

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,040
Please say hello to them.
What are you doing?

76
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,440
Hey, you're not done yet.
Try to calm down a little.

77
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,960
Be patient. Let's continue this.
Okay, guys. That was Ares.

78
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,200
Come on!

79
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,280
That's how you do it.

80
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,800
Why isn't he picking up?

81
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,800
Hey, guys. Look who came.

82
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,640
Not just anyone can come
to Calderioz headquarters.

83
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,480
She's the girl who treated us. Right?
You should treat us often.

84
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,200
You should come here often too.

85
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,200
It'd be fun when there's a girl here.

86
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,160
Right?

87
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,400
You should be coming to meet me,
not just standing there.

88
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,120
He's taking her!

89
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,120
They were just fighting yesterday
and now they're...

90
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,240
Bring me a drink.

91
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,240
No.

92
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,560
Let me make this clear.

93
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,600
I asked you to come here
to grant my first wish.

94
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,480
Do everything I tell you to.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Now, bring me a drink.

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,320
Okay. What do you want?

97
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,840
Anything is fine.

98
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,600
Zea, there are cockroaches there.
I'll come with you.

99
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,840
Don't be like that, Ares.

100
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,120
How could you order a pretty girl
like that around?

101
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,360
What?

102
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,320
He's so annoying.
He told me to bring him a drink.

103
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,640
Now that I'm here, he already left.

104
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,800
-Where did they go?
-I don't know.

105
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,920
Oh, my goodness.

106
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,000
Be patient.
You're doing okay, right?

107
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,520
Okay, then. I'm going home.

108
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,640
Okay. I'll go with you, okay?

109
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,600
You don't have to.
I can go home by myself.

110
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,760
I mean, I'll take you to the door.

111
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,600
-Okay.
-Okay? Come on.

112
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,400
Are you crazy? What if that had hit me?

113
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,323
It didn't hit you, right?

114
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,159
Pick it up.

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,800
No!

116
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,666
-I said, pick it up.
-No!

117
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,200
I tried to be patient.
But this is crossing the line.

118
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,166
Are you doing this on purpose?

119
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,240
Wait!

120
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,800
Zea!

121
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,680
Hold on.

122
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,120
Where are you going?

123
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,600
Your first wish is completed.

124
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,440
So cute, Cleo!

125
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
Of course.

126
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,280
Please come to my party.

127
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,680
Please come to my party.
Don't miss it.

128
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,440
Anya, please come to my party.

129
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,160
Ares.

130
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Please come
to my sweet seventeen party tonight.

131
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,400
I have something to do tonight.
So, I don't think I can come.

132
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,240
But I can ask
for your good wishes, right?

133
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,440
-It's okay, Cleo. I'll come.
-Okay.

134
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,320
-One more.
-Here you go.

135
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,760
-Give me one more, for Aiden.
-Here you go.

136
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,280
Babe, you'll come, right?

137
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,720
If you don't come,
who will I go to the party with?

138
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,948
Of course I'll come, babe.

139
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,471
Wherever you are, I'll always be there.

140
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,760
-What's with you?
-You're just jealous.

141
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,280
See you later.

142
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,000
Zea, come here!

143
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,080
The invitation for Zea.

144
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,200
A special invitation for Zea.

145
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,840
The new kid that caused a sensation
in this school.

146
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,400
Zea, there are only two types of girls
in this school.

147
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,280
The first are the girls
who are crazy for the Calderioz boys.

148
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,120
And the second are the girls
who are afraid...

149
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,520
and even have a phobia of them.

150
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,400
And we salute you because you
don't belong to any of the two.

151
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,320
-Come to the party.
-Yes, you should come.

152
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,560
If you don't come,
who will be my rival there?

153
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,200
Come on, just come.

154
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,680
I'll come if I'm in the mood.

155
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,080
"Mood."

156
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,880
-Let's go.
-How annoying.

157
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,360
It'll be so much fun.
What should our dress code be?

158
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,560
-Peach! But if it's that...
-What about purple?

159
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,000
Ares.

160
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,960
You haven't gotten ready yet?

161
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,960
You know that I don't like going
to those things.

162
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,240
Oh, my gosh.

163
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,040
Come on, Ares.

164
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,480
I'm sure Cleo's pretty friends
from other schools will be there.

165
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,640
Just go.

166
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,920
But if you don't come, Ares,
we'll still go there.

167
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,000
-Even if they'll look like losers.
-Hey, Mr. Know-It-All.

168
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,600
You're speaking nonsense.

169
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,960
But, Ares, if you don't come,
it won't be fun.

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,600
We won't have our leader.

171
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,760
Hey.

172
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,720
Let me tell you something important.

173
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,760
Without you, our gang
is like Barcelona without Messi.

174
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,880
It's like a rice box without the rice.

175
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,000
It's like Coboy Junior
without Zayn Malik.

176
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,720
He's no longer part of it.

177
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,640
Okay... The point is, you're coming.
Hurry up. Go and get changed.

178
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,994
-Hurry.
-Okay, I'll go.

179
00:12:20,604 --> 00:12:22,000
There we go.

180
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,480
-Now it's fun.
-I'll be there too.

181
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,800
So, that it won't be like a fan,
but there's no wind.

182
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,280
I already dressed up like The Weekend.
It'd be crazy if I didn't go.

183
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,640
-Cleo, happy birthday, girl!
-Thank you.

184
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,240
-Hi, Cleo. Happy birthday.
-Thanks for coming, Zea.

185
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,160
Girl, happy birthday!

186
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,280
Oh, my God. You look so pretty!

187
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,880
-Thank you.
-I hope that at your age of 17,...

188
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,400
you'll become prettier, smarter.

189
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,960
Wish you all the best.

190
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,800
-You're so pretty!
-Thank you.

191
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,600
Hi.

192
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,520
-Happy birthday, Cleo!
-Thank you.

193
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,680
-Happy birthday, Cleo.
-Thank you.

194
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,760
-Are my friends here yet?
-Not yet.

195
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,600
Maybe it'd be good if they don't come.
So the party will be peaceful.

196
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,520
You guys should go and get something
to eat there.

197
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,360
Let's go. Let's get something to eat.

198
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,040
Let's go.

199
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,120
Hello, Cleo! Hello!

200
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

201
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,240
May you live long
and will always be healthy.

202
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,560
-Happy 17th birthday, Cleo.
-Thank you.

203
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,160
-Happy birthday. Wish you all the best.
-Thank you.

204
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,800
-Happy birthday, Cleo.
-Thank you.

205
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,720
-Happy birthday, Cleo.
-Thank you.

206
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,160
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you, Ares.

207
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,120
Have fun, guys.
I will leave you guys here.

208
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,720
Ares.

209
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,200
Hi.

210
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,520
I'm surprised.
I thought you weren't coming.

211
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,760
See you.

212
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,400
Okay.

213
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,240
Hi!

214
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,680
Oh, my gosh, guys.

215
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,840
-Cleo. Is that a photobooth?
-Yes, it is.

216
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,680
Guys, let's take some photos.

217
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,800
No, let's do it later.
Let's eat first. I'm hungry.

218
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,880
Karissa, if we take the photo
after eating,...

219
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,840
we'll look fat in the photo.

220
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,040
Zea looks so pretty.

221
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,560
I don't want to look fat in the photo.
Come on, let's take some photos first!

222
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,120
I'm mesmerized by her.

223
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,720
-Come on.
-Let's go.

224
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,120
Let's go.

225
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,800
Hey, let's go take some photos.

226
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,440
-Get ready!
-Okay.

227
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,960
-One...
-Hold on.

228
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,320
-What is it?
-Hey, you!

229
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,520
Come and take some photos with us.

230
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,800
-Come on.
-Just go and take your photos.

231
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,080
You're no fun.

232
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,200
-Come on, Ares.
-To make it quick!

233
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,120
Come on, baby girl.

234
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,280
I'm just kidding, baby girl.

235
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,360
-Get in. Make way for my boss.
-Okay.

236
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,000
Get ready, everyone! Get ready.

237
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,520
Get ready.

238
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,520
It's too close.

239
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,720
I don't even want to be close to you.

240
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
-Another one, okay?
-Another one.

241
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,680
Come on. Get ready.

242
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,006
What's with you?
Don't get so close to me.

243
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:55,360
You're using this opportunity
to get close.

244
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,640
Of course I am!

245
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,680
Oh, my gosh.

246
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,360
-It's your fault!
-Moreo!

247
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,840
How could this happen?

248
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Please use less butter.

249
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,640
Serra.

250
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,320
I found your favorite cake.

251
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,880
Rainbow cake.

252
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,320
It's been a while since I ate this.

253
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,160
-But I don't like it anymore.
-Wait, Ser.

254
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,480
-When can we get back together?
-Stop, Aiden.

255
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,720
That's impossible.

256
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,240
Everything has changed.

257
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,840
Ser.

258
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,080
Nothing has changed.

259
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,760
I'm still here.

260
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,720
It's the result. It's good.
Seriously, it's funny.

261
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,440
-Let me see.
-It's awesome.

262
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,440
Take a look.

263
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,520
-Zea, here.
-It's so funny.

264
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,520
-It's funny. You look awesome here.
-What were you doing?

265
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,160
Hey, social climber.

266
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,960
I know that you're getting close
to the Calderioz boys...

267
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,920
just so you can be famous
at school, right?

268
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,360
And I also know that you went
to Calderioz headquarters last night.

269
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,760
What were you doing there?

270
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,720
They took turns on you, didn't they?

271
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,080
Stop!

272
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,440
Anya! Zea!

273
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,520
If you want to fight, don't do it here.

274
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,640
Don't you feel bad for Cleo
if her party is ruined?

275
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,280
What are you even doing here?
Did someone invited you?

276
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,800
You're right.

277
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,120
She's not worth my time.

278
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,320
Hey, guys.

279
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,440
-Did you see that?
-See what?

280
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,680
Zea slapped Anya.

281
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,720
-Are you serious?
-Of course.

282
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,640
That's insane.

283
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,440
It's the first time
I saw such a brave girl.

284
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,000
Just wear it.

285
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,728
You're the only girl...

286
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:14,920
who dares go against the Calderioz gang
and Anya's gang.

287
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,800
I don't know who you are.

288
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,800
But, I advise you to be careful.

289
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,000
I don't know if it's you or me
who has to be careful.

290
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,040
Wait.

291
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,080
Give it back.

292
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,520
You look great with untied hair.

293
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,160
What's wrong with you? Don't you
have anything to do in the morning?

294
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,320
How cute. You guys are already together.

295
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,600
Zea, don't let Ares be taken by Anya.

296
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,640
There's nothing between us.

297
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,720
Stay away from me.

298
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,720
Don't let gossip like this
spread around the school.

299
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,520
I don't even want that.

300
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,080
Okay, then.

301
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,751
Miss.

302
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,837
Can I go to the clinic?

303
00:20:55,877 --> 00:20:59,149
-I'm feeling sick.
-Okay, go ahead.

304
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:02,258
-Thank you.
-It must be because of last night.

305
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:05,212
Miss, let me go with Zea.

306
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,400
-It's okay. I can go by myself.
-Seriously?

307
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,946
You're burning. Do you have a fever?

308
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:58,146
Why? You're worried about me?

309
00:21:59,346 --> 00:22:01,306
No, I'm not.

310
00:22:01,346 --> 00:22:04,426
I'm worried that the pole
will get scratched if you crash into it.

311
00:22:13,226 --> 00:22:15,186
Zea.

312
00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:17,666
Zea!

313
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:23,026
Excuse me. Someone's fainted.

314
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,626
Zea.

315
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,026
Zea, wake up.

316
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:32,866
Zea.

317
00:22:32,906 --> 00:22:36,106
Oh, my God. Zea, wake up.

318
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,386
-I'll take care of her.
-It's okay, I want to help.

319
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:41,946
I'll take care of her.

320
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,706
Okay?

321
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:45,706
Okay, then.

322
00:22:45,746 --> 00:22:47,826
I'll go to the class.

323
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,426
-What happened to her?
-She fell in the hallway.

324
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:56,226
She passed out.
So, I carried her here.

325
00:22:56,266 --> 00:22:57,746
Thank you, Miss.

326
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,266
You have to get more rest.

327
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:19,506
"More rest"?

328
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:25,947
Don't worry. I'll look after her.

329
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,906
-Okay, then. I have to go.
-Okay, Miss.

330
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:44,466
What are you doing here?

331
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,786
I want to help you to get well soon.

332
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:51,466
So, that we can fight again.

333
00:23:51,506 --> 00:23:54,120
Because fighting you
turns out to be fun.

334
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,906
Your coming here
is actually making me more sick.

335
00:23:56,946 --> 00:23:58,866
You're not helping me at all.

336
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,160
How to do it?

337
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:11,108
Are you asking me?

338
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:14,946
Nope.

339
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,786
Get out of here.

340
00:24:37,746 --> 00:24:39,346
Zea!

341
00:24:39,386 --> 00:24:41,506
Are you okay? They said that you went
to the school clinic.

342
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,826
What happened?

343
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:47,426
I'm fine now.
I'm heading back home too.

344
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:50,266
Thank goodness. I feel relieve.

345
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:54,346
Just admit it that you did that
on purpose to get Ares' attention.

346
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:58,506
The new kid's trying
to get her senior's attention.

347
00:24:58,546 --> 00:25:00,426
You're shameless.

348
00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:06,956
What's wrong with her?

349
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:08,986
She's just jealous
because she can't get Ares.

350
00:25:09,026 --> 00:25:10,506
Zea, don't think about it.

351
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:15,266
She is weird.

352
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,986
-Let's just go home.
-Okay.

353
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:20,586
We're going now.
Serra's been waiting there.

354
00:25:20,626 --> 00:25:22,706
-Bye bye.
-Bye.

355
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:32,426
-Are you sure you're fine?
-I'm fine.

356
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:34,266
Get on.

357
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,546
I'll take you home.

358
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:40,466
You don't have to.
I can go home by myself.

359
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,146
Bye.

360
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,146
If something happens to you,
and I didn't help you,...

361
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:54,626
my good reputation could be ruined.

362
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:57,866
So, I'm helping you
just because of basic human decency.

363
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,556
I hate rejection.

364
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,506
Come on.

365
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:12,026
How cute, a new couple.

366
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:15,706
Give me your helmet.

367
00:26:15,746 --> 00:26:17,986
-For what?
-Hurry and give it to me.

368
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:21,906
-How about me?
-Borrow one from the security guard.

369
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:23,586
And how about him?

370
00:26:26,826 --> 00:26:28,746
I think we're going to have
a double date soon.

371
00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:31,320
-You're right, babe.
-That's impossible.

372
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,840
Indeed.

373
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:37,746
A weak girl like you isn't my type.

374
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,986
Because I've been in fights often,
I like girls who are gentle.

375
00:26:44,026 --> 00:26:46,626
I'd like to be loved and spoiled.

376
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:49,226
-Are you serious?
-Of course I am.

377
00:27:13,906 --> 00:27:16,346
Serra. Get on.

378
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,346
Let's have a reunion too.

379
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:24,106
You're the best.

380
00:27:24,146 --> 00:27:26,586
-Come on, wear this.
-Come on, Ser.

381
00:27:26,626 --> 00:27:29,786
Even Zea did not mind going with Ares.

382
00:27:29,826 --> 00:27:31,386
Wear this.

383
00:27:36,706 --> 00:27:39,226
Aiden, let's go.

384
00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:08,470
Just return it to me tomorrow.

385
00:28:13,106 --> 00:28:14,485
Thanks.

386
00:28:25,156 --> 00:28:27,756
What are you doing? Just go.

387
00:28:29,266 --> 00:28:32,157
I'm waiting for you
to get into your house safely.

388
00:28:38,186 --> 00:28:39,586
Bye.

389
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:11,360
-Hello?
-Hi, Zea. How is it?

390
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,906
Did you get information about Ares?

391
00:29:13,946 --> 00:29:17,706
I tried to investigate,
but I haven't found any evidence.

392
00:29:17,746 --> 00:29:19,546
I understand.

393
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:22,426
Because it's only been a few days
for you in that school.

394
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:26,666
But don't be careless.
And continue searching for evidence.

395
00:29:26,706 --> 00:29:29,986
Remember that your purpose
of coming to Jakarta...

396
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:32,480
is to look for evidence
that Ares is the one...

397
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,167
who made your brother, Eros,
go into a coma for a whole year.

398
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,426
I won't ever forget my mission.

399
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:41,426
And I promise that I won't give up
until we find evidence...

400
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,400
and get our revenge against Ares.

401
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,200
You can do this.

402
00:30:11,884 --> 00:30:13,204
Ros.

403
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,040
Ros!

404
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,200
-Ros, wake up!!
-Zea.

405
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,240
Zea, be patient. Just a minute, Zea.

406
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,960
-Ros!
-Ros, wake up.

407
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,868
Eros!

408
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:28,665
Ros, wake up!

409
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,665
Who did this to Eros?

410
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,665
It must be Calderioz
who made Eros like this.
