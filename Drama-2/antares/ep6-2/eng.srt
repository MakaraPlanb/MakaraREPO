1
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Hey, what are you doing?

2
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,320
I'm looking for the action cam.

3
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,800
Maybe Zea took the action cam.

4
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:50,880
Why do you keep accusing her?

5
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,600
Because she's the killer.

6
00:00:57,175 --> 00:00:59,415
Call Serra now.

7
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,360
I've sent some men to keep Aeros safe.

8
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:08,280
Thanks.

9
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,600
I haven't seen any movement from Lionel.

10
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,080
Maybe he doesn't have anything to do
with Aiden's death.

11
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,960
Everyone now thinks I am the killer.

12
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,280
I need to find evidence
to clear my name.

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,895
Just be patient, Zea.

14
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:32,640
I will let you know
as soon as I find anything new.

15
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,960
Okay, thanks.

16
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,200
Wait, why do you have his helmet?

17
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,400
Why do you have his helmet?

18
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,640
My driver took it from the scene.

19
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,480
It was inside my car's trunk
all this time.

20
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,200
Serra.

21
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:27,855
Serra?

22
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,440
She can't bear to watch it.

23
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:00,095
Let me take you home.

24
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,680
You can wear it.

25
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,360
So, I can remember how it feels like
to ride with him.

26
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Don't...

27
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,320
Please don't...

28
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,480
I've recorded everything that we did.

29
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,120
I have your pictures, too.

30
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,920
If you tell anyone about this,
I will post this on social media.

31
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,880
What's wrong?

32
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,880
Are you still thinking about that day?

33
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,280
You have to forget it. I know you can.

34
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,800
Where's my phone?

35
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,495
Maybe you left it at home.

36
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:34,040
No, I was texting with my dad
before we went outside.

37
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,375
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I am.

38
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,000
Could there be a thief in this class?

39
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,520
Alright. Everyone, Serra lost her phone.

40
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,200
So I'm asking all of you to put
your bag on the desk.

41
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,840
We're going to search for it together.

42
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,200
Okay?

43
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,200
-What's this?
-Why is it here?

44
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,520
So, you took my phone?

45
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,575
Of course not. Why would I?

46
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,775
Then how on earth did the phone
get inside your bag? A ghost took it?

47
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:30,640
Just admit it.
The phone was clearly in your bag.

48
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,880
Don't you have any shame?

49
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,360
We caught you red-handed,
but you won't admit it.

50
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,695
Just say you did it!

51
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:38,200
Stop!

52
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,960
Serra's phone was inside her bag,...

53
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,240
but that doesn't mean
Zea took it, right?

54
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,200
Why do you keep defending her?

55
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:56,840
Fine, let's settle this
in the counseling office.

56
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,440
Okay.

57
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,720
It wasn't her.

58
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,600
Since everyone started bullying Zea,...

59
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,800
I've suspected one of the people
who hates her the most.

60
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,800
Anya has crossed the line this time.

61
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,960
I will make her pay for this.

62
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,720
Sel, take her to the club room.

63
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,120
Where is Anya?

64
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,280
Don't you have any respect, Junior?

65
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,560
-Are you looking for trouble?
-I'm asking you, where is Anya?

66
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,480
Who are you?

67
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,680
Tell Anya to take responsibility
for her action.

68
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,175
Don't act like a coward.
She should be ashamed as a senior!

69
00:08:00,215 --> 00:08:03,495
Shameless coward! A wench!

70
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,920
You two, come with me. You, too.

71
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,240
Where?

72
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,560
-Counseling office.
-Let's go.

73
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,600
Miss.

74
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,360
We'd like to report about Anya.

75
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,600
What did she do?

76
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,280
Here you go, ma'am.

77
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,880
She was caught stealing Serra's phone
and then hid it inside Zea's bag.

78
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,240
She's responsible for this.

79
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm going to give her detention.

80
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,320
I'll call her right now.
She went too far this time.

81
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,720
This is really dangerous.

82
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,255
Thank you very much.

83
00:08:58,295 --> 00:09:02,335
-Can you send me the video?
-Yes, ma'am.

84
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,640
This doesn't mean you are forgiven
for what you did to Aiden.

85
00:09:23,255 --> 00:09:26,546
Thanks for helping me out.

86
00:09:26,586 --> 00:09:28,520
You're welcome.

87
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,400
I hope you can forgive me.

88
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,480
See you later.

89
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,840
Ares.

90
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,360
Are you going to keep acting like this?

91
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,520
I know, I still can't prove
that I didn't kill Aiden.

92
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,920
But, I swore in front of you guys.

93
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,360
I cared about him.
He was my good friend, too.

94
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,800
Ares?

95
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,775
Aiden, I don't know what to do.

96
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:43,055
How should I convince them
that I didn't do this to you?

97
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,800
I always thought of you
as my good friend.

98
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:56,407
And I'm devastated
to have lost you like this.

99
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,720
If you aren’t the one who killed Aiden,
why did you infiltrate Calderioz?

100
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,960
At first, I thought Ares
was the one who hurt my brother,...

101
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,720
and put him in a comatose.

102
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,399
But, recently I found out that...

103
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,120
Ares has nothing to do
with what happened to my brother.

104
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,360
What is it?

105
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,430
Is there something you want to tell me?

106
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,720
So, I saw Zea at the cemetery today.

107
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,481
And I could see that...

108
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:12,040
she's deeply distressed
by Aiden's death.

109
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,121
She also told me...

110
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:17,520
the reason why she came
to Calderioz in the first place.

111
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,120
Yeah.

112
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,040
She told me about that, too.

113
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,320
This is the baseball bat that
the culprit used to beat Aiden to death.

114
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:48,655
Where did you get this?

115
00:12:48,695 --> 00:12:55,040
I'm sorry.
Someday I'll tell you who owns this bat.

116
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,720
But, right now, I'm asking for your help
to uncover the truth with this.

117
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:25,120
Hello? I have found the murder weapon.

118
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,375
What should I do now?

119
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:30,320
Let's meet at the hospital.

120
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,360
A friend of mine is a forensic doctor.

121
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,400
Alright.

122
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,560
Try to search for Aiden's hair
from his helmet...

123
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,760
to match with the DNA.

124
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,360
Okay. Thank you.

125
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,480
Let's head back to the base.
I need to take Aiden's helmet.

126
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,960
But, for now,...

127
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,120
let's keep this between us, okay?

128
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:07,655
If I ever find the culprit,
I will do this to him.

129
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,695
Can you do that?

130
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:12,775
Ares.

131
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,120
Where's Aiden's helmet?

132
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,800
-Why do you need it?
-I need it. I have to take it with me.

133
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
-See you, guys.
-Thanks.

134
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,360
-See you, bro.
-Serra. Stay strong, okay?

135
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,000
After we've completed
the DNA test in our lab,...

136
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,720
the blood on the baseball bat
and the hair from the helmet...

137
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,920
is a match.

138
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,640
Where did you find the baseball bat?

139
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,560
Tell me.

140
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,600
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

141
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,080
Why did you stay silent
and make Aiden feel guilty?

142
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,135
I was just trying to protect him.

143
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,495
I never said anything
because I love him so much.

144
00:16:56,455 --> 00:17:02,555
I never thought it would end like this.

145
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:11,600
Yes, this is all my fault. I am stupid.

146
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:22,000
And I'm sorry that I couldn't do enough
to protect the person that I love.

147
00:17:29,455 --> 00:17:31,855
I'm sorry.

148
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,960
I'm sorry.

149
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,680
But, we should call the police.

150
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,280
I'm begging you, please.

151
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,600
Regardless of what he did,
he's still my father.

152
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,760
Please give me some time to talk to him.

153
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,680
A sunflower, a symbol of faithfullness.

154
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,080
Look.

155
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,520
Yellow represents warmth and happiness.

156
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,480
Those are things I miss from Serra.

157
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:21,655
What are you doing?

158
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:25,281
I just wanted to see how it looks.
Don't flatter yourself.

159
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:26,895
I thought...

160
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,280
Did you see how Ares looked at Zea?

161
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,880
I'm sure he still has feelings for her.

162
00:20:16,735 --> 00:20:18,495
I saw it too.

163
00:20:18,535 --> 00:20:20,801
I'm worried that Ares
will change his mind,...

164
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:22,855
and ruin the whole investigation.

165
00:20:22,895 --> 00:20:25,440
Zea's got Ares under her spell.

166
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,240
We can't let this happen.

167
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,840
Ares.

168
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,560
You have to solve Aiden's death
until everything is clear,...

169
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,080
and continue our investigation on Zea.

170
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:51,415
I need you to give me more time.

171
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:55,455
I'm still investigating this.

172
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,120
See you later.

173
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,360
Hello, sir? Where are you?

174
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,975
I'm sorry, miss,
but I had to bring the car to the shop.

175
00:21:28,015 --> 00:21:30,680
I can't come and pick you up.

176
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,440
It's okay. I can call a cab.

177
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,320
-I'm sorry, miss.
-It's okay.

178
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,680
Get on.

179
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,880
No, thanks.

180
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,375
You have to be strong, Zea.

181
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:29,935
You can't let Ares get inside your head.

182
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:35,095
Not until you can prove to Calderioz
and Ares that you're not the culprit.

183
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,040
Aiden...

184
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,600
I'm so sorry, Aiden.

185
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,680
I'm so sorry.

186
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,600
With you, you are my shore.

187
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,920
And with you is where I find comfort.

188
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,160
Aiden!

189
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:10,760
-Serra, what's wrong?
-Are you okay?

190
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,800
-Are you not feeling well?
-You look so pale.

191
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,920
-Let's head to the infirmary.
-Please...

192
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,760
Leave me alone.

193
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,120
-Serra...
-It's okay.

194
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,640
She needs some time alone.

195
00:26:12,895 --> 00:26:14,855
What should I do, Aiden?

196
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,520
I know that both of them
will never be as one.

197
00:26:46,775 --> 00:26:49,135
Until one day,...

198
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,360
one of them
had to take the other one's life.

199
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,960
Tell me, Dad, what should I do?

200
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:27,615
