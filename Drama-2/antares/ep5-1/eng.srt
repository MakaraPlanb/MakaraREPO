1
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,000
Ares is the best person
I've ever known.

2
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,320
He's so loyal to the gang.

3
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,760
He never lets anyone down.

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,360
He's the opposite of what
he's showing to us...

5
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,560
being solemn and cold.

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,600
But, deep down he has a gentle heart.

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,560
A sunflower, a symbol of loyalty.

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,680
Look. The yellow part represents
warmth and happiness.

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,840
But, I will always be...

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,520
a prisoner in your heart
till the day that I die.

11
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,200
-Make way!
-Aiden!

12
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,000
Aiden!

13
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,640
Aiden!

14
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,640
Den!

15
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,400
Aiden!

16
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,000
-Aiden!
-Moreo, stop!

17
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,840
Aiden!

18
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Sorry, please wait outside.

19
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,120
-Aiden!
-Stop it, Mor!

20
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,840
Serra, tell me what happened.

21
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,480
Did you see the license plate?

22
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
Did you see the guy?

23
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,360
Please, you have to tell me!

24
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,840
Let her calm herself down.

25
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,960
Serra...

26
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,520
You just relax.

27
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,480
After Aiden survives
the critical phase,...

28
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,080
then we'll get our revenge.

29
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,160
My son!

30
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,480
What happened to my son?

31
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,000
Tell me what happened to my son?

32
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,000
My son...

33
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,160
How could this happen?

34
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,800
What if he doesn't make it?

35
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,000
Calm down. Let's just pray for the best.

36
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,920
I haven't had enough time
to make him happy.

37
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,680
I'm sorry, Aiden.

38
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,400
-How is my son?
-How is it?

39
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,080
I'm sorry, sir, ma'am.

40
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,240
We have tried our best.

41
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,400
But, unfortunately,
we couldn't save your son.

42
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,600
What do you mean
you couldn't save my son?

43
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,760
I can't lose my son!

44
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,720
Doctor, please!

45
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,840
I'm sorry, son.
I wish I could suffer in your place.

46
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,560
God, please take me instead.

47
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,960
Don't take my son away.

48
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,080
I'm sorry, Aiden...

49
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,400
Aiden, babe. Please, wake up.

50
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,120
Hold this and put this on my hair.

51
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,600
You hear me, right?
Aiden, please. Do you hear me?

52
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,880
You promised me that you're
going to put this on my hair.

53
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,480
You have to wake up!
You promised me! Don't you remember?

54
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,600
Aiden! No, no, no!

55
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,600
No! Let me go! He can't leave me now!

56
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,760
Aiden, please.
Who will take care of me now?

57
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,720
Aiden, please wake up.

58
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,280
Serra?

59
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,880
Serra, wake up!

60
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,640
Goddamn it!

61
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,520
Ares, stop it!

62
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,160
Aiden can't die like this.

63
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,600
Who did this to him?

64
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,520
Which gang?

65
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,600
I'm going to hunt them and finish them!

66
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,520
I'm going to kill them all!

67
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,880
-Stop!
-Get your hands off me!

68
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,240
You told us, remember?

69
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,120
We need proof before doing anything.

70
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,520
Ares, stop!

71
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,320
I won't let you leave
before you can control your anger.

72
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,680
Anger won't solve anything.

73
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,560
Let me go!

74
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,120
Don't let your emotions control you!

75
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,480
Use your brain.

76
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,880
Whoa, watch out!

77
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,360
-That's crazy.
-Who did that?

78
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,000
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

79
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,280
Here, let me help you.

80
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,960
Sorry.

81
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,200
Zea?

82
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,960
Lio?

83
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,080
I was visiting my friend
and then I saw you.

84
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,040
What are you doing here?

85
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,600
My friend passed away.

86
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,160
Zea...

87
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,920
You have to be strong.

88
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,360
Why?

89
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Why does someone with a gentle heart
have to go so soon?

90
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,800
And why did he have to go like that?

91
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,160
Do you think that...

92
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,880
Calderioz' accusation to Retro
angered them?

93
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,080
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

94
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,000
Just like how Calderioz
has their enemies.

95
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,960
I don't know.

96
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:43,560
But, I know for sure that Aiden
didn't deserve to die like this.

97
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,000
No!

98
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,480
Mor.

99
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,440
Calm yourself down.

100
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,840
This is a hospital.

101
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,160
You guys are pulling a prank, right?

102
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,560
You got me!

103
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,920
Okay, guys. Enough of this.
This is just a prank, right?

104
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,920
Right?

105
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,040
Mor. I know you're sad.

106
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,760
Because we are, too.

107
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Aiden was a part of Calderioz.

108
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,560
We all lost him. Not only you.

109
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,240
All of this is happening...

110
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,560
I think it's fate.

111
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,440
Den.

112
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,080
Please don't leave us.

113
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,840
Mor. Calm down.

114
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,560
He's happy where he is now.

115
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,080
You should let him go.

116
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,560
For you who has left this world,...

117
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,240
you should not be afraid
of feeling lonely.

118
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,720
You should not worry about being alone.

119
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,360
We will see each other again one day.

120
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,080
To be together with you again.

121
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,400
Letting you go, even with doubts...

122
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,400
we are ready to carry this yearn,...

123
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,000
and to walk without you.

124
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,200
From Calderioz to Aiden.

125
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,520
You know where that curiosity leads to.

126
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,360
To your heart. Be careful.

127
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,160
And I know that...

128
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,040
you will remember this night
for the rest of your lives.

129
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,160
Calderioz is where I find joy,...

130
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,200
sadness, and rise.

131
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,280
You will always be in our hearts, Den.

132
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,800
You were everything to Calderioz.

133
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,920
I can feel his pain.

134
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,840
Are you okay, Ares?

135
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,560
I'm okay.

136
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,200
Welcome to Calderioz headquarters!

137
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,200
I like this one. What do you think?

138
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,240
You should calm down a bit.

139
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,240
Be patient.
I will be right back, okay, guys?

140
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,880
That was...

141
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,720
You think you're that handsome?
Your face looks like a duck.

142
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,960
-Stop the vlog. Let me handle it.
-What are you doing? I'm not done yet!

143
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,720
Aiden's death made me afraid.

144
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,280
I'm afraid that
Ardhan's going that way too.

145
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,281
I know,...

146
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:41,360
Ardhan can't be separated
from Calderioz.

147
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,320
But, I'm afraid...

148
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,081
that the death of Aiden...

149
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:53,160
will start a war between Calderioz
with other gangs.

150
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,040
Calderioz is not that kind of bike gang.

151
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,960
They wouldn't start making trouble.

152
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,400
Okay?

153
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,280
Right now,...

154
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:10,640
all you can do is to calm Ardhan.

155
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,561
I'm sure Calderioz
is in the middle of confusion now.

156
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:17,001
Angry, sad,...

157
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:21,000
lost, and also trying to find justice
for Aiden.

158
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,080
-So, it's okay if I'm afraid, right?
-That's okay.

159
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,280
Please join us.

160
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,600
-Please join us.
-Thanks, Zea.

161
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,760
Please join us.

162
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,720
Serra isn't coming to school again.

163
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,000
She must be devastated.

164
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,360
She needs us.

165
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,000
How about visiting her tomorrow?

166
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,560
Sure.

167
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,720
(Ceremonial Prayer Invitation)

168
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,680
Aiden.

169
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,840
I still can't believe
you're not with us anymore.

170
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,760
This is my only picture with you.

171
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,680
This photo will be a memento for me.

172
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,640
So, I will never forget about you.

173
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,880
Den, I will remember you forever.

174
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
I miss you, Aiden.

175
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,920
Nobody knows whose turn is next.

176
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,080
I know that you'll be here.

177
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,840
Because this place
is full of memory of Aiden.

178
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,280
Everyone have their own way
to cope with their sadness.

179
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,280
If you need someone to talk to,
you've got me.

180
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,760
Peace be upon you.

181
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,000
Peace be upon you too.

182
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,040
We're all here to mourn...

183
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,640
one of our students
who has just passed away.

184
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:22,080
Let this be a lesson to all of us
for the better in the future.

185
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,880
We pray that...

186
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:32,040
he may rest in peace
with Allah as well as he deserved.

187
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,120
Amen.

188
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,168
On behalf of Aiden,...

189
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:50,880
if he ever hurt your feelings,
or played a prank on you,...

190
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,000
please forgive him.

191
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,280
We have to catch Aiden's killer
and make him pay for what he did.

192
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,280
Aye!

193
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,480
Always remember
the three rules of Calderioz.

194
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,600
Defend each member.

195
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,960
Destroy the betrayer.

196
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,400
Don't die as a loser.

197
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,640
Laskar.

198
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,680
I need you to set up a plan.

199
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,000
We need to check all of the other
bike gang headquarters.

200
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,720
We have to find out who did this to him.

201
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,680
To get justice for Aiden.

202
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,800
You, you, and you, come with me.

203
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,600
How are you doing, Serra?

204
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,160
We're worried about you.

205
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,120
Yeah, I kept thinking of you.

206
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,280
I'm sure Aiden wouldn't want
to see us sad like this.

207
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,000
Right?

208
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,160
Let me get you a drink.

209
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,320
I hope she's really okay.

210
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,960
Yeah. I feel really bad for her.
