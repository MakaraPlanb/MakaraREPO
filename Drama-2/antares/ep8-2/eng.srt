1
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,120
Starting from today,...

2
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,080
never trust anyone.

3
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,920
Except me.

4
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,920
Because I promise
that I'll never hurt you.

5
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
-Oh my God!
-I don't want to see it!

6
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,720
Cleo, you need to focus.

7
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,800
Yes, I'm focusing. I'm focused.

8
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,480
What? Why did you shoot me?

9
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,120
Ended up losing, right?

10
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,440
I'm sorry for shooting you.

11
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,840
That's why you shouldn't shoot
just anyone.

12
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,000
(-Let's have a sleepover at Serra's.
-Let's go!)

13
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,320
(-Yay, slumber party!
-Okay, I'll bring snacks.)

14
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,280
Would I look good
if I cut my hair like this?

15
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,280
Hi, friends!

16
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,120
-Did you miss me?
-Hi.

17
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,680
What are you guys doing? Let's play!
We're playing cards, right?

18
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,880
-Yes.
-Let's play Big Two!

19
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,440
We can't, Sel.
Big Two is played by four people.

20
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,200
-How many of us are there?
-There are five of us.

21
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,320
So what should we do?

22
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,000
-Let's play...
-Swat the Mosquito!

23
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,800
Swat the Mosquito!

24
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,920
Take it.

25
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,880
-King!
-Ace!

26
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,840
Oh, my gosh.

27
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,760
It's like Ardhan.

28
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,160
It's always Ardhan.

29
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,280
Girls.

30
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,680
Thank you for accepting me.

31
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,080
I can't imagine how it'd be
if I hadn't met you all.

32
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,160
I can't imagine how it will be
after we graduate.

33
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,560
We have to meet up often.

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,120
-I love you guys.
-I love you guys so much.

35
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,520
I love you guys too.

36
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,080
Thank you, guys, for everything.

37
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:49,120
I ask all members of motorcycle gangs
in Indonesia to unite.

38
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,720
No more being enemies with each other.

39
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,720
We have to be a positive asset
for this nation.

40
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,600
We have to erase the negative image
of motorcycle gangs in everyone's minds.

41
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,480
So,...

42
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,760
we all agreed...

43
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,120
to make a motto together.

44
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,720
"Solidarity is more important
than conquering the road."

45
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,360
Ares.

46
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,200
Aeros.

47
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,360
Are you ready?

48
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,400
Guys, I'm auctioning this motorcycle
to help orphans.

49
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,480
Whoever can give the highest price
can take it right away.

50
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,040
Goodbye, Nadia.

51
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Nadia Nurhasana.

52
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,320
Okay, I'm starting the auction
at 50 million rupiah.

53
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,320
-100 million rupiah.
-125 million rupiah.

54
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,200
-126 million rupiah.
-126 million rupiah!

55
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,520
Anyone else?

56
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,400
-Okay, if there's no one else...
-200 million rupiah!

57
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,520
Anyone else? Anyone wants to bid
more than 200 million rupiah?

58
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,320
If there's no one else, I'm closing
this auction at 200 million rupiah.

59
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,800
One.

60
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,480
Two.

61
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,520
Three!

62
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,040
The winner is Barend!

63
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,680
In memory of Aiden,...

64
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,760
we held this event.

65
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,720
A tribute to Aiden.

66
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,600
And today,...

67
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,880
I'll give Aiden's jacket
which was very precious to him...

68
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,040
to someone special.

69
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,360
Serra.

70
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,760
-Thank you, Ares.
-Of course.

71
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,400
Aiden is a friend...

72
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,760
and best friend to all of us.

73
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,440
Until whenever,...

74
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,280
Aiden will still be the sun to me.

75
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,160
And for us all.

76
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,440
Huh? Did you two plan this?

77
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,880
Aeros.

78
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,640
Thank God you're all better now.

79
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Why didn't you tell me, Zea?

80
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,000
To surprise you.

81
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,320
-How are you?
-Thank God, I'm doing well.

82
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,680
-Thank God.
-I'm so happy.

83
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,240
Let's go.

84
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
-Gosh.
-It's cool here.

85
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,480
Here it is.

86
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,800
-Thank you, miss.
-You're welcome.

87
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,760
-Thank you.
-Let's eat.

88
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,080
-Gosh. Thank you, Aeros.
-Yes.

89
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,760
Zea, thank you so much
for bringing us here. Ares too.

90
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,040
-You're welcome.
-You're welcome.

91
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,520
The drink looks like it'll cool us
to our hearts too.

92
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,240
Oh, my gosh. Take a sip.

93
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,760
Oh, my gosh.

94
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,520
It's really good.

95
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,200
You sound like you're in a commercial.

96
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,720
Aeros, thank you. We don't get
to eat something like this very often.

97
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,040
You're welcome. You can order more.

98
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,120
It's so good, Aeros.

99
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,360
-We can order more?
-You can.

100
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,560
-Let's order wontons. He said we can.
-Finish the food first.

101
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,200
Aeros, eat a lot. Oh, my goodness.
So, you can be healthy.

102
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,840
Thank you for taking care of Zea.

103
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,960
I really love your sister.

104
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,040
I'm asking for your permission.
Can I get close to Zea?

105
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,640
I'm sure if it's with you, Ares.

106
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
But, you have to remember.

107
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,920
Never make her sad.

108
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,480
Or you'll have to face me.

109
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,600
Yes. I promise.

110
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,880
I'll be the best man for Zea.

111
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,160
I actually came here to pick up Zea.

112
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,320
I'm going to leave for three days.

113
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm going to borrow Zea
for three days, okay?

114
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,720
Why are you laughing?

115
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,160
-Wait for me, Zea.
-Come on, Aeros.

116
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,560
-Let's go there first.
-What?

117
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,080
-Let's go there first.
-Where?

118
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,840
-There.
-Let's go.

119
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,560
-Let's go.
-Hey! You cheater!

120
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,360
Aeros, wake up.

121
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,640
-Aeros, wake up.
-Yeah.

122
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,800
Wake up!

123
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,880
Wake up!

124
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,080
Pillow fight.

125
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,040
-Have mercy!
-Wake up!

126
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,640
Did you miss me that much?

127
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,000
This is the first time
you smiled at me like that.

128
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,160
Hey.

129
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,400
Looks like he's thinking about Zea.

130
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,720
It makes me want to cough.
Oh, my gosh.

131
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,240
If you miss her, just text her
saying that you miss her. Right?

132
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,400
Right.

133
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,120
Okay, I'm going.

134
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,760
He left.

135
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,640
-It's because you're always annoying.
-It's fine.

136
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,880
-What matters is that I'm handsome.
-What?

137
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,160
Moreo, can we take a photo together?

138
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,400
Yeah.

139
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,320
Wait. Sorry, guys.

140
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,920
-What's your name?
-Rei.

141
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,720
-Feli.
-Feli and Rei.

142
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,560
Say, "I love you, Moreo".
One, two, three.

143
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,680
Love you, Moreo!

144
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,240
One more time. Love you, Moreo!

145
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,920
Thank you.

146
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,320
Bye.

147
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,800
Amazing. I see that
you're getting popular with the girls.

148
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,720
Thank God.

149
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,640
Is it really fun playing that?

150
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,760
Teach me please.

151
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,640
Okay.

152
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,360
Someone's getting close.

153
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,640
Yes, to be the next couple, right?

154
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,200
-Really?
-Yes.

155
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,560
Can someone as cool as Megan
have a girlfriend?

156
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,960
Of course he can, babe.

157
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,160
No matter how cool a guy is,
he still needs love.

158
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,520
Like me and you.

159
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,560
Okay.

160
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,160
-Hi.
-What are you doing right now?

161
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,800
I'm at a cafe.

162
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,520
Oh, my gosh.

163
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
-Who's that?
-Someone.

164
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,200
A boy whom I love very much.

165
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,880
Okay.

166
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,720
Zea's coming back tomorrow.

167
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,080
Aeros.

168
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,840
Zea.

169
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,000
He hung up.

170
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,880
He's jealous, isn't he?

171
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
Oh, my gosh.

172
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,720
Here.

173
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,200
A belated birthday gift for you.

174
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,520
I had already prepared it
before I fell into a coma.

175
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,200
What is it?

176
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,040
A jacket?

177
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,760
It's such a nice jacket!
Thank you, Aeros.

178
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,840
You're welcome.

179
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,680
-Wear it when you're riding.
-Yes, sir.

180
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,720
-What is it?
-Aeros.

181
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,800
What do you think about Ares?

182
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,240
He has principles.

183
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,480
He's responsible.

184
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,760
He looks like a good person.

185
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,440
I'm giving you the green light.

186
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,440
Really?

187
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,360
Thank you.

188
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,320
My little sister is all grown up now.

189
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,200
It's so quiet.

190
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,320
Even though it's still early.

191
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,520
Why is it so quiet here, sir?
Today isn't a holiday, right?

192
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,520
So, you did all of this?

193
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,520
Zea.

194
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,680
I want to say something.

195
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,000
Do you know what I'm going to say?

196
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,720
What is it?

197
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,200
You still owe me one request.

198
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,960
What do you want?

199
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,760
You.

200
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,920
What?

201
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,720
I want you.

202
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,280
Gosh, I can't hear you. Say it louder.

203
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,880
I want you forever!

204
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,680
No.

205
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,040
I don't want to just pay off my "debts".

206
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,080
Because I also...

207
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,360
want you forever.

208
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,880
I'm sure...

209
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,440
that we're a match made in heaven.

210
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,840
And you're the only one
who I need by my side.

211
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,240
So, do you want to be my queen?

212
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,560
I want to.

213
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,720
You want to what?

214
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,200
I want to be your queen.

215
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,480
Antares Sebastian Aldevaro.

216
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,720
Then I'll be the luckiest king.

217
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,440
That's awesome, Zea!

218
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,920
How sweet!

219
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,120
Awesome.

220
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,520
-Please accept this.
-I'll accept this.

221
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,640
-I hope it'll be helpful.
-Amen.

222
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,240
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

223
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,480
Ser.

224
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,560
Serra.

225
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,360
Ser, it's okay.

226
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
It's okay to cry.

227
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,760
It's okay to be sad.

228
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,680
You're human.

229
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,280
I'm sure.

230
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,320
I'm really sure that one day,
your smile will come back.

231
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,800
We're all here for you, Ser. Okay?

232
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,760
Ser, I'm sure Aiden is really happy
to see us all gathered here...

233
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,360
and making his goals come true.

234
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,040
-Don't cry.
-Be strong, dear.

235
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:15,680
Thank you, everyone.
You always give me strength.

236
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,160
You really are my best friends.

237
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,200
-Thank you for coming.
-You're welcome.

238
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,080
Look. No wonder Fiona chose Laskar.

239
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,360
Try to imagine if you were with her.

240
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,800
It would be like the beautiful princess
and the Frog Prince.

241
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,840
That's so funny! Seriously. Nice one.

242
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,401
It's okay, Moreo. Who knows one day...

243
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:00,040
you might get someone
who is truly your soulmate.

244
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,680
-Listen to her.
-Right?

245
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,040
It's okay. Pity will become love.
Right, Sel?

246
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,160
Come here.

247
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,120
You don't need to. It's gross.

248
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,400
I hope your good deeds
are accepted by God.

249
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,200
-Amen.
-Amen.

250
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,560
Bro.

251
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,840
Be at peace there, okay?

252
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,160
I hope you're happy there.

253
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,880
Don't worry.

254
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,800
I'll take care of everyone.

255
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,640
Like how you took care of us
this whole time.

256
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,120
Don't worry...

257
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,040
because now there's someone special
taking care of me.

258
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,200
Who isn't annoying like you.

259
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,840
Who...

260
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,280
Aiden. Don't worry.

261
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,560
Now I am here
to take care of your leader.

262
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,600
Ares. It's okay. Ares.

263
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,720
Don't be sad all the time.

264
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,120
I'm sure Aiden wants us to be happy too.

265
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,360
He wants us...

266
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,160
He wants us to always be happy.

267
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,480
Not to be sad.

268
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,520
Hey, help me. It's so difficult.
I'm bringing so many things. Take turns.

269
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,560
It's always been me carrying this stuff.

270
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Here, let me help you.

271
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,160
Guys, don't you feel sorry for Moreo?

272
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,000
Look at his face, guys.

273
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,960
If Moreo wasn't here,
the girls can't cook either!

274
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,400
-She's right.
-Right?

275
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,760
-Of course!
-Moreo is so helpful!

276
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,680
Do none of you care?

277
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,280
Okay, Sel. I noticed
that you're caring more about Moreo.

278
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,640
-Help me.
-Gosh.

279
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
Hey, Kar, help.

280
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,440
-You should have said so.
-You should have the initiative.

281
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,000
-Yes!
-Yes, we won!

282
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,680
Thanks for always taking care of me
in the game.

283
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,600
Can I take care of you
in the real world?

284
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,080
Where's your girlfriend, Fiona?

285
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,880
I didn't invite Fiona because I
didn't want to hurt your feelings.

286
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,040
Just relax. I already let her go.

287
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,000
And now I'm looking for a girl
who wants to accept me for who I am.

288
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,080
Do you remember something
now that we're here?

289
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,160
I remember Aiden.

290
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,720
Yeah. I miss him.

291
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,680
But, he's resting peacefully now.

292
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,640
Guys, let's gather
for the campfire tonight.

293
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,200
-Come on.
-Let's go.

294
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,960
-Come on, let's gather.
-Let's go.

295
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,520
Friends!

296
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,360
Let's help Selina.

297
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,800
This is your chance
to get her attention.

298
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,640
You don't know if there will be
a second chance.

299
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,640
Relax, I just need to give the info
to Karissa.

300
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,880
She has a lot of tricks. Romantic.

301
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,560
-You know me. I'm good at it.
-Seriously?

302
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,000
-Of course.
-Seriously? Don't just be all talk.

303
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,000
Guys.

304
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,320
Let me read a poem that I didn't get
the chance to read to Aiden, okay?

305
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,880
Okay.

306
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,920
Ser.

307
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,680
Thank you.

308
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,880
It's late at night.

309
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,280
And my heart is haunted by fear.

310
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,440
Because you're gone, Aiden.

311
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,440
But, I remember...

312
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,120
when you introduced me
to whom you called your family.

313
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,640
Calderioz.

314
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,840
Now you're gone.

315
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,680
But, Calderioz is still here.

316
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,680
They've become my family,...

317
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,440
and they are looking after me.

318
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,200
Aiden.

319
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:31,080
I'm sure that you don't want
to see me cry like this.

320
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,760
That's why...

321
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,040
I just want to tell you
to be all right there.

322
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,640
And you don't have to worry
about me anymore.

323
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,400
Just wait...

324
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,760
until the day...

325
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,040
we'll be reunited again.

326
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,280
Aiden.

327
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,080
Among the many stars,
the one that shines the brightest.

328
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,280
I'm sure...

329
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,600
that it's you...

330
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,600
hiding in my heart forever.

331
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,840
That night, everyone thought of Aiden.

332
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,080
There's nothing in this world
that won't change.

333
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,400
Even the hearts of people can change.

334
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,360
It's just like the saying.

335
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,401
Hate someone
with the right amount of hatred.

336
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:08,041
Love someone
with the right amount of love.

337
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,440
Because you never know
if the person we once hated...

338
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,800
would eventually be someone we like.

339
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,120
It also goes the other way around.

340
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,360
-It's okay, Mor. Don't cry.
-Love is amazing.

341
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,520
-It can make a weak person strong.
-He's in a better place now.

342
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,720
And make a strong person weak.

343
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,320
If one day you're happy
and remember someone,...

344
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,760
it means that you love that person.

345
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:44,880
If you're sad and remember someone,
it means that they love you.

346
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,000
That's the way of love.

347
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,880
When you haven't found the way,
just be sure...

348
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,760
that one day, there will come the moment
when someone comes to you,...

349
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,680
and they're willing to give you
their whole heart.
