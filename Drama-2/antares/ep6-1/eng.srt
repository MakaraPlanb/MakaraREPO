1
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,360
(Previously...)

2
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:34,835
No!

3
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:38,115
Aiden!

4
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:40,195
Aiden, please wake up...

5
00:00:40,235 --> 00:00:42,480
Aiden!

6
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,040
-I'm sorry, Serra.
-Aiden.

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,240
Aiden!

8
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,200
I did everything I could
to crush Calderioz.

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,200
Because they put Aeros in a coma.

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,120
And now I'm even more sure...

11
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,800
that Ares didn't do it.

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,160
I don't know who you are.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,520
But, take my advice. Be careful.

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,880
Well, I don't know
who should be careful, you or me.

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,520
Hey, you!

16
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,080
It's a girl?

17
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,840
Zea?

18
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,601
Zea, I swear, I didn't know it was you.

19
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:53,241
What were you going to do
with Aiden's bike?

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,320
Zea, what were you doing?

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,360
Zea.

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,520
Laskar, get a taxi.
We should treat her wounds at our base.

23
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,120
-Okay.
-Okay?

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,440
Zea.

25
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,440
I thought she was trying
to steal the bike.

26
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,600
This is really unexpected.

27
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,240
Wolves?

28
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Capo for Wolves?

29
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,160
The warlord?
That means Ares' accident was...

30
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,240
It was part of their plan?

31
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,080
Firecrackers at school?

32
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,840
And the one who killed Aiden?

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,400
Mor.

34
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,760
Don't jump to conclusions.

35
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,560
What else do you need to know?
She is a Capo for Wolves!

36
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,120
I noticed that a lot of bizarre things
happened since Zea came to our school.

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,315
This is unbelievable.

38
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,961
A girl.

39
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:09,595
Capo for Wolves, is in our base.

40
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,200
And very close to us.

41
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,480
Come on, Res.

42
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,040
I'm sure she's got something to do
with Aiden's death.

43
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,720
-Definitely.
-We don't know for sure.

44
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,600
You are defending her
just because you like her!

45
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,760
What if she really did it?
What are you going to do, huh?

46
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,315
-Give me some time...
-We don't need to think any further.

47
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,635
The person we're looking for
is right here.

48
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,000
And we have to do something.

49
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:39,675
Right, guys?

50
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,680
Aiden...

51
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,720
Aiden was our family!

52
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,680
Can you shut up?

53
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,400
Guys, calm down.

54
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,960
Let's talk about this.

55
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,040

We were caught off-guard.
All because of a girl!

76
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,000
Zea.

77
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,640
We know you're a Wolves' Capo
who infiltrated our gang.

78
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,480
What are your intentions?

79
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,960
Answer him.

80
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,560
No more secrets now.

81
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,080
-You killed Aiden!
-Stop!

82
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,720
Don't hit a girl!

83
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,160
I will never forget about Aiden.

84
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,960
And I will prove that to all of you.

85
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,960
-Zea! Wait, Zea!
-Ares.

86
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,760
Just let her go.

87
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,200
Who is this?

88
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,800
Is it Ms. Zea?

89
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,840
Miss Zea, what happened to you?

90
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,840
What happened to your face?

91
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,480
Who did this to you? Tell me.

92
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,520
-Miss.
-Let's go inside.

93
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,640
Who did this?

94
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,400
Yeah, seriously!
Climbing was my hobby.

95
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,360
I could climb any tree.
Mango tree, banana tree, and many more.

96
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,600
-And then I would pick the fruits.
-Are you for real?

97
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,360
-Please don't tell anyone about this.
-You're as strong as Super Woman.

98
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,440
No wonder she could fight
when she was rescuing Sandra.

99
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,400
I know she's not just an ordinary girl.

100
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,720
You should do something about this,
and decide our next move.

101
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,280
We need to know
why she infiltrated our gang.

102
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,480
And I'm sure she had something to do
with Aiden's death.

103
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,880
I'm scared.

104
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,240
There was someone suspicious
when I was cleaning the yard.

105
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,920
That's why I told you about this.

106
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,880
Should we call the police?

107
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,840
No. I can handle this.

108
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,600
How about asking for help
from your two handsome friends?

109
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,600
Ares and Lionel?

110
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,840
There's no need for that. Don't worry.

111
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,000
You can go back to your work.

112
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,760
After all, Mr. Jaya is outside,
looking after us. Right?

113
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,080
Okay. But, you have to eat
your breakfast. So, you can recover.

114
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,640
Okay.

115
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,320
Zea, they must be Ares' men.

116
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,760
He knows where you live, right?

117
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,080
I'm sure he has a plan.

118
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,960
They must be Lionel's men.

119
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,320
It was him and his men
who tried to hurt you last night.

120
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,760
You can't trust Lionel.

121
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,680
Hey! You can't accuse him like that.

122
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,840
Lionel is like her own brother.
It's impossible for him to do this.

123
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,680
Nothing is impossible.
Who can guess what is inside our hearts?

124
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,400
It must be Lionel who sent them.

125
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
Ares.

126
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,960
-It must be Lionel.
-Ares!

127
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,960
Quiet!

128
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,240
-Yes, Bara?
-Zea.

129
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,720
They called you a liar.
What is going on?

130
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,320
Lionel is behind all of this.

131
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,120
He's the one
who tried to hurt me and Ares.

132
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,440
He also set Retro and Calderioz
against each other.

133
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,720
And my identity as a Capo for Wolves
has been exposed to Calz.

134
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,360
So you're saying
that Lio abused Aeros' trust?

135
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,640
Zea, I'm worried about your safety.

136
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,680
You should be careful, too.

137
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,080
We can't act recklessly.
We should play it safe.

138
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,520
Okay.

139
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:38,640
Split the team into two.

140
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,917
But, don't let Zea know about this.

141
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:47,320
I want some of you to watch Zea
and protect her from afar.

142
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,040
Seeing what happened to Aeros,
I can't let this happen again.

143
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:58,560
What will I say to Aeros
if I can't even protect Zea?

144
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,040
Zea!

145
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,520
Hi.

146
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,400
What happened to your face?

147
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,120
-I'm okay.
-No, you're not.

148
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,280
You have bruises on your face.

149
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,960
I really am okay.

150
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,320
So, this is why you skipped school
for the last two days.

151
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,080
Zea, you can tell us anything, okay?

152
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,840
I found some information about Zea.
I'm sending it to you.

153
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:46,320
She is the sister of the Wolves' leader
who is currently in a coma.

154
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,240
Don't tell anyone about this.

155
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,150
Now tell me the truth.

156
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,880
I've searched information about you.

157
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,360
But, I want to hear it from you.

158
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,680
I'm looking for the person
who put my brother in a coma.

159
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,840
Somebody told me it was you.

160
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,800
And you need to know that
I have nothing to do with Aiden's death.

161
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,720
Who told you...

162
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,520
that I put Aeros into a coma?

163
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,920
Lionel Kavindra.

164
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,240
The temporary leader of Wolves.

165
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,760
Aeros and I were good friends.

166
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,640
Because we share the same goals.

167
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,440
You shouldn't easily trust people,...

168
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,160
considering what has happened to Wolves.

169
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,760
And I just found out that he was the one
who attacked us the other day.

170
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,520
Are you stupid or just naive?

171
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,240
Don't you ever think...

172
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:17,440
that Lio could be manipulating you
to break Calderioz apart?

173
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,920
And during the chaos,...

174
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,880
he can take advantage of the situation
to take control over Wolves.

175
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,040
Just so you know,
we've never had any issue with Aeros.

176
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,640
If something happened to Aeros,...

177
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,960
it may be caused
by someone within Wolves.

178
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,960
Someone who doesn't like him.

179
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,920
Didn't you ever feel suspicious?

180
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,960
Lio could be the one behind this.

181
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,760
-Hey, intruder!
-Mor, that's enough.

182
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,880
I hate intruders!

183
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,560
-What did Aiden ever do to you?
-I didn't kill him!

184
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,880
You still deny it, huh?

185
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,760
-Come and fight me!
-Stop it!

186
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,040
That's enough.

187
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,640
Why are you letting her go?

188
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,720
-Moreo.
-Do you love her?

189
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,920
We have a commitment to search
for undeniable proof.

190
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,000
Okay?

191
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,680
-Stop pointing fingers like that.
-But, this is about Aiden.

192
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,760
Mor...

193
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,040
Is it true that you ordered him
to attack me and Ares?

194
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,320
Answer me!

195
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,760
Did you also set Retro and De Lasga
against each other?

196
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,440
Ares.

197
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,800
You are our leader.

198
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,280
And Aiden...

199
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,680
He was one of us. He was family.

200
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,960
Calderioz's family.

201
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,492
And he was the victim.

202
00:19:54,532 --> 00:20:00,092
You should be bold.
Don't let your feelings make you weak.

203
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,160
How long have you known Zea?

204
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,520
Try to think about
what we have gone through together.

205
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,480
Remember, Res. Zea is an intruder.

206
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,240
She tricked all of us.

207
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,840
And I'm sure Zea
was the one behind Aiden's death.

208
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,040
We should finish her.

209
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,840
Destroy the betrayer.

210
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,640
Something doesn't feel right about this.

211
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,080
It's not Zea. I'm sure it's not her.

212
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,920
We should investigate this.

213
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,680
Someone is trying to pit
all of the gangs against each other.

214
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,160
You're still defending her?

215
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,920
If that's what you want,
I'm leaving Calderioz.

216
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,360
Mor!

217
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,240
Do you think...

218
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,600
it's possible that Lio was the one
who put Aeros into a coma?

219
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,520
He may have a different view
from Aeros.

220
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,240
But, you should not worry
about his loyalty.

221
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,800
Are you sure?

222
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,520
About Jenna, too.

223
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,080
Are you sure
she was behind Aeros' accident?

224
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,760
I'm not sure about that.

225
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,520
But, what I know is that
she was with Aeros that night.

226
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,800
Lio told me...

227
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,160
that Aeros almost hurt him for Jenna.

228
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,720
Hi, Zea. How are you?

229
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
Where have you been?

230
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,840
-Don't you care about us anymore?
-Enough of this!

231
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,720
I'm tired of being accused.

232
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,600
And of being told that I'm ungrateful.

233
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,400
-I love Aeros.
-Then prove it!

234
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,440
Where were you when he needed you?

235
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Since that accident,
someone has been blackmailing me.

236
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,240
He's been threatening my family.

237
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,800
Tell me, can you guys guarantee
my family's safety?

238
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,640
It must be Lio's plan.

239
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,960
Zea, you should be careful.

240
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,680
I will send some men
to watch over Lio...

241
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,600
until I find solid proof
about Lio's connection to all of this.

242
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,280
Are you crazy?

243
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:25,091
I'm sorry for lying to you.

244
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,440
I have explained everything to you.

245
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,920
You know why I did that.

246
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,880
It's because of Aeros.

247
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,160
Move.

248
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,640
-Ares...
-I said, move!

249
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,880
Zea is a member
of a bike gang in Bandung.

250
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,801
And she is the suspect
for Aiden's death.

251
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:08,761
What?

252
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,680
-Are you sure about this?
-I am sure. This information is valid.

253
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,640
I don't believe it.

254
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,920
I'm sorry, but this is the truth.

255
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,440
-Serra, I...
-You hypocrite!

256
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,440
I can explain it to you
and I'm telling you that I didn't do it.

257
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,760
You dare to talk to me like that?

258
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,640
-I can explain...
-Shut up!

259
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,160
Stay away from us!

260
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,280
Because of you, we lost Aiden.

261
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,040
I'm sorry, Zea.
But, I'm with Serra this time.

262
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,000
Calm down, girls.

263
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,880
We can't accuse her without any proof.

264
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,880
Ares has the proof.

265
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,880
Shut your mouth!

266
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,280
What's going on here?
The class is about to begin.

267
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,480
Now! Come on! Back to your seats!

268
00:26:42,943 --> 00:26:45,840
Murderer!

269
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,800
-Murderer!
-Murderer!

270
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,720
-Murderer!
-Murderer!

271
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,440
-Murderer!
-Murderer!

272
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,960
-Murderer!
-Murderer!

273
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,920
-I cannot dance.
-Your hands are correct.

274
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,360
So, how?

275
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,922
Thick and strong.

276
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,080
-That's it.
-No, it's like a girl. I don't want it.

277
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,000
-No! It's universal.
-It's difficult. Others, please.

278
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,760
Why you...

279
00:28:02,092 --> 00:28:04,172
Serra?

280
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,960
Why are you crying?

281
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,280
I can't believe that Zea killed Aiden.

282
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:27,101
My own best friend.

283
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,600
I can't believe it, too.

284
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,720
I thought she was a nice person.

285
00:28:42,015 --> 00:28:44,015
It turns out that she's a traitor.

286
00:28:46,535 --> 00:28:52,455
I promise you, I will make her pay!

287
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,600
I will find evidence which proves
she was involved with Aiden's death.

288
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,695
That girl is out of her mind!

289
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:18,040
She's being friendly in front of us,
when she has been the devil all along.

290
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,560
I can't believe it, too. How could she?

291
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:25,560
I'm a bit scared, you know?
What if she's a psychopath?

292
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,335
She's been acting like a good girl,
but it turns out that she's...

293
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,240
It's all right.

294
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,920
But, we still don't have any proof
that she actually did it.

295
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,895
What the hell is wrong with you?
Why are you on her side?

296
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:38,800
It's not like that.
It's just we still don't have any proof.

297
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,360
You see, everything points towards her.

298
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,615
And right now, I believe Calderioz
rather than Zea.

299
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:45,415
You're the only one on her side.

300
00:29:53,815 --> 00:29:56,320
You girls are really inconsistent.

301
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,920
It’s so easy
to pit you against each other.

302
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,480
You are Zea’s best friends.
You should know her true nature.

303
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,335
Even I, who is not her friend,
believe that she would never do that.

304
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,687
Hey, who asked for your opinion?

305
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,800
You conveniently barged in,
defending Zea.

306
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,080
Hey, you have a friend now.

307
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,760
Why are you still here?

308
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,000
This is our business, not yours!
You know nothing!

309
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,120
You're just defending her
because you like her!

310
00:30:37,495 --> 00:30:40,255
-What a loser.
-He really pissed me off.

311
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,520
Let's go, guys.

312
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,760
(You killed Aiden!)

313
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,960
Let me help you.
