1
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,720
Aiden?

2
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,600
Serra, do you need any help?

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,120
Serra?

4
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,120
Serra?

5
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,880
Aiden?

6
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,120
Aiden!

7
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,080
-Serra!
-Aiden!

8
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,960
-Serra, are you okay?
-Aiden!

9
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,960
-Aiden!
-Serra, Aiden's gone.

10
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:42,600
Aiden...

11
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,280
-Serra...
-Aiden!

12
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,320
But, he was just right there. I saw him.

13
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,920
-Let's go back inside.
-Aiden...

14
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,360
I know this is hard for you.

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,160
But, Aiden is not with us anymore.

16
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,680
And you have to let him go.

17
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,560
No. That was Aiden.

18
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,080
I saw him with my own eyes. I swear...

19
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,360
I know, I know.

20
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,600
I understand how you feel.

21
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,840
But, you can't keep going on like this.

22
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,760
He would hate to see you like this.

23
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,800
He would want you to be happy.

24
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:01,320
Do you know why he gave you
a sunflower hairpin?

25
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,560
Because it represents faithfulness.

26
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,520
It always faces the sun.

27
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,920
And the yellow petals represent
warmth and happiness.

28
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,760
I'm sure Aiden would want to see you
happy like you used to be.

29
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,200
Don't drown yourself in sadness.

30
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,080
I was late for a mere few seconds.

31
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,840
If only I had agreed to meet him,
this wouldn't have happened.

32
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,680
If only I knew things
were going to turn out this way,...

33
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,480
I would've spent more time with him.

34
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:11,400
But, I had no idea
that I would lose him so soon.

35
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,080
Yeah. This is life.

36
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,120
Life is like a coin with two sides.

37
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,000
Life isn't just about sadness.

38
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,480
So, you have to be strong
when misfortunes happen.

39
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,960
Life isn't just about happiness.

40
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,200
So, you have to be grateful
when things are good.

41
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,120
This is our starting point.

42
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,960
And then we move here.

43
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,800
Here.

44
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,880
We're going to search for information
in all those headquarters.

45
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,480
All of them.

46
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,640
We don't have time to waste.
We should move now.

47
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,280
Count me out, then.

48
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,160
If you guys prefer using your brawn,
instead of your brain...

49
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,760
What did you just say?
Is this what you call solidarity?

50
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,880
-None of this means anything to you?
-Enough, Mor!

51
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,720
Mor!

52
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,800
If you want to avenge Aiden's death,...

53
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,080
we have to do this together.

54
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,880
But, I don't like
the way you plan to do it.

55
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,600
You should be careful, Res.
We can't let this distract us.

56
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,600
Nothing can break us apart!

57
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,560
He doesn't care about Aiden anymore.

58
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,920
-I'll be going then.
-Okay.

59
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,120
Cha.

60
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,200
What's wrong?

61
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,600
I heard tonight Calz is going to raid
all the bike gang's headquarters...

62
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,560
to find Aiden's killer.

63
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,880
What about Ardhan?

64
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,040
He has turned off his phone.

65
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,360
What should I do?
I'm so worried about him.

66
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,240
I haven't even seen him today.

67
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,800
I'm scared. What should I do?

68
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,720
Why don't you just leave?

69
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,640
We've had enough trouble from you guys.

70
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,200
What?

71
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,840
Is this about Aiden?

72
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,520
Retro would never do such a thing.

73
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,400
You hear me?

74
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,000
Calderioz!

75
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,640
What do you guys want? Huh?

76
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,040
I need to know if it was one
of the members of De Lasga...

77
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,560
who murdered one of us.

78
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,760
So, you're going to pin that on us?
Is that it?

79
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,480
I don't accept that!

80
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,600
Ares!

81
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,960
Enough!

82
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,240
What if they didn't do it?

83
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,960
We didn't kill your member.

84
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,280
You can't accuse us without any proof!

85
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,240
If it turns out
that you're the one behind this,...

86
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,040
you will never live in peace.

87
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,960
-You can't just accuse us like that.
-You'd better not mess with any of us!

88
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,760
Listen, I'm not afraid
of you and Calderioz.

89
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,240
And we never caused you any trouble.
You happy now?

90
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,520
-Watch your tone, man.
-You should watch it!

91
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,320
I don't know if you feel this too,...

92
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,440
but I think
Calz is starting to get brutal.

93
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,320
Yeah, I agree with you.

94
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,160
He accused all of us
without any evidence.

95
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,880
They think
they're some kind of hot shot...

96
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,200
that they can do whatever they want.

97
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,160
Aiden's death,
one of Calderioz' top members,...

98
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,000
is a great loss for any of us.

99
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,680
And none of us know who did this to him.

100
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,680
However, that doesn't justify
their action, raiding our base.

101
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,800
For me, it's an act of disrespect.

102
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,160
We have our code of ethics,
respect each other!

103
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,600
Yeah!

104
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,000
We should respect each other.

105
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,800
If we do nothing,
they will keep acting like this.

106
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,440
They will do anything they want.

107
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,440
This is the best moment
to crush Calderioz.

108
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,440
And get our revenge!

109
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,680
I agree with you.

110
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,640
What do you want, huh?

111
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,200
Enough!

112
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,160
What do you guys want?

113
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:28,080
I want us to sit together
at a neutral place.

114
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,440
Not in any base.

115
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
We should talk this out.

116
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,960
Violence isn't a good way
to resolve a conflict.

117
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,200
-Find out who did this to us.
-Okay.

118
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,760
The license plate is B 1775 SUB.

119
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,520
Hello, Bara?

120
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Yeah?

121
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,720
How are things with the Wolves?

122
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,880
Well...

123
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,800
Ever since Aeros isn't in charge,
somehow we have changed our ways.

124
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,880
I feel like there are two sides
within the gang.

125
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,320
Two sides? What do you mean?

126
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,000
The one that still holds
Wolves' real values,...

127
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,120
and the more extreme one.

128
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,680
Hold on a second.

129
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,800
Don't tell me Lionel
is on the extreme side.

130
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,960
That's what I think.
I've been curious about him lately.

131
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,360
Let's not talk about this.

132
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,880
You just leave the Wolves to us.

133
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,400
Aeros' condition
must be taking a toll on you.

134
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,800
Okay.

135
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:20,080
But, please write this down. B 1775 SUB.

136
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,920
I need your help to find out
the owner of that license plate.

137
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,600
-Can I count on you?
-Of course.

138
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,680
-You can count on me.
-Thank you.

139
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
Take care.

140
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Calderioz is having a problem.

141
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,680
One of their boys got beaten to death.

142
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,480
We are trying to find out
who's responsible for this.

143
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,480
Will you guys help Calderioz?

144
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,840
Are you done with your workout?

145
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,520
I know you're still grieving.

146
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:23,040
I just wanted to remind you
to not be reckless in your actions.

147
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,320
Ares is a very good guy,
even though he looks scary.

148
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:45,200
I guess that's why people respect him
and love him.

149
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,520
That's what Aiden told me.

150
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:04,440
I'm sure he wanted you to
not only be loved by many people,...

151
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,040
but especially, by yourself.

152
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:28,160
I know you feel like you
have hit the rock bottom.

153
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,440
But, don't stay there. Get back up.

154
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,000
We miss you.

155
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,640
Hey.

156
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,680
I miss you.

157
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,960
He doesn't want to hang around
with us anymore.

158
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,800
What Megan said to us
is not wrong, though.

159
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,480
If we choose violence,
we're just going to end up badly.

160
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,880
Yesterday, we could have started a war.

161
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,240
We should be together...

162
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,120
to find the solution.

163
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,360
I'm with Ares.

164
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,760
Me, too.

165
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,840
Serra.

166
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,000
Serra.

167
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,040
Serra.

168
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,920
Welcome back to school.

169
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,640
We're with you.

170
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,720
I hope our company
will give you comfort.

171
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
We won't let you through this alone.

172
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,600
The hairpin looks good on you,
by the way.

173
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,920
Aiden must be happy
to see you wearing it.

174
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,080
Sorry, I didn't mean...

175
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,280
It's okay, Serra.

176
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,040
Serra!

177
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,160
Can you not talk about him to Serra?

178
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,960
I didn't know it would make her sad.

179
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,920
-How come you didn't know...
-Enough!

180
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,120
That's enough.

181
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,760
Serra.

182
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,960
Yes?

183
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,800
Come with me.

184
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,240
You can talk to me.

185
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,960
My biggest regret is that
I never showed him that I cared for him.

186
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,360
I promise...

187
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,720
I will find the person
who's responsible for his death.

188
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,000
This isn't just for you.

189
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,240
It's for him.

190
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,240
I want him to rest peacefully.

191
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,040
Can I ask you something?

192
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,200
If you cared for him,...

193
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,360
why did you push him away?

194
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:19,040
Because I didn't deserve him.

195
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,640
I didn't deserve him.

196
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,880
Aiden...

197
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,880
I'm sorry for bringing him up.

198
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,400
It's okay if you can't tell me now.

199
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,160
I understand.

200
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,680
But, when you are ready,...

201
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,960
I need you to tell me
what happened that day.

202
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,960
Hi.

203
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,560
Why aren't you answering?

204
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,080
I'm not in the mood.

205
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,840
Don't hold back your feelings.

206
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,000
If you're still feeling upset
over Aiden's death,...

207
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,200
you can cry it out.

208
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,360
It's completely fine.

209
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,480
I'm sure Ares didn't have anything to do
about what happened to Aeros.

210
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,520
He has a noble heart.

211
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,920
This is not the right
time to provoke her!

212
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,160
Don't you have any empathy?

213
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,440
Can't you see them? They are grieving.

214
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,320
Serra.

215
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,680
So, you're the one riding his bike now?

216
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,320
Please take good care of it.

217
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,600
Sure. I promise.

218
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,920
Come on, let me drop you home.

219
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,840
Zea...

220
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,240
Thanks for the ride.

221
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,120
Wait, I need to get something.

222
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,760
Give me your hand.

223
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,320
You should not leave a wound open.
It might get infected.

224
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,080
Thanks.

225
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,160
Are you out of your mind?

226
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,880
Miss Zea! Where are you going?

227
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,000
Where are you going?
You haven't had your lunch.

228
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,720
I've already prepared your lunch.

229
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,800
It'll all go to waste.

230
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,720
Don't worry, babe.
I can eat it for you.

231
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,520
-Do you have to?
-Of course I do.

232
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:16,040
-Fine, let's eat together.
-Thank God!

233
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,480
-I like that.
-Okay.

234
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,840
-Do you agree with me?
-Definitely.

235
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,360
So this is the map. We start from here.

236
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:46,760
And then, we turn to this point.

237
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,000
Lio.

238
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,600
Zea, is something wrong?

239
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,360
I don't think it was Ares
who hurt Aeros.

240
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,080
After getting to know him,...

241
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,720
I found that he's completely different
from what you said to me.

242
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,280
No one will admit that
he's a bad person.

243
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,160
But I can see who is bad
and who is good.

244
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,360
He's just acting nice in front of you
because he likes you.

245
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,680
Don't tell me you like him, too.

246
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,520
Are you having a romantic relationship?

247
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,560
-You have betrayed us, Zea.
-I'm not a betrayer!

248
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,480
In front of me
and in front of everybody else,...

249
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,880
Ares and Calderioz
aren't as bad as you told me.

250
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,280
So he's your guy? Look at him!

251
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,040
Is he?

252
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:35,520
You're like my own brother,
but you were willing to hurt me?

253
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,600
Explain it to me.

254
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,600
Tell me.

255
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:49,680
Is it true that you ordered him
to attack me and Ares?

256
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,560
Answer me!

257
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:02,240
Did you also set Retro and De Lasga
against each other?

258
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,480
Yes, I did everything I could
to crush Calderioz.

259
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,360
And that's because they put
Aeros in a coma.

260
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,040
By attacking me?

261
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:30,840
I have always believed in you.

262
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,320
And now I'm even more sure...

263
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,000
that Ares didn't do it.

264
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,680
You are blinded by your feelings for him
and you are betraying Wolves!

265
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,800
This is not about my feelings for him.

266
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,120
This is not about that.

267
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,400
-I just want to make it clear...
-Zea!

268
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,800
I am disappointed.

269
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,200
Because one of the Wolves has bent
their knees in front of Calderioz.

270
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,720
Alex!

271
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,000
Get her!

272
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,320
Come on!

273
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,280
-Where did she go?
-Find her! Let's split up.

274
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,320
Hey, you!

275
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,880
