23
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:43,708
I thought you got mad at me

24
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,791
and you don’t want to see me.

25
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,708
What should I be mad at you?

26
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,541
Because I canceled on you.

27
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:51,791
Am I that kind of person
to hold a grudge?

28
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,083
By the way,

29
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:57,166
I got you a present as an apology.

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,916
I chose a tie for you.

31
00:01:59,083 --> 00:01:59,833
Let me put it on for you.

32
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,000
That’s not necessary.

33
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,041
I believe your good taste.

34
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,833
I’m not going to leave this time.

35
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:06,791
I plan to set up

36
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,291
my own self-media studio,

37
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,750
right in the park.

38
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,416
It’s also close to your company.

39
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:12,750
Good.

40
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,166
Let me know whenever you need my help.

41
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,041
That’s it?

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,250
What else?

43
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:22,875
You are still as cold as always.

44
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:25,957
Did that girl come to pester you?

45
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,250
Just some minor problems.

46
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,541
I’ve handled it.

47
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,041
Mr. Alex.

48
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,875
I came here

49
00:02:41,832 --> 00:02:43,457
still for Marry Me this time.

50
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,375
Didn’t you ask Mr. Yin about it?

51
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:49,000
Not this time,

52
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:51,991
because I want to give him a surprise.

53
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,250
A surprise?

54
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,025
Yes.

55
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,957
I’ve been in love with Sichen for years.

56
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:03,291
Last time,

57
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:05,541
when he gave me the necklace
your wife designed...

58
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:07,375
Let’s go.

59
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,707
...he was going to propose.

60
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,666
The ball is over.

61
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:16,750
If you don’t leave now,

62
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,832
your Cinderella Pumpkin
is about to reveal itself.

63
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,666
But I wasn’t ready.

64
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,957
You are burning the bridges.

65
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,416
Until I saw the wedding dress you made.

66
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:32,832
I suddenly realized

67
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:35,832
that only when girls

68
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,166
(The buyer has paid a 10% deposit.)
see the white dress

69
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,416
they fall for,

70
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,791
will they suddenly make up their minds

71
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,125
to take an oath to marry someone.

72
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:45,166
Goodbye.

73
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:46,375
Never see you again.

74
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:51,916
Maybe the reason I had been hesitating

75
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,166
was because

76
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:55,207
I didn’t see the unique white dress.

77
00:03:57,082 --> 00:03:58,291
If I can

78
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:00,332
get married
in the wedding dress you made,

79
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,125
I will be the happiest woman
in the world.

80
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:04,666
I’ve dreamed about

81
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,207
that scene countless times.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,750
According to my contract with Mr. Yin,

83
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
I can’t sell the wedding dress
to you in private.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,250
If you don’t mind,

85
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,332
I can sell you

86
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:16,790
my hand-made wedding dress.

87
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,950
As for the size,

88
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:22,000
I can alter it according to your size.

89
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,583
That would be great. I’m so honored.

90
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,650
You can talk to my assistant

91
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,875
about the details.

92
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,290
Okay, okay.

93
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,958
Thank you so much.

94
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,415
May you and Mr. Yin be happy forever.

95
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:37,415
We will.

96
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,790
(Xixi and Mumu’s Magic Cabin)
Dear customer, we’ve obtained the right

97
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,290
(Xixi and Mumu’s Magic Cabin)
to buy Marry Me’s wedding dress.

98
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,500
We need you

99
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,125
to confirm receipt of the 10% deposit
you took earlier.

100
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,290
Sure enough,
a fraud has all kinds of tricks.

101
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,250
(Girls’ Dream Lover)
Really?

102
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,333
(Girls’ Dream Lover)
Do you have any proof?

103
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,540
After you pay the deposit,

104
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,833
Alex’s studio

105
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,208
will provide proof of purchase.

106
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,375
I’ll pay you in full

107
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,625
when you get the proof of purchase.

108
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,040
After all, it’s my first time
to buy something through a shopper.

109
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,083
I also worry about being cheated.

110
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,583
I tried so hard
to go against Yin Sichen,

111
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,665
and you think I’m a fraud?

112
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,583
Dear customer,
if you don’t confirm the deposit,

113
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,500
the deposit will be held
by the online shopping platform.

114
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,290
I can’t buy the wedding dress
without the deposit.

115
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,540
This is what frauds always do.

116
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,915
Give me the dress
and I’ll give you the money.

117
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,290
Or I’ll cancel the order.

118
00:05:30,175 --> 00:05:31,165
All right.

119
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:39,250
Hello, what’s up?

120
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:39,915
Well,

121
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:40,708
Alex agreed to sell me

122
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,458
a sample dress of Marry Me.

123
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,375
Really?

124
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes.

125
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,665
But,

126
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:49,800
we have to pay a deposit first.

127
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,750
How much do we still need?

128
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,790
More than 50,000 yuan.

129
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,290
I’ll pay the deposit then.

130
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,790
I can get the money back

131
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,958
after you get the money
from the customer.

132
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,333
As for the interest...

133
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,000
I’ll alter your clothes for one year
without any charge.

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,725
How is it?

135
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,458
Deal. Send me your card number.

136
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,025
Okay.

137
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,333
Hello, Miss Gu.

138
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,458
Our first class

139
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,875
is to learn to sketch,
the basic skill of drawing.

140
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,915
Sketching is

141
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:22,665
the dullest part of drawing.

142
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:24,958
It was really hard

143
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,165
when I learned it.

144
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,208
Observing is more important
than drawing.

145
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,000
I’ll start now.

146
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,540
For example, the apple.

147
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:35,750
First,

148
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,083
we need to figure out
the light area and the shade.

149
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,915
Usually, we will draw the shade

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,750
in gradation from the terminator

151
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,875
to where the light disappears.

152
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,833
The tone is divided into darkest black,

153
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,208
sub-black and light black.

154
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,583
When the light comes down, the back side

155
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,790
is the darkest place,

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,800
followed by sub-black and light black.

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,833
Zixin.

158
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,958
Are you listening to me?

159
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:07,708
Yes.

160
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,790
The darkest black, yes.

161
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,083
I know this is boring.

162
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,708
Well, look at me.

163
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,208
Look at my face.

164
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,125
Observe my face carefully.

165
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:33,165
What do you see?

166
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,415
Beautiful eyes.

167
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,290
Zixin, no.

168
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,125
I’m asking you to see
the terminator on my face.

169
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:47,915
Sorry.

170
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,625
- You really like complimenting people.
- Sorry.

171
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:51,750
There must have been a lot of girls

172
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,208
falling for you, right?

173
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,208
Unfortunately,

174
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,458
I’ve been single.

175
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,208
That must be because
your standard is too high.

176
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,540
Well,

177
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,665
let’s try to draw this apple

178
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:10,958
on this.

179
00:08:12,665 --> 00:08:14,415
It’s boring at first.

180
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,583
Because I went through this before.

181
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,083
Come on, let’s draw it out.

182
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,000
That’s it for today.

183
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,040
I got something to do at home.

184
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,725
(MARRY ME enters WHY-MALL.)
Goodbye.

185
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:29,540
That’s it.

186
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,125
Ruona, Ruona.

187
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,000
I bought you milk tea.

188
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,083
I waited in line for a long time.

189
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,208
I don’t have time now.

190
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,458
Why?

191
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,916
Because my boss went to buy milk tea

192
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,250
and left me here alone

193
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,625
to handle everything.

194
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,208
But I heard that drinking this milk tea

195
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,291
will make you feel the taste of love.

196
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,708
It’s working time,

197
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,583
and I don’t like sweet drinks.

198
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,166
Wait, Ruona.

199
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,416
The milk tea...

200
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,458
You are not going
to make a move on Mu Ruona, are you?

201
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,041
Your dad placed her here.

202
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,000
I’ve made a move in my heart

203
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,458
although it didn’t start well.

204
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,250
You are not telling me

205
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,625
that she’s the girl in the bar, right?

206
00:09:14,725 --> 00:09:15,575
Yes.

207
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:18,916
Then I can only

208
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,275
wish you good luck.

209
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,791
Your move may not work on Ruona.

210
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,541
If you have been enthusiastic before,

211
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,208
try to chill out.

212
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,166
Be more serious when you work.

213
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,250
Good advice, bro.

214
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,833
Alex and the reporters have arrived.

215
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,250
Let’s get started.

216
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,666
The wedding dress

217
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,875
you bought through a shopper

218
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:45,958
has worked.

219
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,166
Should we continue?

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,625
Okay.

221
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,250
By the way, there is a fraud.

222
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,500
Take care of her for me.

223
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:57,958
Mr. Yin.

224
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,583
Mr. Alex.

225
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,708
Didn’t Miss Gu come today?

226
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,375
She asked me to give you her blessings.

227
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,458
Unfortunately, she has
a stomachache again today.

228
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,833
She has to rest at home.

229
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:11,750
All right.

230
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,958
Let’s welcome
the internationally renowned designer,

231
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,291
Alex.

232
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,925
(WHYMALL MARRYME)

233
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,625
(WHYMALL MARRYME)

234
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,083
This is the first offline store

235
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,500
of my personal brand, Marry Me.

236
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,625
It’s an honor to give its first time

237
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,625
to Why Mall.

238
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,500
Its brand personality, aesthetics

239
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,375
and pursuit

240
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,708
agree with me perfectly.

241
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:40,708
I believe

242
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,708
the cooperation between
Why Mall and Marry Me

243
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,750
will be a great pleasure.

244
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:45,708
Thank you all.

245
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,250
Mr. Alex.

246
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,958
I heard
that you are planning to step aside.

247
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,958
What about Enjoy you founded?

248
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,833
I put a lot of efforts into Enjoy.

249
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,500
I will choose a right partner

250
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,625
to entrust it with.

251
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,500
I heard you sold

252
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,250
the crafted sample dress this time.

253
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,833
Who did you sell it to?

254
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,166
Is there any special meaning?

255
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,708
That wedding dress

256
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,666
is for Miss Gu Xixi,

257
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,150
the fiancée of Mr. Yin Sichen.

258
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,916
Gu Xixi!

259
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,250
(Wenye Group)

260
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,875
Mr. Mo, we can be sure

261
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,125
that Miss Gu is the person

262
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,666
who is said
to have an affair with Yin Sichen.

263
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:38,708
I see.

264
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:39,208
And also,

265
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,958
we couldn’t find the pigment

266
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,416
you asked me to look for earlier.

267
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,333
But after my investigation,

268
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,708
I found

269
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,458
the address of person
who works in the pigment factory.

270
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,208
Send me the address.

271
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,791
Gu Xixi.

272
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:03,958
Fei, is it for real?

273
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,833
Fiancée?

274
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,250
I wish it’s fake.

275
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,708
Mr. Yin, what should we do?

276
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,083
Accept the lights and their blessings.

277
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:29,750
Hello.

278
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,750
Your total is 8,930 yuan.

279
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,125
8,900?

280
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,041
Yes.

281
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:36,583
It’s okay.

282
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,166
Use my card.

283
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,850
Miss Gu, please hold on.

284
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,375
We just checked the restaurant

285
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,083
and we found
three sets of silver tableware missing.

286
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,500
According to our regulations,

287
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,666
you must pay the full price,

288
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,166
which is 2,000 yuan.

289
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,125
How can there be tableware missing?

290
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,208
One of them
must have taken the tableware.

291
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,791
It’s okay. Let’s go.

292
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:10,625
Sorry.

293
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,525
Go home with your uncle later.

294
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,458
Grandmas.

295
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,050
I think we are all finished.

296
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,083
Before we leave,

297
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,375
please check your bags

298
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,375
and see
if you accidentally took anything.

299
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,041
No.

300
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,500
Xixi, what do you mean?

301
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,666
Do you think we are thieves?

302
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,083
How come?

303
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,125
- Grandma.
- It’s disrespectful.

304
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,375
I’m just thinking

305
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,250
that the kid is naughty

306
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,583
and he might accidentally take it.

307
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,625
Is it possible?

308
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,916
That’s more ridiculous.

309
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,166
You even slander a child.

310
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,791
Seriously.

311
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,000
Come on.

312
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:50,916
- Sit down.
- It’s Grandma’s birthday.

313
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,541
- It’s okay.
- Let it go.

314
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:53,708
It’s alright.

315
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,708
Okay, sorry.

316
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,583
I wronged you.

317
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:56,666
Well, Sir.

318
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:57,600
Yes.

319
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,850
Let’s call the police.

320
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,875
Let the police deal with it.

321
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,041
Call the police?

322
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:03,500
Sir.

323
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,250
Are we still a family?

324
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,625
There are just some plates

325
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,666
and forks missing.

326
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:07,750
Do you need to call the police

327
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,458
for such a trivial matter?

328
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,175
- Xixi.
- Is it necessary?

329
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,708
Look, it’s Grandma’s birthday today.

330
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,666
Just let it go.

331
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,041
Let it go?

332
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,075
Dad.

333
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:20,708
You’ve been letting everything go

334
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,958
your whole life.

335
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,325
How can you let this kind of thing go?

336
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:24,916
I...

337
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,583
The person who took it
should be held legally responsible.

338
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,791
Miss Gu, well...

339
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,791
Sorry to trouble you.

340
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,208
It’s okay. Just call the police.

341
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,000
Let’s do what we should do.

342
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,416
Mr. Mo.

343
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,291
What happened?

344
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,541
Zixin.

345
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:40,791
Well,

346
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,583
there are
three sets of silver tableware missing

347
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,541
in Miss Gu’s box.

348
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,791
But the guests said
they didn’t take them.

349
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,500
Miss Gu asked me to call the police.

350
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,166
Well, I’ll buy the tableware.

351
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,291
No need, Zixin.

352
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,666
It’s not about money.

353
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,750
Xixi.

354
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,000
If you call the police,

355
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,541
the person who gets arrested
will be in big trouble.

356
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,208
How serious?

357
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,958
According to Criminal Law,

358
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,833
those who steal or take public property

359
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,916
worth more than 1,000 yuan
will be sentenced to imprisonment

360
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,875
of not less than one year
and not more than three years.

361
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:20,825
Well...

362
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,375
Tian, what have you done?

363
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,333
Why did you put the plate here?

364
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,166
The kid is too naughty.

365
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,235
We found it.

366
00:15:28,235 --> 00:15:29,002
We found it.

367
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,208
It’s a misunderstanding.

368
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:31,750
The kid is naughty.

369
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:33,583
Great.

370
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,666
I’m glad it’s just a misunderstanding.

371
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,958
I thought there was a thief.

372
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,416
How about this?

373
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,833
I overheard

374
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,291
that it’s Grandma’s birthday today.

375
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,125
Well,

376
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,666
Manager Chen, wrap it up for me

377
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,458
as a birthday present for Grandma.

378
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,000
Okay.

379
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:46,041
- Don’t.
- No, Zixin.

380
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:46,916
- Don’t.
- Don’t do this.

381
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:47,708
We can’t take it.

382
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:48,375
Xixi.

383
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,458
Zixin.

384
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,583
You don’t have to do this.
It’s not good.

385
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,458
They are still your family.

386
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,125
Don’t make them look too bad.

387
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,850
It won’t do good to you, either.

388
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,916
I’ll transfer the money to you.

389
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:05,425
Yin Sichen!

390
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,000
Are you crazy?

391
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,291
I’m crazy?

392
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,750
Who is crazy? My fiancée.

393
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,075
I...

394
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,250
♪Does anyone♪

395
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,675
♪Make me like and care for him♪

396
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,875
I don’t know what happened between you.

397
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,708
But you can’t take her away like this.

398
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,500
She must go with me today.

399
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,600
Get off me. I’ll go with you.

400
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,250
Zixin, sorry.

401
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:38,958
I need to deal with something

402
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,083
with Mr. Yin.

403
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,291
I might know what happened.

404
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,650
Yin Sichen’s fiancée?

405
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,125
The person

406
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,833
Alex wants to work with on Enjoy?

407
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:02,958
I see.

408
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,250
Ask our people to contact him.

409
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,291
Do you have any idea

410
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,000
what kind of trouble you put me in?

411
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,208
Do you have any idea

412
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,875
what kind of trouble you put me in?

413
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,208
What an unreasonable woman!

414
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,208
What a slanderer!

415
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,083
Seems that we can be a good couple,
my fiancée.

416
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,541
We’re perfect for each other, my fiancé.

417
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,833
You are saying it so naturally.

418
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,333
Have you dreamed about it
countless times?

419
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,083
You...

420
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,458
Hello, Xiaoya.

421
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,208
Hello, Xixi.

422
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,500
The person who bought Marry Me’s dress
canceled the order.

423
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:44,833
Wait.

424
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,041
Then my deposit will be down the drain.

425
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:48,958
What’s the delivery address
of that person?

426
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:49,833
Send it to me and I’ll go to see him.

427
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,375
You are familiar with this address.

428
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,250
The Headquarters of Why Mall.

429
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:57,541
(WHYMALL)

430
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,083
I’ll hang up, Xiaoya.

431
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:00,791
Bye-Bye.

432
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,333
Yin Sichen, let me ask you.

433
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,083
Is there a person

434
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,375
called Girls’ Dream Lover
in your company?

435
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,708
Are you that shopper, the fraud?

436
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,416
Who is a fraud...?

437
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,166
Yin Sichen.

438
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,666
Don’t tell me that person is you.

439
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,416
Gu Xixi.

440
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,291
You got me into great trouble

441
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,166
just for a small order.

442
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,541
I tried so hard
to buy the wedding dress.

443
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,041
I didn’t expect that it’s for you.

444
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,416
How would someone name himself
Girls’ Dream Lover?

445
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,041
Aren’t you too narcissistic?

446
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,166
According to the network index,

447
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,791
I am the man
that all women on the internet

448
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,750
want to marry the most.

449
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,666
It’s not narcissism.

450
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,958
It’s big data.

451
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,291
I’m indeed the dream of all women.

452
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,583
Oh, please.

453
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,750
Which president would be so bored

454
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,958
to search the online list about himself?

455
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,375
I just got the news

456
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,750
that Wenye Group is contacting Alex now.

457
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,750
I guess it’s also about Enjoy.

458
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,333
Wenye Group?

459
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,416
We must seize the initiative

460
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,416
before Alex decides.

461
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:15,875
At the press conference today,

462
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,000
Mr. Alex

463
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
seems to be interested in Miss Gu.

464
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:35,708
I’ll take care of it.

465
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,000
You can go back.

466
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,200
Yes.

467
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,375
Have you come up with a solution?

468
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,125
Yes.

469
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,250
I’ll explain it to Alex.

470
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,125
How?

471
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,791
Explain to him that you cheated him

472
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,166
in order to get
a Marry Me wedding dress?

473
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,166
Or explain to him

474
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,958
that you and I colluded with each other?

475
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,041
Then what?

476
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,875
What do you think I should do?

477
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,666
I can give you a chance
to make up for it.

478
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,875
You continue to play my fiancée.

479
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,166
If you agree,

480
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,541
I’ll compensate you for your loss

481
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,541
and give you a handsome sum of money.

482
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,541
Take the money and help me.

483
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,083
This is your only choice.

484
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,083
Okay, I can do this.

485
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,500
That’s a fast answer.

486
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,083
I deserve
the compensation for the deposit.

487
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,291
But I won’t take
the money you talked about.

488
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,708
Looks like you need money badly.

489
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,166
Yes, I’m short of money.

490
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,083
But you are right.

491
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,291
I’m responsible for what happened.

492
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,041
I’ll make up for the loss.

493
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,416
But,

494
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,750
after this,

495
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,916
I hope you and I
won’t see each other anymore. Thanks.

496
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,750
Rest assured.

497
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,791
You are not that attractive to me.

498
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:02,333
You...

499
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,375
Yin Sichen, what are you doing?

500
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,708
Just to give you a feeling

501
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,375
of what it’s like to be my fiancée,

502
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,625
so that you won’t give yourself away

503
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,166
when you meet Alex tomorrow.

504
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,041
I’ll ask my assistant

505
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,625
to send you a copy of my information.

506
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Memorize it before tomorrow morning.

507
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,075
(Self-evaluation: Cheerful and helpful,
rigorous and careful, responsible...)

508
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,770
(Education: Managerial Economics, CAMB)
What a snob!

509
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,900
(Hobbies: Reading, drawing, writing,
fitness, outdoor activities, basketball)

510
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,500
He got himself such a detailed profile.

511
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,250
It’s not to find a wife.

512
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:53,175
(Yin Sichen
requests to add you as a friend.)

513
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,291
Reject.

514
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,425
(Yin Sichen: Don’t reject me again.)

515
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:05,208
Fine.

516
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,600
(Gu Xixi)
Have you memorized all the information?

517
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,600
(Yin Sichen)
Almost.

518
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,125
5,000 yuan for each mistake.

519
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,791
Yin Sichen, did you lose your humanity?

520
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:26,833
Okay.

521
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,625
Boss.

522
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,416
My resume is relatively simple.

523
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:33,958
There’s no weird thing like

524
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,708
an award for flexible hands

525
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,250
in elementary school.

526
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,000
Yin Sichen, you investigated me.

527
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,416
Yin Sichen, you investigated me?

528
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,250
Not only you need to know me,

529
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:46,541
I also need to know you.

530
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,666
I didn’t expect your life
to be so colorful.

531
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,083
I didn’t expect anyone

532
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,208
to take TOEFL and IELTS

533
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,625
in elementary school.

534
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,708
You are such a freak.

535
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:57,750
A freak.

536
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,708
That’s because excellent people
are always excellent

537
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:03,850
and weird people are always weird.

538
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,041
Don’t bother me when I work.

539
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:08,875
See you tomorrow.

540
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:12,083
Mr. Shang.

541
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:14,833
There is a team-building dinner party
of the Management Department

542
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,250
on Friday night after work.

543
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,125
They said it’s a welcome party for me.

544
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,416
You should come together.

545
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,666
Okay.

546
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,833
If you’ve been enthusiastic,

547
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,375
try to chill out.

548
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:28,275
Let me consider it.

549
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,208
Well,

550
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,916
I’ve already

551
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,041
made an appointment

552
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,250
with my younger female schoolmate.

553
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,125
She said she missed me,

554
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,500
and I agreed to see her.

555
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,791
Okay, then, I’ll leave you to it.

556
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:49,100
Hold on.

557
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:51,500
Speaking of this girl,

558
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,625
she was the most popular girl
in school at that time.

559
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,916
She had a crush on me

560
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:56,750
and she confessed to me.

561
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,666
I don’t think she is the right person,
so I rejected her.

562
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,000
Now she asked me out again.

563
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,666
I’m sure she is going
to confess her love to me again.

564
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,875
It’s a tricky situation.

565
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,833
Ruona, what do you think I should do?

566
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,625
I’m not you. It’s up to you.

567
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,375
It’s up to me?

568
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,708
If I relent and say yes,

569
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:13,416
then...

570
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,791
Then I will have to wish you happiness.

571
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,541
I still have work to do. I’m leaving.

572
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:21,833
I might say yes.

573
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:22,958
No, I will say yes.

574
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:24,750
I...

575
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,083
She doesn’t care about me.

576
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,333
Do you know
that staying up late for too long

577
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,291
can lead to sagging skin,
premature aging,

578
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,041
poor memory

579
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,800
and even early death?

580
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:37,825
I only know

581
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:39,000
that if I don’t work overtime now,

582
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,625
Why Mall will close down

583
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:41,916
and you and I will lose our jobs

584
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:44,083
so that you won’t give a thought

585
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,875
to your skin and your memory.

586
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,666
The worst situation

587
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,291
is that your dad buys you up.

588
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,166
Keep it in mind.

589
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:58,291
This is my least favorite sentence,

590
00:24:58,625 --> 00:24:59,625
end of story.

591
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:01,583
No bonus for you this month.

592
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:03,958
All right.

593
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:04,791
Say it.

594
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:05,791
What can I do for you?

595
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:08,083
Look into Mo Zixin for me.

596
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,333
(Mo Zixin, President of Wenye Group)
Mo Zixin lived in Meishan District.

597
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:12,833
His family immigrated to Canada

598
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,208
when he was 10 years old.

599
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:16,250
He just came back two years ago.

600
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,416
I can’t find anything else about him.

601
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:20,916
Nothing?

602
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:22,875
Just some charity news about him.

603
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,791
According to the official statement
of the Oceanic Organization,

604
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:26,916
Mo Zixin

605
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,791
makes a personal donation

606
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:30,625
to endangered sea creatures every year.

607
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,833
Mo Zixin
is an interesting person indeed.

608
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:34,916
Or,

609
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
he just has too much free time.

610
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,041
I don’t think so.

611
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,250
Alex said in an interview

612
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,125
that he doesn’t like

613
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,916
those businessmen with greasy hair.

614
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,250
He prefers

615
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,666
those who are romantic and interesting.

616
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:49,750
Alex will like him a lot.

617
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,000
From now on,

618
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:54,125
I’m not a businessman.

619
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:58,708
I’m a romantic and interesting person

620
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,125
who is willing to spend money like water

621
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,958
for romance.

622
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,333
What’s wrong with you?

623
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,541
I have to act like this

624
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,666
at least in front of Alex, right?

625
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:21,791
Hello.

626
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:22,916
Hello, Mr. Mo.

627
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:23,958
Hello.

628
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,666
Please have a seat.

629
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:27,833
Mr. Alex.

630
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:32,083
I believe this proposal

631
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:34,166
will meet all your needs.

632
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:36,000
Besides,

633
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:38,500
I don’t think
you can find a better partner

634
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,916
than Wenye Group in China.

635
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,291
Have you always been so confident?

636
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:43,333
Yes.

637
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:44,958
Because I have

638
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,375
the best data team and marketing team

639
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:48,500
in China.

640
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,541
And we have a broad user base
on our platform.

641
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:52,750
This is what gives me confidence.

642
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:57,708
As a businessman,

643
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,208
this proposal is impeccable

644
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:00,500
both in financial

645
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,833
and commercial terms.

646
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:05,125
But this brand

647
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,458
is not a business for me,

648
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,500
but the embodiment of personal values.

649
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:11,541
I think you can get the idea.

650
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:13,833
I do.

651
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:15,625
Whether it’s Marry Me

652
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,375
or other design products of yours,

653
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:18,708
they are works of art.

654
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:20,791
After we’re done talking about business,

655
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:22,958
maybe we can talk about art.

656
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:25,500
Here.

657
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:26,083
Thanks.

658
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,416
(Statement MARRYME)
I asked the best art team

659
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:33,958
to integrate

660
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:35,875
all the works
launched by Marry Me so far

661
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,200
into this page.

662
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:39,708
Mr. Mo, I really appreciate it.

663
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:40,916
My pleasure.

664
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,166
I want to invite you and your designers

665
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:44,541
to hold a design exhibition

666
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,250
at the National Academy of Fine Arts.

667
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,583
There are many other plans.

668
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,250
I won’t go into details now.

669
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:52,250
I will reply to you as soon as possible.

670
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,000
Okay.

671
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:26,416
So,

672
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,250
this is my job?

673
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,958
Just follow my instructions.

674
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:42,450
This wedding dress

675
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,708
is like tailor-made for you.

676
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,041
Today is your first day of shooting.

677
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,541
I invited Mr. Alex over

678
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:50,500
to supervise it.

679
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,125
I heard that you are going to wear
my wedding dress

680
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54,083
to shoot the cover of the magazine.

681
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,791
I’m very curious,
so I came over to take a look.

682
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,166
Hope I won’t let you down.

683
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,041
All right, let’s get started.

684
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,083
Good.

685
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,083
♪Like a meteor streaks♪

686
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:23,958
♪The night sky is lit up♪

687
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:24,791
Very good.

688
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,025
♪I never want you♪

689
00:29:29,025 --> 00:29:31,875

694
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:52,833
She is beautiful.

695
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,000
You are a lucky man.

696
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:00,958
Yes.

697
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,792
Actually, the reason
I want to work with you this time

698
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:07,458
is mainly because of her.

699
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:09,833
She reminded me

700
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,541
that if we can make more women

701
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:16,000
feel confident about marriage
because of your design,

702
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,625
that would be the best thing.

703
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,541
I’m optimistic about your love.

704
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,708
You two are so in tune.

705
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,725
I’m also grateful
to have her in my life.

706
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,625
She gave me a lot of inspiration.

707
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,583
Actually, I came to Jiangbei this time

708
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:36,166
to find the right person for my brand.

709
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,125
Although you are
successful and professional,

710
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:41,500
I still worry
that the way you think as a businessman

711
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,500
may not perfectly fit
the temperament of my brand.

712
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,041
Now you have Miss Gu by your side,

713
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:49,375
I can rest assured.

714
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,375
If I give you
the authority of agency of my brand,

715
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,125
do you think it’s okay?

716
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,958
I think Xixi will also be thrilled

717
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:00,875
to hear that.

718
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,833
Feel free to tell me your conditions.

719
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:08,958
My conditions are...

720
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:14,541
Do you want to take a photo together?

721
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,416
Okay.

722
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,708
I’ll send the photo to you later.

723
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:55,250
Okay.

724
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,291
I’ll leave then.

725
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,541
Thanks a lot.

726
00:32:00,225 --> 00:32:00,825
Yeah.

727
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:09,291
Are you done hugging me?

728
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,083
What were you talking about with Alex?

729
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,583
It’s a secret for now.

730
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,416
Anyway,

731
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,125
thank you for today.

732
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,208
Thanks to you,

733
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,500
Alex and I had a good talk.

734
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:31,375
I’ll treat you to dinner
as a thank you.

735
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:34,166
That’s not necessary.

736
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:35,250
You should

737
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,525
stay away from me as far as you can.

738
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,791
This is a private estate.

739
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:42,791
There is no taxi.

740
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,166
Do I have no legs?

741
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:53,666
It’s okay.

742
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,541
Just start from scratch.

743
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:58,791
Why is there no car?

744
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:04,350
Hey.

745
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:10,708
Don’t you have...?

746
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:36,125
What?

747
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:36,916
Did no one tell you

748
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:38,708
that it takes strength to be brave?

749
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:42,333
It’s not your problem.

750
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,625
Get in the car.

751
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,083
None of your business. I can walk.

752
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:50,041
Don’t take me wrong.

753
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,750
I don’t want to waste time
because of you.

754
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,333
If you waste an hour here,

755
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,333
I’m going to wait for you
for one more hour in the restaurant.

756
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:58,166
Can you afford to pay for my loss?

757
00:33:58,975 --> 00:33:59,500
You...

758
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,375
High heels are not suitable for you
in this situation.

759
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,541
I just got a call from Mr. Alex.

760
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,250
He chose Why Mall in the end.

761
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:42,458
But Alex

762
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:43,666
was very interested in our company

763
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,125
when he talked to me this morning.

764
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,500
Do you know what Yin Sichen did?

765
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,125
I heard it was Yin Sichen’s fiancée

766
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:53,550
who convinced Mr. Alex.

767
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,208
Gu Xixi?

768
00:34:59,375 --> 00:34:59,958
By the way,

769
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,333
the person
who works in the pigment factory

770
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:02,416
lives in Huaiyuan, right?

771
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,350
Yes.

772
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:04,958
Book a flight there for me.

773
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:05,583
Okay.

774
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:16,083
I’m finished.

775
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:18,467
Happy to work with you today.

776
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:19,666
I’m leaving then.

777
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:20,958
Hold on.

778
00:35:22,575 --> 00:35:23,958
(Jiangbei Development Bank Cash Cheque)
Fei’ang has transferred

779
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,658
(Jiangbei Development Bank Cash Cheque)
the money you lost to you.

780
00:35:25,658 --> 00:35:27,408
The amount of this check
is one million yuan.

781
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,875
I’ve signed it.

782
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:30,750
You can fill in any number

783
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,583
as today’s payment.

784
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:35,458
I said

785
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,750
that I don’t need your money.

786
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:38,666
Not enough?

787
00:35:40,575 --> 00:35:42,166
That’s not what I mean.

788
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:43,416
Then what are you up to?

789
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:47,041
What am I up to?

790
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:49,325
What do you mean?

791
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,583
Women like you

792
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:54,958
do everything

793
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,958
for your own interest, don’t you?

794
00:35:57,575 --> 00:35:58,958
You don’t want this one-million check,

795
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,791
so it means you want more.

796
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,500
You might as well tell me

797
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:04,000
what you want.

798
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:06,541
You are not falling in love with me,

799
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:07,833
are you?

800
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,208
Yin Sichen.

801
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,791
Do you think you can judge people at will
just because you are rich?

802
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:14,583
Who gives you the right to say that?

803
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,125
You wanna know why?

804
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:22,333
You’ve been that kind of person

805
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,166
since the first time I met you.

806
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:31,041
A woman like you

807
00:36:31,825 --> 00:36:32,958
can do anything

808
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,433
for money. Am I wrong?

809
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:07,791
Do you have to be so cruel?

810
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:11,541
If you act, you act professionally.

811
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,875
If I’m not being cruel,

812
00:37:14,975 --> 00:37:16,308
I’m afraid
she would fall in love with me.

813
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:18,250
Let’s go back to the company.

814
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,041
What’s wrong?

815
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,416
Alex just sent it over.

816
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:29,541
Take a look.

817
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Marry Me’s authorization

818
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,500
will automatically take effect
three months after you get married.

819
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:36,708
Either of the two parties
can waive the authorization,

820
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,041
then it will be managed
by the other party.

821
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:40,541
It means I have to marry her
and wait for three months?

822
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:43,375
This is the only way.

823
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:49,625
Let’s go.

824
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,125
I remember I said

825
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,625
we should never see each other again.

826
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:10,833
