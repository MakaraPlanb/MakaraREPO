Thank you.

24
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,041
You should thank the necklace
for not going wrong.

25
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,375
I take back what I said, then.

26
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:00,875
Childish.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You’re childish.

28
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:13,625
Are you all right?

29
00:02:14,707 --> 00:02:15,416
Yes.

30
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:18,000
Looks like

31
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:20,075
we have to leave
before the party is over.

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,859
Hope you will also

33
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,625
enjoy this wonderful night.

34
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:27,957
Good day.

35
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:42,975
See you.

36
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:43,682
Necklace.

37
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:53,957
See you.

38
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:57,125
Never again.

39
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,250
That’s all?

40
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:06,291
Yeah.

41
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,916
That’s Yin Sichen.

42
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,125
Yin Sichen! Yin Sichen!

43
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,525
Nothing else happened?

44
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:21,400
No, no, no.

45
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,082
From this day on,

46
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,082
I don’t want to hear his name
ever again.

47
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,500
That’s impossible.

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,416
In this city,

49
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,375
the city news, social news,

50
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,125
pink news, entertainment news

51
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,125
and even after-dinner conversations

52
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,500
are all about him.

53
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,082
He came back to Chine two years ago.

54
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:39,666
Instead of joining his family company,

55
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,375
he established Why Mall

56
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,041
and made it one of the best malls

57
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,541
in Jiangbei.

58
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,207
He’s known as a business talent.

59
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,207
Lin Xiaoya,

60
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:52,041
why are you flattering him?

61
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,666
Shall I pay you
to build a temple for him

62
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,541
where you can worship him?

63
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,775
(Yin Sichen)
Here’s the temple.

64
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,875
Seriously?

65
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:02,500
Would you like to make a wish?

66
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,207
It’s said to be efficacious.

67
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Lin Xiaoya,

68
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,625
why do you keep flattering him?

69
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:08,957
Which side are you on?

70
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,375
All right. I’ll stop that.

71
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,582
By the way,

72
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:13,750
help me to check

73
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,665
who overtook my car today.

74
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,790
I’ll make him pay for that.

75
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,790
All right. I get it.

76
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,225
I’ll find him out.

77
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,165
But the man who had your car fixed

78
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:25,165
was nice.

79
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,415
How does he look?

80
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:33,040
Handsome.

81
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,958
What’s his name?

82
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:34,833
Do you have his number?

83
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,458
I didn’t ask him.

84
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:38,790
But,

85
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,000
I gave him my number.

86
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,708
His appearance enchanted you.

87
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,625
You haven’t asked for his number.

88
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,290
What if he’s gone with your car

89
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,040
and never returns it?

90
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,915
That’s a Porsche.

91
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,040
Can you afford the compensation?

92
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,208
He doesn’t look like a bad guy.

93
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,775
Are you sure?

94
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,500
I’m sure.

95
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,415
Miss Gu, your car is being fixed.

96
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,583
(Unknown contact)
I’ll give you the bill tomorrow.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,350
When may I meet you?

98
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:13,725
Lin Xiaoya,

99
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:16,125
I’m quite lucky.

100
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,083
Lucky girl.

101
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,500
All right.

102
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,790
(Gu Xixi)
Let’s meet in the noodle shop

103
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,790
of Baisha Plaza
at twelve the day after tomorrow.

104
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,583
By the way,

105
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,583
your doll looks cute.

106
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,583
This?

107
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,575
I designed it.

108
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,300
It’s a doll with big ears.

109
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,208
It has the same name as me, Xixi.

110
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,375
I had thought

111
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,458
it would be extremely hard to find you.

112
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,540
Unexpectedly, the rain

113
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,290
brought you right to me.

114
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:56,000
Maybe,

115
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,750
it’s the magic of the Sunny Doll.

116
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,500
Screwed.

117
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,958
I haven’t posted the update today.

118
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,125
(I think someone’s calling me...
Who’s that?)

119
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,775
(What are you doing?
Where is it?)

120
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:23,735
Nianxi finally updated his cartoon.

121
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,415
I thought he wouldn’t update this week.

122
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:28,225
(You know? A boy came the other day.
Can he be...?)

123
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,500
Mom, come and have lunch.

124
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:45,450
Mm.

125
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,025
- Enjoy the meal.
- Be quick.

126
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,540
Look at you.

127
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,500
You keep working in the laundry,

128
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,000
but you haven’t made much money.

129
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:01,775
And you...

130
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,200
You don’t even have a job.

131
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,415
My son has to raise you two?

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,625
You...

133
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:10,625
Xixi, focus on your meal.

134
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,600
You know what?

135
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,040
Ms. Wang introduced a boyfriend to you.

136
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:15,875
He’s local in Shanghai.

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,250
The blind date has been arranged.

138
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,000
Go meet him tomorrow.

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,550
I’m not going.

140
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,333
He got divorced.

141
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,915
And he’s in Shanghai.
But he has an apartment and a car.

142
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,083
Grandma cares for you.

143
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,665
I’ve got a boyfriend.

144
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,375
You have?

145
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,875
Where’s he from?

146
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,375
What do his parents do?

147
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,540
- Does he have an apartment?
- What about a car?

148
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,850
Let me make it clear first.

149
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,790
If he’s from a poor family,

150
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,165
I won’t allow you.

151
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,900
Mm.

152
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,075
Grandma,

153
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,000
let me put it this way.

154
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,958
My boyfriend is good-looking

155
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,975
with a stable job and income.

156
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,915
You won’t be disappointed.

157
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,075
On your birthday,

158
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,650
I’ll bring him to you, all right?

159
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:57,833
Does that satisfy you?

160
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,040
I want no more. Enjoy yourselves.

161
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,715
What?

162
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:00,825
You...

163
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:10,833
This is where I leave you.

164
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,708
Mr. Alex,

165
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,375
- nice to work with you.
- Nice to work with you.

166
00:08:17,275 --> 00:08:18,775
(Tea Shop)

167
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,165
Mr. Alex.

168
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,083
Miss Gu.

169
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:24,625
Mm.

170
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,415
Didn’t Mr. Yin say you had a cold?

171
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:30,958
I did feel unwell.

172
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,916
But I’m much better now.

173
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,041
I don’t want to stand you up.

174
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,250
You’ve waited for long?

175
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,950
No. I just arrived.

176
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,350
Didn’t you say

177
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,916
you could sell me
a Marry Me wedding dress?

178
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,958
Are you going back
on your promise?

179
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,750
Didn’t Mr. Yin tell you?

180
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,000
Tell me what?

181
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,400
Marry Me will settle in Why Mall.

182
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,833
Half an hour ago,

183
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,125
we signed the contract.

184
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,166
Considering your relationship,

185
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,208
shouldn’t he give you the wedding dress?

186
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,975
Am I spoiling his surprise?

187
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,458
This isn’t a surprise, but a shock.

188
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,583
Shock?

189
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,300
Just kidding.

190
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,625
He hasn’t told me about it yet.

191
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,416
Then don’t tell him

192
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,208
that I spoilt his surprise.

193
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,500
Don’t worry. I won’t.

194
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,925
I’m leaving, then.

195
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:20,967
I’ll leave you alone.

196
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,700
Mm.

197
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,725
Xiaoya.

198
00:09:31,725 --> 00:09:32,525
Ah?

199
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,067
How was it going? Did you get the order?

200
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:39,617
What? What happened?

201
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:40,500
You know what?

202
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,541
Yin Sichen is such a bad guy!

203
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,041
How could someone

204
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:44,833
mess up a sure thing?

205
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,458
He ruined my order.

206
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,958
Yin Sichen annoyed you again?

207
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:48,500
Yes.

208
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,416
Looks like

209
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,541
you and he are destined to meet.

210
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,583
In a bad way.

211
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,333
I have two pieces of news for you.

212
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,375
They may stir you up.

213
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,708
Go ahead. I can handle that.

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,291
I found the man who overtook your car.

215
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,291
Who’s he?

216
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,541
Someone you’re familiar with.

217
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,958
Don’t stare at me like that.

218
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,625
It can’t be him, can it?

219
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,583
Congratulations. You always
have good instincts.

220
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,100
Yin Sichen!

221
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,750
We’ve reached a preliminary cooperation

222
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,416
with Alex.

223
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,583
This is the promotion proposal
I made in advance.

224
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,208
Get the Advertising Department
and the Publicity Department to work.

225
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:24,791
Okay.

226
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,375
Come on, Sichen.

227
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,000
Sichen,

228
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:30,625
I’m your best friend

229
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,541
and your personal PR.

230
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,541
Why didn’t you tell me about that?

231
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,333
Who’s she?

232
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,250
Who do you mean?

233
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,958
You’ve got famous.

234
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,333
I’ve got famous?

235
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,875
You haven’t checked Weibo, have you?

236
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:45,000
(Rich Yin Sichen kissed a girl
by the swimming pool.)

237
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,875
(Mysterious rich Yin Sichen
at a fashion party with his secret girlfriend.)

238
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,375
The angle was bad.

239
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,675
The light was dim.

240
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,100
But considering I’m the leading man,

241
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,458
I think this photo is nearly perfect.

242
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,583
It’s so modest of you.

243
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,166
This girl makes the photo worse.

244
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,375
So, who’s she?

245
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,208
A nobody in the news.

246
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,333
Nobody?

247
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,541
You kissed her by the swimming pool.

248
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,541
What do you mean nobody?

249
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,583
Any other business?

250
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,625
No idea.

251
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,750
Who took the photos?

252
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,225
(Zegang)

253
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,541
Hello, Zegang.

254
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,416
Gu Xixi,

255
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:22,317
come to my home when you have time.

256
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,458
Take away all your belongings.

257
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,400
Come on, Zegang, I...

258
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:27,625
Hello?

259
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:31,800
What happened?

260
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,833
Zegang wants to break up with me.

261
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,208
Why does he want that?

262
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,258
Did he see the trending topic?

263
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:44,958
No way. I must go see him.

264
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,583
I want to explain to him.

265
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,625
If we eliminate the trending topic,

266
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,025
aren’t we admitting it?

267
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:52,958
Marry Me

268
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,000
is a romantic brand of wedding dress.

269
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,275
Take it as free promotion for us.

270
00:11:58,775 --> 00:11:59,666
Isn’t that good?

271
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,458
Let’s go have some coffee.

272
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,083
Come on. You’re so big-hearted.

273
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,958
Zegang, where are you?

274
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,666
I’m at a meeting. Let’s talk tonight.

275
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:16,175
We’ll go after finishing the meal.

276
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:17,041
Come on.

277
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,000
Help yourself to more.

278
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,291
You’ve been thinner lately.

279
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,583
It’s your fault for not accompanying me.

280
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,916
All right.

281
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,500
I’ll make it up for you.

282
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,083
Zhao Zegang!

283
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,291
I wondered why you suddenly
broke up with Xixi.

284
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,208
You’ve got another girlfriend,
haven’t you?

285
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,791
Zegang, who’s she?

286
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,333
A friend of mine.

287
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:48,541
A friend?

288
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,333
You need to feed a friend?

289
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,291
Gu Xixi,

290
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,500
I should ask you.

291
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,416
What’s the trending topic about?

292
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:57,833
And the photos.

293
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,916
Gu Xixi.

294
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,583
Zhao Zegang, don’t talk nonsense.

295
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,125
I came to explain to you.

296
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,333
But looks like

297
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,666
I don’t need to.

298
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,250
I knew you were a material girl.

299
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,375
You’d rather believe

300
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,000
the pink news on Weibo

301
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,500
than what I said, right?

302
00:13:21,825 --> 00:13:22,875
- I...
- Let’s break up.

303
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,583
Do you hear me?

304
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:26,916
I dumped you.

305
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,625
Love rat!

306
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,125
Xiaoya, let’s go.

307
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,125
Don’t be angry.

308
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,333
Let’s go to SAO.K and get hammered.

309
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,041
You’ll get a new boyfriend soon.

310
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,291
What happened?

311
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,750
Ignore them. She’s my ex.

312
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,625
Come on.

313
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,916
Did she break up

314
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,083
because of the photos with you?

315
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,291
Do you know SAO.K?

316
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,291
That’s my home field.

317
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,583
Let’s go there tonight.

318
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,250
Aren’t we going to have coffee?

319
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
I just changed my mind.

320
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,416
Waiter, the bill, please.

321
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,666
- Happy single girl!
- Happy single girl!

322
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,791
He’s such a love rat.

323
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,041
Why do I still need him?

324
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,916
It’s great to dump him.

325
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:10,791
Maybe he has been

326
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,958
with that girl

327
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,333
for a long time.

328
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,083
Yeah.

329
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,333
What’s your plan, then?

330
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,041
I’ll embrace my new life.

331
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,500
Xixi.

332
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,075
Mm.

333
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,375
Cry out if you want.

334
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,625
Why would I want to cry?

335
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,166
I want to laugh.

336
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,125
It was just failed love.

337
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,833
I’ll forget him

338
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,750
and do business.

339
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,350
Do business?

340
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,875
Girls should do business.

341
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,625
Business.

342
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,625
- Do business.
- Mm.

343
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,416
Do business.

344
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,000
Cheers.

345
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,541
Cheers.

346
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,166
But I think

347
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,750
you should find out the source first.

348
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,583
You’re right.

349
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,250
I should find the source

350
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,916
and destroy it.

351
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:09,775
Mm.

352
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,375
But what’s the source?

353
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:15,475
I’m hungry, Xiaoya.

354
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,666
I want roast chicken wings.

355
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,291
Hot spicy?

356
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,833
- Hot spicy.
- Hot spicy.

357
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:22,825
That’s right.

358
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:23,500
Mm.

359
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:25,125
I’ll go buy some. Wait for me.

360
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,291
Okay.

361
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,458
Where shall I go?

362
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:31,666
This way?

363
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,125
Be careful.

364
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:33,625
Mm.

365
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,083
Waitress.

366
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,416
Where’s the restroom?

367
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:39,666
Go out and turn right.

368
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:40,475
Oh.

369
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,916
There aren’t too many people today.

370
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,041
Waiter, clean the table out.

371
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:54,625
All right.

372
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,791
The old same order.

373
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:57,400
Okay.

374
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,666
Nice.

375
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,225
Has she left?

376
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:05,666
What are you looking for?

377
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:15,166
I noticed a nice girl.

378
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,583
I’m going to talk to her.

379
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,208
Would you like to help me?

380
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,125
Bye-bye.

381
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:20,791
How unromantic!

382
00:16:24,075 --> 00:16:24,958
Waiter,

383
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,416
a cup of Hot Summer for this lady.

384
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,458
My dream goddess?

385
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,541
I don’t take anything without a reason.

386
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,375
I’ll buy you a drink, too.

387
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:48,041
Excuse me.

388
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,208
A cup of Long Island for him, please.

389
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,958
You... You’re welcome.

390
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,059
It’s my honor to buy a drink

391
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:57,916
for such a beautiful girl like you.

392
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,041
Xiaoya, I’m back.

393
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,875
Have it when it’s hot. It’s hot spicy.

394
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,125
It tastes great.

395
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,625
Xiaoya, I knew it was you.

396
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,666
Just now,

397
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,650
I mistook you as Yin Sichen.

398
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,625
He had long horns

399
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,458
and so many teeth.

400
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,291
His paws were like this long.

401
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:35,875
He was

402
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,166
staring at me like that.

403
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:38,750
Terrifying.

404
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,500
Luckily, it’s you, Xiaoya.

405
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,083
Xiaoya,

406
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,875
I found the source you mentioned.

407
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,458
Yin Sichen is the source!

408
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,208
The bad guy Yin Sichen!

409
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,625
He’s so merciless and inhumane.

410
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,291
He ruined my life.

411
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,125
He ruined my love.

412
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,625
He ruined everything of mine.

413
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,416
So, I must find the source.

414
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,250
I’ll destroy him.

415
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,375
I’ll get rid of him.

416
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,708
You’ll destroy Yin Sichen?

417
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:13,250
Yes!

418
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,458
I’ll destroy Yin Sichen!

419
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,958
I’ll make him into roast chicken wings,

420
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,125
cut him into pieces

421
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,958
and thread him...

422
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,433
Drive me home. I’m tired.

423
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,375
Drive the car to me.

Mm.

458
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,458
What...?

459
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,875

Mm.

461
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,833
Your father spent the rent

462
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:11,833
on investment.

463
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,333
I asked for it,
but he didn’t give it to me.

464
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,375
He even lost his temper on me.

465
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,291
But if we still don’t pay the rent,

466
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,291
the landlord will
take the apartment back.

467
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,291
Mom,

468
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,750
stop worrying.

469
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,458
Your grandma’s birthday is in two days.

470

She insists on booking a room

00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,833
How can she pay for it?

474
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,625
Mom,

475
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,291
let me handle it, all right?

476
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,733
Lately, I’ve just got

477
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:39,125
a big order.

478
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,750
I’ll make a lot of money.

479
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,541
I can handle the rent

480
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,583

00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,416
My daughter,

482
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,875
you’ve really grown up.

483
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,083
But I’m so sorry.

484
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,666
I’ve been...

485
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:56,916
I’ve been troubling you.

486
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,166
What are you talking about, Mom?

487
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,875
I make money for you.

488
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:02,916
Don’t worry.

489
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,333
I’ll take care of everything.

490
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:05,875
Okay.

491
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,000
Come and clean it up with me.

493
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,125
I’m sorry, sir.

494
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,916
I’ve got business this afternoon.

495
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,916
So, I have to meet you this morning.

496
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,916
The location of the noodle shop
is concealed.

497
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,425
But the noodles here are great.

498
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:25,833
It’s a good place.

499
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:27,875
I’m glad you like it.

500
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:29,916
Mr. Mo?

501
00:22:30,175 --> 00:22:31,050
Miss Gu?

502
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,675
Mm.

503
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,000
You know each other?

504
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:34,833
Yeah.

505
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,375
Enjoy yourselves. I’ll get back to work.

506
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:37,291
- Okay.
- Okay.

507
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,208
Why did he say that?

508
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,666
I often came to this noodle shop, too.

509
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,125
What a coincidence!

510
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,166
This restaurant was opened in Meishan.

511
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:46,750
I often had noodles there
before I went abroad.

512
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:48,583
What a bigger coincidence!

513
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,916
I came from Meishan, too.

514
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,208
Maybe we met when we were little.

515
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,458
Not maybe.

516
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,666
You really don’t remember me?

517
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:02,750
- Mo.
- Mo.

518
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:03,791
- Zi.
- Zi.

519
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,208
- Xin.
- Xin.

520
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,291
This is a doll I made.

521
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,041
Take it as a Sunny Doll.

522
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,000
With its protection,

523
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,291
you won’t be scared of rainy days again.

524
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:21,833
Bye-bye.

525
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,166
You’re Mo Zixin?

526
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:33,583
Have I changed so much?

527
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,583
Sorry, but I didn’t recognize you.

528
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:36,625
It’s okay.

529
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,500
It’s been long since we last met.

530
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,041
I thought I would never see you again.

531
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,416
Unexpectedly,

532
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,625
we met again that day.

533
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,333
So, I think I’m a lucky guy.

534
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:47,625
By the way,

535
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:50,416
this is the certificate
of the car repair.

536
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,541
You can get your car with it.

537
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,083
(Receipt of Auto Service Center)

538
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,125
Thank you, senior.

539
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,458
Can I pay you later...?

540
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,416
You don’t need to.

541
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,250
Don’t care about the bill.

542
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:02,541
No, no.

543
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,708
I must pay you back.

544
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:05,000
Well,

545
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,500
let me write an IOU to you.

546
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,083
(IOU)
I’m short of money lately.

547
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,333
But when I have money,

548
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,166
I’ll certainly pay you back.

549
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:14,291
This is the IOU.

550
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,125
Xixi.

551
00:24:17,275 --> 00:24:17,900
Mm?

552
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,666
I don’t need the IOU.

553
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:21,875
- No.
- Listen to me.

554
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:23,750
Do you remember

555
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,333
what you promised me?

556
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,833
You promised...

557
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:33,791
To teach you to paint?

558
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,208
You still remember?

559
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,375
I do.

560
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:40,625
If you insist on paying me back,

561
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:43,416
come and be my art teacher.

562
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:44,750
No problem.

563
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,041
How about this?

564
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,541
I’ll give you a lesson every week.

565
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,208
For the whole year, all right?

566
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:52,833
Okay.

567
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,083
Hello, Yin Sichen.

568
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,458
Last night, I got to know a girl.

569
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,625
She said she was a top student

570
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,541
from a business college.

571
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,958
I talked myself out to get her number.

572
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:08,458
Hope when I meet you again,

573
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,458
she’s already my girlfriend.

574
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,083
What about you? Any news?

575
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:13,583
No. I’ll hang up.

576
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,416
How unromantic he is!

577
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,625
Something’s wrong.

578
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,291
Hello, Director Zhang.

579
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,916
What’s going on?

580
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,500
Isn’t there a regular meeting
every Monday?

581
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
Look what time it is.

582
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,583
We’re a humanistic company,

583
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,583
but we shouldn’t be so sluggish.

584
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:38,166
It’s over.

585
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,541
What? It’s over?

586
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,083
The new general manager?

587
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,625
What general manager?

588
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:45,958
She didn’t tell me about the meeting
on her first day to work.

589
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:46,875
She even...

590
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:59,208
How...? How did you

591
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,291
find me here?

592
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:02,291
I work here.

593
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,125
Work?

594
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:06,833
Are you saying

595
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,916
you’re the new doctor?

596
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:11,375
Hello, Mr. Shang. I’m Mu Ruona.

597
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:17,166
If my boss is a man

598
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:18,700
who cares nothing about work,

599
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:21,666
but only cares about playing,

600
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,041
what should I do?

601
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,500
That’s easy.

602
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,500
He likes playing, doesn’t he?

603
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,458
Let him play until he’s fed up.

604
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:31,250
This is the game of cat and mouse.

605
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,500
Do you believe

606
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:43,375
two persons may look the same?

607
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,708
Do you believe that?

608
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:47,458
Last night, I met a man

609
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:49,666
who looked the same as you.

610
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,541
I had his number.

611
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:56,291
Shall I call him to confirm?

612
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,250
This may be
a beautiful misunderstanding.

613
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,600
President Shang entrusted me

614
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,083
to help you manage the company.

615
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:04,625
I don’t care about anything else.

616
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,500
Let me report to you today’s work.

617
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,375
Before that,

618
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:11,625
I have a question for you.

619
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:13,666
Last night, you had a good impression

620
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,041
of me, didn’t you?

621
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:18,916
You’d better save your breath

622
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,333
and put your energy on some other girl.

623
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,000
I...

624
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,416
It’s nothing to do with work.

625
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:28,916
I refuse to answer.

626
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:30,833
I just reviewed

627
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,583
the draft contract with Why Mall.

628
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:35,291
There’re some problems
with the details.

629
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:38,833
We use common practices

630
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:39,958
for the cooperation with Why Mall.

631
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,416
Besides,

632
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,708
no one dare to negotiate with Sichen.

633
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:45,791
Now, someone dare.

634
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,708
My dream goddess.

635
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:02,333
Excuse me.

636
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,166
Excuse me.

637
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,750
Excuse me.

638
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,500
Miss, how can I help you?

639
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,458
I want to see Yin Sichen.

640
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,041
Do you have an appointment?

641
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:25,708
No.

642
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:26,541
Sorry,

643
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:28,975
but you can’t see Mr. Yin
without an appointment.

644
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,175
(Mysterious rich Yin Sichen
at a fashion party with his secret girlfriend.)

645
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:34,750
Come with me.

646
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:36,083
Mr. Yin is at a meeting.

647
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,250
Look. Look at this.

648
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:44,708
The data aren’t right.

649
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:47,708
Please wait here for a moment.

650
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:49,625
You can get in
after the meeting is over.

651
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:50,583
Okay. Thank you.

652
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:06,958
Come in, please.

653
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,125
Yin Sichen, you’re good at hiding.

654
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:14,166
How will you explain
what you lied to me?

655
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,650
Let me explain.

656
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,825
He’s indeed a bad guy.

657
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,958
(Office of the President)

658
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:27,958
This is where I’ll leave you.

659
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:32,875
Have a meal with me if you have time.

660
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:33,725
Mm. Okay.

661
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:34,475
Bye-bye.

662
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:45,666
I’ve never seen Mr. Yin

663
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:47,291
walk someone out as politely as that.

664
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:47,791
Yeah.

665
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,250
She’s indeed a brilliant girl.

666
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:49,916
Who’s she?

667
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,000
Miss Gu.

668
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:51,700
Mm?

669
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:11,875
Yin Sichen,

670
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:15,375
I remember at the after-party,

671
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:17,166
we said we would get what we wanted.

672
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,041
But what are you doing now?

673
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,583
I’ve got what I want with my ability.

674
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,958
But you haven’t.

675
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:25,041
It only means you’re not capable enough.

676
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,166
But actually,

677
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:30,375
at the after-party,

678
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:32,291
Alex promised to sell me
one wedding dress.

679
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,625
- But because of you, he...
- Marry Me dresses

680
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:34,208
will be sold in my mall

681
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,000
in three months.

682
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,125
You can buy one at that time.

683
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:39,500
No way.

684
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,333
I’m in urgent need of one.

685
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,250
So, I need it now.

686
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:53,791
Why is the wedding dress
so important to you?

687
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,500
It’s none of your business, is it?

688
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,750
What? Rush to get married?

689
00:31:05,825 --> 00:31:06,541
Wait.

690
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,791
Didn’t you just break up?

691
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:12,666
How did you know that?

692
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,791
These three months
are our promotion period.

693
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:21,125
Throughout the world,

694
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:24,208
you can buy

695
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:26,541
a Marry Me dress in nowhere,
but Why Mall.

696
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:28,750
Unless...

697
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:32,125
Unless what?

698
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,208
Unless I suddenly get married.

699
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:35,916
I’ll consider

700
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,500
preparing one dress for my wife.

701
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:39,041
But even if I get married,

702
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:41,000
I won’t marry you.

703
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:43,208
Yin Sichen,

704
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,125
you’ve severely

705
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,166
disturbed my life.

706
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:49,458
It means your life is too fragile.

707
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,125
My life is fragile
because of a selfish egomaniac like you.

708
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,500
You have no idea

709
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
how greatly you’re troubling
and hurting me.

710
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:57,708
I’ll try to handle the dress problem.

711
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,125
But you must explain to the media

712
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,500
about the misunderstanding,

713
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,000
prove that we’re in no relationship,

714
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,375
and delete the photos.

715
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:07,958
How shall I explain?

716
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:10,791
Tell them that you and I cheated Alex?

717
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,958
What about my losses?

718
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,208
Will you pay for them?

719
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,791
It’s the price you have to pay

720
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,208
for your unauthorized action that night.

721
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:21,958
Yin Sichen, you’re an arrogant
and ruthless demon

722
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,375
without any empathy.

723
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,458
Miss Gu, after you vent your anger,
you can leave.

724
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:56,291
Hello. I want to see Mr. Yin.

725
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,791
This way, please, Miss Ran.

726
00:32:57,925 --> 00:32:58,475
Mm.

727
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,541
She’s good enough for our president.

728
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,166
But that girl...

729
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,083
Screwed.

730
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:07,208
Wait.

731
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:15,625
Yin Sichen!

732
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,333
The photo should have
been taken like this.

733
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:21,833
It can be nearly a perfect photo.

734
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:33,958
What do you want to do?

735
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:38,250
What do I want to do?

736
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,541
I want to have some water.

737
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:51,750
But I just drank that.

738
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,375
♪Oh yeah♪

739
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,518
♪Does anyone♪

740
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:20,150
♪Make me like and care for him♪

741
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:25,375
Yin Sichen, what do you want?

742
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:27,208
You rogue!

743
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:33,041
I’m a rogue?

744
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:33,625
Mm.

745
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:36,916
Don’t you remember
what you did last night?

746
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,125
What did I do last night?

747
00:34:44,675 --> 00:34:45,541
Sorry to bother you.

748
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:47,375
Walk Miss Gu out.

749
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:55,708
It’s the bill

750
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,291
of my broken limo

751
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:58,791
because you overtook my car.
Pay for it.

752
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,541
Are you crazy about money?

753
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,583
You think everyone else is like you,
