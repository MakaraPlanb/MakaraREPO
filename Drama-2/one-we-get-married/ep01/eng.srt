170
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:04,750
to buy Marry Me dresses at a high price.

171
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,665
Why do I need so many wedding dresses?

172
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,665
Do I need to explain
hungry marketing to you?

173
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:11,833
Think about it.

174
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,583
What if I become popular?

175
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:15,125
Can I consider being a star,

176
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,540
instead of a boss?

To a designer,

185
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,250
the online store is the base.

186
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,290
Only when we run the online store well

187
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,458
can we run the physical store...

00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:35,675

189
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,925
It’s the real stage.

190
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:39,950
Mm.

191
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,333
I’m glad you understand.

192
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,415
Don’t worry.

193
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,790
When I open Cici,

194
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:46,000
I’ll make you my exclusive model.

195
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:49,875
Do I need your job?

196
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,665
After all, I’m a first...

197
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:53,790
Second...

198
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,458
Third-line model.

199
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,040
And I’m a famous vlogger.

200
00:07:57,665 --> 00:08:00,000
You have 25 real fans

201
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,165
and 250,000 fake fans on Weibo.

202
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,208
They’re not revealed yet?

203
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,125
Come on, Gu Xixi!

204
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:05,708
All right. All right.

205
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,915
You’re the Vlog Queen, okay?

206
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,875
That’s more like it.

207
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,083
By the way, Xiaoya,

208
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,915
a batch of clothes will be arriving.

209
00:08:12,915 --> 00:08:14,000
I’ll leave them at your place.

210
00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:15,333
If they’re delivered to my home,

211
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,375
my grandma will sell them again

212
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,500
to help support the family.

213
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,250
Gu Xixi, look what you are doing.

214
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,625
Aren’t you tired?

215
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,540
Xiaoya,

216
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,208
nothing in life can be easy.

217
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,540
My only hope is that

218
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,250
a big order will come to us

219
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,583
so that I’ll make a fortune.

220
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,175
(List of Shoppers)

221
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,975
(Xixi and Mumu’s Magic Cabin)

222
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,925
(Search: Xixi and Mumu’s Magic Cabin)

223
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,875
Aladdin and the Enchanted Lamp?

224
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,900
(Hello.)

225
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:57,858
Girls’ Dream Lover?

226
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:02,725
What a narcissistic and arrogant ID!

227
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,083
Marry Me.

228
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,291
Sorry,

229
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,166
but I’ve got a boyfriend.

230
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,725
She’s even more narcissistic than me.

231
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,958
I mean the Marry Me wedding dress.

232
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,083
What’s wrong?

233
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,000
This guy wants a Marry Me wedding dress.

234
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,791
Can he be a fraud?

235
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:25,583
Come and have a look.

236
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,625
Marry me?

237
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,833
The customized wedding dress
worth a million yuan?

238
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,208
(Wedding dress: 1.28 million)
10% of the price is the commission.

239
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,025
(10% of the price: 1.28 million*10%= 128,000)
We can earn a hundred thousand.

240
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:36,875
Mm.

241
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:37,541
Take the job.

242
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,458
Take it.

243
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,125
Take it?

244
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,750
Do you know
why the dress is so expensive?

245
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,125
Because its designer Alex

246
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,333
only designs 12 dresses a year.

247
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,958
We can’t buy one.

248
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,125
It’s because

249
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,375
Alex hasn’t met you before.

250
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,150
Don’t flatter me.

251
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,125
Even if I can convince Alex,

252
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,166
I can’t even see him.

253
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,125
What a coincidence!

254
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,125
Alex is right here.

255
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,583
Tomorrow night, he will

256
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,625
hold a party here.

257
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,875
I can get an invitation.

258
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,500
Would you like to give it a try?

259
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,291
It may be a chance.

260
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,625
Do you know the price
of a Marry Me dress?

261
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,416
Money isn’t a problem.
But can you buy one?

262
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:24,000
Gu Xixi, I think
he’s underestimating you.

263
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,041
Pay 10% of the price as a deposit.

264
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,583
Pay the rest after I buy one.

265
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,150
(Successful payment
Payment to be confirmed.)

266
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,625
Done.

267
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,750
Time to show me what you can do.

268
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,458
Xiaoya.

269
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:40,400
Ah?

270
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,416
Find out as much as you can about Alex.

271
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,525
I’m on my way.

272
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,416
This is the information

273
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,416
I’ve collected about Alex,

274
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,291
including his family hobby, background

275
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,250
and personal interests.

276
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,625
3g in total.

277
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:56,541
Coffee.

278
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,791
The doctor suggests that

279
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,791
anyone with severe insomnia

280
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,416
shall not drink anything with caffeine.

281
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,041
You have severe insomnia already.

282
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,041
You must be aware of that.

283
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,166
Do you know
why I don’t want a girlfriend?

284
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,500
Because you’re busy.

285
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,208
Because you’re nagging too much already.

286
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,250
Make coffee and you can get off work.

287
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:15,500
Wait.

288
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,700
I picked a shopper for you.

289
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:19,750
Shopper?

290
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,125
What shopper?

291
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:22,958
One on your list.

292
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,916
I wondered where the list was.

293
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,600
These are the worst shoppers
I’ve listed.

294
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,041
You didn’t pay, did you?

295
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:34,791
She can’t buy one, anyone.

296
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,125
We’ll get the money back then.

297
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,333
Yin Sichen, you!

298
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,333
Take off your coat and come over!

299
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:09,750
Why?

300
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,666
Then we can fight.

301
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,083
What’s wrong with you?

302
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,225
What’s wrong with me? It’s you!

303
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,041
You leave Why Mall’s
promotion of next year,

304
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,166
to another company.

305
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,200
I should certainly fight you.

306
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,475
Who told you?

307
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,291
Don’t bother about that.

308
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:25,625
If I win,

309
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,208
leave the promotion of next year to me.

310
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,166
If you win,

311
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,541
leave it to me, too.

312
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,125
But I’ll give you 5% off.

313
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:32,958
Okay.

314
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,150
K.O.

315
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,750
Tomorrow, I’ll ask Fei’ang

316
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,416
to prepare the next contract for you.

317
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:52,041
By the way,

318
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,708
you’re a trending topic again today.

319
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,083
Could you keep a low profile in the pub?

320
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,750
I’m a trending topic again?

321
00:12:59,125 --> 00:12:59,833
No, that...

322
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,791
If I say that was an accident,

323
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,708
will you believe me?

324
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,250
Your father won’t believe you, anyway.

325
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,250
He asked me to recommend someone

326
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,708
to be the general manager
of your company.

327
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I recommend an alumna
of my university, Mu Ruona.

328
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,583
She’s an overseas returned doctor.

329
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,250
General manager?

330
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:18,875
I think my father

331
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,833
just wants to cut off my economic power,

332
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,208
instead of expecting a general manager.

333
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,208
Left or right?

334
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:25,583
- Left.
- Right.

335
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,125
Anything you like.

336
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,450
You’ll wear such a nice suit.

337
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,416
You must be going out for fun.

338
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,125
Take me with you.

339
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,208
I’m going to a ball tomorrow evening

340
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,125
where I can meet the designer Alex.

341
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,333
I know him.

342
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,541
He’s the dream lover of girls.

343
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,750
There’ll be beautiful
young girls, won’t there?

344
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:49,975
Take me with you.

345
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,000
Beautiful young men and girls.

346
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,850
I mean...

347
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,708
I only care for beautiful girls.

348
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:01,975
Sorry, Mr. Shang,

349
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,333
but he can’t take you this time.

350
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,708
I arranged his appointment
with Ran Xiwei for tomorrow.

351
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,166
Good, Sichen.

352
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,083
You get to be romantic.
You’ll date Xiwei.

353
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,583
Shut up. Or I’ll call the security.

354
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:14,458
Security.

355
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,350
Stop.

356
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,500
Don’t bother.

357
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,583
I’ll leave you alone.

358
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,875
Bye-bye. Come on.

359
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,325
These are dresses I’ve kept for long.

360
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,166
A new LU dress.

361
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,583
LU’s designer Simon

362
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,083
has old grudges against Alex.

363
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:35,958
You want to get me in trouble?

364
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,166
What about a new Mumu dress?

365
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,041
That’s how Mumu’s SA tricked you?

366
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,708
Fine, then.

367
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:41,750
Pick one yourself.

368
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,000
I’ve made my decision.

369
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,291
I’ll wear a future international brand,

370
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:50,958
Cici.

371
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,175
It’s not appropriate for tonight, is it?

372
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,708
At Alex’s after-party,

373
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,000
most guys in the fashion circle
will be present.

374
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,750
Isn’t it a great chance

375
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,458
to present my design?

376
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:03,916
All right, then.

377
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,708
Anyway,

378
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,666
I won’t bother about what you wear.

379
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,541
However...

380
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,708
You must take this.

381
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:14,208
(Baichengbai Boutique Car Shop)

382
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,625
(Baichengbai Boutique Car Shop)
We look forward to your next visit.

383
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,416
- Miss.
- Thank you.

384
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,625
Lin Xiaoya,

385
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,125
you embezzled my money?

386
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,500
You have so little money.

387
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,875
I don’t want it.

388
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,791
I rent the limo for you

389
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:25,916
with 1,000 yuan per day.

390
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:26,916
To make you look rich.

391
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,250
I’ll later get the money back
from your profits.

392
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,541
No problem.

393
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,875
Good luck.

394
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,025
(One hour before the after-party)

395
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,416
It’s the first time
that I drive a Porsche.

396
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,625
Why is there such a challenge?

397
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:33,958
Sir.

398
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:35,833
Sir.

399
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,416
Sir, are you all right?

400
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,125
Are you hurt?

401
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,125
Sir?

402
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,500
Sir?

403
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,541
Are you all right, sir?

404
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,041
Are you okay?

405
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,541
Sir, are you hurt?

406
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:19,791
Don’t be scared.

407
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,791
I blew away the bad things.

408
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:33,666
Are you hurt?

409
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:38,083
I’m... I’m fine.

410
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,291
I’m sorry.

411
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,083
On such rainy days,

412
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,583
I always think of bad things.

413
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:44,625
I’m glad you’re all right.

414
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:45,291
I’m...

415
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,625
I’m so sorry.

416
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,708
I have something urgent to do.

417
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:49,791
I have to go somewhere.

418
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,500
How about this?

419
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,125
I’ll leave my contact number to you.

420
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,416
Call me if you feel anything wrong.

421
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,625
I...

422
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,208
Wait.

423
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,083
I don’t think

424
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,583
you can drive your car anymore.

425
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,791
Shall I drive you there?

426
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,166
Mr. Mo, you...

427
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:08,916
Her car broke down.

428
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:09,750
Take care of it.

429
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,500
Okay. I’ll get it towed.

430
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,500
Sorry to bother you.

431
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:23,800
I’m sorry.

432
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,291
Sorry for the trouble I brought you.

433
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,291
You didn’t.

434
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,291
You hit the car because of me.

435
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:31,875
Thank you.

436
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,625
Thank you so much.

437
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:00,500
Here I am.

438
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:01,875
You’re welcome.

439
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,916
May I have your phone number?

440
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,041
When your car is fixed,

441
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,333
I want to contact you.

442
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,150
Sure. Sure.

443
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,458
All right.

444
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,400
Thank you.

445
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:14,583
I gotta go, then.

446
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:19,916
Mr. Mo,

447
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,458
is she the girl
you’ve been looking for?

448
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:24,625
I don’t think

449
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,583
she still remembers me.

450
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,275
(ifc)

451
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,600
(Paris, France)
Hello, Xiwei.

452
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:45,916
Hello, Sichen.

453
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,041
Where are you?

454
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,583
I’m still in Paris.

455
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,041
Because of the weather problem,

456
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,125
I can’t make my trip back.

457
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,416
Let’s meet after you’re back, then.

458
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,075
Mm.

459
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,541
Looks like you need a new girl tonight.

460
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,375
Hello.

461
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,375
(MARRY ME)

462
00:20:11,725 --> 00:20:12,541
Look this way.

463
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:15,583
Sorry.

464
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:21,625
Sir, this way, please.

465
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:26,250
(MARRY ME)

466
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,333
I’m doomed.

467
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,625
What do I do?

468
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,541
It’ll be too late to fetch it.

469
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,875
Come on. I must follow someone in.

470
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,475
(Handsome, decent, having good taste)

471
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,250
I’ll pick him.

472
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,350
(MARRY ME)

473
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,225
I’m sorry.

474
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:44,416
Your...

475
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,125
Your invitation letter dropped.

476
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,708
Wait a second.

477
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,625
Your bow tie is a bit crooked.

478
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,050
Sorry.

479
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:02,171
Look this way.

480
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,458
Your invitation, please.

481
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,583
Okay. Come in, please.

482
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,375
I’m with him.

483
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,150
I’m... I’m sorry.

484
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,125
Mr. Zhang, long time no see.

485
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:44,791
Gao,

486
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,825
you’re just in time.

487
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:46,958
- Let me introduce him to you.
- Who’s this?

488
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,083
This is Mr. Chen.

489
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,541
Nice to meet you, Mr. Chen.

490
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,541
Where’s Alex?

491
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,333
Hello, Miss.

492
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:07,125
- You have a nice figure.
- Mrs. Huang, when did you come?

493
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,166
Shall we have a drink?

494
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,666
Sorry, but I’m waiting for someone.

495
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:11,958
Waiting for someone?

496
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,208
Where’s he, then?

497
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,708
If he isn’t here,

498
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,250
I can drink with you.

499
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,458
He’s over there.

500
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,333
Excuse me.

501
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,575
Oh.

502
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,575
You have a strong background.

503
00:22:27,775 --> 00:22:29,375
I have to count on you.

504
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,208
I mistook you as a friend of mine.

505
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,083
I’m sorry.

506
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,041
What kind of friend

507
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,333
made you run into my arms
at the first meeting?

508
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,541
That was an accident.

509
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:54,933
Hello.

510
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,375
Look this way.

511
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:01,166
You often come to this kind of party?

512
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,041
What?

513
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,708
Want to learn from me?

514
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,291
Hello, I interviewed you last time.

515
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,125
Do you remember?

516
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,450
Tell me.

517
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,416
Thank you. Thank you.

518
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,000
What do you think I am?

519
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,525
You?

520
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,833
I can’t tell the brand of your suit.

521
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,250
But you have good taste.

522
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,458
You don’t like to communicate,

523
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,250
but watch secretly.

524
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,208
You must be a serious man.

525
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,083
I guess you’re an overseas returnee

526
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,291
or a senior leader of a company.

527
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:34,500
Awesome. Awesome.

528
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:36,791
What about that man?

529
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:44,000
He’s the host of the party,

530
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,250
Mr. Alex.

531
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,925
Oh.

532
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:48,791
He’s Alex.

533
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,650
Mm.

534
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,958
I didn’t know
he was a veteran anime fan.

535
00:23:52,475 --> 00:23:53,541
Anime fan?

536
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,583
His sleeve buttons

537
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:57,666
and collar button

538
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,333
are Jump’s limited edition

539
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,875
for its 50th anniversary.

540
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,958
They were sold two years ago.

541
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,550
But he still wears them at the party.

542
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,333
He’s quite a veteran fan.

543
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,325
You had such careful observation.
Thank you.

544
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,400
No problem. No problem.

545
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,150
You’re welcome.

546
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,791
Hope you aren’t too stupid.

547
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,150
I really appreciate your works

548
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,125
on your last presentation,

549
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,375
especially the last piece.

550
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,250
I love it.

551
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,675
Hello, Mr. Alex.

552
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:29,250
Hello.

553
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,175
Your dress looks nice.

554
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,208
Who designed it?

555
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:38,791
Thank you.

556
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:40,583
I designed it myself.

557
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,291
We’re both designers, then.

558
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,333
No, not really.

559
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,625
I’m just a new designer.

560
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,375
I’m Gu Xixi.

561
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:54,700
Isn’t it Jump’s button
for its 50th anniversary?

562
00:24:56,075 --> 00:24:57,258
You recognized it.

563
00:24:57,975 --> 00:24:59,625
You’re the first one

564
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,375
to notice my special design tonight.

565
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,583
I am?

566
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:04,291
I think it’s easy to recognize it.

567
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:05,950
And your sleeve buttons.

568
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,750
Aren’t they the limited edition

569
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,000
for Jump’s 50th anniversary?

570
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,000
You observed so carefully.

571
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,708
Right.

572
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,875
Many people only observe
the surface part.

573
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,583
I didn’t expect you to know so much

574
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:22,666
about design styles.

575
00:25:23,225 --> 00:25:24,650
That’s rare.

576
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,625
I’m kind of showing off
in front of you.

577
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:31,800
After I give a speech,

578
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,375
may I have a word

579
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,041
with you?

580
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,425
You want it? That’ll be my honor.

581
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,525
Excuse me, Miss.

582
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,458
May I see your invitation?

583
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:48,916
What happened?

584
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,458
Sorry, Mr. Alex.

585
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,291
Someone reported to us

586
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:53,875
that this lady may not

587
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:54,791
have an invitation.

588
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:00,916
Miss, may I see your invitation?

589
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,625
My partner keeps it.

590
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,375
Where is he, then?

591
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,750
In the restroom, I guess.

592
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,291
Who’s he and what’s his name?

593
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,000
We have the information
about all guests.

594
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,583
We can confirm it.

595
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,250
Mm.

596
00:26:20,825 --> 00:26:21,913
What’s going on?

597
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,075
No idea.

598
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,900
Sorry, Mr. Alex.

599
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:28,125
Please excuse me.

600
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:28,950
Mm.

601
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,094
What’s going on?

602
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,958
You’re not on our guest list.

603
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:35,541
You can’t tell

604
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,333
who invited you to the party, either.

605
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,025
If you still don’t confess,

606
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:41,375
we have no choice,

607
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:43,708
but to call the police.

608
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,000
Give me five minutes. I’ll make a call.

609
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,541
I guess you need my help now.

610
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,325
It’s you?

611
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:25,333
You’re not too stupid.

612
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,916
Which series of Jump do you like best?

613
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:29,833
One Piece.

614
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:31,916
Which character do you like?

615
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:34,916
I think the lady on the second floor

616
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:36,791
came in without an invitation.

617
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:38,875
I get it.

618
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:45,583
So, you knew

619
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:47,041
I followed you into the party.

620
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,583
But now you’re here,

621
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,750
instead of exposing me.

622
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,708
It means you need my help, too,
don’t you?

623
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:57,500
Let me introduce myself.

624
00:27:58,583 --> 00:27:59,833
I’m Yin Sichen.

625
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,416
I’m Gu Xixi.

626
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:04,291
Hello, Miss Gu Xixi.

627
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:05,958
Get to the point.

628
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:07,666
What do you want from me?

629
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:08,916
I need a girl

630
00:28:08,916 --> 00:28:10,541
who Alex appreciates

631
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:11,875
to be my partner.

632
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:13,583
That’s all?

633
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:16,083
You earned the appreciation

634
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,791
from Alex just now.

635
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,425
So,

636
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:25,250
you deliberately told me

637
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,875
that Alex was an anime fan.

638
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,750
Cooperate with me

639
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,375
and I won’t sell you out.

640
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:36,208
Shame on you.

641
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,500
Are you going to confess?

642
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,458
Miss Gu Xixi,

643
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,125
will you help me?

644
00:28:49,725 --> 00:28:50,850
Mm.

645
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:57,958
Thank you for your responsibility.

646
00:28:58,675 --> 00:29:01,967
But your behaviors have annoyed me.

647
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:05,875
Let’s go.

648
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:09,291
Wait.

649
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,666
Hold my arm.

650
00:29:28,325 --> 00:29:29,041
You...

651
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,208
You... What...?

652
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,375
What do you want?

653
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:35,500
You need something.

654
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:42,500
Head down.

655
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:18,708
What’s this?

656
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,250
You don’t need to know.

657
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:27,458
Long time no see.

658
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:28,500
Yeah.

659
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:30,375
Mr. Alex.

660
00:30:35,975 --> 00:30:38,392
Miss Gu turns out
to be your partner, Mr. Yin.

661
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,875
No wonder she didn’t want to confess.

662
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,041
I didn’t see you tonight.

663
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,541
I thought you hadn’t come.

664
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:45,333
How come?

665
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:46,458
Our mall expects

666
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,583
to cooperate with you, Mr. Alex.

667
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:50,250
I’d certainly come to your party.

668
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:55,541
Miss Gu, why do you have this necklace?

669
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:58,833
I gave it to her.

670
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:00,458
Last year in Spain,

671
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:02,791
I saw it at an auction.

672
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,083
When I caught sight of it,

673
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,458
I thought it was perfect for Xixi.

674
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:09,250
Then I bought it for her.

675
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,350
Miss Gu, I didn’t know

676
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,225
you had the necklace.

677
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,875
Anything special about it?

678
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:21,625
My wife was a jewelry designer.

679
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:23,800
She designed this necklace

680
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:26,416
for our wedding anniversary.

681
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:28,583
After she passed away,

682
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:30,833
I sold the necklace at the auction

683
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:34,875
as she asked me to.

684
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,550
Miss Gu, I didn’t know

685
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,833
you would have it at last.

686
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:44,875
It sounds like

687
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,084
we’re destined to meet.

688
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:49,625
I have a personal favor.

689
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:51,416
Could we do me the favor?

690
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:53,916
I want Miss Gu to wear this necklace

691
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,000
and the new dress I designed

692
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:57,708
to go on the stage with me.

693
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,208
As respect to my deceased wife.

694
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:01,708
Me?

695
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:03,791
I...

696
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:05,000
Mr. Alex,

697
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,458
we’d like to lend the necklace to you.

698
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,833
But I think

699
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:13,125
it’s better to have a professional model

700
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,916
to perform on the stage.

701
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,791
I haven’t been on a stage before, but...

702
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:21,125
What?

703
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:22,666
Having a stomach ache again?

704
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:23,750
I...

705
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:25,958
If you feel sick, you can leave, Xixi.

706
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,083
Mr. Alex won’t blame you.

707
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:30,817
Mr. Alex,

708
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,041
I’m sorry to disappoint you.

709
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,250
Xixi is feeling unwell.

710
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,275
I’ll ask my driver
to drive her back home.

711
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,708
Miss Gu, take good care of yourself.

712
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:49,666
Wait. Wait.

713
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:53,375
Our deal isn’t over yet.

714
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:55,458
Didn’t you see

715
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:56,500
how Alex looked at me?

716
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:58,850
He just wanted me to put on the necklace

717
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,250
and stand on the stage
in the wedding dress he designed,

718
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,250
in memory of his deceased wife.

719
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:03,458
What’s the problem with that?

720
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:05,333
That’s not in my plan.

721
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:07,458
Your plan?

722
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,875
Your plan is

723
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:11,600
just to use his feelings
for his deceased wife

724
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,416
to get close to him.

725
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,833
My plan is to cooperate with him.

726
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,375
Besides, I don’t allow anyone

727
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:20,041
to disturb my plan.

728
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:23,583
You have no empathy, do you?

729
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:56,291
The ball is over.

730
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,575
If you don’t leave,

731
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:01,041
your pumpkin carriage
will turn back into a pumpkin.

732
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,350
How ungrateful you are!

733
00:34:16,475 --> 00:34:17,666
Hello? How is it going?

734
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:18,916
I managed to make Alex

735
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:20,166
get to know me.

736
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,475
Good job.

737
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:23,458
What about the wedding dress?

738
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,250
A conceited man

739
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,958
just made use of me.

740
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:28,166
But don’t worry.

741
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:30,458
I’ll think of a way
to get the wedding dress.

742
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,083
I’ll get it today.

743
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:35,300
Sounds like someone has stirred you up.

744
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:36,958
There’s fun to see.

745
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:37,833
Fei’ang,

746
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:39,916
tell the Law Department

747
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:41,875
to prepare the contract with Marry Me.

748
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:43,208
You’ve made it?

749
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,791
Not yet.

750
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,375
However,

751
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,333
he invited me to breakfast tomorrow.

752
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,825
Invited you to breakfast?

753
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:52,900
You just made it.

754
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:57,200
Let’s welcome Mr. Alex to give a speech.

755
00:35:02,825 --> 00:35:03,750
I’m very happy

756
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:05,333
to have you come

757
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:06,291
to this after-party.

758
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,575
Hello.

759
00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:08,250
- Hello.
- Today,

760
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,250
- I’m lucky to meet an interesting lady.
- I...

761
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:10,825
I...

762
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,708
- I lost the necklace.
- She reminded me of my deceased wife.

763
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:13,325
You lost your necklace?

764
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:13,925
Mm.

765
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:15,666
- She’s my source of inspiration.
- Come with me.

766
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:17,625
She’s also the reason

767
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:18,625
I created Marry Me.

768
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:21,375
Anyway, it’s a wonderful night.

769
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,375
Hope you’ll enjoy yourselves.

770
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,083
Mr. Alex,

771
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,500
this lady lost her necklace.

772
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:30,500
I’m sorry

773
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,625
to disturb you.

774
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,791
When this lady was in the restroom,

775
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,475
she accidentally lost her necklace.

776
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,300
If anyone picked it up,

777
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:39,666
please give it to her.

778
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,541
Maybe some kind guy picked it up for me.

779
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,291
Xixi.

780
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:44,500
Mm?

781
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,916
You went to the restroom in a rush

782
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:48,300
and left the necklace to me.
You don’t remember?

783
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,166
I did?

784
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:55,666
I had such a poor memory.

785
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,450
In this way,

786
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,500
it was just a misunderstanding.
It’s okay now.

787
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:10,833
Sorry, Mr. Alex.

788
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,458
From now on,

789
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,166
I’ll keep this necklace very carefully.

790
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,500
It occurs to me

791
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,416
that nothing is perfect
for this necklace,

792
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,666
but a Marry Me wedding dress.

793
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:23,583
But I hear it’s hard to buy one.

794
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,775
May I buy one from you?

795
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:27,083
No problem.

796
00:36:27,725 --> 00:36:29,625
I live in Room 3303 of this hotel.

797
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,500
Visit me at any time
if you’re free tomorrow.

798
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,083
I’m so grateful.

799
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:37,541
Hope you’ll enjoy the wonderful night.

800
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,416
I’ll leave you alone.

801
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:40,200
Mm.

802
00:36:55,575 --> 00:36:56,791
May I dance with you?

803
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:00,625
I’m leaving.

804
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,625
If I’m not,

805
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,291
my pumpkin carriage will be gone.

806
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:06,291
Now that you’re back,

807
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:09,458
leave until you handle the awful mess.

808
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:35,333
Do you know your unauthorized action

809
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:37,625
would be very risky?

810
00:37:38,575 --> 00:37:40,075
You’ve got what you want.

811
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,500
I’ve got mine.

812
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:44,458
We had quite nice cooperation.

813
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,666
It’s not time to celebrate yet.
