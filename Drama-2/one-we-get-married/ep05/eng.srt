57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,041
The two rooms are connected.

58
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,125
But unless I have to get some clothes,

59
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:52,791

Don’t worry.

61
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,207
You owe this cloakroom.

62
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,000
But don’t mess with my stuff.

63
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,707
Who wants to mess with your stuff?

64
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,125
Little Fortune,

65
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,250
this is where we’ll sleep.

66
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,666
Why did you put it on the bed?

67
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,791
It’s my pet.

68
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,082
Its name is Little Fortune.

69
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,300
Any problem?

70
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,625
Poor taste.

71
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:16,708
So do you.

72
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,625
Don’t be angry, Little Fortune.

73
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,625
(Venice)

74
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,958
(Jumeimh)

75
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:26,625
Here.

76
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:30,825
(President Yin Sichen of Why-Mall
got married.)

77
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,450
Come on.

78
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,525
Give it to me.

79
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,500
We’re here on vacation.

80
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,165
I’m here on vacation.

81
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,790
You’re taking advantage of me.

82
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,125
We made a deal

83
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,915
that you took care of our son at home.

84
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,250
Why did you come to me?

85
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,583
Over so many years,

86
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,750
you only flatter me

87
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,583
when you have done

88
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,790
something wrong.

89
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,290
You!

90
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,915
Fine. Get to the point.

91
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,083
Shang Ke,

92
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,915
how did Gu Xixi and Sichen
get to know each other?

93
00:05:12,915 --> 00:05:14,040
How long have they known each other?

94
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:17,165
I really don’t know

95
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:18,500
how they got to know each other.

96
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,333
For less than one month,
according to Sichen.

97
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:24,625
Less than one month?

98
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,500
What does Gu Xixi do?

99
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,000
She runs an online store.

100
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,375
When we met her last time,

101
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,458
she was breaking up
with her ex-boyfriend.

102
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,250
I took a photo of them.

103
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,833
Do you still keep it?

104
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,583
The photo? On my phone, I think.

105
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,050
Let me check.

106
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:40,600
Mm.

107
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:43,790
Here it is.

108
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,250
Her ex-boyfriend looks good, actually.

109
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:56,583
I see.

110
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,125
(Wedding of Yin Sichen and Gu Xixi,
Hope every Jack has his Jill.)

111
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,025
(Wish they would grow old together,
Wedding of Yin Sichen and Gu Xixi.)

112
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,475
Wow.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,458
It’s such a big cloakroom,

114
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,540
but with only a few clothes.

115
00:06:32,915 --> 00:06:34,250
What a waste of space!

116
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,415
What kind of man
put such a big self-portrait

117
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:44,875
in his cloakroom?

118
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,540
How narcissistic!

119
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,625
I forgot you were here.

120
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,665
Sorry.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,790
I didn’t see anything.

122
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,708
I didn’t see anything.

123
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,100
Good night,

124
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,875
Little Fortune.

125
00:07:59,083 --> 00:07:59,708
Yin Sichen,

126
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
how immoral you are!

127
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,583
When you make such a big noise,

128
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,583
how can I fall asleep?

129
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:05,500
98.

130
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,750
99.

131
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:09,750
100.

132
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,500
I have severe insomnia.

133
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,165
Effective exercise promotes sleep.

134
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,583
It doesn’t work, though.

135
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:20,915
But when I’m lucky,

136
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,625
I can get some sleep
for two or three hours.

137
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,290
So,

138
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,083
you spend the time exercising

139
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,250
while others spent it sleeping?

140
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:33,750
Gu Xixi, I’m warning you.

141
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,583
Never have illusions about my body.

142
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,208
Yin Sichen,

143
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,333
do you know why you can’t fall asleep?

144
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,333
Because you have too many evil thoughts.

145
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:03,150
Fine.

146
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,375
I’ll stay in the study for tonight.

147
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,791
Wait.

148
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:18,000
I thought about it.

149
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,625
It’s our first day of marriage.

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,541
If you spend the night in the study,

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,166
they’ll find out the truth.

152
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,750
I’m considering it for your own good.

153
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,500
You’re asking to sleep with me?

154
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,375
In your dream!

155
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:30,875
Let’s sleep in different places.

156
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:38,500
Go sleep over there.

157
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,875
You don’t need the bed, anyway.

158
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,625
Yin Sichen, you know what?

159
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,625
We’ve signed a contract.

160
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,333
If you do this, I can sue you.

161
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,083
I decide if I sleep.

162
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,625
But the bed is mine.

163
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,000
What are you doing?

164
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,083
You win.

165
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:33,525
The earth is round, like an orange.

166
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,875
Ursula lost her patience.

167
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,475
If you have to go crazy,

168
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:38,875
please go crazy all by yourself.

169
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,166
Why must you read it out?

170
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,833
I have to read it out.

171
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,416
You don’t sleep, anyway.

172
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,291
You sound like a pupil who can’t read.

173
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,250
She shouted.

174
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,041
But don’t try to put your gypsy ideas

175
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,250
into the heads of the children.

176
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,875
José Arcadio Buendía, impassive,

177
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,208
did not let himself be frightened
by the desperation of his wife,

178
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,041
who, in a seizure of rage,
mashed the astrolabe against the floor.

179
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,541
He built another one,

180
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,416
he gathered the men of the village
in his little room,

181
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,000
and demonstrated to them, with theories
that none of them could understand,

182
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,500
the possibility of returning
to where one had set out

183
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,208
by consistently sailing east.

184
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,875
The whole village was convinced that

185
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,375
José Arcadio Buendía

186
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,000
had lost his reason,

187
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,458
when Melquíades returned...

Yin Sichen,

208
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,458
what’s wrong with you?

209
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,083
I fell asleep last night?

210
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,500
You’re not sleepless at all.

211
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,375
You fell asleep in seconds.

212
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:52,583
I’m indeed sleepless.

213
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,541
Maybe my reading made you sleepy.

214
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:58,875
I used to read books,

215
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,208
but it didn’t work as well as this.

216
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,666
You think it’s my fault?

217
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,009
Read for me tonight.

218
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,475
Mm?

219
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,500
You’re one hour later than usual.

220
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,958
It’s not your style.

221
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,291
I overslept.

222
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,208
Did the doctor give you

223
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,208
any efficient sleeping pills?

224
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,375
No idea.

225
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,208
When I accompanied Gu Xixi last night,

226
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,208
I fell asleep.

227
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:29,833
Accompanied her?

228
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,750
Did you really sleep with her?

229
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,458
Don’t talk nonsense.

230
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,166
We only slept in the same room.

231
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,250
I didn’t expect you
to accompany anyone while sleeping.

232
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:41,583
Shut up.

233
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:42,875
Call for the meeting.

234
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,750
Miss Bride, you got up so early?

235
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,041
Just get to the point.

236
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,875
Our online store is closed down,

237
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,375
for three months.

238
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,208
Lin Xiaoya, what did you do?

239
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,541
Nothing.

240
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,000
The customer service said

241
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,625
we broke the rule

242
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,475
and sold a virtual item.

243
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,416
I see.

244
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,650
It’s the dress we sold.

245
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,500
Three months?

246
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,958
I’ll have nothing to eat.

247
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,208
Now you’re Yin Sichen’s wife.

248
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,083
I’ll have nothing to eat, instead.

249
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:31,916
What did you say?

250
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,000
Say it again.

251
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,541
What?

252
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,291
- Say it again.
- I said,

253
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,333
I would have nothing to eat.

254
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,708
You’re Yin Sichen’s wife

255
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,958
and you wouldn’t have nothing to eat.

256
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,875
Yes, yes.

257
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Why do you look so happy?

258
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,875
What a toxic friend!

259
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:44,791
Xiaoya, calm down.

260
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,625
Listen to me.

261
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:48,075
I...

262
00:14:49,175 --> 00:14:51,250
I’m Yin Sichen’s wife.

263
00:14:56,675 --> 00:14:57,450
Mm.

264
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,500
(Wenye Group)
I signed the contract with Yin Sichen.

265
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,075
(Wenye Group)
It’s reasonable to make use of him, right?

266
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:08,791
It is.

267
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:10,825
Excuse me.

268
00:15:10,825 --> 00:15:12,791
I’d like to see the director
of the Store Department.

269
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,725
Hello.

270
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:15,058
Do you have an appointment?

271
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,875
Appointment?

272
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:18,791
Hello.

273
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:19,708
This is

274
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,333
President Yin Sichen’s wife,

275
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,475
Gu Xixi.

276
00:15:23,475 --> 00:15:24,708
We forgot to make an appointment.

277
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,291
I wonder if we can meet

278
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,975
the director of the Store Department?

279
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:28,625
Sorry,

280
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,791
but we have rules.

281
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:30,791
Whoever comes

282
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:31,791
has to make an appointment.

283
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,583
Even Yin Sichen’s title can’t help.

284
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,416
Yeah.

285
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,083
It doesn’t help at all.

286
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,375
Xixi?

287
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,000
Mr. Mo?

288
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,208
Senior Mo?

289
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:45,916
Why are you here?

290
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:46,875
I work here.

291
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,208
What a coincidence!

292
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,500
What brings you here?

293
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,175
We’re here to see
the director of the Store Department.

294
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:53,000
Mm.

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,541
Now that you work here,

296
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,208
do you know him?

297
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,750
Not really.

298
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,750
But I can contact him for you.

299
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,500
Come with me.

300
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,083
Thank you.

301
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,075
You’re welcome.

302
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:09,958
He’s Mo Zixin you mentioned?

303
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,791
Yeah.

304
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,375
Nice.

305
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,625
He’s as cool as Yin Sichen.

306
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,041
Lin Xiaoya,

307
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,416
are you being boy-crazy again?

308
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,291
Your mouth is even watering.

309
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:21,833
Let’s go.

310
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:23,875
Here.

311
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,250
Senior,

312
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,083
this is a little problem.

313
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,750
Do we need to bother your president?

314
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,458
Yeah.

315
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,000
Don’t worry.

316
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,083
He’s at a meeting now.

317
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:32,916
He won’t know you’re here.

318
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:33,958
It’s okay. It’s okay.

319
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,291
What would you like to drink?
I’ll go get some.

320
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,250
Take your seats.

321
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,375
But Senior...

322
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,583
Is it appropriate?

323
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,025
Wow.

324
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:49,166
The president has good taste.

325
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,650
He likes abstractionism.

326
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,958
We learned about it
in the art class in college.

327
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:54,666
It’s quite expensive.

328
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:55,775
- It is?
- Mm.

329
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,583
It’s a Franz Kline’s painting.

330
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,750
Here.

331
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,125
Be seated.

332
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:06,975
Oh.

333
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:09,875
Are we...?

334
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:10,458
Mr. Mo,

335
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,041
this is the meeting arrangement
for this afternoon.

336
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,375
Mr. Mo?

337
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,500
Well...

338
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,700
What...? What shall we call him?

339
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,625
- Mr. Mo.
- Mr. Mo.

340
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,416
I still want you to call me Senior.

341
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:23,833
I didn’t expect you

342
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,125
to be the president of Wenye Group.

343
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:26,833
I...

344
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,916
You came

345
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,125
for the Store Department?

346
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:33,708
Yes.

347
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,416
You know what?

348
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,208
We have an online store on your platform

349
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,625
and it’s closed down
for three months.

350
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,208
So, we came to see

351
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,541
if we could do anything
to solve this problem.

352
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,208
Yunong,

353
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,291
did you hear her?

354
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,041
Go have it handled.

355
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:45,708
Okay.

356
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,750
Sorry to bother you
with such a little problem.

357
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,291
We’re sorry.

358
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,333
It’s noon.

359
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,333
Shall I invite you to lunch?

360
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,500
- No.
- Why not?

361
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,333
I’ve got something else to do.

362
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,416
Enjoy lunch without me.

363
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,083
No...

364
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,708
Xiaoya,

365
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,250
we’ve something to do together.

366
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:04,750
Don’t you remember?

367
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,291
Gu Xixi,

368
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,166
online store...

369
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,041
Our store...

370
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,791
Come on! We count on you.

371
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:10,125
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

372
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,125
Come on! Come on!

373
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,250
Your friend is funny.

374
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,041
Senior,

375
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,666
shall I invite you to lunch?

376
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,083
Grandma,

377
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,083
this is

378
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,000
the bag

379
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,291
you asked me to have customized.

380
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,625
It was delivered to me today.

381
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,083
I came quickly to give it to you.

382
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,333
It’s quite a nice bag.

383
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:31,291
Good.

384
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:32,541
Good.

385
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,541
I asked

386
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,750
a friend of mine in France

387
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:36,500
to have it made

388
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,625
by the most famous artisan Barrett.

389
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,375
He praised your design.

390
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,458
He said the bag you designed

391
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,083
was simple and nice,

392
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,958
and looked as good as luxury bags.

393
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,666
I thought about the design

394
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,850
and then painted it.

395
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,291
This bag

396
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,791
can be unique in the world.

397
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,075
It’s one and only.

398
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,166
Xiwei,

399
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,916
thank you so much.

400
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,541
I’m glad you like it.

401
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,833
I’m sure Xixi will like the bag.

402
00:19:13,225 --> 00:19:14,525
Xixi?

403
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,775
Mm.

404
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,958
This is a gift for her.

405
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,675
Xiwei,

406
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:24,416
I think the bag is perfect for Xixi.

407
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,500
Your guest has come.

408
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,875
Get him to my office.

409
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,916
All right.

410
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,958
Sir, please come with me.

411
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:40,541
By the way,

412
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,166
I called you the other day,

413
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,083
but it didn’t get through.

414
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,250
I was worried if you were in trouble.

415
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,083
You called me?

416
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:46,775
Mm.

417
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:47,500
What for?

418
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,083
Nothing.

419
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:50,916
It’s been solved.

420
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:52,708
I’m glad you’re all right.

421
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,416
Actually,

422
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,375
I have something to ask you.

423
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:00,925
Mm.

424
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,250
Why did you suddenly become Mrs. Yin?

425
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,000
What exactly happened?

426
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,708
I didn’t expect that, either.

427
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,350
It happened unexpectedly.

428
00:20:14,225 --> 00:20:15,208
You get it, don’t you?

429
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:15,708
I mean,

430
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,416
love...

431
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,416
Love came unexpectedly.

432
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,208
I lost my mind immediately.

433
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,708
Then I got a flash marriage.

434
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,208
I get it.

435
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:27,333
I get it.

436
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,333
Oh,

437
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,675
I was on a business some days ago.

438
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:32,166
Mm.

439
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,075
I bought a gift for you.

440
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:34,850
What is it?

441
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:36,225
Here.

442
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:37,825
What’s this?

443
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:38,458
Thank you.

444
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,175
Kalian 5277?

445
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:46,725
Mm.

446
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:47,916
Thank you, Senior.

447
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:48,500
Oh my God.

448
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,250
I was looking for it for a long time,

449
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,208
but always failed.

450
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,083
How did you get it?

451
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,916
I do online business.

452
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,750
One of my clients sells this.

453
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,625
Then I bought it.

454
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,583
I wonder if you like it.

455
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,291
I love it.

456
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,291
Thank you, Senior.

457
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:03,500
Tell me.

458
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,708
Tell me whatever you want.

459
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,583
As long as I can help,

460
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,333
I’ll give it to you.

461
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,091
You will?

462
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:07,575
Mm.

463
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,000
So,

464
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,541
if you really want to thank me,

465
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,875
I want you to draw a painting

466
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,083
in this color.

467
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,875
Sure.

468
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:15,583
No problem.

469
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,333
That’d be great.

470
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:21,500
By the way,

471
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,416
now that you’re Mrs. Yin,

472
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,708
will our art lessons...?

473
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,458
They won’t be influenced.

474
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,041
We can continue.

475
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,166
I owe you that.

476
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,083
I must pay you back.

477
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,541
Also, don’t call me Mrs. Yin

478
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,708
or Madam Yin,

479
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,083
I’m not used to that.

480
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,791
Call me Xixi.

481
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,458
Miss Gu, you’re back.

482
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:48,541
Grandma,

483
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,166
why are you still here?

484
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,333
Xixi.

485
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:52,300
Mm.

486
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,125
Where were you?

487
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,708
I’ve been waiting for you the whole day.

488
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,416
I’m sorry, Grandma.

489
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,833
I went to see a friend.

490
00:21:59,166 --> 00:21:59,750
Be seated.

491
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,000
Okay.

492
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,416
What’s this, Grandma?

493
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,125
It’s a gift for you.

494
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,041
Open it and check.

495
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:12,875
Come on.

496
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,041
Grandma,

497
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:15,625
thank you.

498
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,250
Why did you buy me a gift?

499
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,291
What a nice bag!

500
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,500
It must be very expensive.

501
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,041
If you want to thank me,

502
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,916
try harder and harder

503
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,958
so that I’ll have a great-grandson soon.

504
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:36,500
Grandma,

505
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,541
why did you bring it up again?

506
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:39,708
Since Sichen was back,

507
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,083
he’s been waiting for you.

508
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,250
He looks angry.

509
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,125
Let me teach you a little trick.

510
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,083
If he’s angry,

511
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:53,708
play games with him

512
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,125
and concede to him.

513
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:56,916
When he wins,

514
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,666
he’ll no longer be angry.

515
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:01,725
I’ll keep that in mind.

516
00:23:01,725 --> 00:23:02,500
- Gu Xixi.
- Mm.

517
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,625
Come to my study.

518
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,250
Boss,

519
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:12,916
what do you want?

520
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,416
Call me Darling at home.

521
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,041
Yin Sichen,

522
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,458
don’t push it.

523
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,458
If someone hears you

524
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:20,625
and you give us away,

525
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,625
you’ll have to pay for it.

526
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,166
Darling.

527
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,583
You went to Wenye Group today?

528
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,625
You even knew that?

529
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:31,791
Thanks to you,

530
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,125
I kept answering calls the whole day.

531
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,500
Anything wrong?

532
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,750
I went there cautiously.

533
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,250
I don’t think I was noticed.

534
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,916
So, you indeed met Mo Zixin secretly?

535
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,475
I indeed met him,

536
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,083
but not secretly.

537
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,625
I met him frankly.

538
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,541
This is the last chance
you make a mistake.

539
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,458
Make another mistake
and I’ll fire you.

540
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:57,800
Then you’ll have to pay.

541
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,750
How did you get to know Mo Zixin?

542
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,041
What’s your relationship with him?

543
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,041
For your information, Boss...

544
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,291
Call me Darling.

545
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,125
For your information, Darling,

546
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,333
Mo Zixin and I met in middle school.

547
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,458
He was my senior.

548
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:12,458
Today,

549
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,166
I visited Wenye Group
to unlock my online store,

550
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:14,875
only to find that

551
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,666
he was the president of Wenye Group.

552
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:17,375
Then,

553
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,208
we had lunch together.

554
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:18,750
All right?

555
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,708
That’s true?

556
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,000
Absolutely true.

557
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:24,375
By the way,

558
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,666
this is the bag Grandma gave me.

559
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:28,875
It’s too expensive.

560
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:29,625
According to the contract,

561
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:30,458
I’m giving it to you.

562
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,416
Grandma gave it to you.

563
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:32,791
Keep it.

564
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,375
You’ll deduct the money
from my pay, right?

565
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,375
Gu Xixi,

566
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,916
don’t forget I’m still angry with you.

567
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:44,166
If he’s angry,

568
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:45,791
play games with him

569
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:47,083
and concede to him.

570
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:48,500
When he wins,

571
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:50,375
he’ll no longer be angry.

572
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,500
Shall I play games with you?

573
00:24:58,541 --> 00:24:59,125
Can you?

574
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,083
Come on.

575
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,075
K.O.

576
00:25:07,825 --> 00:25:08,583
I won.

577
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,291
No way.

578
00:25:16,275 --> 00:25:17,333
- I’m screwed.
- No way.

579
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,625
I was enjoying the game so much

580
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,041
that I forgot to let him win.

581
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:22,791
I quit.

582
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:23,458
Wait.

583
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:24,125
Let’s play another round.

584
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,125
The last round.

585
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,416
Boring.

586
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:27,208
You’re afraid to lose?

587
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:32,958
Come on.

588
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:49,333
Did you pretend you lost?

589
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,541
You... You’re awesome.

590
00:25:53,975 --> 00:25:54,708
K.O.

591
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:55,250
Nice!

592
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:07,083
I mistook you for Shang Ke.

593
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:11,541
Are we done?

594
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,166
I’m going to sleep.

595
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:15,333
Go have a bath

596
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,041
and sleep with me...

597
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:21,750
Accompany me

598
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,833
when I sleep.

599
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,458
Okay.

600
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:54,500
No problem.

601
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,375
Who is she calling?

602
00:26:57,525 --> 00:26:58,833
- She’s smiling so widely.
- Mm. Fine.

603
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,416
Okay.

604
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,166
Okay.

605
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,541
Who were you calling?

606
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,458
A client.

607
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:09,583
Client?

608
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:10,500
But you smiled so widely.

609
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:11,666
Which client?

610
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,458
We have so many clients.

611
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,541
Who do you know?

612
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,416
You only know Yin Sichen, don’t you?

613
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,125
I... I’ve known three clients.

614
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,041
Well,

615
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,050
however busy you are,
you have to eat.

616
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:27,708
Right?

617
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:29,791
I’ve found a new restaurant nearby.

618
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:30,541
It’s a great restaurant.

619
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:31,333
I booked a table.

620
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:32,875
Let’s go have dinner there tonight,

621
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:34,833
as the reward for your hard work
in recent months.

622
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,291
I had an appointment with a client.

623
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,583
Let’s take a rain check.

624
00:27:43,325 --> 00:27:44,050
Mm.

625
00:27:44,825 --> 00:27:45,958
Let’s keep discussing the contract.

626
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,808
All right.

627
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,333
This is the contract
for our cooperation.

628
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,166
Please review it.

629
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,125
According to our Law Department...

630
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,416
Isn’t he the playboy Mark

631
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:05,416
Xiaoxin mentioned last time?

632
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:06,125
We have

633
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,600
- What does he want?
- made the biggest concession.

634
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,500
Miss Ruona,

635
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:12,916
let’s not talk about business today.

636
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,166
You mean...?

637
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:16,750
Miss Mu,

638
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:18,951
(To love and to be loved is)
I don’t want our relationship

639
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:19,625
(the greatest happiness of existence)
I don’t want our relationship

640
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:21,750
to be stuck in business only.

641
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:23,541
What’s this?

642
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:25,375
I want more

643
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:28,125
of a private date.

644
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:30,541
This is a gift.

645
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:31,375
Please accept it.

646
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,333
He even gave her a gift?

647
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:36,083
But,

648
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,500
I come for business cooperation
on behalf of our company.

649
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,875
Also, I have a boyfriend.

650
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:45,291
Why do I know that

651
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,708
you’re still single?

652
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,416
Because of some reasons,

653
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:50,208
I haven’t made it public yet.

654
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:52,958
It must be office romance.

655
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,041
In such a secret relationship,

656
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,100
you must have suffered a lot.

657
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,083
Thanks for reminding me.

658
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:01,708
I’ll take care.

659
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,083
Miss Mu,

660
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,208
I have a true love for you.

661
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:06,500
Also,

662
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:07,958
I feel sorry for you.

663
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,291
What do you want to do?

664
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:13,291
Shang...

665
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,333
- Who are you?
- Mr. Shang?

666
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,200
Shang Ke.

667
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,958
All you all right?

668
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,208
Yes.

669
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,541
How would I not be all right?

670
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:32,083
You know what?

671
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:33,583
When I started to fight,
he was still in kindergarten.

672
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:34,583
Why didn’t you punch him?

673
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,083
I was trying to save you.

674
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:36,833
Let’s go to the hospital.

675
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,083
Hospital?

676
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,416
It hurts. It hurts.

677
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:51,583
Hello, Mom.

678
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,875
Calm down.

679
00:29:58,333 --> 00:29:59,291
I’ll be right there.

680
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:01,333
Bye-bye.

681
00:30:05,775 --> 00:30:06,583
I’m warning you.

682
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,666
Pay all the rent today,

683
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:09,958
or you have to close your laundry.

684
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,791
Ms. Fatty, I’ve rented
this place for years.

685
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,500
Give me three days, please.

686
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,958
I’ll get the money for you.

687
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,416
You keep postponing it.

688
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:20,041
What happened?

689
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:21,750
Your mother hasn’t paid the rent.

690
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:22,916
She owed me the rent for a year.

691
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:24,583
I’ll pay. How much?

692
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:25,750
You will?

693
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,325
Mm.

694
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:26,958
Pay the annual rent.

695
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:27,541
96,000 yuan.

696
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:29,750
Fine.

697
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,625
How about this?

698
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,250
I’ll transfer it to you.

699
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:34,083
But I need a few days.

700
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,625
Within a week.

701
00:30:37,075 --> 00:30:38,208
That’s the deadline.

702
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,425
Thank you.

703
00:30:39,425 --> 00:30:40,000
All right.

704
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,000
Thank you, Ms. Fatty.

705
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,041
Mom,

706
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:46,708
what happened?

707
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:48,416
When I got married,

708
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:49,583
you were given some money as betrothal.

709
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:50,833
It’s enough for the rent.

710
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:53,958
Well,

711
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,083
I bought a dryer.

712
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:58,333
And washing... Dryer...

713
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,625
Mom,

714
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:03,750
did Grandma take the money?

715
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,750
Your father and grandma took the money.

716
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:13,375
Your father wanted it
for shop investment.

717
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:14,625
Your grandma wanted it
for health products.

718
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:15,833
How could I say no?

719
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,750
They were going too far.

720
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:18,958
Mom, come on.

721
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:20,541
Why do you keep giving them money?

722
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:21,600
Xixi,

723
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:22,275
Mm?

724
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,291
How about closing the laundry?

725
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:27,083
No way.

726
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,333
How can we close it?

727
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,166
Isn’t it your hope?

728
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:33,166
Over so many years,

729
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,333
many regular customers
have been your friends.

730
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,416
Do you really want to close it?

731
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,166
Don’t worry, Mom.

732
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:42,291
I’ll take care of it.

733
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,625
What? Still hurts?

734
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:53,500
Mm.

735
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:55,333
No, it doesn’t.

736
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,916
Take a rest at home.

737
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:01,541
I’ll take care of the company.

738
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,666
Thank you, then.

739
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:04,958
I’ll leave you alone.

740
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,291
So quickly?

741
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:08,666
I...

742
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:11,000
What?

743
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,666
I want some water.

744
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:14,416
Get some yourself.

745
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,166
But I’m hurt.

746
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:17,583
Your right hand is hurt.

747
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:18,458
You still have your left hand.

748
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,583
Anyway,

749
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,375
I was hurt for you.

750
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,791
Are you really so merciless?

751
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,500
When you wanted to help a girl,

752
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,916
you should at least practice Kungfu.

753
00:32:33,475 --> 00:32:34,225
Mm.

754
00:32:34,425 --> 00:32:37,259
Before working as a model,

755
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,958
Mark was a professional
taekwondo athlete.

756
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:45,666
I was disgraced, wasn’t I?

757
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,500
No.

758
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:49,291
You were at least brave.

759
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:53,291
Anyway,

760
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,291
what did he meet you for?

761
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:56,541
He confessed to me.

762
00:32:58,166 --> 00:32:59,208
What?

763
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,416
You know what?

764
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:03,125
He’s a playboy.

765
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,000
Don’t ever trust him.

766
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:06,666
Do you think I will?

767
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,000
That makes sense.

768
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:09,166
I’m so handsome

769
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,208
and honey-lipped.

770
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,083
But you still turn me down.

771
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:11,916
He won’t get you, either.

772
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,708
By the way,

773
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:16,875
why were you there today?

774
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,083
I...

775
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:20,083
I was just passing by.

776
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:20,958
Passing by?

777
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:21,900
Mm.

778
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:24,291
Having lunch with your junior again?

779
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:27,333
No.

780
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:27,916
I...

781
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,916
I went there for you.

782
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:35,750
You know.

783
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,166
I adore you.

784
00:33:39,775 --> 00:33:40,541
Do you...?

785
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,291
Do you have no feeling for me?

786
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:51,458
Not yet.

787
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,083
Why?

788
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,500
You’re my boss.

789
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:07,125
I can hardly treat you as a boyfriend.

790
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:08,583
Also, I’m here to work.

791
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,166
I don’t want other trouble.

792
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:18,666
All right.

793
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,041
Don’t overthink.

794
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,583
Stay at home for a good rest.

795
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,166
It’s not convenient for you
to work these days.

796
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:25,333
If there’s any problem,

797
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,291
I’ll come to see you.

798
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,333
I gotta go.

799
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:30,333
Wait.

800
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:32,291
There’s a spare key
under the doorway.

801
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:34,750
You can come in next time.

802
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:49,833
She doesn’t like me yet.

803
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:52,275
But she may like me later.

804
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:54,791
Shang Ke, come on!

805
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,167
Xixi.

806
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:07,675
Mm.

807
00:35:07,675 --> 00:35:08,425
What?

808
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,708
You don’t like the dishes?

809
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,250
No, Grandma.

810
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:14,333
The dishes taste great.

811
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:20,500
Xixi.

812
00:35:20,675 --> 00:35:21,275
Mm?

813
00:35:21,275 --> 00:35:25,083
Are you quarreling with Sichen lately?

814
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,666
No, Grandma.

815
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:30,666
I don’t mean

816
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:34,041
to ask about your privacy.

817
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:36,041
Earlier this day,

818
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,750
I passed your bedroom

819
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,875
and saw a rocking chair
beside Sichen’s bed,

820
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,416
with a pillow and blanket on it.

821
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:47,333
Xixi,

822
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:49,833
if Xixi bullies you,

823
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,125
tell me.

824
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:52,750
I’ll defend you.

825
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:57,166
But at night,

826
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,458
you mustn’t sleep separately.

827
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,750
You’re newly married.

828
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:04,500
It’ll hurt your feelings.

829
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:08,750
You get it wrong, Grandma.

830
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:11,875
We played a game yesterday.

831
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,875
The loser had to sleep
on the rocking chair.

832
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:17,708
You did?

833
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:18,708
Yes, yes.

834
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:20,166
You must have suffered.

835
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,125
Look.

836
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,875
You’re a beautiful girl,

837
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,583
but you have to accompany me every day.

838
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,375
No, Grandma.

839
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,708
If you have a baby early,

840
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,916
you don’t need to bother.

841
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:37,750
Are you all right?

842
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:38,875
Yes.

843
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:39,958
Are you all right, Xixi?

844
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:41,875
What?

845
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:44,333
I’m fine, Grandma.

846
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,625
Why isn’t Sichen back yet?

847
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,916
He’s preparing for tomorrow’s meeting.

848
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:54,208
Madam Song.

849
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:54,750
Yes.

850
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,041
What’s up, my lady?

851
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,125
Have some soup made

852
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,375
and have it sent to Sichen’s company.

853
00:36:59,475 --> 00:37:00,125
Okay.

854
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:03,000
Grandma,

855
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:04,458
let me deliver the soup

856
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:05,791
to Sichen.

857
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:13,500
For the May 18th Activity,

858
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:14,708
according to the Marketing Department,

859
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:16,875
we’ll have a 10% to 15% profits

860
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:19,208
more than that of previous years.

861
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:20,708
The PR Department will handle

862
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:22,041
the further activities.

863
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:24,500
This is the soup from Mrs. Yin.

864
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,125
She said

865
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:26,333
she would go home with you
when you got off work

866
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:27,916
and wouldn’t disturb you now.

867
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,125
What did she do again

868
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,250
to make her obedient?

869
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:35,675
Fine.

870
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:38,041
Ask her to wait for me out there.

871
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:38,700
