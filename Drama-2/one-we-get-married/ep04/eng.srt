Let’s get married.

24
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,458
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,416
I think my pronunciation is good enough.

26
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,166
I said let’s get married.

27
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,208
Yin Sichen.

28
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:51,750
Are you nuts?

29
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,041
Don’t go.

30
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,625
Here is a prenuptial agreement.

31
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:56,833
We only need to be married
for three months.

32
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,541
Three months later, we’ll get divorced,

33
00:01:58,958 --> 00:01:59,541
and you will

34
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,916
get hefty compensation.

35
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,041
You mean a fake marriage?

36
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,541
But according to the law,

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,250
we need to get a real marriage license.

38
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:08,541
Yin Sichen.

39
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:10,325
I think you are not just nuts.

40
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:11,625
You are simply hopeless.

41
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:15,125
Gu Xixi.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,375
You have to marry me.

43
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,500
Get off me.

44
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:19,791
Freak.

45
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:34,916
Mr. Shang.

46
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,957
You will
go to the team-building party, right?

47
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,041
Yes.

48
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,750
Aren’t you also going with us?

49
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,875
Tell me

50
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,916
who will be there.

51
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,666
Mr. Wang of the Commerce Department,

52
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,041
Jimmy from the Planning Department,

53
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:51,125
and some models
we worked with a lot of times,

54
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,916
like Lindy,

55
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:53,541
Zheng Ruixuan,

56
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,375
and Mark.

57
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,375
Hold on.

58
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,100
Mark?

59
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,832
Yeah.

60
00:02:57,832 --> 00:02:58,666
The one who was voted by women

61
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,582
as the most popular male model
of the year.

62
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:01,166
- Every week, he changes three...
- Wait.

63
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,125
Enough. Enough.

64
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,707
I know it. I know it very well.

65
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:04,425
He...

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Just tell me the time and the place.

67
00:03:08,707 --> 00:03:09,916
Hello, your package.

68
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:10,750
Coming.

69
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,125
Hello.

70
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,916
Tell her you are Alex’s assistant.

71
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,457
The wedding dress has been sent to her.

72
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,166
Ask her if she got it.

73
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:25,666
Hello.

74
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:26,707
You can call me Marry.

75
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:28,666
Did you receive the wedding dress?

76
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:29,957
Yes, I did.

77
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:31,416
Here is the thing.

78
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:33,207
Something came up,

79
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,207
so I may not need

80
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:36,207
the wedding dress for now.

81
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:37,916
(Gu Xixi)
Can I cancel the order?

82
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,875
Tell her
that the wedding dress is handmade.

83
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,082
No refunding.

84
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:43,541
(Gu Xixi)
Well, I’m afraid not.

85
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,400
I’m sorry.

86
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,125
(Gu Xixi)
Well...

87
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,791
Ask her when she will pay the balance.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,250
If she can’t pay within three days,

89
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,791
we will sue her for breach of contract.

90
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:53,707
You must pay in three days.

91
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,125
Three days?

92
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,791
You are

93
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:00,000
cruel and ruthless indeed.

94
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:06,250
Pay hundreds of thousand yuan

95
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,082
in three days!

96
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,916
Why don’t you

97
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,125
tell Alex the truth

98
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,582
and cancel the order?

99
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,290
I’ll lose my reputation if I do that.

100
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,458
Maybe I’ll even lose my store
if someone makes a complaint.

101
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:23,040
What to do then?

102
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,875
We shouldn’t take the risk
in the first place, dear God.

103
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,083
Hello, Mei.

104
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,290
I want to borrow some money from you.

105
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:34,625
Ruthless.

106
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:35,625
Heartless.

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,208
What to do?

108
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,665
Why don’t you answer it?

109
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,665
It’s from abroad.

110
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:46,583
What if it’s someone sent by Alex

111
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,750
who calls to urge me to pay?

112
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,415
No, no.

113
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:52,790
What about your senior?

114
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,958
How about this?

115
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,625
I overheard

116
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,915
that it’s Grandma’s birthday today.

117
00:04:59,165 --> 00:04:59,915
Well,

118
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:01,040
Manager Chen, wrap it up for me

119
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,125
as a birthday present for Grandma.

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,165
He seems to be the only person

121
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,833
who might lend me money.

122
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,458
Have a try.

123
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,000
Sorry, the subscriber you called

124
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:11,875
is not available now.

125
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,083
Why isn’t he answering the phone?

126
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,625
Please call again later.

127
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,583
- Not available.
- Sorry...

128
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:22,290
No. 18, Huangluwan Village.

129
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,083
It should be here.

130
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,875
Hello.

131
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:35,375
Are you Mr. Hu?

132
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,625
Yes.

133
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,708
I am. Who are you?

134
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,708
Hello, my name is Mo Zixin.

135
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,708
I came from Jiangbei.

136
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,333
I heard that you used to be

137
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,208
a colorist at Kalian.

138
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:45,875
I have a favor to ask of you.

139
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,083
What is it?

140
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:48,375
I want you to make

141
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,625
the Kalian 5277.

142
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,708
5277?

143
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,200
You mean cerise?

144
00:05:56,415 --> 00:05:57,208
I think so.

145
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,375
I can’t do it.

146
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,458
The factory is closed.

147
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,375
The machine is sold.

148
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,208
Don’t worry about it.

149
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,083
I’ve got the factory
and the machine ready for you.

150
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,375
I just need your help.

151
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,583
I wonder what’s going on up there.

152
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,665
Take a look up there?

153
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,540
No way.

154
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,875
I don’t have an excuse now.

155
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,958
I told her I would have dinner
with a schoolmate.

156
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,875
Now I’m here with milk.

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,625
It’s too embarrassing.

158
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,500
I should come up with an excuse.

159
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,583
Or forget it?

160
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:31,458
You...

161
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:32,625
Mr. Shang.

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,915
Why are you here?

163
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,750
I just had dinner with that girl.

164
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,458
I’m taking a walk. It helps digestion.

165
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,358
Milk.

166
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,040
A box of milk after dinner

167
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,325
makes me feel good.

168
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:50,375
Well,

169
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,040
why didn’t you send her home?

170
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Was it not going well?

171
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,333
It was going too well.

172
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,075
Aren’t you
supposed to be singing up there?

173
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:00,200
How do you come down alone?

174
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:01,875
It’s stuffy in there.

175
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:02,708
I came out to get some fresh air.

176
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:04,708
I’m going back.

177
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,540
I still have work tomorrow.

178
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,165
Good, my car is nearby.

179
00:07:08,165 --> 00:07:09,000
Let me drive you home.

180
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,290
I thought you want to take a walk alone.

181
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,708
Well, I’m finished.

182
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,625
Okay, go ahead.

183
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,708
I want to take a walk.

184
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,025
Hold on.

185
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,625
I suddenly feel bloated again.

186
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,458
I need to take another walk.

187
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,833
So, together?

188
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,333
Wait for me.

189
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:27,958
Give me a second.

190
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,165
Wait for me!

191
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,083
Actually, I heard from Sichen

192
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,000
that many domestic companies
are interested in you.

193
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:47,958
If you don’t think
my company is right for you,

194
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
you can leave as you want.

195
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,083
That’s not what I think.

196
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:02,083
Not?

197
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,915
In your eyes,

198
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,915
I’m just a frivolous boss

199
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,583
who is fooling around.

200
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:13,540
There is no future

201
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,875
to work for me.

202
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:18,208
To be honest,

203
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,000
I was kind of
prejudiced against you at first.

204
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,290
After all,
I have long heard of your temper.

205
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:26,665
But,

206
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,415
the company has a great atmosphere,

207
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,790
and the relationship between colleagues
is simple.

208
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:32,708
Besides,

209
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,041
you are trying to get better.

210
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,208
Do you really mean it?

211
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,041
I only believe what I saw.

212
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:47,833
Thanks.

213
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,291
I...

214
00:08:59,041 --> 00:08:59,833
Well...

215
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:05,583
Come on.

216
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,208
Wait, I...

217
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,208
Hello.

218
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,583
Hello, I’m Ran Xiwei.

219
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,550
Hello, what can I do for you?

220
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,958
I don’t know what you did

221
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,208
to make Alex say in public

222
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,875
that you are Sichen’s fiancée.

223
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,291
I’m here today

224
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,708
to give you a piece of advice.

225
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,583
Stay away from Yin Sichen.

226
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:50,958
If you need anything,

227
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,541
or if you have financial difficulties,

228
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,666
you can come to me.

229
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,500
I want you to stop harassing him.

230
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,833
Miss Ran, I think
you may have misunderstood.

231
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,875
- Yin Sichen and I...
- You don’t need to explain to me.

232
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,625
And I don’t want to hear

233
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,291
what happened between you.

234
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,166
I just want to tell you

235
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,708
that I am back.

236
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,916
Other things are not so important.

237
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,708
You and Yin Sichen
are perfect for each other.

238
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,791
You won’t understand our world.

239
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,250
Maybe Sichen

240
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,625
is just a symbol of
money and status for you,

241
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,458
but for me,

242
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,458
he is my whole life.

243
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,583
I hope you can

244
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,666
keep my advice in mind.

245
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,458
Thank you for your time.

246
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,208
It has been three days.

247
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,375
If she doesn’t contact us,

248
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,166
we will miss the boat.

249
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:17,833
Let’s wait a little longer.

250
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,000
She will call us.

251
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,700
(Fiancée)

252
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:34,708
Hello.

253
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:36,666
The first contract

254
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,333
is a prenuptial agreement.

255
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,041
It can make sure

256
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,750
that you and I will get divorced

257
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,083
three months after you marry me.

258
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,250
At the time,

259
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,916
you can get one million yuan
as compensation.

260
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,291
The second contract

261
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,708
is Alex’s licensing contract.

262
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,791
Both of us need to sign it.

263
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:51,958
I’ve already signed it.

264
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
The last one

265
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,291
is the authorization document

266
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,041
to transfer
your shares of Marry Me to me.

267
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,375
I disagree.

268
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,958
If you don’t sign it,

269
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:01,916
you will be solely responsible for

270
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,583
all the economic losses

271
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,166
of Why Mall this time.

272
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,083
Your parents’ real estate,

273
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,208
your mother’s laundry

274
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,291
and

275
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,333
the online store
you opened with your friend, Lin Xiaoya.

276
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,375
All of them will be given to us.

277
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,958
I have the lawyer’s letter ready

278
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,250
for you anytime.

279
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,250
Yin Sichen.

280
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,875
Are you threatening me?

281
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,333
If you sign these three contracts,

282
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,666
there will be no threat.

283
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,166
What are you doing?

284
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,166
Pay hundreds of thousand yuan

285
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,333
in three days!

286
00:12:38,275 --> 00:12:39,416
Screw it.

287
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,375
I’m looking for my pen.

288
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:50,458
But,

289
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,666
I want to add three conditions
to this agreement.

290
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,291
You’re not in a position
to negotiate with me.

291
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,333
Yin Sichen.

292
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,833
Don’t forget

293
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,500
I’m also your only choice.

294
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,083
That gives me the right.

295
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:04,750
Go ahead.

296
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:05,875
First,

297
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,208
without jeopardizing this contract,

298
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,500
you can’t
interfere with my life or work.

299
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,500
If we need to live together,

300
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,083
I need a private

301
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,041
and separate single room.

302
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,375
As long as you do what I ask,

303
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,375
I don’t care about the rest.

304
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,250
Very good.

305
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,125
Second,

306
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,291
although I’m living with you

307
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,541
as your wife,

308
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,208
I still only work

309
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,250
eight hours every day.

310
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,500
If I work overtime,

311
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,083
you’re gonna have to pay me double.

312
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,083
I’ll pay you triple.

313
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:32,583
Third,

314
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,416
you and I are only married.

315
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,583
You mustn’t have any feelings for me.

316
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,416
Who gives you the confidence?

317
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:47,750
You have to promise me.

318
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,250
Fei’ang.

319
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,541
Revise the contract.

320
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,000
Done.

321
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:58,708
You can sign it now.

322
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,416
I’m glad to work with you, Miss Gu.

323
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,166
In terms of the previous situation,

324
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,083
you don’t need
to take any responsibility,

325
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,416
and we don’t have the right to sue you.

326
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,625
- You...
- You have signed the contract now.

327
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,875
Once you breach the contract,

328
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,416
you have to pay me liquidated damages
in accordance with the contract.

329
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:26,041
All right, you can leave now.

330
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,875
Happy marriage.

331
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,291
Ridiculous!

332
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,958
It’s ridiculous!

333
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,208
Everybody,

334
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,833
I have a big announcement to make.

335
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,791
- What?
- I’m going to get married.

336
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,833
With whom?

337
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,500
Xixi, it’s such a big decision.

338
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,375
Why didn’t you talk to us first?

339
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,125
Yeah.

340
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,750
What is his family like?

341
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:02,833
A fake marriage?

342
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,708
Does my son need

343
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,000
a fake marriage for money?

344
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,750
The stocks went down and the market value
got damaged. So what?

345
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,625
I can take back your company.

346
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
As for the money you owe the investors,

347
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,833
I’ll pay it for you.

348
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,666
Are you pregnant?

349
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,833
What are you talking about?

350
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,875
No.

351
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,708
I...

352
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,041
What about the bride price?

353
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,083
I don’t think there is any.

354
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,166
You...

355
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,416
It’s the bride price.

356
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,333
You didn’t ask for the bride price?

357
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,208
What a silly girl!

358
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,041
Without half a million yuan,
we won’t let you marry him.

359
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,625
With Why Mall’s current valuation,

360
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,916
if you want to acquire it,

361
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,875
I’m afraid you will pay a lot of money.

362
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,625
Besides, I founded Why Mall

363
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,083
to prove myself.

364
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,791
If you ask me to admit that I failed

365
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,625
and I need my dad to clean up my mess,

366
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,375
you’d better just kill me.

367
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,916
This is your marriage.

368
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,375
What era is it now?

369
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,125
Marriage is no longer a lifetime thing.

370
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,791
But it’s not something
you can play with.

371
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,208
Even if it’s a stopgap,

372
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,541
is it worth it?

373
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,416
It’s definitely not worth it
if it’s for me.

374
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,625
But for Why Mall,

375
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,125
it’s totally worth it.

376
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,208
I’m so mad.

377
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,250
Coming.

378
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:16,708
Xixi.

379
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,666
What’s going on?

380
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,375
Who is that?

381
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,575
Hey.

382
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,250
- How did you...?
- Miss Gu.

383
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:24,666
Who are you?

384
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,000
Who let you in?

385
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,458
Mr. Gu.

386
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,583
I’m here to bring you gifts
on behalf of Mr. Yin.

387
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,208
Who is Mr. Yin?

388
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,625
The man I’m going to marry.

389
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:36,791
Got it.

390
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,625
Go back and tell Mr. Yin

391
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,791
that we are not the kind of people

392
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,625
who can marry off
their daughter casually.

393
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,291
Yeah.

394
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,416
What’s this?

395
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:47,625
The car for you.

396
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,291
There are other gifts.

397
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,666
Go to bring them.

398
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,666
Thank him. Thank him.

399
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,825
Good.

400
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,208
Mr. Yin also

401
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,916
wants to thank you

402
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,083
for taking care of Miss Gu these years.

403
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,458
The wedding is two days away.

404
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,375
Please take care of her
for a few more days.

405
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,166
No problem.

406
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,225
It’s my granddaughter.

407
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,166
If your mom finds it out,

408
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,125
she will never approve of this.

409
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,208
That’s why I need your help.

410
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,000
Keep her at bay for me.

411
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,416
Spend three months with her,
just the two of you.

412
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,833
I’ve booked the ticket for you.

413
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,333
You will leave tomorrow morning.

414
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:29,133
You planned it without telling me first?

415
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:30,875
You are the one

416
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,791
who kept saying
that you want some alone time with Mom.

417
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,750
Don’t worry.

418
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,500
While you are away,

419
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,583
I will keep an eye on your company.

420
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,375
Really?

421
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,000
When did I ever break my promise?

422
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,458
Before you leave,

423
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,166
you have to record a video

424
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,916
for my wedding
to give us your blessings.

425
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,166
Well...

426
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,375
Is there a wedding?

427
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,708
It’s her first time getting married.

428
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,958
There should be a decent wedding, right?

429
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,125
By the way, Miss Gu.

430
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,625
Remember to bring that Marry Me dress

431
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,166
when you go to take photos tomorrow.

432
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:03,958
Put it here.

433
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:04,541
Got it.

434
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,583
All right. I’m leaving then.

435
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:07,500
I’ll walk you to the door.

436
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,375
Go ahead.

437
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,250
Girl, well done.

438
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,958
Mr. Mo.

439
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:19,916
Here.

440
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,208
It’s done.

441
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:25,750
Thank you.

442
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,625
I’m curious about

443
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,500
what makes you

444
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,541
come all the way over here

445
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,625
and spend a few days

446
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,541
just to make a bottle of paint.

447
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,166
There is a person

448
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,291
who once told me

449
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,500
that it’s the most beautiful red
she could remember.

450
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,083
I want to find it for her.

451
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:41,916
Your girlfriend?

452
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,166
No.

453
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,166
No.

454
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,208
It will work when you show this to her.

455
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,750
I’m moved by you,

456
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,333
not to mention a little girl.

457
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,166
I didn’t think that much.

458
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,050
I just want her to be happy.

459
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,125
Mr. Hu.

460
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:57,708
Thank you so much.

461
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,375
No problem.

462
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,000
All right.

463
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,666
- I’m leaving then.
- Okay.

464
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:00,458
Good luck.

465
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:01,166
Okay.

466
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:05,375
Wow.

467
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,708
This is really beautiful.

468
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,958
The streamlined folds,

469
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,166
the draping tailoring,

470
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,208
the waist

471
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,625
and the cut-out design of the chest.

472
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,208
Gu Xixi.

473
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,541
Are you still a woman?

474
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,000
That’s all you can see?

475
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,291
I have to say

476
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,250
the details

477
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,791
are well-designed by Alex.

478
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,125
The price is also good.

479
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,208
In some sense,

480
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:37,000
I paid for this wedding dress for you.

481
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:38,666
Yin Sichen.

482
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,250
Why do you say you paid for it?

483
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,625
Your package.

484
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:44,708
Coming.

485
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,300
(Sender: Marry To: Gu Xixi)

486
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:49,583
Hold on.

487
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,416
Don’t tell me
that the overseas call and the package

488
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,208
are part of your plan.

489
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:57,791
What are you talking about?

490
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,166
I don’t understand.

491
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,625
You don’t understand?

492
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:01,833
Fine.

493
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,958
I’ll ask Alex about it now.

494
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay.

495
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,333
Ask him
if I tricked you into marrying me.

496
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,958
Anyway,

497
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,625
you are the one
to wear the wedding dress.

498
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,708
You have to pay for it.

499
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,166
Yin Sichen.

500
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:20,833
You are really something.

501
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,000
Hello.

502
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:35,500
Hello.

503
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,375
I’m Lin Xiaoya.

504
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,525
Lin Xiaoya.

505
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:41,208
Yeah.

506
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,208
Gu Xixi’s friend.

507
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,150
- Her roommate.
- Yeah.

508
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,208
- Her partner.
- Yeah.

509
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,250
A third-rated model?

510
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,000
I’m kind of a second-rate model.

511
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,666
I’ve been on a lot of big shows.

512
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,000
Hello.

515

that Mrs. Yin likes it.

(WHYMALL)
You...

541
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:15,541
I’m so angry.

542
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,416
You are getting married,

543
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:18,179
(President of WHY-MALL, Yin Sichen)
but I’m not the first one

544
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:18,979
(Rushes into Marriage with Gu Xixi!)
to know it.

545
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,375
Tell me it’s not true.

546
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,125
Do I look good?

547
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,708
You’re not going to tell me

548
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,875
that it’s true.

549
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,416
I’m asking you
if I look good in the picture.

550
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,583
The dress is really expensive.

551
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,458
Good. You look really good.

552
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,500
Don’t you think
she is not good enough for you?

553
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:41,500
You can only say that

554
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,666
in front of me from now on.

555
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,916
She is going to be Mrs. Yin.

556
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,333
Watch your words.

557
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,250
Seriously, Mrs. Yin?

558
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:52,875
I remember

559
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,583
you said it was just business

560
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,708
and an act

561
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:58,833
when the gossip magazine caught you.

562
00:23:58,875 --> 00:23:59,875
Now she is Mrs. Yin?

563
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,666

564
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:02,708

If anyone else hears what you just said,

566
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:06,041
what do you think
my company’s valuation will be?

567
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,041
Free up your weekends.

568
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:10,541
Sichen.

569
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,541
You get married before I do,

570
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,875
and with a girl I don’t know.

571
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,166
Have I ever lost to you in any game?

572
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:19,541
No.

573
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,625
Do you think I will lose in marriage?

574
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:21,541
Well...

575
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:22,708
At least you should tell me

576
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:26,041
where Gu Xixi lives,

577
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,166
where she is from,

578
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,916
what her parents do

579
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:29,750
- and what she likes...
- Hey.

580
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:31,666
It’s marriage.

581
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:33,625
If I make everything so clear,

582
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:34,666
do I still need to get married?

583
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,250
But marriage...

584
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,250
Besides, I don’t have so much energy

585
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,000
to waste on these unimportant things.

586
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,833
I...

587
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:41,875
Sichen.

588
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,500
Xiwei.

589
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,775
(President of WHY-MALL, Yin Sichen
Rushes into Marriage with Gu Xixi!)

590
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:53,925
Have a seat.

591
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,375
Congratulations.

592
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:07,166
Thanks.

593
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:10,000
Why her?

594
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:13,291
It’s fate.

595
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:14,333
It’s fate?

596
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:15,375
I think it’s a natural disaster.

597
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,125
You saw that

598
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,541
she was with Mo Zixin that day.

599
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:22,583
Are you not worried at all?

600
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:23,333
Hold on.

601
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,166
You mean the Mo Zixin

602
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,916
from Wenye Group?

603
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:27,750
Yeah.

604
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
No way.

605
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:30,375
If Gu Xixi knows him,

606
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:31,541
there must be...

607
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,958
Do you think

608
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:37,625
I can’t deal with Gu Xixi?

609
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:39,791
Sichen.

610
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,333
We don’t want you to be deceived by her.

611
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,083
You don’t know her well.

612
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,291
You have to be careful.

613
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:47,125
Moreover,

614
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:48,875
you were so innocent
when you were a kid.

615
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,208
I’m really worried
that you will get hurt.

616
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,333
Thank you.

617
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,666
But you should have more faith in me.

618
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:00,333
Well...

619
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:03,291
Since you are going to get married,

620
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:04,458
how about

621
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:06,625
having a bachelor party for you?

622
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:08,916
Let’s have a drink?

623
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,075
- Come on.
- Hold on.

624
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:11,541
I still have work to do.

625
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,041
You should send Xiwei home first.

626
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,833
I... Well...

627
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:28,375
See you at the wedding.

628
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:30,041
Okay.

629
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,875
Well, Xiwei.

630
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,041
Wait for me at the door.

631
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,041
I’ll drive you back.

632
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:39,791
Yin Sichen!

633
00:26:43,554 --> 00:26:45,900
(WHYMALL)

634
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:47,291
Xiwei, wait a minute.

635
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,666
You can cry if you want to.

636
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,625
Have you ever seen me cry?

637
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,166
The time I soiled your skirt

638
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,541
when you were seven.

639
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:24,791
I still remember

640
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:27,958
he told me at that time

641
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,916
that tears can’t solve any problems.

642
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,208
Since then,

643
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:38,625
I haven’t cried.

644
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,500
I remember he told me once

645
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:47,208
that he doesn’t like the girl next door.

646
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:48,833
After that,

647
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,583
I threw away

648
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,250
all my tutu skirts

649
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,625
and dolls.

650
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:56,166
I thought after I came back,

651
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,583
I would be the one standing by his side.

652
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,025
(Wedding)

653
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:17,889
(ALL THAT LOVE)

654
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:28,750
Come on, move this over.

655
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,625
Okay.

656
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:32,708
Put it over there.

657
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:35,625
Sichen.

658
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,291
Is it okay here?

659
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:40,041
Okay. Okay.

660
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:40,750
Grandma.

661
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:43,916
Grandma.

662
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,958
Are you sure you want to marry her?

663
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:58,583
Yes, Grandma.

664
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,500
Let me ask you one more time.

665
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,041
Are you sure you want to marry her?

666
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,041
Yes.

667
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,083
My granddaughter-in-law.

668
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,225
You are

669
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:25,916
really beautiful today.

670
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:27,833
Thank you for

671
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,458
marrying Sichen.

672
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:32,375
If he doesn’t treat you well,

673
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:33,458
just tell me.

674
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,291
I’ll back you up.

675
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,125
If you dare to treat her badly,

676
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,708
I will cut you off.

677
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:43,708
Don’t worry.

678
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:44,791
Thanks, Grandma.

679
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:47,541
All right.

680
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,250
I won’t bother you.

681
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:50,708
I know you are in a hurry,

682
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,916
but you must treat her well.

683
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,708
Xiaoya, take Grandma inside.

684
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:03,958
Grandma, this way.

685
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:04,700
Okay.

686
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,450
Be careful.

687
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,000
Right.

688
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,500
Your grandma is so cute.

689
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,458
- Why didn’t you get that from her?
- Thanks. This way.

690
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,208
Please.

691
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:14,916
Xiwei.

692
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:19,333
Sichen.

693
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:27,833
Congratulations.

694
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:29,750
Thanks.

695
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,500
Miss Gu, hello.

696
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,791
I’m Ran Xiwei.

697
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:35,791
Hello.

698
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:58,950
Hi.

699
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,775
Hello.

700
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,458
From now on,

701
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:06,500
you took away my life.

702
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:11,775
Hello, guys.

703
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:12,525
Let’s go in.

704
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:20,875
I’m gonna need you
to take care of Sichen from now on.

705
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:24,541
I’ll go inside then.

706
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:25,791
Okay.

707
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:33,708
I think you didn’t mention

708
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,666
that I have to deal with
a rival in love in the contract.

709
00:31:37,925 --> 00:31:39,583
When did you fall in love with me?

710
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,291
What nonsense are you talking about?

711
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,000
If you are not in love with me,

712
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:46,958
how would she be a rival in love to you?

713
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:51,958
You have a point.

714
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:55,208
Xiaoya.

715
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,041

00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:57,833
Yin Sichen!

755
00:35:02,825 --> 00:35:04,825
♪Ah yeah♪

756
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:10,708
Gu Xixi.

757
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,250
I won’t let you take advantage of me.

758
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,375
Yin Sichen.

759
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,083
Can you let me know in advance

760
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,958
when you have a plan?

761
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,375
I’m your boss.

762
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,458
Just follow my lead.

763
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,791
From now on,

764
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:42,541
you are the nominal Mrs. Yin.

765
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,500
The first job you need to do is

766
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:48,375
to socialize.

767
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:55,833
Please.

768
00:35:57,475 --> 00:35:58,416
Come on, a toast to you.

769
00:35:58,416 --> 00:35:59,175
- Grandma.
- Yeah.

770
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:00,258
Dad.

771
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:00,833
Yeah.

772
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:01,291
Mom.

773
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:02,266
Yeah.

774
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:04,291
Xixi and I will drink a toast to you.

775
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:06,791
Cheers.

776
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,750
Xixi, come here.

777
00:36:15,325 --> 00:36:16,208
Keep it.

778
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:18,916
You know,

779
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,041
it’s really beautiful.

780
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,908
Xixi.

781
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:24,875
Don’t drink too much.

782
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,375
If you get drunk, I won’t help you.

783
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,333
If I don’t get drunk,

784
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:30,833
I’m afraid I would
run out on my wedding.

785
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:31,625
Come on.

786
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:32,250
Let’s drink.

787
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,916
Come on, a toast to you.

788
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:37,458
Come on, let’s get some luck from this.

789
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:38,725
Come on.

790
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,000
Try this.

791
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:47,175
(China Construction Bank
Long Card All-in-One (Deposit Card))

792
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,208
We only met once.

793
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,666
But since Xixi chose to marry you,

794
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,583
you must be

795
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,541
a trustworthy and reliable person.

796
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:00,708
After today,

797
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:02,500
Xixi will be your wife.

798
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,583
You will need to take care of her.

799
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:08,333
I’ll leave her to you.

800
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,000
There are a few things
I want you to know.

801
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:11,875
First,

802
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,791
Xixi likes to eat spicy food

803
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:16,208
that makes her want to cry
when she is sad,

804
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:18,375
because she doesn’t want people to know

805
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,458
that she would cry when she is sad.

806
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:21,875
Second,

807
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,041
Xixi has always had a dream

808
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:26,583
to become a designer.

809
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:28,541
The old days were hard.

810
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:30,083
Xixi chose

811
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:32,083
to endure it and compromise
for me at home.

812
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,541
Now she can finally leave.

813
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:36,583
I’m happy for her.

814
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,000
So,

815
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:41,458
- I hope you can support her.
- Stop drinking.

816
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:43,791
I hope she won’t

817
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:45,208
live a featureless life like I do

818
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:46,500
- in the end.
- Of course.

819
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,425
I’m very happy.

820
00:37:47,425 --> 00:37:48,925
Let her follow her dream

821
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:50,958
and do what she likes.

822
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:52,083
Come on.

823
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,000
Cheers.

824
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:56,708
Cheers.

825
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,041
Miss Gu seems to be drunk.

826
00:37:58,958 --> 00:37:59,666
I see.

827
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,041
They are waiting for you.

828
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,808
I’m afraid she will choke herself
to death by her vomit.

829
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,833
The top story tomorrow

830
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,625
will be the death
of Yin Sichen’s newly married wife

831
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,208
in their mansion.

832
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:24,916
Take care of it for me.

833
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:28,416
Just say we want some time alone.

834
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:35,125
What do you mean?

835
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:48,125
Gu Xixi.

836
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:23,833
You...

837
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:24,958
Why are you crying?

838
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,541
It’s so unfair.

839
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:31,750
I always thought

840
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:34,083
I will walk into the wedding hall

841
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:36,458
with someone I love.

842
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,208
Then,

843
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,333
he will put a ring on me,

844
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:44,958
and we can live a happy life forever.

845
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:46,875
But why

846
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:51,000
is my marriage a contract?

847
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:55,791
Do you hate me?

848
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,666
Yes. I hate you! I hate you...

849
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:00,875
Yin Sichen.

850
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,625
He is a rascal.

851
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:05,958
A jerk. A liar.

852
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:08,125
A pig.

853
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,250
But I envy you.

854
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,166
For what?

855
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,875
That you can cry,

856
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:22,166
you can act childishly,

857
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,000
and you can blow off steam as you want.

858
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:34,416
I haven’t cried for a long time.

859
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:38,708
I don’t remember the last time I cried.

860
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:43,166
You are right about one thing.

861
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:48,625
I’m a jerk without feelings,

862
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:52,125
and I don’t have time for this.

863
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,000
Gu Xixi.

864
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:02,833
Gu Xixi.

865
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:04,750
