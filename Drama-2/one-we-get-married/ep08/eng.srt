What are you doing?

24
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,166
Why are you blushing?

25
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,125
Am I blushing?

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,625
That’s right.

27
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,291
It proves my theory right.

28
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,666
It shows
that even if you don’t like that person,

29
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:58,750
you will still blush

30
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,875
when you get close.

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,925
This is an instinct.

32
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,725
Hey.

33
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,166
Let me take you to a place

34
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,832
where your face will turn red
and your heart will race.

35
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:17,625
Have more.

36
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:18,250
Okay.

37
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,025
You eat a lot at night.

38
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:23,125
Sir, two beers.

39
00:02:24,582 --> 00:02:25,200
Cheers.

40
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:27,675
Thank you for saving me today.

41
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:28,975
I heard it for the first time.

42
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:31,625
Sir.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Two more beers.

44
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:33,850
All right.

45
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,250
And two more hot spicy chicken wings.

46
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,225
Thanks.

47
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:41,832
Eat some, too.

48
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,041
Don’t let me eat alone.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,541
I’m not eating.

50
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:45,750
Waiter.

51
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,500
Fine.

52
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,225
Two more cokes.

53
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,825
Do you like to eat
hot spicy chicken wings that much

54
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:52,325
when you are feeling blue?

55
00:02:52,325 --> 00:02:53,125
Um.

56
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,791
Yeah, how do you know it?

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,525
No, no.

58
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,250
Why are there

59
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,875
weird things

60
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:08,750
popping in my head?

61
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:13,875
Yin Sichen, I have a question for you.

62
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,791
That day at SAO.K,

63
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,457
were you...

64
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:21,625
Were you there?

65
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,082
Do you just know about it now?

66
00:03:31,582 --> 00:03:33,457
The time you rolled the car window...

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,875
What car window?

68
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:38,207
Nothing, nothing.

69
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,166
At that time,

70
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:41,875
I didn’t know

71
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,707
you are

72
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,709
such a considerate, helpful,

73
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,000
and gentle person.

74
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:52,957
I didn’t know it.

75
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,925
So if I said anything

76
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,500
about you,

77
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,150
like,

78
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,600
something,

79
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,875
I take that back.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,375
I should have known

81
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,000
you are such a troublemaker.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,600
Yes, yes.

83
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,425
I’m definitely a troublemaker.

84
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:11,791
Boss.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,275
Fire me, then.

86
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,665
I kind of regret it now.

87
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:17,650
You regret it?

88
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,540
If you regret it,

89
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,250
you can write a termination letter now,

90
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,333
and I’ll sign it.

91
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,415
After this meal,

92
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,708
we will never meet again.

93
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:25,625
Okay.

94
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:26,333
Sir, can I have the check?

95
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,225
Yeah.

96
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:28,458
Okay.

97
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,600
Wait,

98
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,925
Boss, are you really firing me?

99
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:40,625
All right.

100
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:43,025
(Supplementary agreement: Do one thing
for the other party unconditionally.)

101
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,165
I’ll tell you after you sign it.

102
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,250
Okay. I’ve signed it.

103
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,250
After we finish the meal,

104
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,500
(Signatory: Gu Xixi)
let’s never meet again.

105
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,208
Hold on.

106
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:57,775
Boss.

107
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,500
If we end the contract now,

108
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,900
the time is not up.

109
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:03,125
How about the money?

110
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,540
Do one thing for the other party...

111
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:12,800
That’s not right.

112
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,708
Read the terms first

113
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,000
before signing an agreement next time.

114
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,600
Just ask if you don’t understand.

115
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,125
Tomorrow, I’ll ask Fei’ang

116
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,708
to send me the terms of the extension.

117
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,708
You will be my free maid
for another three months.

118
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,325
No,

119
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,540
you can’t do this.

120
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,958
No way.

121
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:30,540
I’ll tear it off.

122
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,900
It doesn’t count if I tear it off.

123
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,325
I’ve sent it to Fei’ang.

124
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,850
I’m deaf now.

125
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:36,915
No. It didn’t happen.

126
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:41,650
(Xiaoya)
Nianxi is going to have a book signing!

127
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,400
What happened again?

128
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:46,750
You don’t need to know.

129
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,050
Something really good happened.

130
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:50,208
Cheers.

131
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,000
Right.

132
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,900
Don’t worry.

133
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,750
Everything is ready.

134
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,600
Of course.

135
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,190
She is grinning.

136
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,100
(Shang Ke)

137
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,550
Mr. Shang.

138
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,225
Um.

139
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,475
I’m going to leave early today.

140
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:27,625
Why?

141
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,375
What’s the matter?

142
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,325
Nothing.

143
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,500
I have a dinner with Redwood’s Mr. Fang.

144
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
He asked me to do him a favor.

145
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,450
You mean Fang Ming?

146
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,300
Um.

147
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,083
It’s an important meeting.

148
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,083
Bring me with you

149
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,500
to show respect.

150
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,958
If you have time,

151
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:46,583
let’s go there together.

152
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,292
Um.

153
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,625
Send me the time and the address.

154
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,700
Okay.

155
00:06:56,575 --> 00:06:59,040
She asked me to meet her ex-boyfriend.

156
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,100
That’s asking me to back her up.

157
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:03,875
Don’t worry, my Ruona.

158
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,790
I will treat you like a princess,

159
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,333
and I’ll make a romantic gesture.

160
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,975
Will you be my girlfriend?

161
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,950
Um.

162
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,083
Then...

163
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:20,415
Come on, drink.

164
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,800
Where is it?

165
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,125
Why isn’t she answering the phone?

166
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:31,083
Sir, please show your invitation.

167
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,175
Invitation?

168
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
I have no invitation.

169
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,100
I know someone in there.

170
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,775
Hey.

171
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,075
Do you know who I am?

172
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:40,875
You don’t know?

173
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,500
That’s right.

174
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:55,625
Marry him!

175
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:01,500
Marry him!

176
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,608
Marry me.

177
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,250
Marry him!

178
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:08,958
Let’s be together forever.

179
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:17,208
Marry him!

180
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,999
Marry him!

181
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:40,600
Shang Ke.

182
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,125
Ruona.

183
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,708
It’s not Ruona.

184
00:08:58,075 --> 00:08:59,600
Ruona is married.

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,166
It must be a dream.

186
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,666
Why?

187
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,250
Why do you come to me
after you said yes to him?

188
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,125
Why?

189
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,000
You made me desperate

190
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,833
and you show me hope again.

191
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,625
You are horrible.

192
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,950
All right, stop drinking.

193
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,750
You don’t like me at all.

194
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,041

196
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,416
get to treat me so casually?

197
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,083
Why?

198
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,083

What should I say to her later?

211
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,200
Good morning?

No.

214
00:12:58,875 --> 00:12:59,791
It sounds experienced

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,166
like I do this kind of things a lot.

216
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,900
Or just ask her what happened last night

217
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,333
and see how she reacts.

218
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:06,541
No.

219
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,541
It sounds what a playboy would do.

220
00:13:09,075 --> 00:13:10,825
She would think
I don’t want to be responsible for her.

Yes.

228
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,875
It occurred to me
that my cat hasn’t been fed.

229
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,000
I’m going home to feed my cat.

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:22,916
The protagonist is here.

385
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:23,666
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:24,791
Take a photo.

387
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, it’s big news.

388
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,375
I heard all your questions.

389
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,850
Not to mention

390
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,333
your lack of basic courtesy,

391
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,400
your questions are meaningless.

392
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,166
Do we need to waste time on

393
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,725
such obvious things?

394
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,791
I fell in love with Gu Xixi
at first sight.

395
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,625
So I pursued her

396
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,833
and made her my wife.

397
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,833
No matter what Gu Xixi was like before,

398
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,333
she is my wife now.

399
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,175
Do you have any other questions?

400
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,625
Well...

401
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,625
If there is no other question,

402
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,100
that’s all for the press conference.

403
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,000
They are leaving.

404
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,625
That’s it?

405
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,850
This is your evidence
for the press conference?

406
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,625
Um.

407
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,875
Didn’t you say
that there was no recording?

408
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:30,500
Give it back to me.

409
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,892
Yin Sichen.

410
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,375
Yin Sichen, give it back to me.

411
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,125
Yin Sichen.

412
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,083
Thank you for helping me out.

413
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,208
Can you give the recorder to me?

414
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:58,916
Why?

415
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,583
Because there is

416
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,833
a lot of personal stuff in there.

417
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,375
I think you were about to

418
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,375
play the recording in public.

419
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,791
Now you said it’s personal.

420
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:14,333
Gu Xixi.

421
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,150
That doesn’t add up.

422
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,817
I had no choice at that time.

423
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,291
So you were going

424
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,600
to sacrifice your privacy
and personal image

425
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,450
to protect me?

426
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,041
No.

427
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,250
I just want to solve it.

428
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,625
Give it back to me.

429
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,041
Sit back. It’s dangerous.

430
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,750
Then he carried me to the dining room.

431
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,925
Yin Sichen!

432
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,500
- Give it back to me.
- The first bite of food I ate

433
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,583
- Sit back.
- was the cake he made by himself.

434
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,958
Give it back to me. You...

435
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,750
Before he went to work,
he kept kissing me goodbye.

436
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,375
Yin Sichen, it’s too much.

437
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,291
Turn it off.

438
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,541
We cuddle every night when we sleep.

439
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,166
In the morning, he woke me up

440
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,000
with an affectionate kiss,

441
00:22:00,175 --> 00:22:02,416
then he carried me to the dining room.

442
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,416
The first bite of food I ate

443
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,550
- I told you it’s dangerous.
- was the cake he made by himself.

444
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,458
Turn that off now.

445
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,525
He kept...

446
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,375
Can you give it back to me, please?

447
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,250
I can give it to you,

448
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:18,833
but I need you to promise one thing.

449
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:19,500
Yes.

450
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,333
That’s fast.

451
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,208
Um.

452
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,425
Like I said before,

453
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,833
extend the contract for three months.

454
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,025
No way.

455
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,208
Then he carried me to the dining room.

456
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,583
The first bite of food I ate

457
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:39,416
was the cake he made by himself.

458
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,541
Okay, I promise you.

459
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:44,125
Good.

460
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,700
Mr. Yin.

461
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:46,958
The police have registered a case.

462
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,208
Zhao Zegang has been arrested.

463
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:49,750
Okay.

464
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,583
I see.

465
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,416
There has been some negative news

466
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,850
about you and Miss Gu online.

467
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,000
What should we do about it?

468
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,575
They just can’t stop
talking about those pictures.

469
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,625
I can do that, too.

470
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,916
Let’s create some stories for them.

471
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,583
Use the photos I sent you

472
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,541
to write a story

473
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:10,333
about a couple
dealing with her ex-boyfriend.

474
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,200
Okay.

475
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,000
Hold on.

476
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,125
Remember to highlight
my love for my wife

477
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,850
and the important role I played
to protect our family.

478
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:18,708
Make me look handsome.

479
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:19,875
But,

480
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,075
Miss Gu and Mo Zixin
have been close recently.

481
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,666
What?

482
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,833
I took a photo with Master Nianxi.

483
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,958
It should be the pinnacle of my life.

484
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,625
The pinnacle of your life

485
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,791
is just a photo with a weird guy
wearing a mask?

486
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,291
Is that a pinnacle?

487
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,916
You are just crazy.

488
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,325
What do you know?

489
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,375
It’s Nianxi. I worship him.

490
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,875
He is a comic book artist.

491
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:58,300
I’ll keep the photo.

492
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,166
Why?

493
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,541
Because you are Mrs. Yin.

494
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,333
You can only worship me.

495
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:06,583
What a narcissist!

496
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,958
I’ll print a new one if you keep it.

497
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:17,375
Zixin.

498
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,550
(Gu Xixi)
Although you have the original drawings,

499
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,625
(Gu Xixi)
I took a picture with him.

500
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:22,708
Isn’t he handsome?

501
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:23,975
Just between you and me,

502
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,708
I even hugged him.

503
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:27,500
Well?

504
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:28,425
Are you jealous?

505
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:30,375
I’m jealous.

506
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,916
How does that hug feel?

507
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,041
It was really warm.

508
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,000
No.

509
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,791
It was detached and cool.

510
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:39,833
No.

511
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,875
There was something familiar about it.

512
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
All right, I can’t make it up.

513
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,000
I was too nervous.

514
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,825
I didn’t feel anything at all.

515
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,125
It’s so annoying.

516
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:50,916
Maybe you’ll get another chance later.

517
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,000
Don’t stay up late.

518
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:58,791
It’s worth it

519
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:00,958
to be liked by you.

520
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:08,500
What are you looking at

521
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,375
so attentively?

522
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:13,000
I’m reading a fan fiction
of you and President Yin.

523
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:16,083
An overbearing president
fell in love with a normal girl.

524
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:17,958
Their solid love

525
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:20,500
was sabotaged by her ex-boyfriend.

526
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,000
The president stood up

527
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,125
and protected his wife like her hero.

528
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:25,875
This kind of plot can be only found
in a soap opera.

529
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,791
How could it happen in real life?

530
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:28,775
Who said that?

531
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,208
Who took care of Zhao Zegang for you?

532
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:32,250
He also

533
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,625
declared sovereignty
in front of the media.

534
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,875
So romantic.

535
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:38,833
Don’t forget

536
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,000
Yin Sichen helped me only because

537
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:42,625
I signed a contract with him.

538
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,166
It’s not romantic at all.

539
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:46,791
No, I don’t think so.

540
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:50,000
Help me think about
how to write the business plan.

541
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,341
That business plan
gives me a headache.

542
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,625
I designed blackboard posters
in elementary school.

543
00:25:56,925 --> 00:25:59,383
I wrote for the radio station
in middle school.

544
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:02,625
I even wrote for WeChat official account
in college.

545
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:03,750
But I really don’t know

546
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,416
how to write a business plan.

547
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:08,291
Actually,

548
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,458
I have a lot of things
I want to write about.

549
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:12,350
(CICI Business Plan)
But once I open Keynote,

550
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,250
(Catalog: Existing situation
of clothing enterprises...)

551
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,375
I don’t know where to start.

552
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,416
My head is a blank.

553
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,125
It’s mainly because we don’t know

554
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:18,875
what a business plan looks like.

555
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:21,600
Why don’t you ask Yin Sichen?

556
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,708
He is too busy.

557
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,500
How could he help me
with a business plan?

558
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,833
Have a try.

559
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:32,333
No.

560
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,375
I won’t ask him for help.

561
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:35,875
I want him to think

562
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:38,458
I’m a talented and beautiful woman
at the same time.

563
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,833
I’ll make him volunteer to write
the business plan for me.

564
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,375
Okay, okay.

565
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:48,666
Madam.

566
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:51,666
Just do it in this way.

567
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:52,583
Okay.

568
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,166
- Hello.
- You’ll get used to it.

569
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,725
Grandma.

570
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,708
- Grandma.
- Yeah.

571
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,000
Why are you here?

572
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:05,041
You don’t welcome me?

573
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:05,750
Of course not.

574
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,583
I got tired from the walk.

575
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:12,708
I can’t walk anymore.

576
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:14,250
Fei’ang.

577
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,208
Take me to the office to take a rest.

578
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,250
No problem, Grandma.

579
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:18,125
Sichen.

580
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,291
Show Xixi around.

581
00:27:20,675 --> 00:27:22,000
Okay, Grandma. Don’t worry.

582
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:27,975
Is it your idea again?

583
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:28,833
No.

584
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,833
I just stopped by.

585
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,000
Since you came,

586
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:38,625
let’s play out.

587
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,300
(Strategy for the next quarter)

588
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,100
(Strategy for the next quarter)

589
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,775
It’s kind of a secret of our company.

590
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,250
Who allows you to see it?

591
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,208
They are watching us.

592
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,041
You said we should play out.

593
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,875
Maybe I can tell you

594
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:08,541
the loss for the next quarter.

595
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,375
What did you say?

596
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:14,250
Based on your research,

597
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,250
it’s not hard to see

598
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,291
that your Marketing Department

599
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,541
believes that the trend
of the next quarter

600
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:20,708
is irregular cutting
and Macaroon colors.

601
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:22,541
In terms of the brands,

602
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:24,208
they should have prioritized

603
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,083
KM and Diesel,

604
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,541
two high-end light luxury brands, right?

605
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:27,791
Then what?

606
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,000
Then,

607
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:33,291
it’s a wrong choice.

608
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,041
Although irregular cutting

609
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,041
and Macaroon colors

610
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,208
have always been classic elements
in fashion,

611
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:42,375
it requires good skills and aesthetics.

612
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,416
KM is an old luxury brand.

613
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,250
They have been doing it for a long time.

614
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,583
Similar items are launched every year.

615
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,666
That’s why their designers

616
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,916
have run out of ideas in this area.

617
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,500
Although it is a prudent choice,

618
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:58,250
the disadvantage is
that there is nothing new.

619
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:00,000
Diesel is the fastest growing brand

620
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,250
in this quarter.

621
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,125
They just changed their designers.

622
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,725
One seeks stability,
and the other seeks innovation.

623
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:05,458
There is no problem.

624
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,458
Commercially speaking,

625
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,250
there is no problem.

626
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,875
However,

627
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:15,625
the art director of KM

628
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:17,708
seems to have some personal conflicts

629
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,875
with the new designer of Diesel.

630
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,625
But these are just some stories
known by the designers.

631
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:24,541
You don’t know it, right?

632
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,083
According to what you said,

633
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:28,625
what should we do?

634
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,125
I’m asking questions.

635
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:33,775
I don’t solve them.

636
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,750
Gu Xixi, do you need my help
for something?

637
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:39,333
No.

638
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:43,400
I’m here to take a walk with Grandma.

639
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:50,541
Ruona.

640
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,333
Why didn’t you come these days?

641
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,725
I had a myopia surgery.

642
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,291
The doctor told me to rest more.

643
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,175
So if Mr. Shang
needs anything to be done

644
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,208
during this period,

645
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,250
I’m gonna need you to help me out.

646
00:30:03,825 --> 00:30:04,783
Okay, no problem.

647
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:06,541
Thank you, Xiaoxin.

648
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:08,750
Ruona, how did it feel?

649
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:12,250
Nothing.

650
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:14,925
Did it hurt?

651
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:15,975
Kind of.

652
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:17,458
Was it fast?

653
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:19,000
Pretty fast.

654
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:20,375
I hardly felt anything.

655
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,125
I’ve always wanted to do it.

656
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,425
But I’m a little scared.

657
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:27,750
Of what?

658
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,925
Just do it if you want.

659
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:29,958
Doesn’t it really make any difference

660
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,958
to your work and life after you did it?

661
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:33,875
What kind of difference?

662
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,825
Just forget it ever happened.

663
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:37,425
Do what you should do.

664
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:38,650
Let’s go.

665
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:39,309
Okay.

666
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:41,458
Never happened?

667
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:47,333
Mr. Shang.

668
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:48,875
You are also here.

669
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:50,208
Mr. Shang.

670
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:53,166
I’m afraid I can’t work these days.

671
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:55,025
You can let her know

672
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:56,625
if you need anything at work.

673
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,200
Um.

674
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:00,750
Well,

675
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,791
Ruona, I’ll go to work.

676
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:02,325
Okay.

677
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,250
I’m leaving.

678
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,000
Hold on.

679
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,625
The night...

680
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,200
Which night?

681
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,375
The night we...

682
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:31,250
Don’t worry about it.

683
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,175
There’s no reason not to take the bait.

684
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:45,666
Why doesn’t he come to me?

685
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:12,458
What should I wear?

686
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:19,500
Aren’t your clothes
basically the same color?

687
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,700
Does it take so long to pick one?

688
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:26,375
I’m choosing which one
I should wear today.

689
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:32,791
Do you want to watch me change?

690
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:35,458
Go ahead.

691
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,425
Say it.

692
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,200
What’s your solution?

693
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:57,916
Well,

694
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:00,125
KM’s previous designer

695
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:01,083
has some

696
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:01,916
relationship issues

697
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03,900
with Diesel’s designer.

698
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,666
It’s about the ex-girlfriend.

699
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,791
As far as I know,

700
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,708
they are on better terms now.

701
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:10,208
I think

702
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:12,208
instead of asking them to work together,

703
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:14,175
it’s better to let them

704
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:15,916
jointly open a one-month pop-up store.

705
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:17,041
It will attract more attention.

706
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:23,583
I see.

707
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:25,900
You said all these things.

708
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:27,541
What do you want exactly?

709
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:33,833
I don’t

710
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:35,666
want anything.

711
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,500
I’ve been working on
a business plan recently.

712
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,700
I don’t know
if you can give me some advice.

713
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:43,625
That’s all?

714
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:44,583
That’s it.

715
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:47,166
No problem.

716
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,958
Since you have nothing else to ask,

717
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,041
you will still read to me tonight.

718
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,875
Got it, boss.

719
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,250
The book is ready soon.

720
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,083
Yes!

721
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:01,958
I’ve added

722
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:02,750
Miss Gu’s design plan to it.

723
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,200
They think it’s great.

724
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:10,000
I found that my contracted marriage
with Gu Xixi

725
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,875
brought me some unexpected gains.

726
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,875
Love?

727
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:14,425
What?

728
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:17,625
I mean Gu Xixi
solved a lot of trouble for me

729
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,666
because of her cleverness.

730
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,083
I suddenly realized

731
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:24,083
that the Miss Gu
you are talking about now

732
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,416
is very different

733
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:27,125
from the Miss Gu
you were talking about before.

734
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,000
Did she change

735
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:30,375
or did you change?

736
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,666
Or,

737
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,458
did she change in your eyes?

738
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,000
What’s the difference?

739
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:37,833
You used to be
harsh and cruel to everyone,

740
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,625
but now you are
very tolerant of Miss Gu, only her.

741
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:45,000
Do you have feelings for her?

742
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,708
There won’t be any good results

743
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:52,375
to fall in love
with a troublemaker like her.

744
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,958
I’ve loved sailing ship models
since I was a kid.

745
00:34:58,375 --> 00:34:59,875
I took them to school

746
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,500
and held them in my arms
when I was sleeping.

747
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:03,675
But later,

748
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:06,583
Mom thought that my will was sapped.

749
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:08,625
She threw them all away.

750
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,791
But you’ve grown up now.

751
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,041
You are able

752
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:14,583
to protect what you like.

753
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,250
But the more you like it,
the easier you will lose it.

754
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,541
I don’t like the feeling of losing.

755
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:39,500
Boss.

756
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:41,075
Come here.

757
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,625
I wrote a business plan.
Take a look for me.

758
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,575
(CICI Business Plan)

759
00:35:53,475 --> 00:35:54,975
(Pattern analysis
of clothing enterprises...)

760
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,375
The content is incomplete.

761
00:35:57,916 --> 00:35:59,208
There are many loopholes in the plan.

762
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,500
You gave a lot of thought to the layout.

763
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,775
This kind of business plan

764
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:06,958
can’t pass Why Mall’s first interview.

765
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,416
How should I revise it then?

766
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:11,916
Don’t waste your time.

767
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,750
No.

768
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,750
What do you mean?

769
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,375
You are not suitable for this.

770
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:19,666
Just give up.

771
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,583
Not everyone

772
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:24,750
is born knowing everything.

773
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:28,000
I’ll revise it.

774
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,300
Zixin.

775
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:34,833
I really don’t need your help.

776
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,125
It’s okay. I don’t want to bother you.

777
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,775
Um.

778
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:41,850
Well, okay.

779
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:42,925
Well,

780
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,000
I’ll see you tomorrow

781
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,916
and we can discuss it.

782
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:46,475
Thanks.
