Sorry to keep you waiting.

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:47,958
It’s okay.

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,041
Please enjoy.

27
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,750
I just want to say thank you.

28
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,250
Thank me?

29
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,250
About my mother’s store.

30
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,666
But I didn’t do much.

31
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,625
The monthly rent is halved
and the deposit is waived.

32
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,666
That has been a great help.

33
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:12,950
It wasn’t me.

34
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,582
Not you?

35
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,250
I just learned your situation

36
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,250
from Miss Lin yesterday.

37
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:20,875
When I found the landlord,

38
00:02:21,832 --> 00:02:23,275
he had sold the store.

39
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:25,750
He sold it?

40
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:27,125
Yes.

41
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:32,875
Maybe I made a mistake,

42
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,791
but still thank you
for worrying about me.

43
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:37,957
I’m your senior.

44
00:02:39,457 --> 00:02:40,707
That place is old and shabby.

45
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:41,675
Who would buy it?

46
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:43,157
The rent is reduced.

47
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:44,075
Is that for charity?

48
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:45,625
Hold on.

49
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,166
It can’t be...

50
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,666
Yin Sichen?

51
00:02:50,332 --> 00:02:51,550
This is what I should do.

52
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,900
Not good.

53
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,916
It doesn’t feel like
I’m accepting her gratitude.

54
00:02:58,916 --> 00:02:59,916
It’s a small thing.

55
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:01,832
Not good.

56
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:04,791
You’re welcome.

57
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:08,375
Not good, either.

58
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:24,582
Why are you here?

59
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,707
Grandma asked me
to take good care of you.

60
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,250
I made soup for you.

61
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:32,425
Okay.

62
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,332
Just put it here.

63
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,250
Is there anything else?

64
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:43,625
Is there anything else?

65
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,207
No.

66
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:48,225
No?

67
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:52,832
Yes.

68
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:53,832
I’m leaving then.

69
00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:03,457
Don’t you have anything to say to me?

70
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,582
What?

71
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,125
Report to me where you went today,

72
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,925
and who you met.

73
00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:18,300
I got up at 7:00 AM.

74
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,550
Then I washed up and had breakfast.

75
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,850
I went for a run.

76
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:24,708
Then,

77
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,165
I sorted out the manuscript.

78
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,450
I had lunch at noon.

79
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,290
Then it’s the afternoon. That’s it.

80
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,000
That’s it?

81
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,040
Didn’t you come across something

82
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,415
that you’re curious about

83
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,625
or something

84
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,625
you can’t figure out?

85
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:48,915
No.

86
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,708
Is your phone charge overdue?

87
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,125
Can you receive a call?

88
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,500
Yeah.

89
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,375
Did you call your mother today?

90
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,165
Yes.

91
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:57,915
What did she say?

92
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,415
She asked me what I ate

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,833
and if it was cold outside.

94
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,175
And...

95
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:05,875
Are you gonna ask that, too?

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,725
Just leave.

97
00:05:10,165 --> 00:05:10,750
Leave.

98
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,750
But there is something very strange.

99
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,250
Well,

100
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,915
a dumb boss

101
00:05:22,915 --> 00:05:24,375
bought my mother’s store.

102
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:26,540
A dumb boss?

103
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:27,875
Yeah.

104
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,083
How dumb?

105
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,600
Super dumb.

106
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,000
It’s not you, right?

107
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,375
What do you know?

108
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,665
I think the street is well located.

109
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,925
The subway and shops
are under construction.

110
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,900
It should be good if they build
a commercial district there.

111
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:43,915
Well,

112
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:45,833
is your mother’s store also there?

113
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,458
So

114
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,083
you asked me all these strange questions

115
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,500
to suggest this, right?

116
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,250
Thank you, Boss Yin.

117
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,125

118
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:04,675
Yeah.

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000

00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,550
I don’t know
what kind of overalls you want,

194
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,916
so I designed three kinds.

195
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:03,583
Take a look.

196
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:04,625
Let me see.

197
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,575
(Three Designs of Overalls)

198
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,125
I want these three.

199
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,416
All of them?

200
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:13,208
Zixin.

201
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,375
I know you want to help me.

202
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,625
But you don’t have to do this.

203
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,675
Don’t take me wrong.

204
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,458
These three designs are all good.

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,800
It’s too hard for me to choose.

206
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,333
By the way,

207
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,166
didn’t you say
that you want to open a store recently?

208
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,275
I thought about this before.

209
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,166
But after further thought,

210
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,350
I realize I don’t have enough funds yet,

211
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,791
and I don’t have a professional team
to run it.

212
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,025
Recently, our company
has a support program

213
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,000
for creative shop owners.

214
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,125
We provide money,

215
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,958
and you provide creative products.

216
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,416
I think it’s perfect for you.

217
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,250
I don’t know
if you are interested in it.

218
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:52,950
Zixin.

219
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,375
Your plan is really good.

220
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,825
It seems to be tailor-made for me.

221
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,500
Then I’ll sign up for you right away.

222
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,166
Thank you, Zixin.

223
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,291
I think I’ll pass for now.

224
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:14,625
I see.

225
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,166
Okay.

226
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,083
Well,

227
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,083
you can tell me anytime

228
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:19,875
once you decide.

229
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,000
Don’t worry, Zixin.

230
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,208
I will consider it carefully.

231
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,166
Now that you got the designs,

232
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,208
I will leave you to your work.

233
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:27,916
I’m leaving then.

234
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:28,416
Okay.

235
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,475
(Zhao Zegang)

236
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:52,916
Hello.

237
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,300
Xixi, it’s me.

238
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,125
What’s up?

239
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,450
Do you have time lately?

240
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:57,791
I want to see you.

241
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,083
Just say it on the phone.

242
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:00,958
Let’s talk face to face.

243
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,250
At five o’clock this afternoon.

244
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,291
I’ll send you the address.

245
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,291
See you there.

246
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,225
Zhao Zegang, I...

247
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:09,650
Gu Xixi.

248
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,875
Why are you walking so quietly?

249
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:16,875
You scared me.

250
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,825
I think that’s because
you have a guilty conscience.

251
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,875
I’m here to pick a tie.

252
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,416
If you are going to meet a girl,

253
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,833
this shirt in your hand
matches the blue tie better.

254
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,416
Just a friendly tip.

255
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,350
This one?

256
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,200
Yes.

257
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,791
Thanks.

258
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,275
So you are going to see a girl.

259
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,425
What does it have to do with me?

260
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:52,050
Why do you want to eat here?

261
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,458
You are a married man now.

262
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,458
If someone sees

263
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,750
us eating together,

264
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,750
it will cause you unnecessary trouble.

265
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,166
This restaurant is relatively private.

266
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:02,958
So

267
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:03,916
I made a reservation here.

268
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,375
Let’s order.

269
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:06,525
Yeah.

270
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:11,166
How’s your married life?

271
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:11,850
Not bad.

272
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:13,541
How about your company?

273
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,075
All the preparatory work has been done.

274
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,583
The decoration is almost done.

275
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,500
The ceremony for the relocation
is in a few days.

276
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,541
After we sign the contract
with the investors,

277
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,791
we can officially open it.

278
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,791
You must come on the opening day.

279
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,000
Sure.

280
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:27,850
By the way,

281
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,625
I’m gonna

282
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,166
- make an exclusive interview with you.
- What would you like?

283
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,300
You know,

284
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,916
many media covet

285
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,500
your first interview.

286
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,041
So you must save it for me.

287
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:38,916
I can promise you that.

288
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,625
But business is business.

289
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,291
I won’t let you distort the truth

290
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,583
just because you are my friend.

291
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,208
Don’t you trust me?

292
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,583
I’m not one of those tabloids out there.

293
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,916
What I run

294
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,916
is a fashion studio.

295
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,250
Let me show you the interview column.

296
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,083
Sichen.

297
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:02,075
Yeah.

298
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:07,050
If it was me

299
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,500
who went to

300
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,583
Alex’s cocktail party with you that day,

301
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,166
would everything end differently?

302
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,500
There is no “if” in the world.

303
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,550
If you can change the past
when you regret it,

304
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,416
there won’t be the so-called fate.

305
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,800
What would you like to eat?

306
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,650
I think this is good.

307
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,200
Okay, I’ll order this.

308
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,125
Xixi.

309
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:35,925
There you are.

310
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,375
Why do you want to see me?

311
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,541
I’m here to ask for your forgiveness.

312
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:41,950
I was wrong.

313
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,225
I hope you give me a chance
to explain it.

314
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,458
Go ahead then.

315
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,125
What did you do wrong?

316
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,000
I know what I did

317
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
broke your heart.

318
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,791
I regret it a lot.

319
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,475
I had no choice at that time

320
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,958
when I broke up with you.

321
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,550
I really love you.

322
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,725
I was just a clerk at the time.

323
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,041
I had no car, and no house.

324
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,250
I didn’t want to drag you down.

325
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,500
Do you have a car and a house now?

326
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,166
You can continue to pick on me.

327
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,650
It was my mistake after all.

328
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,250
I understand

329
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,250
you are mad at me.

330
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,708
You know,

331
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,833
every day before I go to sleep,

332
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,200
I think of our old days.

333
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,000
Those pictures

334
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,541
are so vivid.

335
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,125
The school building 3

336
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,416
and the school playground.

337
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,375
Xixi.

338
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,166
I’m thinking about you all the time.

339
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:35,541
How about you?

340
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,791
Of course, me too.

341
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,525
I’m thinking
how you can be so shameless!

342
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,025
Xixi.

343
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,833
I know that’s not how you really feel.

344
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,950
Look, you’ve lost weight these days.

345
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,708
Yes, I have.

346
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,041
And I lost weight

347
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,825
because of Yin Sichen.

348
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,166
Because he is too good.

349
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,125
I’m stressed out

350
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,208
standing next to a man like him.

351
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:04,916
You know?

352
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,583
Yin Sichen has such an exquisite face

353
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,958
and a chiseled side face.

354
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,041
He is simply

355
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,208
the best example of a master sculpture.

356
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,958
Not to mention his figure.

357
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,500
Even models
will feel ashamed of themselves.

358
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,666
Have you heard of what they call him?

359
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,958
Girls’ Dream Lover.

360
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,750
After I saw him in person, I realized

361
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,750
that the title is nothing short of

362
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,375
a great insult to him.

363
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,833
He is more than the girls’ dream lover.

364
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:28,666
He is simply

365
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,200
the dream lover
of all living female creatures.

366
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,150
How can I not lose weight

367
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,583
after I marry such an excellent man?

368
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,791
Xixi, I know
you are not a superficial person.

369
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,916
You only said these things
to wind me up.

370
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,350
You are right.

371
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,458
I’m not such a superficial person.

372
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Then let’s talk about

373
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,791
Yin Sichen’s talent and ability.

374
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:48,083
Look,

375
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,375
he owns Why Mall,

376
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,541
backed by the Yin Group.

377
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:51,666
But these are

378
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,208
just his basic configuration.

379
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,083
He reads and works out

380
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:55,958
every day.

381
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,375
He is proficient in
languages of various countries.

382
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,666
I know Yin Sichen is successful,

383
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,400
but does he have time for you?

384
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,300
Can he give you the happiness you want?

385
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,000
Actually,

386
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,416
before I met Yin Sichen,

387
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,500
I always thought

388
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
those soap operas are too dramatic,

389
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,666
but after living with him, I found out

390
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,208
that those soap operas
are very restrained.

391
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:16,750
In the morning,

392
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,791
he woke me up
with an affectionate kiss,

393
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,750
- then he carried me to the dining room.
- Sichen.

394
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,750
- I’ll go to the lady’s room.
- I think the first bite of food I ate

395
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,350
was the cake he made by himself.

396
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,791
Before he went to work,

397
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,625
he kept kissing me goodbye.

398
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,541
He reluctantly parted with me

399
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,625
until the driver
urged him countless times.

400
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,791
We cuddle every night when we sleep.

401
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,800
You know it now.

402
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,416
Since you know it,
don’t come to me again.

403
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,083
Don’t make it awkward for us.

404
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:46,916
Thanks.

405
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,000
Xixi.

406
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,175
Zhao Zegang wants to get back together
with you?

407
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:00,825
Yeah.

408
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,375
What is he doing?

409
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,992
He is really scum.

410
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:06,225
If you hadn’t

411
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:07,458
been determined to be with him,

412
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,583
I would have tarred and feathered him.

413
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,500
But why did he

414
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,875
want to get back to you now?

415
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,625
Is it because he got jealous?

416
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,333
He got some nerve

417
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,833
to compete with Yin Sichen for a woman.

418
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,125
He doesn’t have the guts.

419
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,833
What is he up to then?

420
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,400
He asked me out

421
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,041
and kept the evidence
that we met to blackmail me.

422
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,541
I’m Mrs. Yin now.

423
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,000
You knew it already?

424
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,000
I didn’t know it

425
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,625
until he said
he wanted to get back to me

426
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,500
during the meal.

427
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,750
Besides, the table we were sitting at

428
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:44,833
in the coffee shop

429
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:45,833
can be seen completely

430
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,750
from the outside.

431
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,750
Doesn’t it mean

432
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,583
that he has the evidence
of your meeting in private?

433
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,458
Don’t panic.

434
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,333
Speaking of this,

435
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,791
I need to thank Yin Sichen.

436
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,083
Because

437
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,083
I’m used to

438
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,500
recording books for him every night now.

439
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,833
I bring a recorder with me all the time.

440
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,458
So I recorded everything.

441
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,250
You are such a clever girl.

442
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,166
Let me listen!

443
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,166
Stop it. It’s nothing.

444
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,225
(Zhao Zegang)
Gu Xixi.

445
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,333
I think we should meet again.

446
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,900
Who is it? What’s wrong?

447
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,275
(Yin Sichen)
Gu Xixi, come back now.

448
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,208
It’s urgent.

449
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,225
I’ll be right back.

450
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,625
Boss.

451
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,350
What’s urgent?

452
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,000
I’m your husband at home.

453
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,375
Didn’t you say it’s urgent?

454
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,475
I’m going to sleep.

455
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,625
What’s urgent about sleeping?

456
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,291
Don’t judge others by your standards.

457
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,500
I remember you said it.

458
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,625
And you don’t know

459
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,375
how important

460
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,291
a good sleep is

461
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,825
for someone with severe insomnia.

462
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,250
Okay.

463
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,775
The earth is round,

464
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,350
like an orange.

465
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,458
Ursula can’t stand it anymore.

466
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,541
If you have to go crazy,

467
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,041
just do it alone.

468
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,041
You’ve read this chapter.

469
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,375
You should start from

470
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,541
the third paragraph of chapter two.

471
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,325
You will fall asleep
after I read a few sentences.

472
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,458
Is there any difference?

473
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,291
It’s your job.

474
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,916
You have to take it seriously.

475
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:00,875
Okay.

476
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,000
José Arcadio Buendía

477
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,208
can’t believe
that his wife is so determined.

478
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,500
He tried to seduce her with his dreams

479
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,625
and promised to take her
to a magical world

480
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,291
where she only needs to sprinkle
a little magic water on the fields

481
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,958
and the crops will grow as she wants.

482
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,541
Why are you looking at me?

483
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,000
Do you have something on your mind?

484
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,500
No.

485
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,750
As my wife,

486
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,541
when do you get to see

487
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,458
other men in private?

488
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,916
In private?

489
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,500
Yin Sichen, you followed me?

490
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,500
I don’t bother to follow you.

491
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,833
I just happened to see you there.

492
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,875
Did you hear what we were talking about?

493
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,041
Do you think I have nothing else to do?

494
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,791
What did you say, though?

495
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,041
Nothing.

496
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,375
Nothing at all.

497
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:21,083
But, you asked me
to come back so urgently

498
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,166
just to question me about this?

499
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,750
Are you jealous?

500
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,250
I’m jealous?

501
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,083
Gu Xixi.

502
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,291
I just want to remind you of something.

503
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:35,833
You not only

504
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,750
have to act as my wife on the outside,

505
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:38,458
but also

506
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:41,041
accept the fact on the inside.

507
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:42,875
Otherwise, I’m afraid

508
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,291
you might not be qualified for the job.

509
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,708
Is my brain also under your control now?

510
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,250
I don’t have time for your tiny brain.

511
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,458
I just want to remind you

512
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:52,333
the penalty.

513
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:53,791
You...!

514
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,625
Why are you mentioning money again,
Yin Sichen?

515
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,050
You’re such an unsympathetic jerk.

516
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,541
I would never ask anyone

517
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:01,958
to have empathy for me

518
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:02,583
and

519
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,833
I would never have such a thing
for anyone.

520
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:07,708
I’ll go to the study tonight.

521
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,300
You should reflect on yourself.

522
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:12,775
I...

523
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,250
You jerk!

524
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,150
Yin Sichen.

525
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,200
You’re such an unsympathetic jerk.

526
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,200
Mom.

527
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,250
Where are my toys?

528
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,375
I asked Ms. Zhang to throw them away.

529
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,833
But I like them a lot.

530
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,166
No.

531
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,025
I’ll ask Ms. Zhang to find them for me.

532
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,375
So it was Ms. Zhang

533
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,208
who got them back for you.

534
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:11,675
All right.

535
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,450
I’ll fire her tomorrow.

536
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,125
But she didn’t mean to do it.

537
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,000
Sichen.

538
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,250
Just remember,

539
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
affection is a useless emotion.

540
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,416
It will only affect your judgment

541
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:23,708
and your future.

542
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,575
From today,

543
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,125
just be the best.

544
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:29,250
Why?

545
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,541
Because you are Yin Sichen.

546
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,625
Your goal is to win everything.

547
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,125
You only need to be yourself.

548
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,725
Let go of the things

549
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,475
you like and you sympathize with.

550
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,875
This is the new release.

551
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:58,083
The release date is set on the 17th.

552
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,000
Kuaikan Comics

553
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,458
still wants you to attend the signing,

554
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,625
but I refused them as always.

555
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,025
(Flash Marriage of a President
and His Fake Wife)

556
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,583
Master Nianxi’s offprint

557
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:10,708
is coming soon.

558
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:13,041
I don’t know if there will be
a book signing this time.

559
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:15,583
I really want to see Master Nianxi.

560
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:20,083
Tell them that I will attend
the book signing.

561
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,150
Okay.

562
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:21,791
By the way,

563
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,300
prepare a mask for me.

564
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,575
I see.

565
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,083
Grandma, morning.

566
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:35,625
Sichen.

567
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:37,458
Well,

568
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:40,225
you got married not long ago

569
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:42,250
and you went to sleep
in the study again.

570
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,166
Can’t you think about Xixi’s feelings?

571
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:47,500
You are so inconsiderate.

572
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:48,875
What’s this?

573
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:50,541
I recorded the book.

574
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,725
You can listen to it
when you lose sleep.

575
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:56,950
I’ve forgiven you for...

576
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:58,325
Grandma, I’m full.

577
00:25:58,425 --> 00:25:59,100
Well...

578
00:25:59,166 --> 00:25:59,950
I’m leaving, bye.

579
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:00,800
You...

580
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,800
Grandma, I’m leaving, too.

581
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,166
You...

582
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:12,708
My lady.

583
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:16,083
Are they in a mood?

584
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:17,375
I saw Mr. Yin

585
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:18,666
sleeping in his study last night.

586
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:19,425
Madam Song.

587
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,550
Get a locksmith here today.

588
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,208
But there is no broken lock.

589
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,400
Not to fix a lock,

590
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:27,666
but to install a lock.

591
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:29,625
You have a charity basketball game

592
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:31,333
with the board of directors

593
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:33,041
at 8:00 AM

594
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,041
and you will discuss

595
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,791
the company’s positioning in marketing
for the next quarter.

596
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,083
You have a lunch meeting

597
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,916
with Zhang Jinlan of Jinsen

598
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:39,833
at 12:00 PM.

599
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,000
You are going to Miss Ran Xiwei’s
new company

600
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,625
at 7:00 PM.

601
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,075
What about the thing
I asked you to look into?

602
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:48,700
Here is the profile of Zhao Zegang.

603
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,583
(Zhao Zegang Jiangbei University)
He isn’t doing well financially lately.

604
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:52,875
(2020.01-present Unemployment)
He owed a lot of money.

605
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,375
Seems that he will take other actions.

606
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,625
Do you think
Gu Xixi will be fooled by him again

607
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:00,208
because she is too stupid?

608
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,041
Even if Miss Gu is stupid,

609
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,750
she is not as stupid as you think.

610
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,416
I have sent people

611
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:06,000
to protect Miss Gu

612
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,500
24 hours a day

613
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,750
and to keep an eye on Zhao Zegang.

614
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:09,708
You don’t need to worry about it.

615
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:11,708
Who is worried about her?

616
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,291
Her IQ is not stable.

617
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,050
I don’t want her to cause me trouble.

618
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:18,500
Don’t you need to work?

619
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,125
What a slap in the face!

620
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,750
There are more than
1,000 pieces in stock.

621
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,750
The new product

622
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:33,791
is selling pretty well.

623
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:34,675
Xixi.

624
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,208
(Zhao Zegang)
I want to see you tonight.

625
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,325
Zhao Zegang?

626
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:38,541
This scum.

627
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:39,958
He still has the nerve to ask you out?

628
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:40,791
What does he want?

629
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,000
I guess he wants

630
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:44,750
to get money from me.

631
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:46,300
Let’s go.

632
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:47,791
What are you doing?

633
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,541
Let’s call the police.

634
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,225
I’m gonna send this scumbag to prison.

635
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,233
I’m so mad.

636
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,166
If we call the police now,

637
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,300
do we have evidence?

638
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,150
What to do then?

639
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:00,208
I think

640
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:01,458
I should meet him.

641
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:03,166
Or it will never end.

642
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,875
I have to solve it.

643
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,250
Okay.

644
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:07,850
Xiaoya.

645
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,450
Yeah.

646
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,534
I’ll go to see him.

647
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:11,125
Just in case,

648
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:12,416
you drive there

649
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,750
and wait for me

650
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:14,708
about a kilometer from that place.

651
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:15,583
If I’m in any danger,

652
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:16,833
just hurry over and save me.

653
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,041
Okay.

654
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,250
Xiwei.

655
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,575
Sichen, there you are.

656
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,333
Congratulations.

657
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,041
Thanks.

658
00:28:31,075 --> 00:28:32,500
The guests

659
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,833
are all gone.

660
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:34,791
There is no one in the company now.

661
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:35,416
Let me show you around?

662
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:36,050
Okay.

663
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:47,575
Why do you want to see me here?

664
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,175
There are few people here.

665
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:50,958
You don’t want to be photographed again,
right?

666
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:52,708
Say it.

667
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,625
What do you want?

668
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,125
Two million yuan.

669
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:56,250
It’s not a lot.

670
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:58,075
As long as you give me two million yuan,

671
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,833
I won’t send out your photos.

672
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,000
You can continue to be Mrs. Yin

673
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,625
and you won’t
cause Yin Sichen any trouble.

674
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,708
Since I can’t

675
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,458
see the world with you,

676
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,375
I’ll just try to catch up with you.

677
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,850
Then you have to work harder.

678
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,875
I’ll try to catch up with you.

679
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:18,750
You still have this painting.

680
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:20,958
Of course, I keep it.

681
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,333
This painting

682
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,500
is the first gift you gave me.

683
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:26,400
How could I not keep it?

684
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:29,000
I’m a nostalgic person.

685
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:31,416
How old were we at that time?

686
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,900
Five years old or...

687
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,150
Speaking of that,

688
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,083
we have known each other for 20 years.

689
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,334
If we all live to be 100 years old,

690
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:43,541
we will have lived

691
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:44,958
one fifth of our lives.

692
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:48,475
So we should cherish

693
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,666
the remaining four-fifths
of our lives even more.

694
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:53,675
Yeah.

695
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:55,800
Sichen.

696
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:56,625
Yeah?

697
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:59,208
There is something
I’ve always wanted to tell you.

698
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,700
Before this,

699
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,416
I’ve never

700
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,125
regretted anything in my life.

701
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:10,458
But I regret it this time.

702
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,666
I regret that I didn’t

703
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:15,208
go to Alex’s party with you.

704
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,208
If it was me

705
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:19,375
who went to Alex’s party with you,

706
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,750
would everything end differently?

707
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:28,291
Sichen, I like you.

708
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:31,125
I’ve been liking you for 20 years.

709
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:41,075
Xiwei.

710
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,958
I...

711
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:45,541
It’s okay.

712
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:48,291
I finally said it.

713
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:51,150
I feel much better now.

714
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:54,791
These words

715
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,208
have been held in my heart for too long.

716
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,916
But from the moment I saw you,

717
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:06,208
I can’t hold it back anymore.

718
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,000
Sorry

719
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:10,541
to cause you trouble.

720
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:11,416
It’s okay.

721
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:23,250
I need to answer this.

722
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:23,800
Yeah.

723
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:26,425
Hi, Yin Sichen.

724
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:27,875
You have to save Gu Xixi now.

725
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,291
Something might happen to Xixi.

726
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:31,250
My car broke down.

727
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,275
So you asked me to meet you
at that place yesterday

728
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,300
and took photos of us

729
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,625
just to extort two million yuan from me?

730
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,000
Or what?

731
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,208
Don’t tell me
you think so highly of yourself

732
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,791
that you assume
I still have feelings for you.

733
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,500
You think too highly of yourself.

734
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:48,325
You won’t give me the money?

735
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:49,666
Gu Xixi, do you want me

736
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,750
to send out the photos?

737
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,708
It’s up to you.

738
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:55,041
You can send them out if you want.

739
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:56,925
I’m leaving.

740
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:01,100
What’s in your bag?

741
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,916
Give it back to me!

742
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:05,000
You recorded it?

743
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,725
No.

744
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,600
Gu Xixi, give me the recorder!

745
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:28,600
Gu Xixi.

746
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,125
It’s your last chance.

747
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,175
Will you give me the recorder or not?

748
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:45,125
Don’t you dare hurt my woman!

749
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,900
Are you okay?

750
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,166
♪The night sky is lit up♪

751
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:54,708
Sichen.

752
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:55,625

You really scared me.

How did you suddenly show up there?

Well,

773
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:57,875
I happened to be there.

774
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,333
You are bold enough

775
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:02,916
to meet him again.

776
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,950
He has photos that are against you.

777
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,775
What if he sends them out?

778
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,875
Are you brave or stupid?

779
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:15,325
Sorry.

780
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:18,375
I didn’t expect that he would hurt me.

781
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,333
Humans are vicious.

782
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:23,000
But you are not that stupid.

783
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:24,750
You recorded it

784
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:25,500
to keep evidence

785
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,500
and you asked Lin Xiaoya to pick you up.

786
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,541
If her car didn’t break down halfway,

787
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:34,750
that could be a good plan.

788
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:38,625
I’m still too stupid.

789
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,958
If I’m not stupid,
how could I like him in the first place?

790
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,375
You are not very smart
in terms of the relationship.

791
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,025
You should be glad
to break up with him in time.

792
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:55,775
Don’t get emotionally involved
that easily anymore.

793
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:58,666
I don’t want to, either.

794
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:00,825
But you can’t

795
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,083
control your feelings.

796
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:04,291
You can’t control

797
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:05,583
who you like and who you don’t like.

798
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,958
The more you like it,
the easier you lose it.

799
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:13,833
If you don’t like anything,
you won’t feel the pain of loss.

800
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:17,708
You’ve never been in love, right?

801
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:21,000
Who said it?

802
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,208
Then tell me

803
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,725
what it’s like to fall in love.

804
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:31,791
Falling in love...

805
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:33,125
Yeah.

806
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,666
Falling in love is like
when you get close to someone,

807
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:38,041
certain areas of your brain

808
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,500
become hyperactive,

809
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,708
adrenaline starts pumping,

810
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,250
your heart races

811
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,125
and your palms get sweaty.

812
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:46,775
Your face...

813
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:48,875
Your face...

814
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:01,875
Well?

815
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,750
Is your heart racing now?

816
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,450
No.

817
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:10,875
No?

818
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:14,583
That’s not right.

819
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:16,650
In theory,

820
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,084
it happens
when you get close to the opposite sex.

821
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:20,833
Because when a person

822
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:22,958
gets close to the opposite sex,

823
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:24,725
the brain will secrete dopamine.

824
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,916
This is an instinct.

825
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:28,900
It has nothing to do with love.

826
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:31,208
And also,

827
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,041
the theory that if you don’t like it,
you won’t lose it

828
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:35,000
doesn’t hold up at all.

829
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:37,041
You’ve never been in love before,

830
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:39,083
