23
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:46,500
Yin Sichen,

24
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:49,875
I had a nightmare,

25
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:54,083
where I had the third hand.

26
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:56,500
You did?

27
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:57,750
No.

28
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:00,541
You didn’t have it.

29
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:03,541
I remember I told you

30
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,625
not to visit me
unless you had a reason.

31
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,957
I have a reason.

32
00:02:12,957 --> 00:02:14,000
What reason do you have?

33
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:16,916
Here’s the thing.

34
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,125
Grandma found out that
I slept on the rocking chair.

35
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:23,000
What did you explain, then?

36
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:27,750
I told a clever lie to explain to her.

37
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,375
But I think

38
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,541
the contract we have signed

39
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:34,125
doesn’t seem fair to me.

40
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,416
What do you want, then?

41
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,750
Here’s the thing.

42
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,791
According to our contract,

43
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:44,575
I can have my own room.

44
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,332
An independent and private room.

45
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,291
But for some reason,

46
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,707
I have to sleep in the cloakroom

47
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,707
where there isn’t a bed.

48
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:53,250
There’s only a sofa.

49
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,082
Then I think...

50
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:56,666
Right?

51
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,791
I mean,

52
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:01,457
shall we revise the contract?

53
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,916
You think our contract

54
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:05,166
is unreasonable?

55
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,500
I’m okay to sleep in the cloakroom.

56
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,250
I’m okay with it.

57
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,250
I can accept it.

58
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:14,750
But the payment time...

59
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,250
Could I advance some money?

60
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:20,625
You’re short of money again?

61
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,666
Gu Xixi, don’t you ever work hard?

62
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,250
You’re always short of money.

63
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,332
Who told you that?

64
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:31,875
I’m just defending my legal rights.

65
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,450
As your employer,

66
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:36,625
I don’t agree.

67
00:03:39,707 --> 00:03:41,300
After watching
a TV series about law for days,

68
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,125
you think you’re a lawyer?

69
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,450
Yin Sichen, don’t leave!

70
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,250
Yin Sichen,

71
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,666
I just want to advance some money.

72
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:52,166
I don’t ask for extra money, either.

73
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,707
This is what I deserve.

74
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,207
So, I prefer active girls.

75
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,250
What are you staring at?

76
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,250
The soup you just delivered

77
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,665
was made by Grandma, right?

78
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,425
Mm.

79
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,290
Get some information
before you make use of someone.

80
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:24,790
You may not be aware yet.

81
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,833
That’s the son-giving soup

82
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,800
Grandma especially has made.

83
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,909
(Please abide by the contract.
From 22:00 to 8:00,)

84
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,675
(don’t open this door!)

85
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,083
Right?

86
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:11,833
Yeah.

87
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,833
That one looks good.

88
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,500
Xixi.

89
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,000
Xiaoya.

90
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,125
Why did you buy so many things?

91
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,083
I didn’t buy them.

92
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,250
I came to return them.

93
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,040
Return them?

94
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:25,250
But why?

95
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,125
These are the betrothal gifts
from Yin Sichen.

96
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,125
I picked some
that my grandma hasn’t unpacked.

97
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,375
I’d sell them for money first.

98
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:36,415
Your family requires money again?

99
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,333
Well, say no more.

100
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:38,958
Let’s go.

101
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,165
Sorry, Miss.

102
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:42,458
These clothes are
beyond the return deadline.

103
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,165
We can’t have them returned.

104
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:45,625
Rules are dead,

105
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:46,750
but humans are not.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,915
We’ve bought so many clothes.

107
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:49,040
We’re VIPs, aren’t we?

108
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,540
Shouldn’t we have privileges?

109
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,165
20% off.

110
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,625
We’ll take 20% off the price.

111
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,208
That’ll do.

112
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,208
Miss,

113
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,333
this is our rule.

114
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:56,925
30% off.

115
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,083
How about 30% off?

116
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:00,165
We can’t make the decision.

117
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:02,950
50% off!

118
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,875
That’s the least we can take.

119
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:05,458
Miss,

120
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,500
how about this?

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,800
I’ll call and confirm.

122
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,500
Mm. Thank you.

123
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,375
Thank you.

124
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:10,675
Gu Xixi?

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Miss Ran.

126
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:19,500
What a coincidence

127
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:20,333
to see you here!

128
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,165
Yeah.

129
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,040
We’re doing some shopping.

130
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:24,875
Mm.

131
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,333
Sorry, Miss.

132
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,290
I called the headquarters,

133
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,875
but was told that
we couldn’t have the clothes returned.

134
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:30,540
Sorry for that.

135
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,375
Xiaoya,

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,500
I said when the clothes were too big,

137
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,750
we should have thrown them.

138
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,415
There’s no need
to have them exchanged.

139
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,875
Yes, yes.

140
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,625
I’d also buy some clothes

141
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:47,000
for an activity.

142
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,083
Let’s do some shopping together.

143
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,833
Let’s go.

144
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,083
Who’s she?

145
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:01,000
Yin Sichen’s childhood sweetheart.

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,958
If she finds out our plan,

147
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:02,915
we’ll be screwed.

148
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,000
Go, go, go.

149
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,290
But if we leave like this,

150
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,500
it’ll feel a bit weird.

151
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,165
If I stay, I’ll be doomed.

152
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,833
Defend your dignity.

153
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,458
Let’s fight it out with her.

154
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,458
Go.

155
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,708
Xiaoya, aren’t you asking for trouble?

156
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:18,250
This one looks special.

157
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:20,500
Right?

158
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,583
The design is novel.

159
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:28,500
But the fabric is outdated.

160
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:31,708
Miss Ran, haven’t you watched
fashion shows lately?

161
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:34,790
Several big brands have used
this kind of fabric

162
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,333
for this year’s main dresses.

163
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,333
But honestly,

164
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,958
with a poor match,

165
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:40,958
it’ll make you look old.

166
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,875
Mm.

167
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,200
In contrast,

168
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,333
I prefer the classic style.

169
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:58,165
Doesn’t it look too normal?

170
00:07:58,415 --> 00:07:59,150
Normal?

171
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,875
Some designers like to be bumptious.

172
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:03,875
Sometimes,

173
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,625
their designs with sudden inspiration

174
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,625
are only for daily occasions
such as walking a dog.

175
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,458
It’s too cheap for formal occasions.

176
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:10,458
What do you think?

177
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,415
You have such good taste.

178
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:16,290
This is a replica
of the classic style.

179
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,540
It’s also a limited edition.

180
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,458
There are only three pieces in China.

181
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,625
This is the last one.

182
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,625
Pack it for me.

183
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:21,290
Wait!

184
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,375
I’ll take this.

185
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,500
Lin Xiaoya, are you out of your mind?

186
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,850
Defend your dignity.

187
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,500
You don’t feel hurt
when you use my bank card.

188
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,250
But I...

189
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,416
If I remember correctly,

190
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,750
VIPs have preemption right, right?

191
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,041
Sorry, Miss,

192
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,583
but she has preemption right.

193
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,041
Sorry.

194
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,041
It doesn’t matter.

195
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,666
It’s just a blouse.

196
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,000
As you wish.

197
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,250
Well, Miss Ran,

198
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,250
we’ll leave you alone.

199
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,750
Looks like this is my only option.

200
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,991
(Supervision China General Chamber of Commerce
of Watch & Spectacles and Testing Center, HGSTC)

201
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:19,833
This one is 2,000 yuan.

202
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:20,775
This one is 3,000 yuan.

203
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:21,625
This...

204
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:22,583
It’s 500 yuan.

205
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:26,675
Miss,

206
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,666
may I check your bag?

207
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,125
This?

208
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:30,625
Yes.

209
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,958
You’re lucky to know me
who can recognize your bag.

210
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,083
This is handmade

211
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,625
by the French bag maker Barrett.

212
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,875
I checked it.

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,625
The metal and sewing are good.

214
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,958
And it’s made of rare skin.

215
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,791
I offer 50,000 yuan to buy it.

216
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,375
We won’t sell it.

217
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:54,475
Mm.

218
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,400
100,000 yuan at least.

219
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,291
Sorry, Madam.

220
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,583
This is a gift from someone else.

221
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,500
I won’t sell it, anyway.

222
00:10:03,575 --> 00:10:04,750
I’ll offer 20,000 yuan more.

223
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,291
70,000 in total.

224
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,375
I won’t sell it, either.

225
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,625
Xixi,

226
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,500
let’s ask

227
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,708
if we can mortgage it here.

228
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,500
When you have money,

229
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,041
come back to redeem it.

230
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,250
You’re in urgent need of money.

231
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:15,583
Think about it.

232
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,583
Madam,

233
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,458
this bag matters a lot to me.

234
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,750
If I weren’t in urgent need of money,

235
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,041
I wouldn’t come here.

236
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,708
May I mortgage it here?

237
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,458
And in three months...

238
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,375
In three months,

239
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,666
I’ll come back to redeem it.

240
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,125
If you want it in three months,

241
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,875
you’ll have to pay a higher price.

242
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,583
It’s okay, Madam.

243
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,208
I can accept a higher price.

244
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,708
I’ll mortgage it to you now.

245
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,208
Fine, then.

246
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:42,250
Thank you, Madam.

247
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:43,958
Do keep it for me.

248
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,500
Miss Gu.

249
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,075
Grandma.

250
00:10:57,075 --> 00:10:57,875
You’re having dinner?

251
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,975
Where’s the bag I gave you?

252
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,925
Why didn’t you use it today?

253
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,375
You don’t like it?

254
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,833
You’re wrong, Grandma.

255
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,375
The sun was burning today.

256
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,125
I didn’t want it to be burned.

257
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,583
It’s no big deal.

258
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,541
Bags should be used, right?

259
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,250
If it’s broken, buy a new one.

260
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:22,500
All right.

261
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,375
I’ll use it next time.

262
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:24,708
Mm.

263
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,791
Yes. Be a good girl.

264
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,166
Come on.

265
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,625
Sit down and have dinner with me.

266
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,791
There’re so many dishes.

267
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,208
I can’t finish them.

268
00:11:37,425 --> 00:11:38,041
Grandma,

269
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,250
I had dinner before I was back.

270
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,250
Help yourself to more dishes.

271
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,025
Xixi,

272
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,875
my birthday is next week.

273
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,208
I’ll invite many relatives and friends.

274
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,500
By then,

275
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:51,833
Xixi,

276
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:55,166
do use the bag I gave you.

277
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,583
Next week?

278
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,200
Mm.

279
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,125
Don’t worry, Grandma.

280
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,583
I’ll use it.

281
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:06,666
All right.

282
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,666
She’s coming, I guess.

283
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,541
Almost there.

284
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,208
Mr. Shang,

285
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,208
this is the company’s annual budget.

286
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:25,875
Please review it.

287
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,666
Put... put it here.

288
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:31,458
These are files you have to sign.

289
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,250
Have a look.

290
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,400
Sign them and leave them here.

291
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,250
I’ll come and get them tomorrow.

292
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:35,875
I gotta go.

293
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,550
Well...

294
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,666
Stay with me for a bit longer.

295
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:42,916
All right.

296
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,916
Let’s talk

297
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,041
about the annual budget.

298
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,291
I think for this quarter...

299
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,083
I don’t want to talk about this.

300
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,775
What else do you want to talk about?

301
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,708
By the way,

302
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,000
last time,

303
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,208
you asked me about the manager
of the Planning Department.

304
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,000
The HR Department has given
me several candidates.

305
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:03,750
Have a look.

306
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,000
I picked some good ones.

307
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,000
My hand hurts.

308
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,166
Read for me.

309
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,000
Never think of it.

310
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,625
Your hand is okay. Read it yourself.

311
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,550
No.

312
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,125
You can build Lego with one hand?

313
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,333
I... I built it before.

314
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,666
I asked the nanny to bring it to me.

315
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,708
I’d like to have a look.

316
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,791
I used to love this, too.

317
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,250
But it was out of stock.

318
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,083
Then I failed to buy one.

319
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,208
Shall I build it for you?

320
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,100
Sure.

321
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,000
Do it and I’ll watch.

322
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:39,875
Okay.

323
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,166
Teach me.

324
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:42,916
- Where shall I put this?
- No, no, no.

325
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:43,750
It’s... it’s not there.

326
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,583
Not there?

327
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,041
No, no.

328
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:46,750
- Mm...
- Why doesn’t it feel right?

329
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,583
It’s... it’s broken.

330
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:48,475
I...

331
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,041
No, no, no.

332
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,666
When was your hand recovered?

333
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,333
Yeah.

334
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,041
When was it?

335
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,250
Lego has magic.

336
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,916
It healed my hand immediately.

337
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:02,750
How efficient!

338
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,125
Go to the company
for a meeting tomorrow.

339
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:07,875
Yes.

340
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,400
You kept eating this these days?

341
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:20,525
Mm.

342
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,291
You slept on the sofa?

343
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,150
Mm.

344
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,625
My apartment is big.

345
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,783
But I feel the most secure
to sleep on the sofa.

346
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,050
Are you saying
you’re afraid of darkness?

347
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,291
No.

348
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,541
I’m afraid of thunder and rain.

349
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,000
When I was little,

350
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,541
my parents did business
away from home.

351
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:44,625
I stayed alone.

352
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,250
When there was thunder and rain,

353
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,375
I was scared.

354
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,666
Then I came onto the sofa,

355
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,250
put the quilt on me,

356
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,250
huddled myself up,

357
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,125
and turned on the TV.

358
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,700
With sound and light,

359
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,833
I would be less scared.

360
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:04,833
Are you hungry?

361
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,500
Delicious. I feel so happy.

362
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:11,600
Wow.

363
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,475
It’s the best noodles I’ve ever had.

364
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,500
What a surprise!

365
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,950
You work so brilliantly

366
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,291
and even cook so well.

367
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,000
Stop that.

368
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,666
Just some instant noodles.

369
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,775
More than that.

370
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:27,958
You made the noodles for me.

371
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,291
I’m quite satisfied.

372
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,125
Let me help you.

373
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:34,166
I...

374
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,583
Wash it yourself.

375
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:07,350
I...

376
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:10,958
I was so stupid.

377
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,375
If I kissed her,

378
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,458
I would just be punched at most.

379
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:17,000
Coward!

380
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,600
Is your grandson all right abroad?

381
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:22,916
Everything’s all right with him.

382
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:27,500
Come on.

383
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,250
Hello.

384
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:31,958
Be careful.

385
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:32,541
Hello.

386
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,375
- Ms. Zhang, long time no see.
- Go accompany my old friends.

387
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,500
- Talk to you later.
- Hello, Miss Ran.

388
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,275
Mm.

389
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,166
Come on.

390
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:42,500
Grandma.

391
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:42,875
Cheers.

392
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,291
At last, you’ve come.

393
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,875
I miss you.

394
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,208
I miss you, too, Grandma.

395
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,083
Xixi,

396
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,375
this is Xiwei.

397
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,425
You two met at your wedding, didn’t you?

398
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:53,900
Yes.

399
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:54,875
Hello.

400
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,166
I’ll go talk with my old friends.

401
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,100
Mm.

402
00:16:58,725 --> 00:16:59,333
All right.

403
00:16:59,333 --> 00:16:59,875
Go ahead.

404
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:01,950
There you are.

405
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,475
You’ve come.

406
00:17:02,475 --> 00:17:03,708
At last, there you are.

407
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:04,250
Come and take your seat.

408
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,333
Come on. Be seated.

409
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,200
Please help yourself.

410
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,041
Miss Gu,

411
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,500
you’re not a qualified Mrs. Yin.

412
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,583
Miss Ran,

413
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,333
you can’t judge whether I’m qualified.

414
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,458
As Sichen’s wife,

415
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,541
you should communicate more with them.

416
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,208
Maybe one day, you can use
your social relationship

417
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,083
to help Sichen.

418
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:35,850
Yeah.

419
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,899
Come on. Cheers.

420
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,541
Miss Ran,

421
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,083
what’s your point?

422
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,000
Why could a girl like you

423
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,916
take away everything of mine?

424
00:17:45,675 --> 00:17:46,541
Miss Ran,

425
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,833
what do you mean a girl like me?

426
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:49,625
What do you think?

427
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,208
Do you dare to prove yourself?

428
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,833
Why do I not?

429
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,000
Come with me.

430
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:57,583
Cheers.

431
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,525
Hi.

432
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,925
Let me introduce you.

433
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,475
This is Sichen’s wife,

434
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:05,208
Gu Xixi.

435
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,475
Hello.

436
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:07,833
Miss Gu,

437
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,500
which college did you go to?

438
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,125
Harvard or Cambridge?

439
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:12,583
I majored in design.

440
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,708
It must be Columbia University
or Stanford.

441
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:16,916
I see.

442
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:17,500
Can it be

443
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,333
UCLA

444
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,125
or Parsons?

445
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,041
I studied at Jiangbei College of Design.

446
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,075
It’s also a good college of design
in China.

447
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,625
So far,

448
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,125
there haven’t been
any famous designers.

449
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,041
But I believe there will be some.

450
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:33,875
Xixi,

451
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,000
the dress you wear is nicely designed.

452
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:37,550
Thank you.

453
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,416
I designed it myself.

454
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,916
But I haven’t started my brand yet.

455
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,166
I’m running an online store
with a friend.

456
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,350
- Sichen.
- You can see my designs online.

457
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,375
We’re waiting for you.

458
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,041
Grandma.

459
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:49,625
Mm.

460
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,291
- Hello, Grandma.
- Happy birthday, Grandma.

461
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,125
- Sichen.
- Happy birthday, Grandma.

462
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:54,750
Thanks.

463
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,625
Welcome to Grandma’s birthday party.

464
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,250
Sichen,

465
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,625
what gift have you prepared for me?

466
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,541
Didn’t you say the two suits of pajamas

467
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,375
weren’t comfortable?

468
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,833
I asked Pilly
to pick some fabrics in Italy

469
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,291
and have new pajamas made for you.

470
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,416
This is

471
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,916
designed by CI’s designer.

472
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,625
I recommended it to Sichen.

473
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,575
After such a good gift,

474
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:18,041
- how can we show ours?
- Good.

475
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,125
Miss Gu,

476
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,208
what gift have you prepared?

477
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,708
What’s this? Looks mysterious.

478
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,250
Here it is.

479
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,375
It’s...

480
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,458
- It’s my gift for Grandma.
- Vegetables?

481
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
What kind of gift is it?

482
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,166
Yeah.

483
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,583
How cheap!

484
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,375
Yeah.

485
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,916
Today is Grandma’s birthday.

486
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,375
What a poor gift you’re giving her!

487
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,125
Grandma,

488
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,375
I often saw you

489
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,375
have no appetite.

490
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,500
Then I asked a doctor

491
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,375
to match some vegetables

492
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,291
and made them into pickles

493
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,625
so that you would have a good appetite.

494
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,375
It gives me a lot of appetites.

495
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,375
You exactly know what I want.

496
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,083
Grandma.

497
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:18,550
Mm.

498
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,125
It seems to be a suitable gift.

499
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,291
But isn’t it too...?

500
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,750
She’s the hostess of the Yin Family.

501
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,708
Whatever she gives is suitable.

502
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,500
Anyway, Grandma likes the gift.

503
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:32,125
Mm.

504
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,833
A gift is never measured by its price.

505
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:38,916
- Grandma.
- Mm.

506
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,166
When I was shopping in a mall,

507
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,300
I saw a bag.

508
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,791
It looks the same

509
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,208
as the bag you designed.

510
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,666
I bought it to make them a pair.

511
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:49,833
Good things should be in pairs.

512
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,550
The same?

513
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,150
How is that possible?

514
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,958
I designed the bag myself.

515
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,125
It’s the one and only in the world.

516
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:07,250
Madam,

517
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,083
I’ll take this bag.

518
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,400
It’s quite expensive.

519
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,500
Name your price.

520
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,250
Fine.

521
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:16,541
Xixi.

522
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:18,625
Xixi?

523
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,833
What happened?

524
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:21,416
Xixi.

525
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,833
No idea.

526
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,041
Come, Xixi.

527
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:27,375
It...

528
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:28,625
Grandma.

529
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,416
Xixi,

530
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,125
go get the bag I gave you

531
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,500
and show it to everybody.

532
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,791
- I’ll see what she can take out.
- All right?

533
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:35,791
Wait and see.

534
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,333
Maybe she just sold it.

535
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,125
Yeah.

536
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,375
She’ll make a fool of herself again.

537
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,625
- Xixi.
- I’ll see what she can show us.

538
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,400
She’s so disgraced.

539
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,000
Grandma.

540
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,583
- Grandma.
- Actually...

541
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,200
Mm.

542
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,166
The bag is in the room.

543
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,541
I’ll go get it with Xixi.

544
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,250
Go ahead. Be quick.

545
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:57,625
Tell me.

546
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:58,625
What happened?

547
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,750
Why does Ran Xiwei have your bag?

548
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:30,500
You faked a good one.

549
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:33,791
Where did you get it?

550
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,750
You’re really making the same bag?

551
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,666
I have to make it today.

552
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,875
If Grandma can’t see it

553
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,000
at her birthday party,

554
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,208
she’ll be very sad.

555
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,375
I made the bag.

556
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:52,833
The real one...

557
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,583
I sold it.

558
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,500
Madam,

559
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,525
where’s my bag?

560
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:01,750
I sold it.

561
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,291
What?

562
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:04,708
The buyer offered a high price

563
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:05,750
that I couldn’t refuse.

564
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:07,300
You...

565
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,000
Fine.

566
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,275
It’s honest of you.

567
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,041
I’ll go out

568
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,083
and admit my mistake to Grandma.

569
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:26,541
Gu Xixi,

570
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,791
you’re not only greedy for money,

571
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,416
but also have no empathy.

572
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,083
Today is Grandma’s birthday.

573
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,500
Do you want her to remember

574
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,625
the most unforgettable
and hurting moment?

575
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:42,666
What should I do, then?

576
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,125
Don’t say anything when you go out.

577
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:45,800
I’ll explain.

578
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:47,875
Later,

579
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:49,750
I’ll get even with you.

580
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:56,375
Xixi,

581
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,375
come on.

582
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:57,916
Grandma.

583
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,291
Come and show it to me.

584
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,375
Yeah.

585
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,050
It’s right, Xixi.

586
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,791
This is the bag I gave Xixi.

587
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:08,925
Nothing’s wrong.

588
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:09,583
Look.

589
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,833
What’s the problem?

590
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:11,708
Something’s wrong, Grandma.

591
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:13,291
What’s wrong?

592
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,041
The colors are different.

593
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:15,750
Yeah.

594
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:16,791
She’s right.

595
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,291
They’re different.

596
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,416
The colors are different?

597
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,166
Grandma,

598
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,041
let me check it for you.

599
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:23,925
Mm.

600
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,416
These two bags are indeed different

601
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:30,800
in some details.

602
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,041
Which one is real?

603
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:35,000
And which one is fake but looks so real?

604
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,750
How about this?

605
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,166
I’ll go get an appraiser

606
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,208
to appraise the bags.

607
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,708
Then we’ll know the truth.

608
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:42,775
- There’s no need.
- Yes, yes.

609
00:24:42,775 --> 00:24:43,500
An appraiser will recognize it.

610
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,000
Grandma,

611
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,666
these two bags are both real.

612
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,375
They are?

613
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,416
Now, designers make a sample

614
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:51,708
before they make the real product.

615
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:53,875
After revising

616
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,150
some details,

617
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:56,375
they make the final product.

618
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,541
That’s why there are two bags.

619
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,208
That explains.

620
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,708
I understand now.

621
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,500
There isn’t any problem, then.

622
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,150
Sorry, Grandma.

623
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,416
It’s my problem.

624
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,375
I asked Barrett to make the bag for you.

625
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:14,833
I’ll go ask him.

626
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:16,208
Don’t.

627
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:17,583
Don’t bother him.

628
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:22,000
If he hears about it,

629
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:23,916
he’ll find it funny.

630
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:25,150
Xiwei,

631
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,125
this is where you stop.

632
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,250
Today is Grandma’s birthday.

633
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,791
Don’t make it
an appraising meeting for bags.

634
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:33,791
Yeah, yeah.

635
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,458
Sorry, Grandma.

636
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:37,958
It’s inconsiderate of me.

637
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:39,458
Xiwei,

638
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,750
thank you for your care.

639
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,541
I’ll accept this bag.

640
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:45,400
Mm.

641
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:49,708
Let’s have Grandma cut the cake.

642
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,416
Let’s go cut the cake.

643
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:54,325
Let’s go.

644
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,208
Go cut the cake.

645
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,250
Thank you.

646
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:06,916
Ruona,

647
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,708
you haven’t changed after so many years.

648
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,291
Neither have you.

649
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:11,166
I have.

650
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,416
I’ve grown old.

651
00:26:13,275 --> 00:26:14,291
Ruona, you know what?

652
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:14,875
Last night...

653
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:18,458
He...

654
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,000
Well, let me introduce you.

655
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:21,791
Mr. Fang,

656
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:23,750
this is our CEO,

657
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:24,375
Shang Ke.

658
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,708
Mr. Shang,

659
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,333
this is Fang Ming from Redwood,

660
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:27,925
Mr. Fang.

661
00:26:27,925 --> 00:26:28,916
Hello, Mr. Shang.

662
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:29,791
I’ve heard a lot about you.

663
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,125
Nice to meet you.

664
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,625
You two look familiar.

665
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:36,500
You’ve known each other for long?

666
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:37,541
More than that.

667
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:39,541
Ruona and I have known for a long time.

668
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,291
She nearly became my...

669
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:41,791
Mr. Fang,

670
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:42,958
it’s an old story.

671
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:43,958
Don’t make fun of it, Mr. Fang.

672
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:45,041
Old...?

673
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:48,041
You...

674
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,041
Be seated, please.

675
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,333
I...

676
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,675
Get it started.

677
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,750
We won’t waste our time, then.

678
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,450
Let’s just get to the point.

679
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:15,900
(Gu Xixi and Yin Sichen
attended Granny Yin’s birthday party)

680
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,583
I heard you’re looking for a job.

681
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:22,750
I can offer you

682
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,541
a well-paid job.

683
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:27,000
I wonder if you would like it.

684
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:29,583
What do you want me to do?

685
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:40,083
Send the minutes of the meeting to me.

686
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:40,925
- I gotta go, Ruona.
- Mm.

687
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:42,458
See you next time.

688
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:45,166
See you, Mr. Shang.

689
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,000
See... see you.

690
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:51,208
Get to your work.

691
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:51,958
All right, Miss Mu.

692
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:53,875
See you? Never again.

693
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:55,666
Wait.

694
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,350
What?

695
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:03,208
I feel something special
between you and him.

696
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:07,458
He’s just an ex-colleague
from my previous company.

697
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:10,916
Ex-colleague from your previous company.

698
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,916
Isn’t there any...?

699
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:14,375
Any special...

700
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:15,041
Ex-boyfriend.

701
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:17,125
I’ll leave you alone.

702
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:39,650
I know you don’t want to listen.

703
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,291
But I still want to tell you.

704
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,458
It’s not what you think it is.

705
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,333
You’re not what I think you are, either.

706
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,375
What do you think of me, then?

707
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,208
I take back what I said.

708
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:58,541
You’re exactly what I think you are.

709
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
You delivered the soup to me.

710
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Then you asked to revise the contract.

711
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:02,916
Because I didn’t agree,

712
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,942
you sold the bag Grandma gave you.

713
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:11,416
It’s indeed my fault.

714
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:14,875
But I had a reason for that.

715
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,291
You don’t want to listen, anyway.

716
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,166
Even if you do, you won’t believe me.

717
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:26,583
Stop arguing.

718
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,125
You sold it for nothing but money.

719
00:29:31,075 --> 00:29:31,958
Yin Sichen,

720
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:35,583
you’ve never suffered from hunger.

721
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:37,666
Why can you blame me?

722
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:42,125
I’m going to sleep.

723
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:51,916
Mom, I’m sorry.

724
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,041
Grandma, I’m sorry.

725
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,750
You’ve just been married,

726
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,250
but you quarreled?

727
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,000
No, Grandma.

728
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:33,958
I annoyed him.

729
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,625
Xixi,

730
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,625
take care of my naughty grandson.

731
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:40,708
Sometimes,

732
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:42,583
he just has a bad temper.

733
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:43,600
Grandma.

734
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:45,333
Grandma,

735
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,333
do you have time?

736
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,166
I want to tell you something.

737
00:30:50,425 --> 00:30:51,458
Grandma, I’m full.

738
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:52,583
I’ll leave you alone.

739
00:30:53,725 --> 00:30:54,583
Come with me.

740
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:58,625
It’s okay. It’s okay.

741
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:03,916
Gu Xixi,

742
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,708
if you want to explain to Grandma,

743
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:09,208
I don’t think it’s a good chance.

744
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:10,041
First,

745
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:11,333
you’ll make her sad.

746
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:12,416
Second,

747
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:14,750
she’ll suspect our marriage.

748
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,166
If you feel guilty,

749
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,208
spend more time with her.

750
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:35,750
Miss Gu.

751
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,550
Mm?

752
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:37,750
Anything wrong?

753
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Sorry. Nothing. Nothing.

754
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,708
I’m going to check your paintings.

755
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:56,541
Mo,

756
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:58,250
I have to admit that

757
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,458
you have a talent for painting.

758
00:32:04,325 --> 00:32:05,041
It’s...!

759
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:05,958
What?

760
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,208
Why do you have
Nianxi’s original painting?

761
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:13,000
I... I...

762
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,041
Can it be...?

763
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,400
Are you...?

764
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:20,525
Are you his fan?

765
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,375
Don’t feel shy to admit it.

766
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:27,291
You’re a president,

767
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:28,825
but you like comics for girls...

768
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,350
(Comics for girls and president)

769
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:34,833
It’s...

770
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,375
It’s reasonable, isn’t it?

771
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,100
Mm.

772
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,208
Nianxi paints so well

773
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,000
and he writes great stories.

774
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,416
How will anyone not like him?

775
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,708
Well, I’m too shy to tell you that.

776
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,541
I asked my friend

777
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,708
to get the painting from the publisher.

778
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:54,083
So, we’re both Nianxi’s fans.

779
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:57,375
I’m so jealous of you.

780
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,708
How did you get his original painting?

781
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:01,458
If you like it,

782
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:02,333
I can give it to you.

783
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,166
No, thanks.

784
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:08,541
I can’t have the original painting

785
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:09,958
to suffer with me.

786
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:12,350
What does that mean?

787
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yin Sichen won’t like it.

788
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:16,800
Oh.

789
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:17,583
By the way,

790
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,083
Nianxi’s offprint

791
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,125
will be sold soon.

792
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,666
I wonder if he will hold a book signing.

793
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,083
How I wish I could see him!

794
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:27,708
If he does,

795
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:28,625
will you go?

796
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:32,208
I will, no matter what happens!

797
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:36,583
By the way,

798
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:40,075
now that you married Yin Sichen,

799
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:42,041
do you still run the online store?

800
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:43,675
Mm.

801
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:44,833
I still run it.

802
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:47,458
Actually, I started the online store

803
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:48,416
so that

804
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:50,250
I could open my design store.

805
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:52,750
But it can only be my dream.

806
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,541
How about this?

807
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I have a personal favor

808
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,041
to ask you for.

809
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:00,416
May I invite you to design
the overalls for our staff?

810
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:01,958
You’ll do the tailoring, too.

811
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:03,708
Really?

812
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,400
Mm.

813
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:05,500
Thank you, Senior.

814
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,208
That’d be great.

815
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,166
I’ll write it down.

816
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,300
I’ll write it in my palm.

817
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:28,708
I asked you to check on her.

818
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:29,458
What have you got?

819
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,083
After hanging up yesterday,

820
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,208
I started the investigation.

821
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,833
Miss Gu transferred the money

822
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:34,833
to her mother

823
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:35,916
so that she could pay

824
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:37,583
for the overdue rent.

825
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:39,541
I remember before I married her,

826
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:41,541
I asked you to give her family
some cash gift.

827
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:44,291
It should cover the rent.

828
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,375
According to my survey,

829
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,000
the money was taken

830
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
by her grandma and father.

831
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:49,708
Her family is kind of complicated.

832
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,708
Do you need me to sort it out?

833
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:52,833
No.

834
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:54,333
By the way,

835
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:55,500
here’s the thing

836
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:57,041
I think you should know about.

837
00:34:58,925 --> 00:34:59,722
(Notice for Illegal Overtaking)

838
00:34:59,746 --> 00:35:00,725
(Driver Yin Sichen violated
the Law on Road Traffic Safety.)

839
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:03,791
When I was on my way to the party?

840
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:04,425
Mm.

841
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:05,583
Overtaking?

842
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:07,166
I’ll leave you alone.

843
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:08,208
Wait.

844
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:10,500
In case

845
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,250
Gu Xixi makes some other trouble,

846
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,666
go find out

847
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:15,875
the contact number
of her mother’s landlord.

848
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:16,791
Okay.

849
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,083
Hello.

850
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,475
Hello, Sichen.

851
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,958
Something’s come up!

852
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:30,041
I have a rival in love!

853
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:32,125
Do you know Ruona’s ex-boyfriend?

854
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:33,250
I do.

855
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:34,458
Tell... tell me about him.

856
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:37,400
They were in a relationship
for two or three years.

857
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:38,875
They were even getting married.

858
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,083
I don’t know why,
but they suddenly broke up.

859
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:42,458
For three years?

860
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,083
Suddenly broke up?

861
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,416
But why?

862
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:46,583
It’s their privacy.

863
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:47,500
How could I know?

864
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:48,875
I know.

865
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,350
The man must have cheated on her.

866
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,041
My girl is so cute.

867
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,041
How dare he cheat on her!

868
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:57,458
It’s the bill

869
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,166
of my broken limo

870
00:35:59,166 --> 00:35:59,791
because you overtook my car.

871
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:00,333
Pay for it.

872
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:01,708
He was going so far.

873
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:02,916
He’s exactly a bad guy.

874
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,225
Bad guy...

875
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:06,500
You!

876
00:36:11,725 --> 00:36:12,458
Wow.

877
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:12,958
There you are.

878
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:14,125
Take your seat, please.

879
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:15,250
Okay.

880
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,000
Wow.

881
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:25,125
Mr. Mo, why did you

882
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,250
ask to see me?

883
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:28,166
Miss Lin, you are

884
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,291
a good friend of Xixi’s, aren’t you?

885
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,916
I knew he didn’t see me
because of my charm.

886
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:35,875
Nothing.

887
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:36,833
Well,

888
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,375
what do you want to know?

889
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,625
Is Xixi in some trouble lately

890
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:44,458
and she needs money?

891
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:46,875
How did you know that?

892
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,175
Could you tell me about it?

893
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:02,458
Fine.

894
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,583
I know what you mean.

895
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,083
Enjoy the lunch, please.

896
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,458
Shouldn’t you

897
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,000
offer a lot of things to me,

898
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,625
and then I’d decline

899
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:14,791
before accepting them?

900
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,250
Then I’ll tell you everything about her.

901
00:37:21,775 --> 00:37:23,025
Just kidding.

902
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:23,750
Actually,

903
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,583
I thought you were a mature man.

904
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:28,075
But you turn out to be a cute boy.

905
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,208
Miss Lin, don’t make fun of me.

906
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,166
For the sake

907
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,250
that you care so much about Xixi,

908
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:38,291
I’d like to tell you.

909
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,575
(Mom)

910
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:53,041
Hello, Mom.

911
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:54,083
Anything wrong?

912
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:55,500
Did he bully you again?

913
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,041
No.

914
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,250
Some good news.

915
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:58,875
The stores of this row

916
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:00,458
have been bought by another boss.

917
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,166
Considering we’re regular tenants,

918
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,125
he promised to offer a half price.

919
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,541
He doesn’t take the deposit, either.

920
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:06,458
Pay at the end of every month.

921
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:08,625
The money you gave me

922
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:09,575
has been returned.

923
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:11,166
I’ll transfer it to you tomorrow.

924
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:11,750
All right?

925
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,458
Such good news?

926
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,333
This kind of boss is like an angel.

927
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,416
Yes, yes.

928
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:18,333
So, don’t worry.

929
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,666
We’re going to have good luck.

930
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:22,291
All right.

931
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:23,250
Mom, I’ll say no more.

932
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,000
I gotta go.

933
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:37,675
Xiaoya,

934
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,583
you wear such good makeup.
Who were you meeting?

935
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:42,791
Do you know who I had lunch with?

936
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:43,666
Who?

937
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:45,000
Mo Zixin.

938
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,083
Senior Mo?

939
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,083
He invited me to lunch.

940
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,375
But for you.

941
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:50,500
For me? Why?

942
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:51,666
He noticed that

943
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:53,125
we were selling second-hand goods.

944
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,083
He asked me what happened

945
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,625
and then I explained to him.

946
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,250
I told him about your mother’s trouble.

947
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,708
You sold me out for only a lunch?

948
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:02,958
He’s caring for you.

949
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,950
And you know what?

950
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,041
Today, I realized he’s so cute.

951
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,833
I’ll get even with you later.

952
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:08,708
Gotta go.

956
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:26,625

957
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:28,291

I’m accepting her gratitude.

958
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:31,791
It’s a small thing.

959
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:33,916
You’re welcome.

960
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:37,791
Not good, either.

961
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,833
Will I hurt her self-esteem?

962
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:42,750
It will sound a bit strange.
