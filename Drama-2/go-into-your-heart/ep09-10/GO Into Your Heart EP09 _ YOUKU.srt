Why did they

229
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,670
ask you to do an outdoor interview?

230
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:54,670
Isn't that

231
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,280
the job of newbie reporters?

232
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,400
We were short-handed today.

233
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,320
From now on, you should change your shoes
if there's an outdoor interview.

How can your body stand it

237

if you don't eat when you have
an outdoor interview?

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,960
to cook for us.

385
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,790
Good thing I have a good sense of smell.

386
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,670
So it was easy for me to learn to cook.

387
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,400
I would cook and eat in secret.

388
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,670
And then

389
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,470
my sister joined me.

390
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,440
I cooked in secret

391
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,000
and she ate in secret.

392
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,110
Later,

393
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,350
we all rose up in arms

394
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,200
and took away

395
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,200
my grandmother's right to cook.

396
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,550
And that's when

397
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,790
our food improved a bit.

398
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,230
So,

399
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,200
I will make

400
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,230
some delicious food for myself

401
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,110
whenever

402
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,150
I'm happy or not.

403
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,070
If I'm happy,

404
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,590
I'll take it as a celebration.

405
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,880
If I'm not happy,

406
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,159
I'll take it as trouble

407
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,710
and eat it up.

408
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:11,759
After eating,

409
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,350
I can go back to the fight with full strength.

410
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,590
I'm going to start cooking now.

411
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,590
Please give me some privacy.

412
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,190
Can't I

413
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,070
learn from you here?

414
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:24,880
You're standing next to me

415
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,190
like an examiner.

416
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,560
I'm nervous.

417
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:52,950
Here.

418
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,160
How does it taste?

419
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,920
How is it?

420
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,830
Not bad.

421
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,190
Does it taste the same

422
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,000
as you remember?

423
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,070
So it's different.

424
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,190
Spoon, I...

425
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,310
Nothing.

426
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,350
Let's eat.

427
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,190
So... what went wrong?

428
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,110
Is it

429
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,920
the steps

430
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,710
or the ingredients?

431
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,040
It actually tasted pretty good.

432
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,280
You know what?

433
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,190
Tastes and smells

434
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,110
have a stronger link to memory

435
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,640
than the sense of sight.

436
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,000
Even amnesiacs

437
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,110
can remember what they smelled

438
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,920
and tasted

439
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,590
when they were kids,

440
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,230
not to mention a Go expert like you.

441
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,000
I've heard similar stories.

442
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,160
So

443
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,640
it's true

444
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,880
that food can make us feel good,

445
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,040
but only

446
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,640
if it tastes just right.

447
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,590
Anything less

448
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,350
is not effective.

449
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,430
But I won't give up.

450
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,310
Trust me.

451
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,070
I trust you.

452
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,710
Is this

453
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,800
the recovered yellowstone seal you mentioned?

454
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,640
This agarwood

455
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,160
has a strange smell.

456
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,110
It doesn't smell

457
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,230
as strong as other agarwood,

458
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
but it smells very ancient,

459
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,110
making people feel very reassuring.

460
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,680
You can have it

461
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,710
if you like.

462
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,590
No.

463
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,470
I just want to smell it.

464
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,880
And your garden

465
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,830
is so special.

466
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,520
What's so special about it?

467
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,000
For other people's gardens,

468
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,310
the elegant ones grow flowers

469
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,310
and the practical ones grow vegetables.

470
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,800
Your garden only has

471
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,710
a tree

472
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,800
and grass.

473
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,680
That's too bad.

474
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:45,950
Legend,

475
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,590
I haven't figured out

476
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,710
how to make Mrs. Song's fish soup,

477
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,920
but

478
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,310
I have come up

479
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,830
with an alternative way to repay you.

480
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,470
That should be able to hold you off for a while.

481
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,230
What funny idea did you come up with again?

482
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,310
Your place is so nice.

483
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,760
You really don't have a life.

484
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,830
Turn this place

485
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,590
into a transparent greenhouse.

486
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,070
Flowers are planted all year round.

487
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,110
What kind of a god's life is this?

488
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,760
Now that you've said that,

489
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,760
then please let me live

490
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
a god's life.

491
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,800
Really? You agree?

492
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,400
But I'm afraid you'll have to work hard.

493
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,880
It's not hard at all.

494
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,430
You can't feel the joy

495
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,040
of a Landscape Architecture top student.

496
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,110
I'll come over after work,

497
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,950
and with every weekend,

498
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,560
I guess

499
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,880
it should be finished in no time.

500
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,190
So...

501
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,310
you'll be coming over more often?

502
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,310
Can I?

503
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
It's a deal.

504
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,110
Okay.

505
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,310
Ms. Liu.

506
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,310
Have a seat.

507
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,710
Have some coffee.

508
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,350
Thank you, Ms. Liu.

509
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,520
You don't have to be so polite.

510
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,230
I'm not thirsty.

511
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,520
Don't mention it.

512
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,560
Liao Liao.

513
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,560
You and Mr. Xu are good friends,

514
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,710
but I'm in charge of the show.

515
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,000
There are some requests I have to make.

516
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,070
Do tell.

517
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,830
I'll try my best

518
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,800
to do whatever you want.

519
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,430
Since you're dating

520
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,830
Sheng Jing Chu now,

521
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,760
I won't write gossips about you.

522
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,760
I'll give you the freedom

523
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,830
to date normally.

524
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,520
After all,

525
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,350
we're all on the same side.

526
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,350
Right?

527
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,760
Thank you.

528
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,310
So...

529
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,230
what are you going to do to repay me?

530
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
I'm listening.

531
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,590
I love

532
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,800
your straightforwardness.

533
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,680
Here.

534
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,190
This time, the Jiuzhou Four Seas Cup

535
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,470
will be based in Jiuzhou Dojo,

536
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,560
which will face the best players
from all over the world.

537
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Get me an interview

538
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,830
before the tournament starts.

539
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,800
I can let Sheng Jing Chu off the hook,

540
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,800
but you have to dig me up

541
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,760
a great scoop

542
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,800
from the others.

543
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,430
No.

544
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,520
You...

545
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,110
How great do you want it to be?

546
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,470
Don't leave out

547
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,830
any detail

548
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,280
that might be

549
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,680
of interest.

550
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,640
I...

551
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,400
What?

552
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,310
I'll do my best.

553
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,680
Liao Liao.

554
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,400
I knew

555
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,230
you wouldn't let me down.

556
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,640
I have faith in you.

557
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,760
You can do it!

558
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,160
I'm leaving.

559
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,310
Off you go.

560
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,160
Hold on.

561
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,520
Coffee.

562
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,640
Drink more. It keeps you energetic.

563
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,920
Thank you, Ms. Liu.

564
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,920
Go for it!

565
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,800
Cheng Liao, I'll get going first.

566
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,350
Okay, bye.

567
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,880
See you tomorrow.

568
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,310
(What should I do with some of the material)

569
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,640
(and seeds I received)

570
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,000
(for my greenhouse today?)

571
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,160
(I just got off work. I'll be right there.)

572
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,760
Brother Xu Chi.

573
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,560
Let's have dinner together.

574
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,800
I'm...

575
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,920
meeting someone later.

00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,190
the same old pattern.

769
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,600
How can it

770
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,840
be compared to the profound game of Go?

771
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,280
Sister-in-law.

772
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,910
You know,

773
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,840
that's the power of a celebrity.

774
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,120
And

775
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,390
it's the same with Go.

776
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,080
It means

777
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,000
that we have to make

778
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,800
some of the best players famous first.

779
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,360
So you're talking about players like Ke Jie

780
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,190
and Sheng Jing Chu.

781
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,430
But they're quite popular already.

782
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,870
So what I'm saying is

783
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,040
let some of the best players

784
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,040
become famous first.

785
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,040
These two are definitely not enough.

786
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,910
And then add Yao Ke.

787
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,080
Does my face look big on the camera?

788
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,230
No.

789
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,320
Should I tie it up

790
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,560
or wear it down?

791
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,390
It looks neat when you tie it up

792
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,560
and sweet when you wear it down.

793
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,520
Tie it up then.

794
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,040
I'll look independent and smart.

795
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,760
I want to look like my idol.

796
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,390
Who is your idol?

797
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,150
She's a female Go player too.

798
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,470
Nine dan pro.

799
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,800
She's a legendary presence

800
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,560
among female players.

801
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,760
She's the one who gave me confidence

802
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,800
that I could take on

803
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,600
a male Go player.

804
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,520
I hope I can play against her

805
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,150
in my lifetime.

806
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,520
So I set myself

807
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,230
a goal.

808
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,670
I want to be like my idol

809
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,630
and put Go first.

810
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,230
I won't date

811
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,430
until I'm a seven dan pro player.

812
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,230
Then...

813
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,470
What if

814
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,150
you meet someone

815
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,910
you really, really like?

816
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,760
Impossible.

817
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,520

Hello.

844
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,040
Okay, I'm going down now.

845
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Your takeaway order.

846
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,280
Sir,

847
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,910
I'm really sorry.

848
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,520
I was supposed to be handing out flyers,

849
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,910
but the shop was too busy,

850
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,560
so the boss asked me to make deliveries.

851
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,630
I was late

852
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,150
because I didn't know my way around.

853
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,230
It's all right. It's supper.

854
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,560
The later you eat, the better.

855
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,630
Thank you, sir.

856
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,390
I've had more than 10 orders returned.

857
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,430
Thank you so much.

858
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,150
Thank you.

859
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,190
Sir, don't move.

860
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,000
I'll do it.

861
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,760
Sir...

862
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,870
My zipper is stuck.

863
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:50,840
I'll do it.

864
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,710
I'll do it...

865
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,360
Here. Over here.

866
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,430
Sir, is your tie okay?

867
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,760
It's fine.

868
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:17,840
I don't blame you.

869
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,670
I'm really sorry.

870
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,230
Hey, mate.

871
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,040
You got a minute?

872
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,670
I asked her in front of everyone

873
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,910
if she wanted to be with me.

874
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,430
And?

875
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,670
She said no.

876
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,470
What kind of woman is that?

877
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,910
Her standards are too high.

878
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,190
She doesn't even like

879
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
an elite executive like you.

880
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,390
Some things...

881
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,630
are meant to be.

882
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,320
Come on, brother.

883
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,280
At least you have someone to confess your love to,

884
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,630
unlike me.

885
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,950
I'm in much more pain than you.

886
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,470
You've been rejected too?

887
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,430
A woman with a story.

888
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,840
And?

889
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,120
Everything is an accident.

890
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,390
I saw sadness and loneliness

891
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,120
in her eyes.

892
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,190
However,

893
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,470
I have those two things too.

894
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,080
I had no real friends

895
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,230
when I was abroad.

896
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,360
You don't need words

897
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,950
for that kind of eye contact.

898
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,150
It hit me

899
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,280
right in the heart.

900
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,630
And then she disappeared

901
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,190
before I even

902
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,470
got a chance to confess my love.

903
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,840
She didn't even leave her contact details.

904
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,280
Keep the faith.

905
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,080
If you two

906
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,040
are really destined for each other,

907
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,870
you will definitely meet again.

908
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,430
Just don't let her get away easily

909
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,910
the next time you see her.

910
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,470
Thank you.

911
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:19,950
I really didn't expect you

912
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,600
to be the person

913
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:22,870
who's the most friendly

914
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,230
towards me in this city.

915
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,120
Come on.

916
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,120
I hope

917
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,670
you will get your girl soon.

918
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,430
I hope

919
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,520
you get your goddess soon.

920
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,760
Did you sleep well?

921
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,560
How long have I been asleep?

922
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,710
What time is it?

923
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,600
Half past eleven.

924
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,150
Half past eleven?

925
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,630
Why didn't you wake me up?

926
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,950
I saw you were sleeping soundly,

927
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,670
so I wanted you to get some rest.

928
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:13,840
Hello.

929
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,150
Where are you

930
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,000
in the middle of the night?

931
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,040
I'm...

932
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,800
at a friend's place.

933
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,910
This Yan Xiao is really something.

934
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,600
She made you volunteer to work late again?

935
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,000
The rain is too heavy.

936
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,760
I'll tell you what.

937
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,840
You can stay at her place tonight.

938
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,390
Don't come back. Be safe.

939
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:29,870
No, Dad, it's...

940
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,800
My dad said...

941
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,000
that I don't have to come home tonight.

942
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:42,630
