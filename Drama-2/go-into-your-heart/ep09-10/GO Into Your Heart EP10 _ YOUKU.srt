00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,670
[Star Host]
So I'm saving the last few episodes

194
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,030
for the Jiuzhou Four Seas Cup's

195
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,350
Go invitational tournament.

196
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,840
Of the four

197
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,320
traditional arts,

198
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,030
I have the most respect for Go.

199
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,960
It's the most complex and unpredictable

200
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,840
chess game

201
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,110
in human history.

202
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,080
A conversation with a great player

203
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,350
has been a goal

204
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,280
I want to realize

205
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,440
for my show.

206
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,520
You need not be worried

207
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,790
about the views.

208
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,470
Aside from the renowned players

209
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,910
from the Jiuzhou Dojo,

210
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,790
Zhao Yan Xun and Kato Kiyomasa

211
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,520
have quite a fanbase in our country too.

212
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,150
I believe this project

213
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,520
will give everyone

214
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,760
an enjoyable and memorable conversation.

215
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,150
The proposed project

216
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,790
is dubbed

217
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,440
"Showdown of Grandmasters".

218
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,150
I think the overall concept

219
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,110
is viable.

220
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,520
More people are interested in Go lately.

221
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,520
After "the Universal Challenge",

222
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,880
Sheng Jing Chu is all over the internet.

223
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,520
I like the idea.

224
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,520
If you need extra staff, equipment,

225
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,590
or funding,

226
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,200
I'll request from the higher-ups.

227
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,110
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

228
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,230
Cheng.

229
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,670
Don't be too pessimistic.

230
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,230
Maybe the "Showdown of Grandmasters"

231
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,230
is a turning point for your
Sincere Conversation.

232
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,110
I'll give it my all.

233
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,000
All the best.

234
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,470
We believe in you.

235
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,230
Sister Yi.

236
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:51,640
Bye.

237
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,200
Bye.

238
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,520
Sister, stop!

239
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,840
It hurts!

240
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,670
It's me.

241
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,440
Sister,

242
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,840
you could have gone easy on me.

243
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,150
Don't you remember me?

244
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,910
How did you know I'd be here?

245
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,200
I know you are a TV presenter.

246
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,670
To see you,

247
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,080
I've been

248
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,230
giving out fliers for days.

249
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,400
Wait, where are we going?

250
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,710
What exactly do you want?

251
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,080
That day...

252
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,000
Enough about that!

253
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,110
Stop bothering me.

254
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,880
Sister.

255
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,710
I know.

256
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,080
You got it all wrong.

257
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm here to pay you back.

258
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,350
But I don't have the money yet.

259
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,350
So, here is an IOU.

260
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,750
[IOU]

261
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,960
Forget it. Don't bother.

262
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,880
There is an extra zero.

263
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,710
I only gave you 500 yuan.

264
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,520
I know what I wrote.

265
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,080
Wait...

266
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,150
What is the meaning of this?

267
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,400
Lately,

268
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,320
I've never stopped working.

269
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,520
I did street performances,

270
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,710
I gave out fliers,

271
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,880
I delivered food orders.

272
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,000
I did every job I could.

273
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,960
But I can barely make any money.

274
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,200
I only have one meal every day.

275
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,640
I sleep in the cheapest room.

276
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,000
But I'm still short on money.

277
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:36,910
You gave me

278
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,790
500 yuan the other day.

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,840
After paying for the room,

280
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,080
I spent the rest pretty much instantly.

281
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,280
So...

282
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,640
So I wrote this IOU because...

283
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,110
I wonder

284
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,440
if you can lend me 4,500 yuan.

285
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,790
The total will be 5,000 yuan.

286
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,910
Do you take me for a fool?

287
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,350
It hurts, Sister! Please let go!

288
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,400
It hurts!

289
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,110
Stop fooling around

290
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,550
unless you want to face my wrath.

291
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,840
What is it that you want?

292
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,960
I only want to get some Go lessons.

293
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,470
How is it so hard?

294
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,840
I don't want to go home empty-handed.

295
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,230
I don't want my dream

296
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,030
to perish so easily!

297
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,790
That's the story.

298
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,670
I was so tired and sleepy

299
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,590
when I fell asleep.

300
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Are you full now?

301
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,280
No.

302
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,590
Excuse me!

303
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,000
Another set, please.

304
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,080
Thanks, Sister.

305
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,150
Is it worth it

306
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,080
to work so hard?

307
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,320
I have no idea.

308
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,590
But one thing is certain.

309
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,440
Playing Go is the most relaxing

310
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,440
and happiest moment

311
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,150
of my life.

312
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,440
You remind me

313
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,710
of the time I just got graduated.

314
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,350
I was an intern at the TV station.

315
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,590
I didn't get paid. I am not an official staff.

316
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,640
I didn't get anything.

317
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,790
I barely had any hope

318
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,000
for my future.

319
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,670
But much like yourself,

320
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,590
when I set my eyes on a goal,

321
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,670
I won't give up so.

322
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,150
I tried to participate in every work

323
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,200
the station had to offer.

324
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,080
I edited videos, I wrote the scripts,

325
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,960
I carried the equipment.

326
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,760
I was even the assistant

327
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,640
of a host.

328
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,080
But I accumulated experience

329
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,230
over time,

330
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,280
so I acquired the skills a TV presenter

331
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,910
needs to possess.

332
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,030
Later on,

333
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,000
I finally got a chance

334
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,910
to be on the silver screen.

335
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,590
I used the experience I had

336
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,550
to convince the audience, the staff,

337
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,470
and the higher-ups of my worth.

338
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,640
That's how I made it here and became

339
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,440
a qualified TV presenter.

340
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,470
This is inspiring.

341
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,080
You really are amazing, Miss Goddess.

342
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,910
I can relate to your loneliness

343
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,670
and obsession

344
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,880
with your future,

345
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,710
so I thought my story could inspire you.

346
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,280
I hope this could

347
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,030
serve as a motivation for you.

348
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,910
Fear not.

349
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,710
Sometimes,

350
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,550
the hardship you live in

351
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,910
will unlock more possibilities

352
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,150
for your future.

353
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,710
This is by far the most uplifting thing I've heard

354
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,440
since I came back to the country.

355
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Thank you.

356
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,790
Thanks.

357
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,710
Dig in.

358
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,110
Carry on.

359
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,150
There is something I must see to.

360
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,000
Where are you going? I can see you off.

361
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,800
Never mind. Finish your food.

362
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,040
I paid the bill for you.

363
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:12,920
Mr. Sheng.

364
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,799
Ever since you've fallen in love with her,

365
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,470
you started to take your life more seriously.

366
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,560
You make

367
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,160
your own meals now.

368
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,640
That's healthy

369
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,000
and remarkable.

370
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,310
But there is one thing

371
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,310
I just don't get it.

372
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,999
Since you can't tell the color,

373
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,310
how can you tell if the food

374
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,710
is cooked or not?

375
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,590
I have my ways.

376
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,430
But Mr. Sheng,

377
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,710
you might get food poisoning if the food

378
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,520
isn't properly cooked.

379
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,110
This is serious.

380
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,280
You should leave it to me.

381
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,040
Never mind.

382
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,800
Finish up and leave.

383
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,560
Fine.

384
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,590
I'll go after

385
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,310
I've sorted these bags.

386
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,800
Don't touch it.

387
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,800
Mr. Sheng, the competition is around the corner.

388
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,160
You should start practicing.

389
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
Leave the trivial chores

390
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,680
to me.

391
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,800
Don't touch it.

392
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,590
I can handle it.

393
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,110
Don't stand on ceremony.

394
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,040
Come on.

395
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,560
Mr. Sheng!

396
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,000
Mr. Sheng!

397
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,830
What did I do wrong?

398
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,800
What is it?

399
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,760
Does the flower have bug problems?

400
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,800
I don't know.

401
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,920
It hasn't been well lately.

402
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,560
I was hoping you could take a look.

403
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,800
I'll check it out.

404
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,710
These flowers

405
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,590
are doing very well.

406
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,590
Make sure you water them

407
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,310
regularly.

408
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,368
See?

409
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,040
The sprouts

410
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,160
look fragile.

411
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,190
But the truth is

412
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,070
they are extremely tenacious.

413
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,230
Don't forget,

414
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
they rose from the soil

415
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,710
one tiny bit at a time.

416
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,430
So don't worry about them.

417
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,920
Actually,

418
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,110
I was worried about you.

419
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,280
I wasn't

420
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,190
in a good mood today.

421
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,190
What's wrong?

422
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,950
The director doesn't like

423
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,470
the new show I produced.

424
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,680
But I was quite fond of it.

425
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,070
I got it covered.

426
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,190
When you get upset,

427
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,920
you like cooking.

428
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,680
Make yourself at home.

429
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,230
I have another favor to ask.

430
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,230
Do tell.

431
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,640
If I make a mess

432
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,520
out of this place,

433
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,310
could you not yell at me?

434
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,350
I will clean the place

435
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,470
until it's spotless.

436
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,470
However,

437
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,920
I'm a little frustrated at the moment.

438
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,310
As I said,

439
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,430
make yourself at home.

440
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,400
Then... I'll need some space.

441
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,920
It's done.

442
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,520
Do you feel better now?

443
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,190
My frustrations

444
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,920
dissipated like smoke.

445
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,430
But...

446
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,350
I made a mess out of your kitchen.

447
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,920
Sorry.

448
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,040
It's all right.

449
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,950
It's been untouched for some time.

450
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,070
It would be glad

451
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,590
to be of use for someone.

452
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,590
I'll clean it up later.

453
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,520
Dig in.

454
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,470
Sorry.

455
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,190
Sorry.

456
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,400
I think I pressed

457
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,520
the wrong button.

458
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,560
It's okay.

459
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,800
You just opened the garage door.

460
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,710
Your garage?

461
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,800
But you don't even drive a car.

462
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,560
I have a car.

463
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,590
Why did you buy a car?

464
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,560
I can't drive because I'm colorblind.

465
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,230
I won this from a competition.

466
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,280
This car is stunning.

467
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,760
The color is gorgeous.

468
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,110
This branding looks familiar.

469
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,230
It's a pony

470
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,310
standing on his rear legs.

471
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,230
What was it called again?

472
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,520
Ferrari.

473
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,470
I know.

474
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,110
Even though

475
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,040
I barely know anything about cars,

476
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,920
but I know

477
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,680
what a Ferrari is.

478
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,710
Give it a try.

479
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,000
I can't drive.

480
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,710
I'm not asking you to get on the road.

481
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,110
It's not illegal to test it out.

482
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,310
Well...

483
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,590
Press the other button.

484
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,590
This one?

485
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,520
Yes.

486
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,950
You don't drive.

487
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,110
But how do you know about the steps?

488
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,350
I know every detail I need to drive a car.

489
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,110
But I lack the eyes

490
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,070
that can see the colors of the world.

491
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,160
If there is a chance

492
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,590
I could see the colors again,

493
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,950
I would get my driver's license.

494
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,760
When you get it,

495
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,230
take me out for a ride.

496
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,070
Deal.

497
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:55,920
Pinky swear.

498
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,950
This car is awesome.

499
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,230
Do you like it?

500
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,470
You can have it.

501
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,400
Did I save

502
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,470
the universe in my previous life
to deserve this boon?

503
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,230
No.

504
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,800
I can't take this present.

505
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,640
I can't drive it anyway.

506
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,760
I did nothing to deserve this gift.

507
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,830
You made me food.

508
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,160
That's all it takes?

509
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,800
I'd have to cook

510
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,000
for you my entire life!

511
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,520
Why did the engine die?

512
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,350
Did I break it?

513
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,640
I think you might have to

514
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,070
cook for me for the rest of your life.

515
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,000
I didn't press anything.

516
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,350
Why did it die?

517
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,590
It ran out of gas.

518
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,400
Thank you, Eldest Senior Brother.

519
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,310
You really put some muscle into it today.

520
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,230
Slow down a little.

521
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,350
A little gentler.

522
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,800
It's you!

523
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,470
Why are you here?

524
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:36,880
Master.

525
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,830
Sit.

526
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,350
I'll give you a massage.

527
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,590
Let go of her!

528
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,950
Sit.

529
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,470
What do you want?

530
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,190
I...

531
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,680
I came to study under her.

532
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,110
I don't buy it.

533
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,190
You have no master here.

534
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,590
You have a decent look.

535
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,710
Perhaps I could

536
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,560
do him a favor.

537
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,640
No way!

538
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,710
I'm an eight dan for years,

539
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,880
I've never taken in any students.

540
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,350
You're only a four dan.

541
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,040
You have no right.

542
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
He came to me willingly.

543
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,680
So I don't mind at all.

544
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,430
Okay.

545
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,950
Master!

546
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,520
Please accept my worship!

547
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:06,830
Get up!

548
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,760
Get out of here.

549
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,280
Come on.

550
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,000
Master.

551
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,310
He is my student.

552
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:11,950
Hey...

553
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,280
This should be far enough.

554
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,640
Make yourself clear.

555
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,000
If you can't,

556
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,710
then let's settle it another way.

557
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Is this supposed to be

558
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,710
a dance battle?

559
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,230
Stop playing the fool.

560
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,950
Plenty of people want to woo her.

561
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,070
Get in the line.

562
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,400
That's a lot of people.

563
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,800
She is a great person after all.

564
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,590
No one deserves to have her.

565
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,160
I don't want her.

566
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,070
But I want...

567
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,430
you.

568
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,640
Bro.

569
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,400
Does your hand hurt?

570
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,110
Shut up!

571
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,280
I'm warning you.

572
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,280
Stop playing tricks with me.

573
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,070
I heard everything you said.

574
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,760
She is a four dan.

575
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,310
And you...

576
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,190
You're an eight dan.

577
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,350
Let go!

578
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,070
So what?

579
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,830
You must be even greater than her!

580
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,190
Maybe you could be my master.

581
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,680
I...

582
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,590
So you're not here for her?

583
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,470
No way!

584
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,230
I know you have your eye on her.

585
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,520
Was it so obvious?

586
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,190
Of course.

587
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,950
I'm smart enough to notice it.

588
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,310
So don't take this the wrong way.

589
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,160
I want the greatest player around to be my master

590
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,590
and become the greatest there is.

591
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,640
I can't help you with that.

592
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,160
To become the strongest,

593
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,430
you must learn from the strongest.

594
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,070
Brother.

595
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,430
Who's the strongest then?

596
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,560
Golden Age Tianyuan,

597
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,350
Sheng Jing Chu.

598
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,000
Sheng Jing Chu?

599
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,920
(You have a new order.)

600
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,430
(Please see to it immediately.)

601
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,710
Is there more?

602
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,760
It must be delivered

603
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,590
before noon.

604
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,710
Brother.

605
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,430
What a coincidence.

606
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,520
It seems you deliver everything.

607
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,280
I must earn as much as I can.

608
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,400
Come in.

609
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,040
Are you sure?

610
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,280
Come on.

611
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,520
Keep it safe for me.

612
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,880
Thank you.

613
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,160
Sit down. Sit here first.

614
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,710
How are you lately?

615
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,000
Exhausted?

616
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,310
Not bad.

617
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,710
I'm a little exhausted,

618
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,430
but I'm happy.

619
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,350
Judging by the tone,

620
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,920
you've made progress

621
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,830
with your crush.

622
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,000
She gave me her numbers.

623
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,760
I can contact her now.

624
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,430
Good for you.

625
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,110
Brother.

626
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,470
How have you been?

627
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,830
Are things better now?

628
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,520
Not yet.

629
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,800
But I'm not worried.

630
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,310
I've known her for years.

631
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,280
I know her well enough.

632
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,280
I believe

633
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,400
with enough patience

634
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,070
and dedication,

635
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,040
I will win her heart someday.

636
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,640
I doubt it.

637
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,000
If you really like her,

638
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,040
you must take a proactive approach.

639
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,800
Do not take too long.

640
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,880
People might get her before you do.

641
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Are you lecturing me?

642
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,640
No.

643
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,070
I mean no disrespect.

644
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,350
I'm giving you advice

645
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,230
based on my experience.

646
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,040
You should

647
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,640
focus on winning the heart

648
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,710
of your crush.

649
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,560
Sure.

650
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,520
I hope you succeed as well.

651
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,760
That's enough for today.

652
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,590
It's almost time.

653
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,110
I asked her out on lunch.

654
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,470
I envy you.

655
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,920
You actually got to ask her out.

656
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,040
I asked her out as well.

657
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,830
But she's busy tonight.

658
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,110
I should get back to my work.

659
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,920
I thought

660
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,470
you got your crush's number.

661
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,590
Yeah?

662
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,880
Silly.

663
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,190
Add her on WeChat.

664
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,070
Right.

665
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,110
Her WeChat!

666
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,190
Why didn't I think of that?

667
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,470
Brother.

668
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,470
You are my Polaris.

669
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,280
Thank you.

670
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,400
I'll buy you

671
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,640
a meal when I get the chance.

672
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,640
Forget it.

673
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,640
Let me do the honor.

674
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,920
I may be broke for now,

675
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,280
but I can still afford a bowl of noodles.

676
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,190
Right?

677
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,070
I thought

678
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,310
you'd refuse to see me.

679
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,950
Of course not.

680
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,880
As long as you keep a level head,

681
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,310
you're still my best friend.

682
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,710
My mind was perfectly clear.

683
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,400
Xu.

684
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,040
Cut it out

685
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,430
or I'm leaving.

686
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,070
Fine, I won't.

687
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,880
I have a present for you.

688
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,800
For me?

689
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,000
What is it?

690
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:06,760
There are only

691
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,000
a few episodes of Sincere Conversation.

692
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,400
I hope you can finish it

693
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,800
in the most beautiful outfit.

694
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,350
Thanks.

695
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,040
Don't mention it.

696
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,680
You helped me out a lot

697
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,830
during "the Universal Challenge".

698
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,470
Your work went down the drain.

699
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,400
Don't bring that up.

700
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,680
Do I look so petty to you?

701
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,710
I've moved on a long time ago.

702
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,640
I did what I could for it.

703
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,280
The end result doesn't matter.

704
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,710
I know you care about me.

705
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,830
Do you?

706
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,710
Xu.

707
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,190
Fine. Let's not talk about it.

708
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,920
Have a drink.

Brother, I have good news for you.

712
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,280
I got my crush's WeChat.

713
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,190
Congratulations.

714
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,040
You just got one step closer.

00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,430
Thanks.

00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,880
Keep up the good work.

you win her heart someday.

What's so funny?

720
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,070
Nothing.

721
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,920
I just made a donation.

722
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,000
To whom?

723
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,190
He's studying.

724
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,190
He's deprived of education.

738
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,600
do we have any plans

739
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,870

There's a lot to do tomorrow.

00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,320
What about you, Sister?

747
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,230

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,280

I need to shop for meat.

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,950
Do the dishes for me later.

754
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,360
They don't remember my birthday.

00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,950
To make my life more colorful.

Don't be silly.

You can't see the colors.

769
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,230
the Ferrari out for a spin?

770
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,800
I knew it.

771
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,000
You tried it every year.

772
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,080
Aren't you tired of doing it?

773
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,320
(You can have it.)

774
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,280
Did I save

775
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,080
the universe in my previous life
to deserve this boon?

776
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,840
No.

777
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,120
I can't take this present.

778
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,630
I can't drive it anyway.

779
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,520
I did nothing to deserve this gift.

780
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,040
Xi He.

781
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,360
If I were to give you

782
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,910
a very valuable present,

783
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,360
would you find it offhand?

784
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,520
Very much so.

785
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,520
Why would you give anyone present?

786
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,320
I thought you never let go

787
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,230
of anything

788
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,280
you got your hands on.

789
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,120
That depends.

790
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,190
That hurts my feelings.

791
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,150
I'm your best buddy.

792
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,600
If I couldn't get a present,

793
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,800
well...

794
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,710
It was Sister-in-law, am I right?

795
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,080
Why should I be

796
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,950
jealous of her?

797
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,230
But Senior Sheng,

798
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,520
I must say,

799
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,080
you have a unique taste

800
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,080
for lovers.

801
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,040
Ever since her show

802
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,000
was aired,

803
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,600
we've gained a great number

804
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,870
of followers on Weibo.

805
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,600
Then you should thank her.

806
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,430
That is for sure.

807
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,360
But how do I thank her?

808
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,800
I have an idea.

809
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,600
Hello?

810
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,000
Hello? Sister Cheng Liao?

811
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,910
We're going to the Karaoke tomorrow.

812
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,230
It's on Cao Xi He.

813
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,800
He assigned me the task

814
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,870
of inviting you.

815
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,320
So I look forward to your arrival.

816
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,080
I have plans for tomorrow.

817
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:59,120
Well, at least I think so.

818
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,630
I'm not sure yet.

819
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,870
Besides,

820
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,600
only the members of your institute are there.

821
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,040
I shouldn't ruin the fun.

822
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,430
Nonsense!

823
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,230
You are the most important

824
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,390
VIP of tomorrow.

825
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,870
We need you there!

826
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,560
Don't worry, just come with us.

827
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,470
Okay, I'll go.

828
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,470
Really?

829
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,190
Be there or be square.

830
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,390
I'll send you the address later.

831
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,360
Okay.

832
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,150
See you.

833
00:39:34,561 --> 00:39:37,400
[The top TV presenter of Binhai
Television is a hypocrite!]

834
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:40,360
The main subject.

835
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,320
The category.

836
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,280
Talk shows.

837
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,280
You must pay attention

838
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,150
to these aspects.

839
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,500
[The top TV presenter of Binhai
Television is a hypocrite!]

840
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,280
Check your phone.

841
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,910
It's Cheng Yi!

842
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,190
It really is her.

843
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,190
They are having dinner together.

844
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,600
[The top TV presenter is a hypocrite!]
It's not having dinner.

845
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,390
They were dating.

846
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,280
Check your phone!

847
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,840
[Cheng Yi likes them young]
Isn't that Sister Cheng Yi?

848
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,520
[She is a debauched woman, get rid of her!]
It really is her.

849
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,870
[She visits nightclubs! How disappointing!]
Do you know who the guy is?

850
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,120
[The look on her face, she knows her way around!]
I don't know.

851
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,470
[She likes young brats!]
The man is quite dashing.

852
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,360
[She visits nightclubs! How disappointing!]
They had dinner together.

853
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,710
Not bad, Sister Cheng Yi.

854
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,470
I hope

855
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,080
you win the heart of your love.

856
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:23,910
I hope

857
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,760
you can win her heart.

858
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,840
This is new to us.

859
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,710
Yeah.

860
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,710
This picture is shocking.

861
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,360
Sorry.

862
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,870
The number you dialed is unavailable.

863
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,230
I just mustered the equipment,

864
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,430
funding, and staff for Showdown of Grandmasters.

865
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,710
I even got you

866
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,560
the mobile live-stream truck.

867
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,150
How could you make such

868
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,150
a grave mistake?

869
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,560
Cheng Yi.

870
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,430
This is outrageous.

871
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,670
The ratings on Binhai TV Station

872
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,670
are overwhelmingly negative.

873
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,560
We had to close the comment section.

874
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,560
Our chief just called.

875
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,840
You're no longer in charge

876
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,910
of the Jiuzhou Four Seas Cup.

877
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,000
We canceled your talk show

878
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,080
as well.

879
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,150
Sorry.

880
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,520
I never knew I would

881
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,800
garner so much trouble for our company.

882
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,600
For that, I will

883
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,630
express my deepest apology to everyone.

884
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,670
You should reflect on your mistake.

885
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,840
But I must ask,

886
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,910
how do this news thread

887
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,470
and the photo make me

888
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,840
the villain?

889
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,320
You're our most valuable host.

890
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,190
You should be mindful of your image!

891
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,230
I'm single.

892
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,800
I'm not married.

893
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,230
I'm not having an affair

894
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,430
or cheating on my partner.

895
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,600
I'm over 21 years old.

896
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,910
It's legal for me to have alcohol.

897
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,710
How is it wrong?

898
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,150
You're a public figure.

899
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,560
I am also a human being!

900
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,150
What do you think

901
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:12,870
the public will think

902
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,670
when you hugged that man?

903
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,000
Did you even check the photo?

904
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,600
See for yourself.

905
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,840
I merely

906
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
placed my hand on his shoulder!

907
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,800
That's all!

908
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,560
It's the 21st century.

909
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,470
So what have I done wrong?

910
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,910
You're the backbone of our company!

911
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,710
But am I treated like one?

912
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,000
You gave the influencer my show

913
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,600
and you cut

914
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,840
the funding for my show.

915
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,390
You must understand!

916
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,470
We are facing

917
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,670
competition from many platforms!

918
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,470
It's not easy for us to run the business.

919
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,800
We are planning to transform the business.

920
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,870
So why can't I

921
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,520
have a different image?

922
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,600
Why am I always

923
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,230
not being considered?

924
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,390
Over the years,

925
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,390
I never posted anything

926
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,600
on my Weibo page

927
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,670
or any social media

928
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,950
because I knew people might take a screenshot

929
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,040
to slander me!

930
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,150
Whether I was sad or happy,

931
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,360
no matter what I had to deal with,

932
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,320
I never took my frustration

933
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,760
out on anyone!

934
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,040
I couldn't even tell my father

935
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,630
anything at my work!

936
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,670
I don't want him

937
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,950
to get just as worried.

938
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,670
Mr. Gao, if you could just

939
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,670
read my mind,

940
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:13,800
you'd find it full of the anguish

941
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,950
and bitterness I've endured

942
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,000
over the years

943
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,080
