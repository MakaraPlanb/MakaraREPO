00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,080
Oh no!

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,120
You just

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,000
left me one coin?

26
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,160
Do you really want to take her with us?

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,800
I have to,

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,120
or she has nowhere to go on her own.

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,560
What if she wants to die again?

30
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,960
You seem like a bit of
a swordswoman now.

31
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,360
Do I?

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,200
But today is full of accidents.

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,560
I thought I could have been a bully,

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,360
and you'll come here to save the beauty.

35
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,760
But a little accident occurred.

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,880
If you want to see me,

37
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,040
why didn't you send out
the Tian Ji Token?

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,880
But I want to see you all the time.

39
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,560
(Oh no.)

40
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,320
(I said a little too much.)

41
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,480
What were they whispering about?

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,000
Why is it so weird?

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,520
No!

44
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,480
You are a bad woman.

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,320
Why did I say it out?

46
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,800
Well,

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,640
how are you recently?

48
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
Did the cold poison relapse?

49
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,440
No.

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,920
Great.

51
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,760
You have to take care of yourself.

52
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,600
Don't get sick.

53
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,600
Don't get hurt.

54
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,760
And wait for me

55
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,080
to bring you the blood night-blooming
cereus to cure your cold poison.

56
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,720
Why are you so sure

57
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,760
that you can get the
blood night-blooming cereus?

58
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,040
Because I am Jiang Mengmeng.

59
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,480
Is there anything that

60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,800
I cannot get?

61
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Alright.

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
I have to go now.

63
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,480
There's a long way ahead.

64
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
You have to be careful.

65
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,400
Just left like this?

66
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,240
Always come and go in haste.

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,360
Next time, don't wear a mask.

68
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,840
Always come and go in haste.

69
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,160
Forget it.

70
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,600
He has his justice to maintain,

71
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,360
and I have my mission to complete.

72
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,000
What about her?

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,440
She'll go with us.

74
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,360
How's the investigation going?

75
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,160
As the investigation shows,

76
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,880
she did come from Nan Cang
two and a half years ago.

77
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,440
But a few years ago, Nan Cang
was constantly at war.

78
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
All of our members in Nan Cang have

79
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,320
evacuated already.

80
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,040
Most of the data was destroyed
in the evacuation.

81
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,920
Therefore, it is difficult to verify

82
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,440
the history of Zhe Xiang in Nan Cang.

83
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,760
Are you worrying that

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,680
Zhe Xiang harbors malicious intentions

85
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,560
to get close to the 9th princess?

86
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,680
Keep investigating.

87
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,320
Jiang Mengmeng is simple,

88
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,240
and does not have mind of vigilance
to those who are with good looking.

89
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,400
If Zhe Xiang
harbors malicious intentions,

90
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,120
I won't let her get away.

91
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,240
Got it.

92
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,320
Oh,

93
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,400
Master,

94
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,520
these are what you want.

95
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,400
Let's go.

96
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,240
(Jin Ding Manor)

97
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,160
Xiao Ai.

98
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,280
Your Highness.

99
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,280
Don't cry. Don't cry.

100
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,760
I'm here.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,400
I'm here.

102
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,800
Your Highness, where did you go?

103
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,560
I have been looking for you
for a long while.

104
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,960
It's a long story.

105
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
I'll tell you later.

106
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,360
Who is she?

107
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,380
(Teammate +1)

108
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
She is a bad woman.

109
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,240
Don't listen to him.

110
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,440
I'll tell you later.

111
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,360
Oh,

112
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,640
where are Murong Chen and Chang Kong?

113
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,040
He went to look for you.

114
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,000
Didn't you meet?

115
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh no.

116
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,040
Two more lost.

117
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,240
It's raining.

118
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,160
What about Murong Chen and Chang Kong?

119
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,520
Your Highness, look.

120
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,920
What's this?

121
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,640
From which page in Shan Hai Scriptures?
[*An ancient Chinese book on monsters]

122
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,440
Is that you, Your Highness?

123
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,920
Me?

124
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,840
(Missing Person Notice)
Look!

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,360
Jiang Mengmeng.

126
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,360
What?

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,240
Murong Chen.

128
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,040
This is a behavior of anti-fans,

129
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,680
rather than a Missing Person Notice.

130
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,520
I...

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,960
There are more?

132
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,400
I'll find him and kill him!

133
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,720
Murong Chen.

134
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,640
- Who is it?
- What is this?

135
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,760
Your Highness,

136
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,880
please take a break.

137
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
You have been doing this
the whole night.

138
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,280
Mengmeng is missing now.

139
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,560
I don't know whether she is

140
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,680
in danger.

141
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,960
I have to find her as soon as possible.

142
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,920
(Every time I meet Yun Ya,

143
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,400
is he just missing me

144
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,160
like this alone?)

145
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,760
(Strange!)

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,720
(Why do I feel sorry to him?)

147
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,400
Where is my Mengmeng?

148
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,160
- Stop.
- No way!

149
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,960
Mengmeng!

150
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,640
You are back!

151
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,760
Are you alright? Let me check.

152
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,080
Let me check.

153
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,360
Why did you get hurt?

154
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,120
Not a serious one.

155
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,320
It's OK.

156
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,000
And you,

157
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,840
you have no sense of direction.

158
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,440
If you get lost in the night,

159
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,400
what are you going to do?

160
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,040
I have Chang Kong.

161
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,200
He will find the way.

162
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
And I will find you.

163
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,760
It is impossible to get lost.

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,720
You said you have to look exquisite
when not at home, didn't you?

165
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,120
Look at what you did to yourself.

166
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,440
Are you worrying about me?

167
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
No, I am not.

168
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,560
You think too much.

169
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,480
- You are worrying about me.
- Your Highness.

170
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
You are false to your heart.

171
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,160
Who's that girl?

172
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,200
There's a long way ahead
in the depopulated zone.

173
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,480
We can stay over when
we see mountain villa.

174
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,840
How much further to go?

175
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,120
If you get tired,

176
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,840
you can take a rest on the horse.

177
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,320
- I'd better walk.
- Go.

178
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,520
I kill...

179
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,400
I kill...

180
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,040
Da Huang.

181
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,200
Da Huang, Da Huang!

182
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,440
Don't run, Da Huang.

183
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
Da Huang.

184
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,800
The weather was fine all the way.

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,120
Why is the fog occurring so suddenly?

186
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,440
Brother!

187
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,480
Where are you?

188
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,010
(Miasmatic Forest)

189
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,360
Brother!

190
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,240
Murong Chen, what's wrong?

191
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,480
The fog seems to be denser.

192
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,040
Why don't we wait
until the fog disperses?

193
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,360
Just fog.

194
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,080
There is nothing to be afraid of.

195
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,800
Coward.

196
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,640
The fog takes at least four hours to

197
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,280
become dense enough to obscure vision.

198
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,720
If we walk faster,

199
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,440
we can walk out of the forest
in two hours.

200
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,560
If we wait here until the fog
disperses completely,

201
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,840
we might have to stay till
tomorrow morning.

202
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,240
It is more dangerous to
stay overnight in the wildness.

203
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,520
Zhe Xiang, you are amazing.

204
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,920
You can tell this.

205
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,480
You are not a woman of the world.

206
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,240
Why do you know that?

207
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,240
I think she just made that up.

208
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,560
Does it have to be a woman
of the world to know about fog?

209
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,800
Nan Cang is located in
a hot and humid place,

210
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,840
always foggy.

211
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,240
I know well about such environment.

212
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,720
And General Song,

213
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,640
you have years of experience
being at war against Nan Cang.

214
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,760
Don't you know this environment?

215
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,600
You make sense.

216
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,880
(If Xiao Ai is for search,)

217
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,440
(Song Che is for attack,)

218
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,760
(Chang Kong is for defense,)

219
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,920
(and Murong Chen has super power,)

220
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,160
(then our new member, Zhe Xiang, is)

221
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,440
(for)

222
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
(wisdom.)

223
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,280
(Moreover, if Mr. System wants
to set me up,)

224
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,080
(it's the same whenever we go.)

225
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,240
Let's go!

226
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,520
Welcome to the Lost Phantom Formation.

227
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,360
Da Huang.

228
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,840
Da Huang.

229
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,600
Da Huang, Da Huang!

230
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,680
Song Che.

231
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,760
Leave it.

232
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,950
(Phantom Forest)

233
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,840
I guess we might get lost, right?

234
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,840
The fog is coming
quicker than I thought.

235
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,040
Didn't you think it wrong

236
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,400
from the very beginning?

237
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,680
You...

238
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,400
Did you know this is a trap,

239
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,680
and lure us to here?

240
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
Stop it!

241
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,240
What we need to do now is

242
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,160
to figure out a way

243
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,120
to get out of here, right?

244
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,880
I have an idea.

245
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,240
We should separate into
groups of two persons,

246
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,640
so we have three groups in total.
We count the numbers every five steps.

247
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,800
It'll work.

248
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,680
This not only guarantees that

249
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,000
we won't get lost in groups,

250
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,760
but also speeds up the progress.

251
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,480
Then how should we separate?

252
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,280
(Chang Kong, Song Che and Zhe Xiang)

253
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,440
(all have power of attack.)

254
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,080
(As for Murong Chen,)

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,160
(I'd better avoid being alone with him.)

256
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,160
(I cannot give him the chance
to be alone with Mengmeng.)

257
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,360
(Is he trying to test me
with this chance?)

258
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,120
I'll team up with Zhe Xiang.

259
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,760
I think it's safer to be with her.

260
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,760
(You really are a good actor.)

261
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,120
(I think you just want to
be with the beauty.)

262
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,040
(I regret that I...)

263
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,880
(So typical!)

264
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,560
Then I'll team up with Song Che.

265
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,280
(As expected,)

266
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
(Mengmeng still cares about me,
the love one,)

267
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,160
(in the important moment.)

268
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,520
Let's go.

269
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Go!

270
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,360
Your Highness.

271
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Murong Chen,

272
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,720
you're smarter than I thought.

273
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,800
Murong Chen,

274
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,640
what's wrong?

275
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,160
Nothing. Let's go.

276
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,440
Silly boy!

277
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,040
You are in the formation,

278
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,040
and I am out of it.

279
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Only I can see you.

280
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,240
You are impossible to see me.

281
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,200
One.

282
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,160
Two.

283
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,160
Three.

284
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,400
(Walking Phantom Formation)

285
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,880
This fog is so dense.

286
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,440
Everyone counts and stays
wherever you are.

287
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,560
One.

288
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,320
Two.

289
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,240
Three.

290
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,360
One.

291
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,960
Two.

292
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,320
Three.

293
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,920
Murong Chen.

294
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,880
Zhe Xiang.

295
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,200
I heard that your voice is so close.

296
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,400
But I cannot see you.

297
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,040
As expected.

298
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,640
Stop counting.

299
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,880
What's going on?

300
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,000
If my guess is correct,

301
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,000
we are in the same forest,

302
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
but not in the same time and space.

303
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,720
Not in the same time and space?

304
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,920
Is this...

305
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,600
- Parallel time and space.
- Parallel time and space.

306
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,840
This is so chuunibyo.
[*Excessive self-awareness of teenagers]

307
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,120
Chuunibyo?

308
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,120
It seems that I cannot get away from

309
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,520
the traps of this game.

310
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,400
I have to figure it out by myself.

311
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,560
(Chuunibyo.)

312
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,120
(Chuunibyo.)

313
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,280
(Loyalty!)
[*Sounds like Chuunibyo in Chinese.]

314
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,000
We've been separated.

315
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,960
We'll meet when
we get out of the forest.

316
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,760
Mengmeng, you can be assured.

317
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,040
I'm definitely Chuunibyo.

318
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,000
What?

319
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,080
You don't believe me?

320
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:02,800
I...

321
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,080
I do. I do.

322
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,160
Why is it so difficult to understand

323
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,920
this straightforward guy's mind?

324
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,040
Chuunibyo.

325
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,080
Let's get out of here first!

326
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,480
OK?

327
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,640
Mengmeng,

328
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,680
don't worry.

329
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,360
I've been out for war for years.

330
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,240
I have experience in dealing with

331
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,360
getting lost.

332
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,960
Then do you know which direction

333
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
we should go next?

334
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,440
Just stick to one direction,

335
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,600
and keep going.

336
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,360
Keep going.

337
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,560
The worst situation is that
we might go around in circles.

338
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,280
Makes sense.

339
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,400
I have an idea.

340
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,440
Follow me.

341
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,400
Follow...

342
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,200
Whatever.

343
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,400
(It seems that it is the Walking Phantom
Formation of the Sec Master.)

344
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,640
You don't have to do anything.

345
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,240
All you have to do is

346
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,920
to stand the same side as
Jiang Mengmeng does,

347
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,000
stick with them,

348
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,880
and share life and death with them.

349
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,040
You have to protect yourself.

350
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,720
Don't get lost.

351
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,960
There are only me and you here.

352
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,120
Don't pretend it anymore.

353
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
I didn't get it.

354
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,600
What did I pretend?

355
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,760
As for Kung Fu,

356
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,400
Chang Kong and Song Che can protect you.

357
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,240
But you chose to team up with me.

358
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,480
You're afraid I'm going to hurt
Jiang Mengmeng, right?

359
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,440
I chose you

360
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,120
for my own safety.

361
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,880
If I'm with Song Che,

362
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
I would be killed.

363
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,440
Don't you know Chang Kong likes Xiao Ai?

364
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,680
Didn't you suspect that I

365
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,360
would hurt you?

366
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,720
If you want to hurt us,

367
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,520
you won't get involved in this.

368
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,400
(Such a good move by Sec Master.)

369
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,520
(She knows people well.)

370
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,160
If you harbor any malicious intentions,

371
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,640
you won't take any action now,

372
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,400
especially in here.

373
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,800
(Looks like he's not that simple.)

374
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,960
Mengmeng,

375
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,680
if you're afraid,

376
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,160
you can hold my hand.

377
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,840
No, thanks.

378
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,640
If there's some kind of trap,

379
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,120
I can protect you.

380
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,680
You fool!

381
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,320
If there's a trap

382
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,200
and you are holding my hand,

383
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,880
we'll fall in together.

384
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,360
Or you can hold me by the clothes.

385
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,000
Screw you!

386
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,880
Xiao Ai,

387
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,160
don't worry.

388
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,800
As long as we stay together,

389
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,680
I can get you out of here.

390
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,560
Oh no!

391
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,200
The sun is setting.

392
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,640
We cannot tell where we are then.

393
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,000
Do we have to get out of here by luck?

394
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,280
Da Huang.

395
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,320
It's my horse!

396
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,480
It found us!

397
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,040
Horse?

398
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,520
Mengmeng,

399
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,800
stay here and do not go anywhere.

400
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,480
I'll go after it.

401
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,840
It could bring us out of here.

402
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Da Huang!

403
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,640
Where's the horse?

404
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,320
No!

405
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,230
(Southern Border Battlefield
in Phantom Land)

406
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,520
Uncle Qi, Happy Mid-Autumn Day!

407
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,560
Where did the money come from?

408
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,000
Did you steal from others?

409
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,720
Tell me.

410
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,680
(Ruined Temple of Liang City in Phantom Land)
Who did it?

411
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,200
Me.

412
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,920
Don't look.

413
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,480
It's the falcon of my brother.

414
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,560
(Senior,)

415
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,680
(I'm so scared.)

416
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,840
(I don't want to lose.)

417
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,200
Senior,

418
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,000
I am scared.

419
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,120
I don't want to die.

420
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,840
(Who will be my close disciple?)

421
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,320
(This trial will end if)

422
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,960
(one of you four dies.)

423
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,680
(In the Phantom Formation,)

424
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,440
(you would see the most terrifying)

425
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,200
(or solicitous thing in your life.)

426
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,480
(Let me see what are)

427
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,240
(in the most hidden corner)

428
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,480
(of your mind.)

429
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,160
Steal! Steal!

430
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,720
Uncle Qi, stop.

431
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,440
I picked that money up on the street.

432
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,880
This is not picking.

433
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,960
It's called stealing.

434
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,720
I didn't.

435
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,880
(This girl...)

436
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,640
Where did the money come from?

437
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,480
She is the girl in my dream.

438
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,120
Who is she?

439
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,960
You still think that you are right?

440
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,680
OK.

441
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,560
I'll show you

442
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,200
who you stole the money from.

443
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,040
Remember,

444
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
the world is full of difficult people.

445
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Don't ruin other's life

446
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
just to keep yourself alive.

447
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,520
These are all my...

448
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,720
No!

449
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,640
These might be the memories of

450
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,560
young 9th princess.

451
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,760
When you were eight,

452
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,320
you sneaked out of the palace alone

453
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,920
and accidentally fell into the river.

454
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,000
You were wandering in the streets

455
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,760
for one year before they found you.

456
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,200
So these are my experiences
at the age of eight?

457
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,280
No wonder as the 9th princess
of Ruo Shui Kingdom,

458
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,960
I'm so money-hungry

459
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,960
and wild about ganghood.

460
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,080
(You have a butterfly
birthmark on your arm.)

461
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,000
(Zhuang Zhou fascinated about
the butterfly in his dream before dawn.)

462
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,880
(Then I'll call you Xiaomeng.)
[*Xiaomeng means a dream before dawn.]

463
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,960
Butterfly.

464
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,600
Butterfly.

465
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,760
Xiaomeng.

466
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,000
So Xiaomeng is Jiang Mengmeng.

467
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,480
That is me.

468
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,800
Then A Mu and Uncle Qi are...

469
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,560
My hidden hero?

470
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,680
It can only be triggered
by this instance?

471
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,840
Brother.

472
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
It is above the forest.

473
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,320
(Young Murong Yi)
It can tell the direction for us.

474
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
Let's go.

475
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,560
Brother,

476
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,240
this time, I won't let it hurt you.

477
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,360
Brother,

478
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,680
you'll be fine.

479
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,600
You will be able to stand up.

480
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,760
What is happening?

481
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,440
(Imperial Palace of Cang Yun Kingdom
in Phantom Land)

482
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,690
(Cang Yun Palace)

483
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,120
I am handicapped.

484
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,640
Why?

485
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,240
I thought I had changed everything.

486
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,320
Why is my brother still handicapped?

487
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,400
(Murong Chen.)

488
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,440
Who are you?

489
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,040
Who?

490
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,400
What do you want to do?

491
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,320
I want to watch you lose

492
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,440
every important person around you,

493
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,760
dying one by one.

494
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,400
Show yourself!

495
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,800
Show yourself!

496
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Who are you?

497
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,960
Show yourself!

498
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,960
What happened?

499
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,800
Uncle Qi, where are we going?

500
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,880
Xiaomeng,

501
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
it's all my fault.

502
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,280
I got you into trouble.

503
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,720
Senior,

504
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,720
it is so urgent that

505
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,600
I can only find two helpers for help.

506
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,920
Junior,

507
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,480
sorry to bother you.

508
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,320
You have retreated
from the world with great effort.

509
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,080
And now you have to come back for us.

510
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,160
Retreat from the world?

511
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,240
Who is this Uncle Qi?

512
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,560
Please make sure to
protect both of them.

513
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,840
Got it.

514
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,120
Go, go!

515
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,840
I am tired.

516
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,560
(Do you think you could
get away with us?)

517
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,600
Go!

518
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,680
I want to know

519
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,240
how far you can run?

520
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,280
That's her.

521
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
The woman in my dream.

522
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,880
Uncle Qi, A Mu.

523
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,040
I'm so scared.

524
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,200
Don't be scared.

525
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,680
I will protect you.

526
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,440
Be careful!

527
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,800
A Mu!

528
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,560
So it was all real.

529
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,000
A Mu!

530
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,800
A Mu!

531
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,640
A Mu!

532
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,600
It can't be.

533
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,400
A Mu!

534
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,240
A Mu!

535
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,720
Being anger for a man and

536
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,120
crying for him,

537
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,920
is the worst thing you should
have ever done in your life.

538
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,440
However,

539
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,000
you won't have the future.

540
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,880
- A Mu.
- A Mu.

541
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,600
- Senior.
- Junior.

542
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,560
None of us are going to
get away if it goes like this.

543
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,800
What about this?

544
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,880
Let's separate into two groups.

545
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,680
You'll take Xiaomeng with you.

546
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,160
I'll take A Mu.

547
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,400
OK.

548
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,360
Xiaomeng, let's go.

549
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,760
Let's go. Go!

550
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,560
A Mu.

551
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,480
I don't want to separate with you.

552
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Xiaomeng,

553
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,160
I said I will protect you.

554
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,200
- Go! Go!
- No.

555
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,600
No!

556
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,680
No!

557
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,680
A Mu!

558
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,280
A Mu!

559
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,040
Wait for me.

560
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,680
I'll go find you when I grow up.

561
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,880
I am...

562
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I am A Mu.

563
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,240
Then I'll call you A Mu.

564
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,200
Cry!

565
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,640
I am sorry.

566
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,000
How could I forget all these?

567
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,360
Uncle Qi.

568
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,880
A Mu.

569
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,400
I am sorry!

570
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,120
Sorry!

571
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,080
No!

572
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,600
Those things just now...

573
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,800
are the past that I have forgotten.

574
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,800
No.

575
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,200
No.

576
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,840
I am Jiang Mengmeng.

577
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,880
I am the leading lady of the game,
Jiang Mengmeng.

578
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,920
Those are memories of Xiaomeng.

579
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,200
Xiaomeng's.

580
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,000
But...

581
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,640
Why?

582
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Those are the memories in the game,

583
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,720
not mine.

584
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,720
But...

585
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,120
A Mu!

586
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,920
A Mu!

587
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,120
Who am I?

588
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,440
Who am I?

589
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
I am Jiang Mengmeng.

590
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,640
And I am Xiaomeng.

591
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Who am I?

592
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,840
(Xiaomeng.)

593
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,440
(Xiaomeng.)

594
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,040
(Uncle Qi,)

595
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,720
(why did you name me Xiaomeng?)

596
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,280
(Because Zhuang Zhou fascinated about
the butterfly in his dream before dawn.)

597
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,120
(Zhuang Zhou dreamt
about the butterfly,)

598
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,600
(and the butterfly dreamt
about Zhuang Zhou.)

599
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,520
(Just like your situation now.)

600
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,760
(You forgot your name)

601
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,840
(and your past life.)

602
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,960
(But maybe one day,)

603
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,680
(you'll go back to where you come from.)

604
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,480
(And all the things here)

605
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,680
(will be like a dream to you.)

606
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,440
(But can you tell what is)

607
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,120
(the reality?)

608
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,920
Zhuang Zhou dreamt about the butterfly,

609
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,480
and the butterfly dreamt
about Zhuang Zhou.

610
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,960
Jiang Mengmeng and Xiaomeng
are in the same person.

611
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,920
Right.

612
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,920
I can be Jiang Mengmeng,

613
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,600
and I can be Xiaomeng.

614
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,120
Sweet love and heavy life,

615
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,200
I, Jiang Mengmeng, can handle them both.

616
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,000
Oh, Murong Chen and Song Che.

617
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,840
Uncle Qi!

618
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,880
Uncle Qi!

619
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,320
Where are you?

620
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,440
Where are you?

621
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,800
Uncle Qi!

622
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,760
Uncle Qi!

623
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,600
Where are you?

624
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,120
Uncle Qi!

625
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,040
Uncle Qi, where are you?

626
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,800
Uncle Qi!

627
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,840
Uncle Qi!

628
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,960
Uncle Qi!

629
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,720
Uncle Qi!

630
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,840
Uncle Qi!

631
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
Uncle Qi!

632
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,600
Uncle Qi!

633
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,320
It's all my fault.

634
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,080
My fault.

635
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,920
Uncle Qi!

636
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,880
Uncle Qi!

637
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,280
A Mu, this blood night-blooming cereus
strike by Yu Qingzhu

638
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,160
has implanted the
cold poison to your body.

639
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,160
The medicine of Uncle Yun Zong

640
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,000
can only suppress the poisonousness

641
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,600
in your body temporarily.

642
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,000
Her Blood Moon Power

643
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,080
has not been practiced
to the highest level.

644
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,480
So there is no immediate
danger of death.

645
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,080
But you're not allowed to
use internal force in your whole life.

646
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,200
Hide inside.

647
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,280
Hide inside!

648
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,680
Uncle Qi,

649
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,640
what about you?

650
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,440
Uncle Qi will distract them.

651
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,520
Yun Qi died for you,

652
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,720
and you live just for
the sake of remaining alive,

653
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,920
not avenge him.

654
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,160
Do you deserve his sacrifice?

655
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,840
Right.

656
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Avenge...

657
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,840
I have to avenge Uncle Qi.

658
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,200
But I...

659
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,240
But you can't!

660
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,680
You are a loser!

661
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,760
You cannot save your brother,

662
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,960
and you canot kill your enemy, either.

663
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,800
What is the meaning of your life?

664
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,800
You could kill yourself,

665
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,240
and then you can apologize to

666
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,600
Uncle Qi in the hell.

667
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,720
Do it.

668
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,720
Do it.

669
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,600
Then you can be free.

670
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,600
This represents the lives of
all the brothers of Uncle Qi.

671
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,680
You must take good care of it.

672
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,680
Stay alive.

673
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,560
Don't avenge.

674
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,400
I remember...

675
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,560
Uncle Qi gave me Tian Ji Pavilion,

676
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,360
not for revenge.

677
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,600
Once, I thought about

678
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,440
leading members of Tian Ji Pavilion
to Jing Yue Sect for revenge.

679
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,680
But there is never
an end of taking revenge.

680
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,000
This is not what Uncle Qi wanted.

681
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,480
He wanted the same as I.

682
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,680
That is to try every effort

683
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,280
