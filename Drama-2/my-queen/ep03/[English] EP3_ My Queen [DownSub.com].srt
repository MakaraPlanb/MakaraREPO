=Episode 3=

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,160
Xiao Ai.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,560
Listen...

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,120
If I want to break off my engagement,

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,240
what shall I do?

27
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,320
Well, there're only two ways.

28
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,000
Tell me.

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,000
Your engagement to the 5th prince

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,560
is not just a private matter
between you two,

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,680
but a marriage between two kingdoms.

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,680
One is

33
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,080
to ask Her Majesty

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,840
to break off the engagement.

35
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,440
Alternatively,

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,000
the 5th prince can
ask the King of Cang Yun Kingdom

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,000
to withdraw the engagement.

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,960
Let that annoying guy

39
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,960
break off the engagement?

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,280
That will be impossible.

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,040
I'll figure it out on my own.

42
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,200
Xiao Ai,

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,160
another question.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,880
My sister queen,

45
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,560
what's her hobby?

46
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,040
You know,
something she really, really likes.

47
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,360
Just like someone loves
shopping crazily.

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,720
Beauty treatment.

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,080
Well,

50
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,240
Xiao Ai and A Liang.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,480
I'll give you a list,

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,680
and I need you to get me

53
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
everything on it.

54
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,320
I feel so dry,

55
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,280
and

56
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,360
my face's taut.

57
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,920
Very dry.

58
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,360
And we need to enhance
the moisture.

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,400
A Liang, how about you?

60
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,640
A little bit itchy right now.

61
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,400
Come on! Take it off.

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,640
I'm sorry, A Liang.

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,640
It's that

64
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,520
your skin is a little sensitive.

65
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
So it seems you got an allergy.

66
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
How come I got like this?

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
What should I do?

68
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,360
It's OK. It's OK.

69
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,080
I also developed a special mask

70
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,120
for sensitive skin refreshing.

71
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,880
Try it.

72
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,840
Again?

73
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,560
I'll leave the rest of the night
to you guys.

74
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,600
Don't worry, Deputy Commander.
Go and get some rest.

75
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,720
Three,

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,240
two,

77
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,600
one.

78
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,960
Mengmeng.

79
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,160
What a coincidence!

80
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
You're here to walk around, too?

81
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,160
Here is the thing.

82
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,600
The original Deputy Commander of
the palace asked to leave for home.

83
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,040
Nan Cang is safe for now,

84
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,720
so I do not need to go back there.

85
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,880
Her Majesty assigned me
the duty in the palace.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,080
I just got off my shift.

87
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,320
Xiao Ai is correct.

88
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,360
He lacks a sense of romance.

89
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,120
How about you?

90
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,720
It is so late.

91
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Why are you here alone?

92
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,160
I've been working on facial masks,

93
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,520
and I encountered some bottlenecks.

94
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,120
So I just came out for a walk

95
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,600
to see if I can get some

96
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,160
ideas.

97
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,120
My dear?

98
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,120
I mean that star is "my dear".

99
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,320
There are so many stars tonight.

100
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,160
Yes, quite a lot.

101
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,480
I'm on my way home,

102
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,600
so let me send you back.

103
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,680
Why don't you watch "my dear" with me?

104
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,160
Your dear? That seems boring.

105
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,080
Such an awkward situation.

106
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,240
What should I say?

107
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,440
By the way,

108
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,280
Xiao Ai said that

109
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,920
we knew each other since we were five.

110
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,560
Is that right?

111
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,480
Four and a half years old.

112
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,600
You have a good memory.

113
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,960
At that time, you were four and a half,

114
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,080
and I was seven.

115
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,120
That was the first time
I visited the palace with my dad.

116
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,800
I got lost.

117
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,600
I went straight to the imperial garden,

118
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,640
and saw that

119
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,160
you were fishing by the pond.

120
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,120
Then, when you were nine...

121
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,880
Wait...

122
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,120
Nine years old?

123
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,840
What about when I was eight?

124
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,960
Eight?

125
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,960
How could I forget anything about you?

126
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
When you were eight,

127
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,360
you sneaked out of the palace alone,

128
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
fell into the river,

129
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,560
and lived among
ordinary people for a while.

130
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,240
You were found a year after that.

131
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Living among ordinary people?

132
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,880
Something happened.

133
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,000
Do you know where I'd been?

134
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,520
Well,

135
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,880
I don't know.

136
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,680
The hidden plot is a
little hard to trigger.

137
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,080
I was saying...

138
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,040
Wait...

139
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,080
Do you think I'm annoying you?

140
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,120
No.

141
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,520
You're not annoying me.

142
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
I mean...

143
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,760
You know,

144
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
storytellers always have
the next chapter to tell.

145
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,440
So I think you can
save it for next time.

146
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,080
OK.

147
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,440
The wind is making me cold.

148
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,880
You feel cold?

149
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,840
If you feel cold,

150
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,960
let's start running to get warm.

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,920
When I was in the army

152
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,240
and felt too cold to sleep at night,

153
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
I ran to keep warm.

154
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,240
Come on,

155
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,800
follow me and run.

156
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,760
Come on, Mengmeng.

157
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,880
Let's start running.

158
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,520
Running?

159
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,440
Mengmeng,

160
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,120
run.

161
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,320
You won't feel cold when you run.

162
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,200
Follow me.

163
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,840
Get running.

164
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,320
Listen...

165
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,600
Jiang Mengmeng.

166
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,880
Song Che.

167
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,200
I want to go back to sleep.

168
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,480
What are they doing?

169
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,560
Are you sure you have to go,
Your Highness?

170
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,480
After a few days of my observation,

171
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,160
Jiang Mengmeng spent the day
studying facial masks,

172
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,040
and spent the night with Song Che

173
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,360
without paying any attention to me.

174
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,720
So if I go out for a night,

175
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,240
no one will notice.

176
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,800
Nice wine.

177
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,760
You...

178
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,760
What do you want?

179
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,640
Who ordered you

180
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,320
to sell the fake
blood night-blooming cereus?

181
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,240
I...

182
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,600
(Zhao Qian)
I didn't.

183
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,760
(Yun Ya,)

184
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,160
(The Flash Master)
(Murong Chen's second identity,)

185
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,000
(is potent, aloof, and always
controls the situation well in hand.)

186
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,040
(His force value is extremely high,)

187
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,600
(but he's suppressed by
his cold poison.)

188
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,880
Spare me, please!

189
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,600
I'll tell you...

190
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm just a peddler.

191
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,600
When I got
this blood night-blooming cereus,

192
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,920
I had no idea how many times
it had been sold.

193
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,840
I did take

194
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,320
the real blood night-blooming cereus
for trading.

195
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,120
I didn't expect that

196
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,240
I was robbed by

197
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,960
the female bandits of Bai Hua Village.

198
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,280
They took the real flower.

199
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,520
I felt that it was unfair.

200
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,680
I have lost too much.

201
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,520
Then, I thought of

202
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,520
finding a fake flower
to continue the trade.

203
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,560
Is it true?

204
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,640
It's the truth.

205
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
My life is on your hand now.

206
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,520
I won't lie.

207
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,480
Get out of my face.

208
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,040
Thank you.

209
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,040
This ingredient again.

210
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,440
Xiao Ai said no one sells it.

211
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,360
It looks like it won't work without it.

212
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,200
Where can I find it?

213
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,280
Owner of the cosmetics shop?

214
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,200
He should have it.

215
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,680
I have to go by myself.

216
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,080
Not only the princess
likes to climb the wall,

217
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
but also the prince.

218
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,000
Wait...

219
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,680
Don't come down.

220
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,200
You're right on the wall.

221
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,120
Maybe you can pull me up.

222
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,240
No.

223
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,320
Please.

224
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,760
Thanks.

225
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,480
I have to go now.

226
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,440
What are you looking at?

227
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Looking at a monkey.

228
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,280
Watch your month.

229
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,000
You are the monkey.

230
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,600
Your whole family are all monkeys.

231
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,640
Look at you.

232
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,040
In this world,

233
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,320
is there any princess

234
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,000
like you?

235
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,360
Either fall into a pit,

236
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,360
or climb the wall.

237
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,000
Besides,

238
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,000
look at your face.

239
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
It looks like a monkey's ass.

240
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
If you were not the monkey,
who would be.

241
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,600
I'm in a hurry.

242
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,480
I'll let it go.

243
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,160
By the way,

244
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,960
tonight,

245
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,800
I didn't see you.

246
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
You didn't see me either.

247
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,000
OK?

248
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,800
Deal.

249
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,760
OK.

250
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,720
See you around.

251
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,120
Goodbye.

252
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,760
Bold thief!

253
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,160
How dare you steal from the palace?

254
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,160
Catch her.

255
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,680
Yes.

256
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,360
No, I'm not a thief.

257
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,680
Good job!

258
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,520
I'm not a thief.

259
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,080
Sir.

260
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,960
Catch her.

261
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,680
Sir, listen to me, please.

262
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,560
There's one more up there.

263
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,200
Catch him as well.

264
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,600
Yes.

265
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,160
None of my business.

266
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,200
I want to go out for fun.

267
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,520
I want to go out for fun.

268
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,880
Why can't I do Kung Fu?

269
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,080
I wish I knew Kung Fu like them.

270
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,360
Then, I can

271
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,240
fly over the palace wall.

272
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
I wouldn't be so embarrassed

273
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,400
to get caught.

274
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,640
You want to learn Kung Fu from me?

275
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,120
Yes.

276
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,480
You guys all know Kung Fu,

277
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,480
but I don't know anything.

278
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,440
You're not the same.

279
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,720
You are the princess,

280
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,240
and people can protect you.

281
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,760
You don't have to learn Kung Fu.

282
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,840
What if I don't have anyone
to protect me?

283
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,800
It won't happen.

284
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,640
Even if no one protects you,

285
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,160
I'll protect you all the time.

286
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,240
No. No.

287
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,360
Let's get back to the topic.

288
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,160
I just wanna learn Kung Fu from you.

289
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,080
It's not about
having someone to protect me.

290
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,880
I just wanna learn.

291
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,600
That's it.

292
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,680
Do you really want to learn?

293
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,440
OK, then.

294
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,440
But I have to say this first.

295
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,760
Kung Fu requires hard work.

296
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,880
It won't be a big deal for me.

297
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,680
It's OK.

298
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,600
I have the heroine aura,

299
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,400
and I'll learn it very fast.

300
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,760
Master Song,

301
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,640
please kindly advise.

302
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,520
OK,

303
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,880
let's try it first.

304
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
This sword is so cool.

305
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,360
It's an accident!

306
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:53,840
Unexpected!

307
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,800
Is there any other Kung Fu I can learn?

308
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,040
Oh, yeah.

309
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,120
Split the brick?

310
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,960
This is the basic skill for Kung Fu.

311
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,120
Basic skill?

312
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,200
After you have mastered this,

313
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,960
the next step would be

314
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,040
to break a rock on the chest.

315
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,800
Let me show you first.

316
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,120
You give it a try.

317
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,920
It's so easy.

318
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,640
OK.

319
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,160
OK.

320
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,920
Mengmeng,

321
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,480
your moves were right.

322
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,560
You have a talent.

323
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,400
Trust yourself.

324
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:09,840
Really?

325
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,600
Where is my heroine aura?

326
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:31,200
(Ah!)

327
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,840
It's dawn. Open your eyes.

328
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,400
Last night,

329
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,160
my 6th brother was killed.

330
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,760
Why me again?

331
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,800
Who's up against me?

332
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,120
OK. OK.

333
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,800
My brother,

334
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,520
the dead is not allowed to speak.

335
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,480
Let's start from his left.

336
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,920
Where are they heading to
in such a hurry?

337
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,920
There's something fun at the palace?

338
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,520
Your Highness,

339
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,520
they are going to Ling Xi Palace
for a game called

340
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,120
Werewolf.

341
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,920
Werewolf?

342
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,480
What is Werewolf?

343
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,360
It's said that it's
more interesting than chess.

344
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,680
A more exciting game.

345
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,920
No basic knowledge required.

346
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,520
No need to study it.

347
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
Easy to play.

348
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,040
Besides, one person
can lead a group of people to play it.

349
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,480
All the eunuchs and palace maids

350
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,320
are going to Ling Xi Palace to play now.

351
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,600
What kind of magic is she playing?

352
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,680
Got hurt and lying in bed,

353
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,320
she can still make waves
throughout the palace.

354
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,640
It's you again.

355
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,360
How unlucky you are!

356
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,040
Speak one by one.

357
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,800
Speak one by one.

358
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,360
Do you know how to play?

359
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,440
Stop.

360
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,200
I quit.

361
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,000
It's just a game.

362
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,680
Everyone treats me like an enemy.

363
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,360
It's over.

364
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,160
Dear brothers,

365
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,520
please come back tomorrow.

366
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,880
We can play it again the other day.

367
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,360
Bye.

368
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,880
Bye.

369
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,000
I thought you'd

370
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,520
be bored here by yourself.

371
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,320
But I didn't expect

372
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,600
you are so good at

373
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,800
inviting all the people in the palace

374
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
to play with you.

375
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,120
My dear friend,

376
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,920
we have finished today.

377
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,800
Please come earlier tomorrow.

378
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,840
No offence.

379
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,720
I'm not interested in

380
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,640
this stupid game.

381
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,440
Murong Chen, can you be nice?

382
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm hurt badly,

383
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,480
and you come over here to mock me.

384
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,840
You can't blame anyone else for
what you did to yourself.

385
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,320
It's because someone cheats
before the wedding.

386
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,480
To learn Kung Fu from someone?

387
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,560
You made it?

388
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,120
Are you jealous of someone?

389
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,600
I'm jealous?

390
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,760
Am I crazy?

391
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,080
I'm jealous of a guy

392
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,200
who has the body of a man,
the mind of a child,

393
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
acting impulsively
regardless of consequences,

394
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,840
has no idea what a girl is thinking,

395
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,000
running with
a girl in the middle of the night,

396
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,280
and asking a girl to learn
brick split for Kung Fu.

397
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,000
He's a big fool!

398
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,640
You'd better not.

399
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,640
But I warn you.

400
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,760
Do not fall in love with me!

401
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,320
Because I will never marry a guy

402
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,440
who is from a royal family,

403
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,680
doing nothing all day long,

404
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,800
extravagant and enervated
by good living,

405
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,240
unable to be independent
but with blind self-confidence,

406
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,320
and unsympathetic.

407
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,200
Don't forget we are engaged.

408
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,600
I will break off the engagement.

409
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,560
Wait for the good news!

410
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,640
I'll make it happen.

411
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,080
Bye.

412
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Bye.

413
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,320
Were they arguing,

414
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,480
or just flirting?

415
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,080
Your Highness,

416
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,280
you drank too much.

417
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,160
With your provocation,

418
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,120
we've got what we want, right?

419
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
Why are you still so angry?

420
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,840
I don't know why.

421
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,560
I went there to make her angry,

422
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,840
but I got angry myself even more.

423
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,720
Please excuse Chang Kong.

424
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,200
I guess...

425
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,080
Speak out.

426
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,960
Your Highness, I think you feel guilty.

427
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,640
Why?

428
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,760
You have tried your best,

429
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,560
and take every single step cautiously.

430
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,280
But the 9th princess
always treat you honestly.

431
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,760
Although most of the time,
this honest is with anger and hatred,

432
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,760
she never attempts to hide it.

433
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,200
Your Highness,
you can show no mercy to your enemies,

434
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,200
but you can't be cruel to
this innocent princess.

435
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,000
Because you know

436
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,680
she's a nice person.

437
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,240
Yes, she is.

438
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,280
But I'm not.

439
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,200
A Liang,

440
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,520
lower the fire. Lower the fire.

441
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:01,920
Gentle heat.

442
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,600
Why are you in such a hurry?

443
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,120
There's still time to do it
when your hand's healed.

444
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,040
As long as this engagement
is not broken off,

445
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,800
I won't be able to find "my hero".

446
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,520
Xiao Ai,

447
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,920
tell everyone to come to Ling Xi Palace.

448
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,840
I have to increase my samples,

449
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,040
and improve my research efficiency.

450
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,880
This is the final result of my research.

451
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,200
Mengmeng,

452
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,960
what did you put on my face?

453
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,800
What is this sticky stuff?

454
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,040
My sister queen,

455
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,240
this is called

456
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,040
Perfect Mask.

457
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,680
It includes effects of moisturizing,
whitening,

458
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,040
anti-wrinkle, skin soothing,

459
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,480
sensitive skin soothing,
making skin delicate

460
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,200
and a lot more.

461
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,960
The "King" of the facial masks.

462
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,480
Really?

463
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,760
Of course.

464
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,600
You have no idea
how many formulas I've tried.

465
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,400
Finally, I got this.

466
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,800
Mengmeng,

467
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,520
look at my face.

468
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,680
It's more delicate now.

469
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,000
Yes.

470
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,280
Mengmeng,

471
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,480
I didn't expect
you have this special talent.

472
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,440
I want you to be happy.

473
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,040
Happy, happy...

474
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,480
Make a finger heart.

475
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,880
Finger heart.

476
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:24,840
By the way,

477
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,760
my sister queen.

478
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,960
What is your greatest wish?

479
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,520
My greatest wish is that

480
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,640
you and Sisi

481
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,120
can find your true love.

482
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,240
Then,

483
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,200
how about the second greatest wish?

484
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,040
Blood night-blooming cereus.

485
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,400
What is blood night-blooming cereus?

486
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,160
Blood night-blooming cereus
is a magic flower.

487
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,480
It has the effect of
keeping you young forever.

488
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,680
The facial mask you gave me just now,

489
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,680
may make me 3 years younger.

490
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,200
But blood night-blooming cereus
can make me

491
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,840
10 years younger.

492
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,960
Really?

493
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,440
It's true.

494
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,880
But 10 years ago,

495
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,280
it disappeared.

496
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,800
I'm afraid I won't see it again
in my lifetime.

497
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,680
Blood night-blooming cereus.

498
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,440
Here's your wine.

499
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,760
My brothers, let's enjoy
and have fun today.

500
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,480
My treat.

501
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,960
Childe Meng,

502
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,560
you bought us such nice wine.

503
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,800
If you have any questions,

504
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,720
please feel free to ask.

505
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,520
We are

506
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,400
not somebody,

507
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,600
but,

508
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,960
we've been living in the
complicated society for years.

509
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,080
For any questions you ask,

510
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,080
I'll tell you everything I know.

511
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,600
Right.

512
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,520
OK.

513
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,920
I'll ask then.

514
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,520
Today, I want to get
some information about

515
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,960
a flower.

516
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,520
Flower?

517
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,160
You should ask him.

518
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,960
He has been gardening for decades.

519
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,200
He's absolutely an expert.

520
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,040
No, it is not a regular flower.

521
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,400
I want to know about

522
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
blood night-blooming cereus.

523
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,920
Blood night-blooming cereus?

524
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,640
Have you heard of it?

525
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,760
Yes, I have.

526
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,800
This flower has a special effect,
doesn't it?

527
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,760
Yes.

528
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,080
The flower can bring
the dead back to life.

529
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,680
It can make the dead to live.

530
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,800
It can fill the skeleton with flesh.

531
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,360
No. No.

532
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,360
What you said is not right.

533
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,000
The blood night-blooming cereus

534
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,720
has an effect of keeping
people young forever.

535
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,320
Keeping people young forever?

536
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,960
It can be used to make skincare products

537
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,600
to keep people young forever.

538
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,400
Right, right...

539
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,360
No, you're wrong.

540
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,480
I heard that

541
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,320
the blood night-blooming cereus
is a kind of evil flower.

542
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,680
The owner can use it
to control the mind of others.

543
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,760
It's not right. Listen to me, please.

544
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,040
As far as I know,

545
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,160
this blood night-blooming cereus

546
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,400
can help people to achieve
extraordinary Kung Fu.

547
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,520
The spirit of the flower and that
of the owner can be merged together.

548
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,040
Then, you can be invincible.

549
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,240
You're wrong.

550
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,040
Everybody in the world knows it.

551
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,160
You're not making any sense.

552
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,240
What I said is true.

553
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,880
Don't listen to him.

554
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,200
I know where is the
blood night-blooming cereus.

555
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,240
Nothing can keep people young forever.

556
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,800
It is an evil flower.

557
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,880
You know where it is
and its effect, don't you?

558
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,480
Whether it has an effect

559
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,600
or what the effect is,

560
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,040
it depends on the buyer.

561
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,840
The seller only cares about the price,

562
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,200
not its effect.

563
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,880
How much is your information?

564
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,440
Everything you need is here.

565
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,680
However, Your Highness,

566
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,920
why are you going to take the risk to
use the identity of the 5th prince

567
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,960
instead of that of Yun Ya?

568
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,120
It would be more convenient to do so.

569
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,480
What we are about to do
is evil after all.

570
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,640
I'm afraid it may get exposed.

571
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,440
Murong Chen, as the 5th prince,

572
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,880
has been notorious for a long time.

573
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,680
Even if it's getting worse,

574
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,800
it won't be a big deal.

575
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,120
But for the identity of Yun Ya,

576
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,200
it will affect
the reputation of Tian Ji Pavilion.

577
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,160
It doesn't matter
what happens to Murong Chen.

578
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,680
But Tian Ji Pavilion
needs a good reputation.

579
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,600
Steamed lamb,
steamed bear paw, and steamed deer tail.

580
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,000
Roast duck, roast chicken,
and roast goose.

581
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,560
Braised pork, braised duck,
soy sauce chicken and bacon.

582
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,280
Pine blossom tripe and sausage.

583
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,160
Assorted Sushi plate
and smoked chicken.

584
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,320
Steamed eight-treasure pig
and stuffed duck with rice.

585
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,160
Assorted braised food.

586
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,680
Braised goose.

587
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,280
I'm hungry now.

588
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,280
What's going on?

589
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,360
Zhao Qian said that Bai Hua Village
is looking for a cook.

590
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,880
But no one is here.

591
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,680
They got enough cooks?

592
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,240
Or I shouldn't have stayed low?

593
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,200
OK, one more time.

594
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,440
Steamed lamb, steamed bear paw,
and steamed deer

595
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,080
tail.

596
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
Can you do all the dishes you mentioned?

597
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,400
Yes, I can.

598
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,280
Follow me.

599
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,440
(I can't go to the kitchen.)

600
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,760
(Bai Hua Village)
(Once on the stove,)

601
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,560
(they'll find out I'm a fake cook.)

602
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,560
(Then, it will be game over.)

603
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,040
Hurry up.

604
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,160
That way.

605
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,440
What's wrong?

606
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
My beautiful sister,

607
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,400
I need to go to the bathroom.

608
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,440
Hold it.

609
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,040
How can I hold it?

610
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,160
Look,

611
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,440
the kitchen is a place for food,

612
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,760
and if I can't hold it...

613
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,480
I can't hold it anymore.

614
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,840
Go. Hurry up.

615
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,280
Thank you.

616
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,280
Don't try to run away.

617
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,320
I won't.

618
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,680
A merry heart
makes a cheerful countenance.

619
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,930
(Jin Hua)

620
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,280
By the way,

621
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
how is it going with the cook catching?

622
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Got enough ones?

623
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,160
Yes.

624
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,200
We got one yesterday and one today.

625
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,280
Enough now.

626
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,960
Oh, no...

627
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,160
Oh, no...

628
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,200
We lost two cooks.

629
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,160
Which two?

630
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,080
Yesterday's and today's.

631
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,120
OK, fine.

632
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,240
No need to worry.

633
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,880
Don't let these boring things
get in the way

634
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,440
of my birthday celebration.

635
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,520
What should I wear tonight?

636
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,840
You two pretended to be cooks
to get in Bai Hua Village.

637
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,000
What do you want?

638
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,680
(What excuse)

639
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,920
(can keep me alive right now?)

640
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,400
(To learn how to cook?)

641
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,920
(A stupid idea.)

642
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,240
(Admiring the master?)

643
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,160
(No, I'm a woman.)

644
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,320
(Travelling, adventure,
or wilderness survival?)

645
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,960
(Jiang Xiaomeng. Jiang Xiaomeng.)

646
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,080
(Come on! I have to come up
with a good excuse.)

647
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,920
Rescuing the cooks.

648
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,320
Rescuing the cooks?

649
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,280
If you want to rescue the cooks,
you should go to the kitchen.

650
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,680
Why are you here in my room?

651
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,800
To catch the bandits,
catch the ringleader first.

652
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,600
If we catch you first,

653
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,480
we can threaten you
to release all the cooks.

654
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,280
(Oh, no.)

655
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,360
(The excuse of stealing the keys
would be even better than that.)

656
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,360
(Catching bandits?)

657
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,680
(Isn't that a death wish?)

658
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,160
You are very brave.

659
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,160
(Cook, Cook)

660
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,520
I didn't look at you carefully.

661
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,240
Now, I can see

662
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,840
you two are good-looking.

663
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,400
(Following the plot,)

664
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,280
(well...)

665
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,840
The first kotow is to heaven and earth.

666
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,920
The second is to the parents.

667
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,520
The third is to the wife and husband.

668
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,360
The wedding completed.

669
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,480
Now, it's time for bridal chamber.

670
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:12,960
Good.

671
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,640
Let's go.

672
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,720
My dear,

673
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,040
