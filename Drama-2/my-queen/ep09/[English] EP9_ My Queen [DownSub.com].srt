23
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,080
Well done, Xiao Mei.

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,920
The hot spring is a perfect idea.

25
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,360
Since the spring can wash away
our memory,

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,320
it should work for him, too.

27
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,600
Anyway,

28
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,680
Rongrong looks like a man,

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
a real one.

30
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,520
Why are you laughing?

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,520
Nothing but some funny things.

32
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,960
What have you done, Jiang Mengmeng?

33
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,840
I don't know.

34
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,280
(Secret Passage Next to Spa)
What is it?

35
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,640
It's a secret passage!

36
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,520
Your high...

37
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,560
Mengmeng, good job!

38
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,200
Maybe, it's because I'm the protagonist.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,720
Wait.

40
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,520
It doesn't make sense.

41
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,600
Why did Sang Luo build a secret passage
next to her spa?

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,240
If anyone who comes here finds it,

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,840
it will be the way out?

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,560
I guess maybe even Sang Luo herself

45
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
doesn't know the existence of it.

46
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,760
Why?

47
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,120
Let me tell you a story.

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,040
Listen up.

49
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,160
Thirty years ago,

50
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,280
the world was in chaos,

51
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,800
and people lived in danger.

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,960
So,

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,280
many families would build
a secret passage like this,

54
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,160
to meet the need of emergency.

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,080
If I'm right,

56
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,400
this passage was built thirty years ago

57
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,800
when Sang Luo was just a kid.

58
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,600
This passage

59
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,840
must be built by its former owner.

60
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,800
But you are a prin...

61
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,920
I mean, Rongrong,

62
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,400
how did you know what happened

63
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,360
thirty years ago?

64
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,520
I...

65
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,200
That's not the point.

66
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,400
The point is that

67
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,280
we can escape
through this secret passage.

68
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,280
Alright.

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,160
Tomorrow evening,

70
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,760
most of the servants will go to help for
the Blood Moon Tactics.

71
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,520
Rongrong,

72
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,680
you distract them.

73
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,720
And the three of us
will bring the girls here.

74
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,080
Be careful.

75
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,480
You too.

76
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,080
- Where was I last night?
- Hey, you!

77
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,840
Give us a hand.

78
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,000
Coming.

79
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,080
Hurry up!

80
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Hurry, hurry.

81
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,120
This one, nail this on.

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,680
Alright.

83
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Wrong position.

84
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,560
To the left.

85
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,160
The left.

86
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,640
Why are you two just standing there?

87
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,360
We are short of men there.

88
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,160
Get over there.

89
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,040
This way, move, move.

90
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,600
Xiao Ai,

91
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,280
if you had said you were afraid of the
dark earlier,

92
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,520
we would have brought you to the hot
spring before dark,

93
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,200
and you wouldn't have cried alone for
so long.

94
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,240
I‘m sorry. I'm too self-willed.

95
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,880
You have to waste your time on me.

96
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,440
Don't mention it.

97
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,520
We are friends.

98
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,440
Girls,

99
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,720
Let's go for the spa.

100
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,040
Come on.

101
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:50,840
Hurry.

102
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,920
Follow me.

103
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,920
- Wait for me.
- Hurry up.

104
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,800
What's this?

105
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,760
No time for explanation.

106
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,760
Let's go out first.

107
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,440
Go.

108
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,480
Go, go, go.

109
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,960
Mengmeng, aren't you leaving yet?

110
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,640
You go ahead.

111
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,600
I'll wait for her.

112
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,120
Let's go.

00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,160
The officials said,

127
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,680
it's a cold case.

128
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,720
Of course, they have nothing to do with

129
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,320

130
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,880
Underworld?

131
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,520
So, what have you got?

132
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,240
Follow me.

133
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,560
We need to see someone.

134
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
Xiao Ai.

135
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,440
What's…

136
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,760
going on?

137
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,050
(Back hill of Sang's house)

138
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,600
Good word, Xiao Mei.

139
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,920
Xiao Mei, you betrayed us.

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,080
You are so naive, little girl.

141
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,920
Xiao Mei didn't betray you.

142
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,760
She worked for me from the beginning.

143
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,480
Yesterday came a girl
who had been crying.

144
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,080
She was placed in a small room.

145
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,480
I know where Sang Luo is.

146
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,800
I found Sang Luo's room last night.

147
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,400
Since the spring can wash away
our memory,

148
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,400
it should work for him, too.

149
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,800
So, Xiao Mei revealed Xiao Ai's location
on purpose,

150
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,800
and took us to Sang Luo's room

151
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,880
to listen to all her plans.

152
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,280
So, the purpose of taking the servant
into the hot spring

153
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
was to lead me to find this secret
passage?

154
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,080
The Blood Moon Tactics in the house
was also fake?

155
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,080
Of course.

156
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,040
I have to make it real.

157
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,560
If you didn't find the fake Blood Moon
Tactics in the house,

158
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,120
how could you believe all of these,

159
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,280
and come to this real one?

160
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,520
To be honest,

161
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,480
I admire you.

162
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,880
Although you were in danger,

163
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,920
you were not terrified,

164
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,920
and you planned to escape.

165
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,360
Brave girl.

166
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,680
But, that's it.

167
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,400
It's not over!

168
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,800
Don't you want 18 girls?

169
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,040
You know what?

170
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,560
There are only 17 girls here.

171
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,080
This one isn't a girl
disguised as a man.

172
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,440
He is a man.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,520
Why are you selling me out at this time?

174
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,080
What's so funny?

175
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,400
Do you really think

176
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,720
I didn't know?

177
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,200
I lied about the number of girls needed,

178
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,680
little fool.

179
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,480
I only need 17 girls

180
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,120
in my tactics.

181
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,240
You're the only one I want

182
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,560
from beginning to end.

183
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,480
Look at your face.

184
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,280
Soft and smooth,

185
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,600
without any wrinkles.

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,880
Get your hand off me!

187
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,440
You sick old witch!

188
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,760
Go on.

189
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,160
I'll cut you first.

190
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,040
Why not start with another one,

191
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,320
beautiful lady?

192
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,480
She's so fickle.

193
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,000
Take her.

194
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,440
How about drawing lots?

195
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,720
Draw lots, draw lots.

196
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,640
I know.

197
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,840
You are stalling for time,

198
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,040
so you can live longer.

199
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
But

200
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,400
the moon doesn't wait.

201
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,160
Stop joking, Mr. System.

202
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,000
How can a protagonist die in a Dungeon?

203
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,560
Don't you usually like thunder and rain?

204
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,480
Why is there no cloud in the sky now?

205
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,440
Cut me first.

206
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,520
Leave her alone.

207
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,560
Yun Ya, help me.

208
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,400
Help.

209
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,760
Don't worry.

210
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,880
After you die,

211
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,760
your beauty will, through me,

212
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,840
exist in this world forever.

213
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,080
Considering short youth and rapid aging,

214
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,600
this is another kind of immortality.

215
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,200
Isn't it?

216
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,040
Stop it.

217
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,560
Sang Luo.

218
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,680
Go away.

219
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,600
Xi Qing.

220
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,040
Aren't you training?

221
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Why are you here?

222
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,840
It's nothing.

223
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,160
I have to come

224
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,960
to stop you from making mistakes.

225
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,680
Sang Luo,

226
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,120
how can you be so vicious?

227
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,760
Me vicious?

228
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,960
I did all this for you.

229
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,080
Look at yourself,

230
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
and look at me.

231
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,200
When people see us,

232
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,040
they would think we are mother and son.

233
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,800
Never mind what others think.

234
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,520
We love each other. That's enough.

235
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,360
Not enough.

236
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,320
Oh, so,

237
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,640
Sang Luo did all of these

238
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,080
just to pick up a pretty boy.

239
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,760
This view of love is wrong.

240
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,600
I read a lot about cradle-snatcher love.

241
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,680
I know this.

242
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,400
Excuse me.

243
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,880
Listen up.

244
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,640
Miss Jiang's free love class.

245
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,520
Sang Luo,

246
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,880
I have to say it's your fault.

247
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,760
This boy loves you

248
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,160
despite age gap,

249
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,360
which proves that

250
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,960
youth and beauty mean nothing to him.

251
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,280
What did you call me?

252
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,920
Boy.

253
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,800
You should be about my age.

254
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
Little girl,

255
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,080
I'm about your father's age.

256
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
You should call me uncle.

257
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,360
What?

258
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,600
You don't look like

259
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,200
an uncle.

260
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,920
You look…

261
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,080
I'm forty-six.

262
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,160
Forty six?

263
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,360
Here is the thing.

264
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,840
I learned a skill

265
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,200
when I was young.

266
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,760
This skill

267
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,680
can make me look young forever.

268
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,480
I'm sorry. You two go on.

269
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,560
Sang Luo,

270
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,400
I told you that

271
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,440
I love you,

272
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,160
not your youthful face.

273
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,760
No matter you look young or not,

274
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,920
I'll keep loving you.

275
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,600
Don't you believe me?

276
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,880
Of course I believe you.

277
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,840
But I'm still afraid.

278
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,160
Everyone knows

279
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,360
getting old means
being hard to be loved.

280
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,720
When I see myself

281
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,680
getting old in the mirror,

282
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,040
while you

283
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,480
are still a teenager,

284
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,040
I really have no self-confidence.

285
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,640
Xi Qing,

286
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,280
please give me more time.

287
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,440
I have missed this chance.

288
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,240
I can wait for the next full moon.

289
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,040
It doesn't have to be in Qing Luo Town.

290
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,680
I can get other girls somewhere else.

291
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,520
Alright?

292
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,400
Sang Luo,

293
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,920
stop it.

294
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,880
Please be clear-headed.

295
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,560
My head is clear now,

296
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,240
never clearer.

297
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,960
Xi Qing,

298
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,320
you go for training.

299
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,360
One more time.

300
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,080
I only need  a training session.

301
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,240
When next time you finish your training,

302
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,880
I'll succeed.

303
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,960
Xi Qing,

304
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
what are you doing?

305
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,520
What have you done?

306
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,160
Since

307
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,400
you don't believe me,

308
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,760
I dug

309
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,720
my eyes out.

310
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,680
From this moment on,

311
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,960
I can never see you again,

312
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,720
and you will be beautiful forever in
my mind.

313
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,360
Never growing old.

314
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,320
No, I'm sorry.

315
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,360
Xi Qing,

316
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,080
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,280
It's my fault.

318
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,440
It's so moving.

319
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,080
I wish I could meet such a man

320
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,360
in the future.

321
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,720
Xi Qing.

322
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,400
Are you still thinking about tonight?

323
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,000
Have all the girls gone home?

324
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,520
Yeah.

325
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,120
I've asked Song Che and Chang Kong

326
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,240
to walk them back.

327
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,320
Don't worry.

328
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,120
What is still bothering you?

329
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,120
I 'm thinking about
Sang Luo and Xi Qing.

330
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,880
So, it is true

331
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,480
that there are people who don't
care about appearance.

332
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,720
He just can't see anymore.

333
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,920
Murong Chen.

334
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,720
That's not funny.

335
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,280
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,080
I didn't mean it.

337
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
I mean,

338
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,240
true love can transcend all external,

339
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,520
such as appearance, money

340
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,360
and status.

341
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,520
But it doesn't have to be proved

342
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,960
in this extreme way.

343
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,280
But if not in this way,

344
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,760
how can you know that

345
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,680
you have love someone from the outside

346
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,880
to the inside?

347
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,360
Feel with your heart.

348
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,000
How?

349
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,760
If you really like a person,

350
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,160
even if you can't see her clearly,

351
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,880
you will be deeply attracted.

352
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,680
Just like I was unconsciously
attracted to you

353
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,080
before I recognized

354
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,040
you as Xiaomeng.

355
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,920
If one really loves a person,

356
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,520
he doesn't want to get anything
from her,

357
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,640
but to give anything to her

358
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
without reservation.

359
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,920
Even if you have something that
you don't want to do,

360
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,040
you will change

361
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,800
for her,

362
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,480
and make her things your own.

363
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,480
You will bind yourself to her,

364
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,560
and share her motions.

365
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,320
Laugh when she's happy,

366
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,480
and wipe when she's sad.

367
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,160
I get it.

368
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,200
Thank you, Murong Chen.

369
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,360
I didn't expect,

370
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,920
you are the master of love.

371
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,560
(I didn't even know
what Yun Ya looked like,)

372
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,000
(but I was attracted to him.)

373
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,120
(Knowing that he was ill,)

374
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,400
(I wanted to cure him.)

375
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
(For him, I gave up my identity as
a princess,)

376
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,960
(and escaped from the palace.)

377
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,560
(Even if he missed the appointment,)

378
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,600
I still...

379
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,640
(That's right.)

380
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,960
(That's true love.)

381
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,960
The moonlight is so beautiful tonight.

382
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,200
Right, it's beautiful.

383
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,040
But it doesn't know your admiration,
as the way you ignore my affection.

384
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,800
What did you say?

385
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,920
Nothing.

386
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,560
(Jiang Mengmeng,)

387
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,040
(when will you know
my affection to you?)

388
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm sorry.

389
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,040
I've done so many bad things

390
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,680
to you.

391
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,680
It's okay.

392
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,760
We know you didn't mean it.

393
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,960
That's right, Xiao Mei.

394
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,840
We've already forgiven you.

395
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,200
Fortunately, you stopped me,

396
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,120
so there were no irreparable
consequences.

397
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,040
Thank you very much.

398
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,120
You don't have to thank me.

399
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,360
I think it's all Xi Qing's credit.

400
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,200
I wish you happiness and long life
together.

401
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,600
Do you have any plans for the future?

402
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,000
We've sealed the secret passage,

403
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
and decided to move out of the house

404
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,560
and retire.

405
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,840
I'm sorry

406
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,600
to have you retire with me.

407
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,880
Actually,

408
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,600
I'm tired, too.

409
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,000
Only if you are with me,

410
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,320
it doesn't matter where I live.

411
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,320
But I'm blind now.

412
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,160
I can't do many things

413
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,680
that even ordinary people can do.

414
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,120
From now on, I will be your eyes.

415
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,680
Ah right.

416
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,920
I have a parting gift for you.

417
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,960
This is...

418
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,360
the blood night-blooming cereus.

419
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,680
You are giving it to us?

420
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,480
It almost became a murder weapon

421
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,200
in my hands.

422
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,320
But still,

423
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,880
I don't want to destroy it.

424
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,080
So, I decide

425
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,720
to give it to a kind person

426
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,360
who can use it in a right way.

427
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,160
With all due respect,

428
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,240
this blood night-blooming cereus
maybe...

429
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,720
We accept it.

430
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,440
Thank you.

431
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,640
It's about time

432
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,120
we should go.

433
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,560
Right.

434
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,840
So, we are leaving.

435
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,960
See you.

436
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,800
Let's go, Xiao Ai.

437
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,640
Childe, it's so lively here.

438
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,200
Yeah.

439
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,440
Why didn't you let me tell Sang Luo

440
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,600
that the blood night-blooming cereus
might be fake?

441
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,760
Think about it.

442
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,960
She just experienced too much.

443
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,520
She kidnapped so many girls,

444
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,360
and almost became a murderer.

445
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,880
Her husband lost his eyes.

446
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,360
At this moment, you tell her
that all these were a fraud.

447
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,120
Guess if she would collapse?

448
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,720
You are right.

449
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,840
Lies are not necessarily bad.

450
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,160
Sometimes,

451
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,840
white lies can also make things better.

452
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,920
Besides,

453
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,240
her thanks and wishes to you are true,

454
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,880
which is more important than
whether the flower is true or false.

455
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,040
These two are happy now.

456
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
If I hadn't brought Xi Qing,

457
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,520
how could you two be like this?

458
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,200
Didn't I take you to Xi Qing?

459
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,960
We both did it.

460
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
You are right.

461
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,680
Murong Chen.

462
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,800
I usually see you fooling around,

463
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,160
I didn't expect you are so considerate.

464
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,680
Of course I am.

465
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,200
You don't know me very well.

466
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,760
I have many advantages.

467
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,480
Alright, alright.

468
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,920
You are the best.

469
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,680
I mean it.

470
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,440
So do I.

471
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,040
It's a long journey.

472
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,480
Why don't we ride horses?

473
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,240
Mengmeng, come to ride my horse.

474
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,640
Your horse is as stupid

475
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,000
as you.

476
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,760
Mengmeng,

477
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,240
ride my horse.

478
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,880
My Da Huang is a war horse.

479
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,560
Mine is a royal one.

480
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,720
Your horse is as delicate

481
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,080
as you.

482
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,920
Flashy but weak.

483
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,680
I bet he doesn't know the way.

484
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,960
Your horse is as rough as you.

485
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,840
You can insult me,

486
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,120
but not my Da Huang.

487
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,480
Stop it.

488
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,200
I'll handle this.

489
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,760
Childe,

490
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,760
can you do it?

491
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,440
There is a first time for everything.

492
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,440
Don't worry.

493
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,080
We have to sleep here.

494
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,440
Luckily, it's summer now.

495
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,120
It's not that cold at night.

496
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,960
But it's may be hard for Mengmeng.

497
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,520
A  noble princess

498
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,560
has to sleep in the open with us.

499
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,520
I'm not that delicate.

500
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,560
She is a princess, and I'm a prince.

501
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,320
Why don't you sympathize with me?

502
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,480
If you can't bear this,

503
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,640
you can just write a letter

504
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
to Cang Yun Kingdom

505
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,000
and let your people take you back.

506
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,760
Why are you bothering to stay with us?

507
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,840
I just let Mengmeng see me off,

508
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,880
not you.

509
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,360
If you hadn't force Mengmeng,

510
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,000
how could we be together now?

511
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,920
I'd say you don't have a pure motive.

512
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,520
What motive?

513
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,480
You

514
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,440
know it.

515
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,800
- Say it.
- Mengmeng.

516
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,440
Mengmeng, which of us is right?

517
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,520
Mengmeng.

518
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,840
I'm sleepy.

519
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,920
Then go to sleep, childe.

520
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,000
Go to sleep.

521
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,240
I have Chang Kong, what do you get?

522
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,920
Song Che.

523
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,920
What?

524
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,800
Look.

525
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Look.

526
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,080
There.

527
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,720
Right, there.

528
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,160
Did you see it?

529
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,360
What?

530
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,880
Nothing.

531
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,800
You idiot.

532
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,680
What?

533
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,200
What's wrong with you?

534
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,960
I've got Da Huang.

535
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,360
Humph.

536
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,120
A real man would sleep here.

537
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,560
Good night, Da Huang.

538
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,480
Mr. System.

539
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,800
I have completed the mission.

540
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,040
Why don't you

541
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,000
give me some rewards

542
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,080
and let me see Yun Ya?

543
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,400
Did I do it wrong?

544
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,040
Mengmeng.

545
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,200
Yun Ya,

546
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,400
you are here.

547
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,800
This is the right use of full moon.

548
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,880
Are you disappointed

549
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,600
that I didn't come
to get you last night?

550
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,760
You already know?

551
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,280
Right.

552
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,440
The great hero

553
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,520
knows everything.

554
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,240
Actually,
you can send the signal earlier,

555
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,600
without putting yourself in danger.

556
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,040
Or,

557
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,360
it's because I missed the appointment
last time,

558
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,400
and you are still blaming me?

559
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,120
I know

560
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,880
heroes are busy.

561
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,320
If you don't show up,

562
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,000
there must be something holding you.

563
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,320
And you always have to travel all over
the world

564
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,560
to help others.

565
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,160
It's hard to take care of me alone.

566
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,960
If you ask for me,

567
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,120
I will come.

568
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,560
I mean,

569
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,040
helping people is what I do,

570
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,240
and I'll help you if you are in danger.

571
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,320
I knew it.

572
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,440
Speaking of which,

573
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,520
this time I also experienced

574
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,080
the happiness of punishing the evil
and helping others.

575
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,360
I used to be surrounded

576
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,600
by a crowd in the palace.

577
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,440
I thought,

578
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,720
as long as they can protect me

579
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,160
and love me, it's fine.

580
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,720
But after I left the palace,

581
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,200
those people around me were not there
anymore.

582
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,880
I found that

583
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,200
there are also things I can do,

584
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,440
such as saving my companions,

585
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,080
the girls,

586
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,720
and temporarily lost Sang Luo.

587
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,560
It turns out that

588
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,560
there are so many things

589
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,400
that make people feel happy

590
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,520
except being loved.

591
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,280

596

This plot...

597
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,880
Is the climax coming?

598
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,200
Are you alright?

599
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,640
I'm okay.

600
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,200
Oh.

601
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,840
Last time you said you would help me
find the blood night-blooming cereus.

602
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,320
Don't bother.

603
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,600
Why?

604
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
I was detained last time,

605
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,320
and failed to get you

606
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,280
out of palace.

607
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,520
I broke the promise.

608
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,600
So, let's end our cooperation.

609
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,480
You fool.

610
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,080
What?

611
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,440
I said you are a fool

612
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,720
who doesn't know a girl's mind at all.

613
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,680
Those agreements

614
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,200
are to cure you.

615
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
You mean,

616
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,040
you want to cure me?

617
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,640
Don't you understand?

618
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,560
Both the blood night-blooming cereus

619
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,680
and the agreements

620
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,920
are my excuses.

621
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,280
I just want you to be healthy

622
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,320
and happy.

623
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,000
I hope you can do what you want
without worry.

624
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,800
There is no trade between you and me,

625
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
only love.

626
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,360
What kind of man

627
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,200
would run away every time I hit on him?

628
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,880
You should have put me down
before you leave.

629
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,960
What now?

630
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,800
