(one of you four dies.)

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,840
Zhe Xiang,

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,760
I'm the worst one of us.

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,600
They will definitely kill me.

29
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,160
Don't worry.

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,920
I will protect you.

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,480
I will get you out of here alive.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,360
Why?

33
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,640
Sorry, senior.

34
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,840
Don't blame me.

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,040
I just want to be alive.

36
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,800
I, Zhe Xiang, from now on,

37
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,880
will never believe in
sisterhood anymore.

38
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,320
I promised that

39
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,080
I would get you out of here alive.

40
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,040
My lovely disciple,

41
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,120
you seem to have killed more than one.

42
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,720
One more useless person

43
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,040
is too many as well.

44
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,000
You're right.

45
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,440
I change my mind now.

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,720
I only want one disciple.

47
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,000
Go

48
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,360
and kill her for me.

49
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,400
Senior,

50
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,720
I just want to be alive.

51
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,560
Don't kill me. No!

52
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,000
Going through this kind of pain

53
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,040
once is enough for me.

54
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
I can't do it.

55
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,960
Xiao Ai.

56
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,120
Zhe Xiang.

57
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,800
I can't do it.

58
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,920
Zhe Xiang.

59
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,680
I can't do it.

60
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,240
Zhe Xiang.

61
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,440
I can't do it.

62
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,880
Wake up!

63
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,840
Zhe Xiang.

64
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,640
I can't do it.

65
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,400
Zhe Xiang.

66
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,240
Put it down.

67
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
Wake up!

68
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,880
I can't stand it anymore
if you don't wake up.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,040
- I can't do it.
- Zhe Xiang.

70
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,520
Zhe Xiang.

71
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,200
Jiang Mengmeng, are you crazy?

72
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,640
You finally woke up.

73
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,680
Blood. Blood. Blood.

74
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,440
Thank you.

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,680
Why do I always get hurt?

76
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,360
Help! Help!

77
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,040
What's that sound?

78
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,120
Is it Song Che?

79
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:09,920
Let's go.

80
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,000
What is this guy doing here?

81
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,600
Song Che.

82
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,280
Song Che.

83
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,000
Song Che.

84
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,600
General, please wake up!

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,360
We have lost the battle.

86
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,560
We have to run.

87
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,480
Run?

88
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,240
Tell me.

89
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
Where should I run to?

90
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,080
Where should I run to?

91
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,440
Go away.

92
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,760
Mengmeng,

93
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,640
why are you with him?

94
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,760
Who else would I be with?

95
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,040
You want me to be with you,
who lost the battle?

96
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,320
It's been eight years.

97
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,640
Big and small battles

98
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,600
for over 50 times.

99
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
I've got fellow soldiers dying
next to me.

100
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,320
There were enemies as well.

101
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,160
I felt scared every day.

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,120
When I felt scared, I thought of my mom

103
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,920
and you.

104
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,480
I thought of

105
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,320
the days before we were 12 years old.

106
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,800
Mengmeng,

107
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,320
tell me,

108
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,120
why am I not as good as him?

109
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,320
Why am I not as good as him?

110
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,520
Tell me. Tell me.

111
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,720
Murong Chen is the 5th prince of
Cang Yun Kingdom.

112
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,960
He has a noble identity,

113
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,000
and he is handsome and rich too.

114
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,080
He is much, much better than you.

115
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,800
Look at you, Song Che.

116
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,360
You look so poor.

117
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,800
How can you compete with me?

118
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,280
And you dare to take Mengmeng from me?

119
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,360
I despise you.

120
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,280
Hit me. Come here. Come here.

121
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,240
Come and hit me.

122
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,520
Help!

123
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,080
Help!

124
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,000
Help! Help!

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,600
Help!

126
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,480
Help!

127
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,360
What's that sound?

128
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,720
Help!

129
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,160
Help!

130
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,920
I punch you.

131
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,880
Mengmeng.

132
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,280
What?

133
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
What? What happened?

134
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,160
Why is my face hurting so much?

135
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,880
You just lost a fight with Zhe Xiang.

136
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,000
Then, you went crazy.

137
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,960
You kept slapping yourself.

138
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,440
I lost the fight to her?

139
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
That's impossible!

140
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,720
My...

141
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,600
Where is my sword?

142
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,160
My sword?

143
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,920
There it is.

144
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,720
Let me go!

145
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,200
How did you get hurt?

146
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,120
Just small wound.

147
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,120
Why didn't you tell me?

148
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,400
I cut my hand on a branch.

149
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,640
And the wound was already bandaged
by Zhe Xiang.

150
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,280
How could I lose the fight to her?

151
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,440
It is impossible.

152
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,600
By the way,
where are Chang Kong and Xiao Ai?

153
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,800
Yeah...

154
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,560
I wish we could always be here.

155
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,680
That would be nice.

156
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,840
Yes, I like here.

157
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,400
If His Highness is here as well,

158
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,800
that would be nice.

159
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,040
If Her Highness is here,

160
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,640
that would be nice.

161
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,160
Well,

162
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,960
we have to find the
5th prince and 9th princess.

163
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,040
By the way,

164
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,400
as for what happened just now,

165
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,760
please don't let others know.

166
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,120
OK.

167
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,920
Let's just pretend this never happened,
OK?

168
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,160
Your Highness.

169
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,840
Xiao Ai.

170
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,520
Your Highness.

171
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,160
Your Highness.

172
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,400
Are you OK?

173
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:08,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

174
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,960
Are you really OK?

175
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,960
- Yes, really.
- Yes, really.

176
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,840
OK, then.

177
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,600
The fog has lifted anyway.

178
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
Let's get out of here.

179
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,560
Yes. Let's go.

180
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,520
Let's go.

181
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,040
Let me go.

182
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,080
What are you doing?

183
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,160
Let me go.

184
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,120
It can't be true.

185
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,880
How could I possibly lose to her?

186
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,440
There was no way I lost to her.

187
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,760
Where is my scabbard?

188
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,360
Is anybody home?

189
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,520
It's safe.

190
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,720
Finally, I can enjoy a good sleep.

191
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,320
We can only stay here for the night.

192
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,480
Sorry to let you put up with it,
Your Highness.

193
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,200
Yes.

194
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,480
Your Highness,

195
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,720
you have to put up with it for a while.

196
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,040
When we arrive at Cang Yun Kingdom,

197
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,840
you won't have to
suffer with us anymore.

198
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,160
Mengmeng, he hit me.

199
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,520
Xiao Ai, he hit me.

200
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,920
Your Highness,

201
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,000
I'll go in and prepare a bed for you.

202
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,480
Mengmeng.

203
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,880
Why don't you two share a bed?

204
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,320
Again?

205
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,360
Who wants to
sleep in the same bed with you?

206
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,760
I don't want to
sleep in the same bed with you, either.

207
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,880
Sharing the bed with her
is better than...

208
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,160
I don't want to share
the bed with you, either.

209
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,880
Now that I know everything,

210
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,680
it's time to put an end to it.

211
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,160
Why do you have to do this every time?

212
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,120
Always by hurting yourself.

213
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,400
You don't care about

214
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,960
your life?

215
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,800
Sure enough, you are here.

216
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,920
Tell me,

217
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,160
why did you always

218
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,080
show up when my life was in danger?

219
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,080
Even if I didn't launch Tian Ji Token

220
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,080
or ask for help,

221
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,680
you knew exactly where I was.

222
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,600
The first time we met,

223
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,040
why were you in Ruo Shui Kingdom?

224
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,640
I just...

225
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,080
Just happened to walk by
and saved my life, right?

226
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,000
How about the second time?

227
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,800
How about the third time?

228
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,960
The palace was strongly guarded.

229
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Even if you are a great warrior,

230
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,080
how could you just
come and go so freely?

231
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,240
(Does she know everything?)

232
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,120
When I was in Ruo Shui Kingdom,

233
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,640
you were there as well.

234
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,120
Then, when I'm walking around the world,

235
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,400
you too.

236
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,600
I thought it was the storyline that

237
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,240
kept you showing up again and again.

238
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,640
Now, I realized

239
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,120
you were always with me.

240
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,720
Mengmeng,

241
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,400
I'm sorry.

242
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,640
I didn't mean to lie to you.

243
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,320
A Mu.

244
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,920
The first time we met,

245
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,000
you asked if I knew about Liang City.

246
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,360
You also said I look like
an old friend of yours.

247
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,320
At that time, I didn't know

248
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,080
where Liang City was.

249
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,360
I didn't know

250
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,800
I am the old friend you mentioned.

251
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,960
I didn't know it was not encounter,

252
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,000
but our reunion.

253
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,840
I didn't know

254
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,880
you've been with me all the way,

255
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,320
and protected me quietly.

256
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,120
You've been by my side all the time.

257
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,200
I didn't even know

258
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,680
your cold poison was because of me.

259
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,680
I took the liberty of

260
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,320
finding the blood night-blooming cereus
to make a deal with you.

261
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,800
I'm sorry.

262
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,590
♪Of all the waters♪

263
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,800
Don't be too sad.

264
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,880
♪I took a ladle only♪

265
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,660
♪Of all the flowers♪

266
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,560
I never blamed you for anything.

267
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,600
♪Of all the waters♪

268
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,760
So many things have
happened over these years.

269
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,800
Uncle Qi passed away.

270
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,720
You are the Master of
Tian Ji Pavilion now.

271
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,840
Before Uncle Qi died,

272
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,080
he was so worried about you and me.

273
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,640
We are now very good.

274
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,400
In the heaven, Uncle Qi

275
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,200
will feel happy.

276
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,440
By the way,

277
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,880
that she-devil,

278
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,320
did she ever come to you?

279
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,960
After Uncle Qi passed
me the Tian Ji Token,

280
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,600
I transferred all the activities of
Tian Ji Pavilion to underground.

281
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,520
Tian Ji Pavilion is
an intelligence-gathering organization.

282
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,280
Acting in a diametrically opposite way

283
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,680
and hiding.

284
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,720
But to the outside world,

285
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,480
Tian Ji Pavilion disappeared
ten years ago.

286
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,440
These years must have been hard for you.

287
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,640
Uncle Qi saved my life.

288
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,960
This is what I should do.

289
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,000
I have made a decision.

290
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,120
What decision?

291
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,720
You have your own responsibilities.

292
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,920
I have mine too.

293
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,680
I promise you

294
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,320
I will find blood night-blooming cereus

295
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,640
and cure your cold poison.

296
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,840
In this way, you don't have to
worry about that she-devil anymore.

297
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,280
You can live under the sunshine again.

298
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,560
By the way, A Mu.

299
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:30,960
Fine,

300
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,160
I call you Yun Ya.

301
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,160
Over these years,

302
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,720
you have been wearing
a mask all the time.

303
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,960
No one has ever seen
how you really look like?

304
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,040
Actually, the first time I met you,

305
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,800
I almost took your mask off.

306
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,040
Now I realized

307
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,880
it was lucky that I didn't do that.

308
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,840
Why?

309
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,760
Think about

310
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,440
how dangerous you are now.

311
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,920
If one more person knows
who you really are,

312
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,800
you would be even more dangerous.

313
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,320
If it were you,

314
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,960
it would be fine.

315
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,680
Me?

316
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,800
If you really want to have a look.

317
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,120
Your Highness.

318
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,640
Chang Kong?

319
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,760
Chang Kong,

320
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,000
what are you doing here?

321
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,720
I accompanied His Highness
to take a leak.

322
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,640
I found that you were missing.

323
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,960
Then, I came here to look for you.

324
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,880
I came here for that too.

325
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,680
By the way, where is Murong Chen?

326
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,080
His Highness is waiting for me
somewhere else.

327
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,920
Your Highness, shall we go back?

328
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,680
OK.

329
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,920
Then, let's go back.

330
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,520
Why did you stop me?

331
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,320
Chang Kong acts on my own way.

332
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,960
Your Highness, please punish me.

333
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,000
You...

334
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,080
9th princess has got her memory back.

335
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,320
She wants to get the blood
night-blooming cereus to save Yun Ya.

336
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,560
This is in line with our plan.

337
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,920
But if Your Highness
tells the truth now...

338
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,680
You're afraid that
I'll break up with the 9th princess.

339
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,560
She won't help me open the
blood night-blooming cereus.

340
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,720
I just don't want Your Highness

341
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,880
to ruin the final plan

342
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,880
just for the sake of love.

343
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,680
I lied to her over and over again.

344
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,440
But she took me so sincerely.

345
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,560
- I...
- Your Highness,

346
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,720
it is the last step.

347
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,720
Your Highness, why not

348
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,680
get along with the 9th princess,
just like you used to do?

349
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,800
After we find the
blood night-blooming cereus

350
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,200
and the big picture is decided,

351
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,200
it won't be too late
to tell her the truth then.

352
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,840
Your Highness.

353
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,920
Your Highness.

354
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,680
(When I hugged Yun Ya,)

355
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,560
(why didn't my heart beat faster?)

356
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,600
(No. No.)

357
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,600
(We have such deep connection.)

358
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,880
(My hero must be him.)

359
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,800
(It has to be him.)

360
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,120
No way...

361
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,000
No. No. No.

362
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,480
No what?

363
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,240
(I must have been shocked by him.)

364
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,880
Murong Chen,

365
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,720
in the middle of the night,

366
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,760
what are you doing out here,
scaring others?

367
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,640
I didn't mean to scare you.

368
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,200
I'm here, waiting for you.

369
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,920
When you got back,
who knows what you were thinking,

370
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,840
you just walked right into me.

371
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,640
Oh, it hurts.

372
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,880
You said you were waiting for me.

373
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Why?

374
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,920
Since you're OK,

375
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,440
I'm good too.

376
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,480
There is something.

377
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,480
Murong Chen,

378
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,800
what I am going to say is very serious.

379
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,280
Absolutely not joking.

380
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,280
I admit I did have a crush on you.

381
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,800
Really?

382
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,000
But that's as far as it goes.

383
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,320
All the time,

384
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,720
I think I'm just playing a game.

385
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,840
The storyline is a game.

386
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,000
The emotions are games too.

387
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,920
You know,

388
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,360
the men who are
inside and outside the palace,

389
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,800
I have checked them all.

390
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,080
They are all excluded by me.

391
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,600
So,

392
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,720
I am also excluded,

393
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,160
right?

394
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,040
I know what I said

395
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,720
does not sound good to you.

396
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,520
But if I don't tell you right now,

397
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,120
I think it will be not
good to you even more.

398
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,440
I've been

399
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,120
only caring about my own happiness.

400
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,680
I never thought

401
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,440
what I did would make other people sad.

402
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,360
So for this,

403
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,440
I want to apologize.

404
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,960
I'm sorry.

405
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
About what you just said,

406
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,040
I feel really happy.

407
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,960
But I have a question.

408
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,720
Just ask.

409
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,320
Why is he,

410
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,480
the one you like?

411
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,240
Actually, I don't know why it is him.

412
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,800
But I just know that

413
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,920
he is the reason why I don't
want to pick anyone else.

414
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,760
I can understand.

415
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,280
Now that we're both clear,

416
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,520
we're going our separate ways.

417
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,720
You won't send me to Cang Yun Kingdom?

418
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,520
Of course, I will.

419
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,680
I will send you to...

420
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,840
But...

421
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,200
You really don't want to see me?

422
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,080
What about what you said before?
"Merry meet, merry part"?

423
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,000
No. No. No.

424
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,320
I didn't mean that.

425
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,120
I mean

426
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,640
I have something else to deal with.

427
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
It's also because of him?

428
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,800
Do you remember that

429
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,600
we went to find the
blood night-blooming cereus?

430
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,480
Wait a minute.

431
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,460
(Egret Villa)

432
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,800
This.

433
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,560
Wait a minute.

434
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,230
(Egret Villa)

435
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,320
Since we want the same thing.

436
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,400
How about...

437
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,720
OK, this is a deal.

438
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,400
We are only teammates looking for
the blood night-blooming cereus.

439
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,760
Nothing else.

440
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,360
Only teammates.

441
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,240
Nothing else.

442
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,640
Then, our next target is

443
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,520
Egret Villa.

444
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,120
Put out the fire!

445
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,440
Help put out the fire!

446
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,920
There's a fire. Somebody, please help.

447
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,200
Quickly. Quickly. Put out the fire.

448
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,360
(Cereus Villa)
What happened? What happened?

449
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,040
Help! Someone, please help!

450
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,600
Come and put out the fire.

451
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,720
(Liang City to Egret Villa)

452
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,280
(Egret Villa)

453
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,280
Wow, big mansion.

454
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,400
Yes, it is.

455
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,400
I thought

456
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,640
only Ruo Shui Palace has

457
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,240
such kind of big mansion.

458
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,320
The landlord must be somebody.

459
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,040
Well, you haven't seen

460
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,520
the buildings of our Cang Yun Kingdom.

461
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
This kind of mansion

462
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,240
is so normal there.

463
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,760
Then tell me,

464
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,280
if Cang Yun Kingdom is
so strong and rich,

465
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,920
why did you come to
Ruo Shui Kingdom for blind date?

466
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,880
You...

467
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,080
(Lu Feibai)

468
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,560
I'm not aware of your visit.

469
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,680
I didn't come to welcome you.

470
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,600
Please forgive me, three ladies.

471
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,440
La...

472
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,400
Who said we are ladies?

473
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,040
Such beautiful ladies.

474
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,320
You can't be men.

475
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,640
Moreover,

476
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,160
this lady looks familiar.

477
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,360
Maybe we have met each other
before somewhere.

478
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,560
Such a bad move!

479
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,880
Landlord, you are eagle-eyed.

480
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,440
You called me "landlord".
That's not close enough.

481
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,480
I'm Lu Feibai.

482
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,600
I'm a business man.

483
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,920
Ladies can call me Childe Lu.

484
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,720
If you don't mind,
you can call me Brother Lu.

485
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,400
Brother Lu...

486
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,400
Please call me Landlord Lu.

487
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,960
You are such a...

488
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,640
I...

489
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,800
Childe Lu,

490
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,000
I haven't had a chance
to introduce myself.

491
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,360
You can call me Jiang Mengmeng.

492
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,600
They are my companions in the journey.

493
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,160
We are passing through.

494
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,800
I am just wondering
if we can spend the night here.

495
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,680
Yes, of course, you can.

496
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,440
No matter how many nights
Mengmeng wants to stay here,

497
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,240
I will be fine with it.

498
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:55,880
Please.

499
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,280
Let's go.

500
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,640
- See...
- Mengmeng.

501
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,520
See that?

502
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,760
You...

503
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,360
If you want to stay, just stay here.

504
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,880
I won't stay here.

505
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:10,880
Let's go, Song Che.

506
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,600
Red coral.

507
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,600
Gold and silver vessels.

508
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,200
This is...

509
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,880
Childe Lu,

510
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,520
you have more treasures

511
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,240
than my 8th brother.

512
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,000
Do you have mineral
resources related business?

513
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,720
If you like them, just take them.

514
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,200
Wow,

515
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,960
that's so generous of you.

516
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,640
They're all fake.

517
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,160
That's why he is so generous.

518
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,080
Murong Chen, be polite.

519
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,200
Childe Murong is eagle-eyed.

520
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,720
No way!

521
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,400
Fake?

522
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,360
Let's see.

523
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,440
This luminous pearl.

524
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,000
It should be with pearl powder varnish.

525
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,160
Fake!

526
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,400
This coral

527
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,880
is dyed with red paint.

528
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,200
This golden vase is

529
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,320
plated with copper.

530
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,800
How about this one?

531
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,960
For this one,

532
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,120
the rubies on it are made of glass.

533
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,200
Take it. It's a toy.

534
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,120
Glass?

535
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,920
What Childe Murong said

536
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,000
is true.

537
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,400
They're all fake.

538
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,480
Oh, I know.

539
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,600
He is a counterfeiter
specializing in selling fake goods.

540
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,640
Mengmeng,

541
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
you have wronged me.

542
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,000
The "treasures" I have here
are all fake,

543
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,680
but the goods are real.

544
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,560
Childe Murong has a bright eye.

545
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,080
Your family must be grand and rich.

546
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,280
Everything in your house must be
made of gold, jade and precious stones.

547
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,520
That's true.

548
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,720
Everything in my house is real.

549
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,400
Have you ever thought about this?

550
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,960
If an ordinary family

551
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,480
wants to buy something decent,

552
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,360
they can't afford a real one

553
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,920
within their life time.

554
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,720
So you're selling these goods

555
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,200
to ordinary people?

556
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,200
Yes.

557
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,640
They just can't
afford to buy a real one.

558
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,440
So they buy a fake one

559
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,440
to be self-deceiving

560
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,840
and satisfy their own vanity.

561
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,400
Poor people don't deserve it!

562
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,280
OK?

563
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,200
Childe Murong, you're wrong.

564
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,040
Everyone is fond of beautiful things.

565
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,800
They are not rich,

566
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,440
so they should have nothing

567
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,440
but food and clothing

568
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,600
instead of quality of life?

569
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,840
Maybe you think these goods are
worthless.

570
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,960
To an ordinary person,

571
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,440
they have no need to collect treasury
and maintain their value.

572
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,120
But as long as it makes their life

573
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,640
more colorful,

574
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,240
that's the greatest value to them.

575
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,200
You're so right!

576
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,240
Compared with very few
upper-class rich people,

577
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,520
most of the people
are from normal families.

578
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,560
They represent the
vast majority of people in this world.

579
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,120
It's a huge market,

580
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,400
with huge potential.

581
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,760
But businessmen often overlook
this market.

582
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,680
They think that ordinary people

583
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,120
have no demand for luxury goods.

584
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,000
You're right.

585
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,080
This is called "light luxury".

586
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,680
Light luxury?

587
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,080
Xiao Ai can't understand.

588
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,200
But I can feel it seems

589
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,480
pretty good.

590
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,040
Childe Lu,

591
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,880
you really have extraordinary
talent in business,

592
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,800
and you are also commercially minded.

593
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,080
You even have humanistic concern.

594
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,840
You are handsome as well.

595
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,600
You're a great businessman.

596
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,240
Thank you, Mengmeng.

597
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,360
Then, can you

598
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,440
please tell me about

599
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,680
how these,

600
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,920
these, and these

601
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,040
goods are produced?

602
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,080
Look, this one...

603
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,400
- Oh no.
- Don't stop him. Don't stop him.

604
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,640
- Calm down.
- Don't stop him.

605
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,800
That's amazing! You are so brilliant.

606
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,640
By the way,

607
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,680
Landlord Lu,

608
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,000

609
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,920
