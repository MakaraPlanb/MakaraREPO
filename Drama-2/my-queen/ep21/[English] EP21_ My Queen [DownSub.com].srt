no form,

which means to stay away
from any kind of form.

gender

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,600
should be ignored.

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,240
Have you said something?

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,880
Why are you wearing it now?

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,920
Take it off.

38
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,640
But

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,600
I have a question.

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,680
Say it.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,480
If I can't see,

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
hear,

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,280
or even smell,

44
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
how could I know where my opponent is?

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,040
See,

46
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,080
hear, and smell with your heart.

47
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,720
With my heart...

48
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,680
Never mind.

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Let's do this.

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
What happened?

51
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,640
What's that?

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,120
Are we stopping?

53
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,040
How did you know I stopped?

54
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,000
Right...

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,320
How did I know?

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Let's continue.

57
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,480
I did it!

58
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,920
Not bad.

59
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,360
I've been busy teaching
you in recent days.

60
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,680
My own Kung Fu was neglected.

61
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,680
I have to train myself alone
for a few days.

62
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,080
You have to work hard

63
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,520
on your own.

64
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,560
- On my own?
- Sure.

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,040
How can I practice alone?

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,080
The array of arrows...

67
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,840
She hasn't eaten or drunk for days...

68
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,720
It's the sixth day.

69
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,000
Why are you still not awake?

70
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,560
Murong Chen.

71
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,560
Mengmeng.

72
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,040
What did you say?

73
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,840
Mengmeng.

74
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,520
Speak louder.

75
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,640
What did you say?

76
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,360
Mengmeng.

77
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,640
Mengmeng.

78
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,440
Take your hands off me!

79
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,600
Stop it!

80
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,160
What are you doing?

81
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,720
Damn it.

82
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,560
Why are you here now?

83
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,840
Let me explain this.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,840
I'm not... I didn't...

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,840
We are just...

86
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,840
Just help me.

87
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,280
Off.

88
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,040
You took advantage of me.

89
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,560
I've been away only for a few days.

90
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,480
How could he be like this?

91
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,840
Now that you are back,

92
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,440
I'll leave him to you.

93
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,360
Your Highness.

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,160
Chang Kong.

95
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,440
Your Highness.

96
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
You are back.

97
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,700
(Xixi House)

98
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,600
The master is generous.

99
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,080
She went to train herself

100
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,720
and left me a big house.

101
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,800
She ordered to repair

102
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,440
the house long time ago.

103
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,840
Now it's done.

104
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,320
Do you like it?

105
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,400
Yes.

106
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,880
Yes, I do.

107
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,480
I moved your things here

108
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,600
from your old room.

109
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,880
Check to see if there's
anything missing.

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,920
Zhe Xiang,

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,320
have I killed a man

112
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,320
with this sword?

113
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,520
Mengmeng,

114
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,960
you remember?

115
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,320
I just remembered that

116
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,560
I seem to have killed an enemy.

117
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,160
Great.

118
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,440
My enemy is dead now.

119
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,120
Mengmeng,

120
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
what's the matter?

121
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,200
It's weird.

122
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,840
Why am I crying?

123
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,160
(The map shows branches of Jing Yue
Sect that have been eliminated)

124
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,360
Well done.

125
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,400
Your Highness,

126
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,800
you were poisoned by the seven-day
poison of Jing Yue Sect.

127
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,160
Today is the sixth day.

128
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,440
As its name implies,

129
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,520
if you don't take the
antidote within seven days,

130
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,120
you'll die.

131
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
Your Highness,

132
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,160
why didn't you call me back earlier?

133
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,640
I sent you to finish the mission.

134
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,560
If I recalled you halfway,

135
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,240
won't the entire effort

136
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,040
be spoiled?

137
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,640
So you planned to die here alone?

138
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,280
I wasn't alone.

139
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,840
Song Che was here for me.

140
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
It's not the point.

141
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,120
The point is

142
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,680
you are dying!

143
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,240
Maybe that's my destiny.

144
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,960
Now that all has been arranged,

145
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,640
you have to help me finish
the undone work

146
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,840
even if I may die tomorrow.

147
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,000
Your Highness,

148
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,280
you can't die.

149
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,240
What shall I do if you die?

150
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,440
He won't die.

151
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,880
What are you doing here?

152
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,720
I'm here to save his life.

153
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,400
You did this to him.

154
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,720
Now you said you would save him.

155
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,080
How could I believe you?

156
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,800
This is the antidote.

157
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,240
Suit yourself.

158
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,440
How do I know it's the antidote,

159
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,600
not a more toxic poison?

160
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,720
Without the antidote,

161
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,760
Murong Chen will die tomorrow.

162
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,440
Why do I have to bother

163
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,240
with poisoning him again?

164
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,760
Believe it or not.

165
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,680
I believe you.

166
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,280
Your Highness.

167
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,840
Why do you want to save me?

168
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,240
I don't want Jiang Mengmeng to be sad.

169
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,560
Now that you're here,

170
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,760
you might want to listen to a story.

171
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,480
Yu Qingzhu took the blood
night-blooming cereus

172
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,520
in Cereus Villa that year.

173
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,440
But she killed everyone,

174
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,040
so she had no way to know how to use it.

175
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,360
Then she came to

176
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,040
the omniscient Tian Ji Pavilion,

177
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
and let Tian Ji Pavilion

178
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,240
help her practice Blood Moon Power...

179
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,600
If you are trying to tell me

180
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,480
how Jing Yue Sect did
evil in those years

181
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,760
and persuade me to give it up,

182
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,920
I'd like to say

183
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,840
save it.

184
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,320
Wait a second.

185
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,960
I'm not finished.

186
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,640
Yun Qi, the master back then,

187
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,680
would rather die than surrender.

188
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,560
When Tian Ji Pavilion was
destroyed by Jing Yue Sect,

189
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,200
Qu Yeming,

190
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,880
junior of the master,

191
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
and also his deputy,

192
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
pretended to surrender to Jing Yue Sect

193
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,480
and helped Yu Qingzhu

194
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,720
open the blood night-blooming cereus

195
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,560
and practice the Blood Moon Power.

196
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,600
That means

197
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,360
Yun Qi used the time

198
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,640
that Qu Yeming bought for him

199
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:13,644
to dismiss Tian Ji Pavilion and

200
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,680
to disperse the people of
Tian Ji Pavilion to other places?

201
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,840
That's right.

202
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,600
How was the blood
night-blooming cereus stolen?

203
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Qu Yeming stole it.

204
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,600
He wanted to destroy
the flower at first,

205
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,160
but the flower had
already got the immortal spirit.

206
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:35,984
Normal people can't destroy it.

207
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,440
So he used his power of his whole life

208
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,820
to seal the flower in the
box of Cold Jade,

209
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,340
and with his last breath,

210
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,640
he handed it over to reclusive Uncle Qi.

211
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,520
Uncle Qi

212
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,080
never told anyone

213
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
where the flower was
even when he was dying.

214
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,280
Where did you read the story?

215
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,920
Do you know who wrote the story?

216
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,600
It's the master of Tian Ji Pavilion.

217
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,520
The first master of Tian Ji Pavilion

218
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,440
loved collecting stories in the world.

219
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,080
He compiled these stories into a book,

220
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,080
and Tian Ji Pavilion, an intelligence
unit was founded based on this.

221
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,920
It's handed down from
generation to generation.

222
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,200
There are two versions

223
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,840
of this book,

224
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,680
inside one and outside one.

225
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,840
The master decides

226
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,800
what the content of this outside one

227
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,640
looks like.

228
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,720
So

229
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,600
you wrote the stories.

230
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,640
What you just heard

231
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,520
is from the inside one,

232
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,840
which is definitely true.

233
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,320
I won't change my position

234
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,840
because of these past events.

235
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,400
Welcome back, master.

236
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,440
Get up.

237
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,560
How's the situation
of the Sect recently?

238
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,520
Master,

239
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,560
everything is fine.

240
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,920
How about the chosen one?

241
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,360
Did she work hard on training?

242
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,440
Mengmeng,

243
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,600
I don't think you should do it.

244
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Don't worry.

245
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,080
I'm the chosen one.

246
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,200
Let her chop if she really wants.

247
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,320
What if she gets hurt?

248
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,120
I'm not even afraid of catching
arrows with my bare hands,

249
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,840
why should I be afraid of firewood?

250
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,600
Incredible!

251
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,040
Bring me

252
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,600
all of the rest.

253
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,880
This pile of firewood will be
enough for us to use for a month.

254
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,960
Thank you.

255
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,240
No problem.

256
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,160
You can ask me for help

257
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,520
anytime.

258
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,760
I didn't expect the chosen
one to be so approachable.

259
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,840
- She's so kind.
- Right.

260
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,720
It'll be easy for us.

261
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,440
What are you doing here?

262
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,080
Who let the chosen one do such a thing?

263
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,320
Step forward!

264
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,440
You taught me this.

265
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,520
I taught you?

266
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,160
Yes. You said

267
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,480
as for what men can do,

268
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,880
we women can do it too.

269
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,440
We are queens of ourselves.

270
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,760
That's not what I meant.

271
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,680
If you don't have better things to do,

272
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,000
I have a mission for you.

273
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,680
What mission?

274
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,040
The demon's here.

275
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,120
Run, everyone!

276
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,720
Run!

277
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,760
The master let me
come out to sabotage the world,

278
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,760
but people ran away
as soon as they saw me.

279
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,800
Little ones,

280
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,840
is it good?

281
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,360
I'd like to have one.

282
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,360
Thank you.

283
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Thank you.

284
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,440
She freaked me out.

285
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,840
Yeah, me too.

286
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,040
The demon took things from the children.

287
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,920
The demon took children!

288
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,920
I said the demon ate
food of the children.

289
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,800
The demon ate children!

290
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,160
Run!

291
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,680
It is said today that

292
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,880
the 9th princess catches children to eat

293
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,400
in order to master evil power.

294
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,040
Is it true?

295
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,240
It's just a rumor.

296
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,760
But Zhe Xiang still...

297
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,360
They are different.

298
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,720
I can't let people get Mengmeng wrong.

299
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,600
What do you want?

300
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,160
The young lady you met last time

301
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,920
told me to give these to you.

302
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,400
Stop!

303
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,320
(Happiness)
[*A symbol posted at newlyweds' home]

304
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,400
There is a wedding.

305
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh, no. The bridegroom is gone.

306
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,840
She took someone's bridegroom?

307
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,080
Yes.

308
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,360
Actually,

309
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
bridegrooms.

310
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,640
There has never been a
man in Jing Yue Sect.

311
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,040
Master,

312
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,400
should we...

313
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,640
Never mind. Let her be.

314
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Now there are rumors

315
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,440
about the chosen one doing evil,

316
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,560
and it's hard

317
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
to tell the true from the false.

318
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,520
But this one is totally true.

319
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,720
It's okay.

320
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,640
My goal has been achieved.

321
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,280
It doesn't matter whether
it's true or not.

322
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,960
She has no turning back now.

323
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,240
Well,

324
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll go to see her.

325
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,040
What are you going to do

326
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
with the men you took back?

327
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,160
I'll make a harem

328
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,840
and enjoy

329
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,240
being surrounded by handsome guys.

330
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,800
But you used to say

331
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,800
that love is a matter of two people,

332
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,120
and there is no room for a third one.

333
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Did I?

334
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,360
I was a fool before.

335
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,760
Now I understand

336
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,520
what matters is not love

337
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,920
but being happy.

338
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,920
But you are almost hated

339
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,080
by everyone outside there.

340
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,040
Don't you even care?

341
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,600
So what?

342
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,960
I wanted to be a hero

343
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,920
and help others,

344
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,440
so I did many good deeds before,

345
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,120
but they decided to hate me

346
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,640
just because of the blood
night-blooming cereus.

347
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,000
The master is right.

348
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,400
Love

349
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,440
and justice

350
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,640
are both hypocritical.

351
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,920
I'll be the queen ruling the world

352
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,400
and make everyone afraid of me.

353
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,840
I'm going to teach you the fourth
level of Blood Moon Power,

354
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
no ego.

355
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,920
What I taught you before
are all about external things,

356
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,080
but your greatest enemy is yourself.

357
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,520
That means

358
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,120
if I can

359
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,320
forget myself,

360
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,800
fear nothing

361
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,880
and worry about nothing,

362
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,840
I'll be invincible?

363
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
That's right.

364
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,160
Totally right.

365
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,560
You have made great progress.

366
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,560
Alright, let's do this.

367
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,880
Please wait.

368
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,960
I have a requirement.

What did you do to her?

Take it off.

389
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,640
Your Highness,

390
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,440
- I think you are bullying me.
- Just do it.

391
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,760
Do it, do it.

392
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,160
You are a fool,

393
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,560
handsome.

394
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,880

- Song Che.

395

Your Highness,

00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,440
- you can't be so fickle.
- Yeah.

399
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,160
Come on, I knew him long before you.

400
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,640
Looks like it's the case.

401
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,720
Mengmeng,

402
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,320
how did you become like this now?

403
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,480
Like this?

404
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,120
Is this not good?

405
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,600
Don't we play games just for fun?

406
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,120
These pretty boys

407
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,000
are obedient to me, aren't you?

408
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,200
Yeah, we are.

409
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,600
They will do whatever
they are told to do.

410
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,080
How good it is to be happy every day!

411
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,200
I don't have to worry about
who will deceive me

412
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,800
or use me.

413
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,960
Mengmeng,

414
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,600
- actually we all...
- Oh,

415
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,560
you all despised me for
not knowing Kung Fu.

416
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,240
Now I have the power
of the blood night-blooming cereus,

417
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,240
and have mastered the Blood Moon Power,

418
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,840
so I won't hold you back

419
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,240
like I did back then.

420
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,800
Blood Moon Power again...

421
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
Wow!

422
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,000
Awesome!

423
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,440
It's nothing.

424
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,640
Come on and teach us this!

425
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,840
- Teach us!
- Okay.

426
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,840
Don't go, my bridegroom.

427
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,080
What did you call me?

428
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,920
I said you'd be my husband.

429
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,960
- Husband?
- Husband?

430
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,120
After looking for so many days,

431
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,600
I still got nothing.

432
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,240
Not only do I have no
news of the princess,

433
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,160
but Song Che can't be found.

434
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,560
What should I do?

435
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,200
Who are you?

436
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,040
The chosen one sent me to call for you.

437
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,840
The chosen one?

438
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,920
What chosen one?

439
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,480
Just come with us.

440
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,320
Let's go.

441
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,320
Do you know who I am?

442
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,680
When I led Bai Hua Village

443
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,440
to be an overlord,

444
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
you were just a little kid.

445
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,720
You want to kidnap me

446
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,960
with your thin arms?

447
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,920
You are daydreaming.

448
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,800
Sis,

449
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,840
don't waste time with them.

450
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,760
Let's just fight our way out.

451
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,560
Like I said,

452
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,840
the chosen one invited you.

453
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,800
What?

454
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,040
The choked one?

455
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,240
Is she alright?

456
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,720
I'm so worried!

457
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,080
Stop talking nonsense!

458
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,720
Sis, it's Xiao Ai.

459
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,320
Jin Hua and Yin Hua?

460
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,160
Why are you two here?

461
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,400
That sick chosen one

462
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,680
made us here.

463
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,960
She took you too?

464
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,480
Indeed.

465
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,000
I invited you to my wedding.

466
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,360
Your Highness.

467
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,720
This is my fiancé.

468
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,830

469
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,480

470
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,460
(Armory of Jing Yue Sect)

471
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,280
What are you doing?

472
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,240
This is the storehouse of
medicine and weapons.

473
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
No outsiders allowed.

474
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,600
We are not outsiders,

475
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,840
but the chosen one's guests.

476
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,000
We saw that there are
symbols of Happiness posted elsewhere.

477
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,120
Only this place

478
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,400
has not been decorated.

479
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,680
Take them off.

480
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,640
Take off.

481
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,840
No way.

482
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,680
I'm not just posting here.

483
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,560
I'll stick them

484
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,800
everywhere.

485
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,120
Stop!

486
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,960
No.

487
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,560
I'll stick them everywhere.

488
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,920
What are you arguing about?

489
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,920
I'll stick them all.

490
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,360
Master.

491
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,240
Look,

492
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,520
they put up the symbols of
Happiness all over the place.

493
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,080
Just let them do it.

494
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,840
Why did you argue with guests?

495
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,960
That's rude.

496
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,150
(Xixi House)

497
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,440
The chosen one ordered me
to buy wedding supplies.

498
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,880
Get out of the way.
I want to see your master.

499
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,560
The master is resting.

500
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,520
You can't go in there.

501
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,360
Xiao Ai.

502
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,240
You are so lucky, Your Highness.

503
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,840
I didn't expect you are still alive.

504
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,880
Xiao Ai,

505
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,440
don't be so rude.

506
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,920
Am I being rude?

507
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm just congratulating His Highness.

508
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,640
- You...
- Chang Kong.

509
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,560
What are you doing here?

510
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,650
(Wedding Invitation)

511
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,400
Mengmeng and Song Che
are getting married?

512
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,000
After three days, in Jing Yue Sect.

513
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,120
Well,

514
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,400
my mission has been completed.

515
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,440
So, bye,

516
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,400
Your Highness.

517
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,520
Your Highness.

518
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,840
Xiao Ai.

519
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,840
Xiao Ai.

520
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,440
- Xiao Ai.
- What do you want?

521
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,240
What on earth happened?

522
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,160
I've told you

523
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,440
I'm here to send the invitation.

524
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,360
I'm not talking about that.

525
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,120
I mean why the 9th princess
is going to marry Song Che?

526
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,520
Her Highness can marry
any person she likes.

527
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,520
Why?

528
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,440
Does she have no other choices

529
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,680
but to marry your 5th prince?

530
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,840
Xiao Ai,

531
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,360
could you stop talking to me like this?

532
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,400
I went to you last time,

533
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,320
but you refused to help
me save the princess.

534
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,240
Since then, we have been
people of two worlds.

535
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,560
Do you really want to
stand with Jing Yue Sect

536
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,440
with Jiang Mengmeng?

537
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,880
What's wrong about Jing Yue Sect?

538
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,680
I only know

539
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,800
Her Highness is happy there,

540
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,440
and no one would hurt or bully her.

541
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,920
What about us?

542
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,120
There is no us.

543
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,600
Have this back.

544
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,160
Xiao Ai,

545
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,360
do you really want to break up with me?

546
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,880
From now on,

547
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,240
you are a stranger to me.

548
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,560
Xiao Ai.

549
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,910
(Come to rescue us during the ceremony)

550
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Is that true?

551
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,160
Yes.

552
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
I think she hates

553
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,680
Murong Chen and Chang Kong very much.

554
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,840
Good.

555
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,360
Leave me.

556
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,120
If you are not happy

557
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,440
and don't want to get married,

558
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,040
you still got time to call it off.

559
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,320
Why would I do that?

560
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,680
I'm happy.

561
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,600
I'm more than happy.

562
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,480
Why are you still waiting, Mengmeng?

563
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,840
Are you expecting Murong Chen?

564
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,560
I'm not.

565
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,120
Don't rush to deny it.

566
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,760
If he really shows up

567
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,320
and you are willing to go with him,

568
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,600
I won't stop you.

569
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,560
However,

570
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,000
you have to figure out

571
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,640
whether he comes for you

572
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,000
or just for your blood.

573
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,360
What do you mean?

574
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,960
What do I mean?

575
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,200
I think he is very clear

576
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
that the blood night-blooming cereus
watered with your blood

577
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,840
and your blood after you ate the
blood night-blooming cereus

578
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,400
actually have the same effect.

579
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,990
(Happiness)

580
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,920
That's it?

581
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,960
Poor quality.

582
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,960
It must be Xiao Ai
who deducted the money

583
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,080
and got defective products.

584
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,120
You can't prove it.

585
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,400
Don't frame her up.

586
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
I didn't.

587
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,560
Maybe that's what this
firecracker is like.

588
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,760
Come on.

589
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,760
Why didn't it explode?
