It is difficult to make a choice.

What about Murong Chen?

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
Murong Chen.

38
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,600
He's a neat freak, sharp-tongued

39
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,760
and he has no sense of directions.

40
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,240
He is not good at learning

41
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,360
or fighting.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,280
and he is not good at
governing or trading.

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,040
He is just a burden

44
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,880
when we travel in the world.

45
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Except his identity of 5th prince

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,680
and handsome face,

47
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,040
I don't know what else he has.

48
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,480
He is just a useless, lousy

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,680
and worthless wretch.

50
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,160
Since he's so lousy,

51
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,480
then why did you worry about him,

52
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,440
and look for him
risking your own safety?

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,080
I worried about him?

54
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,080
I just had pity on him,

55
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,840
just like I have pity on the wandering
cats and dogs on the street.

56
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,200
And the cats and dogs
know how to flatter,

57
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,800
and strive for a living.

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,360
He...

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,480
does not have any survival skills,

60
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,320
and self-care abilities.

61
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,240
You tell me.

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,000
Isn't he so pitiful?

63
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,560
But Yun Ya, you are different.

64
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,720
You are so strong and powerful,

65
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,160
have a high-flying career,

66
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,240

Murong Chen.

72
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,560
He's nothing like you.

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,880
I'm afraid I'd be a fool to give you up

74

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,760
What happened?

192
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,080
- Mengmeng.
- Murong Chen?

193
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,880
Mengmeng.

194
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,240
Let's go!

195
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,760
Mengmeng, Mengmeng.

196
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,800
Listen to me!

197
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,760
After you go to the palace with me,

198
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,320
I'll tell you the whole truth.

199
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,480
Your Highness, what's the matter?

200
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,720
I can't explain it for a while.

201
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,200
Just let me go.

202
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,280
Brother, why are you here?

203
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,560
- Brother?
- Brother?

204
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,040
My litter brother.

205
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
My sister-in-law.

206
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,040
I finally meet you.

207
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,520
Crown prince!

208
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,800
Crown prince?

209
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,520
Chang Kong, long time no see.

210
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,560
You are Murong Yi, the Crown prince
of Cang Yun Kingdom?

211
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,880
Crown prince!

212
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,440
Get up.

213
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,040
Chen,

214
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,160
you can check it out.

215
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,240
Since Governor Ye knew where you are,

216
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,280
he then reported to the imperial court.

217
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,040
When I heard about this,

218
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,120
I asked father immediately

219
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,760
to pick you up myself.

220
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Brother,

221
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,520
you're in poor health.

222
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,920
You'll be exhausted.

223
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,680
I'll go back in two days.

224
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,120
Listen what you said.

225
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,120
You do not tell me that

226
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,960
you come back with
sister-in-law in advance.

227
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,360
It is difficult to walk

228
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,960
on such a rough road.

229
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,040
See,

230
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,600
you don't bring enough
servants with you.

231
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,000
Servant...

232
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,800
Moreover,

233
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,960
sister-in-law is a princess.

234
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,240
She is royal and precious.

235
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,800
How could you let her walk by herself?

236
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,640
I can walk.

237
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,280
Of course I walk on my own.

238
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,960
Mengmeng.

239
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,600
Sorry,

240
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,360
I didn't mean it.

241
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,960
I was talking about me.

242
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
Never mind.

243
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,400
I don't have any chance to walk
again for the rest of my life anyway.

244
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,040
I can see Chen marry you,

245
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,400
a great sister-in-law.

246
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,560
If I need to die now,

247
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,720
I won't have any regrets.

248
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,680
- We...
- Brother.

249
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,240
Mengmeng is angry with me today.

250
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,520
Let me talk to her for a second.

251
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,520
Ok.

252
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,480
Come over here.

253
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,640
Murong Chen, what are you doing?

254
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Why didn't you let me tell your brother

255
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,080
that we've broken off the engagement?

256
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,120
My brother is like this.

257
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,400
Don't you see?

258
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,320
Don't induce guilt in me.

259
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,680
I admit that he is so pitiful.

260
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,840
But I cannot sacrifice my whole life

261
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,200
for this.

262
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,160
I don't want you to
sacrifice your whole life.

263
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,280
I just want my brother

264
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,200
to be happy.

265
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,960
Mengmeng.

266
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,160
I beg you.

267
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,160
Just pretend it with me
for two more days.

268
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Just two days.

269
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,080
Thank you, Mengmeng.

270
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,040
Brother,

271
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,880
it's windy outside.

272
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,400
I'll take you back to the post house.

273
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,520
Thank you.

274
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,400
Mengmeng,

275
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,520
do we go with them?

276
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,600
Go with them first.

277
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,280
(Post House)

278
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,560
Are you trying to get in my way?

279
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
I'm starving.

280
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,000
Can't you be polite?

281
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,200
The owner has not eaten yet.

282
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,520
Don't be so serious.

283
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,680
Take it easy.

284
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,320
Mengmeng,

285
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,560
- Have meat.
- I don't...

286
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,560
I just have it.

287
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,600
Mengmeng.

288
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,160
- You.
- I am sorry.

289
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,720
Brother, eat something.

290
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,960
Ok.

291
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
The fish tail.

292
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,560
It's chewy.

293
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,520
I like it.

294
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Here you are.

295
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,480
Here's the fish head

296
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,840
for your brain.

297
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,480
Thank you.

298
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,200
You're welcome.

299
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,040
Brother.

300
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
Just eat something.

301
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,400
I'm coming.

302
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,760
Chang Kong.

303
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,560
9th princess.

304
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,720
Xiao Ai is gone.

305
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,040
What's the matter?

306
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,080
The imperial bodyguard said
she was headed for the woods,

307
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,240
and didn't come back.

308
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,560
Then why are we standing here?

309
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,240
Go look for her.

310
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,040
Your Highness go first.

311
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,000
I'll tell the others to follow.

312
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,720
- Ok, hurry up!
- Ok.

313
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
Fireflies.

314
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,600
So beautiful.

315
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Wait.

316
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:34,368
(Sorry)

317
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,160
Mengmeng,

318
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,240
sorry.

319
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,960
You sent Chang Kong to lure me here.

320
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,200
If not,

321
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,320
you won't see me.

322
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,680
Why bother doing it?

323
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
We'll go apart two days later, anyway.

324
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,000
You still won't forgive me?

325
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,360
I've already said everything
I need to say.

326
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,320
Well, in that case,

327
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,840
you listen to me.

328
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,280
Nine years ago,

329
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
we were hunted down by Yu Qingzhu.

330
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,240
That was the second time.

331
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,160
The first time

332
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,360
was before I met you.

333
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,080
I strayed into the miasmatic forest
set by Yu Qingzhu.

334
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,040
In order to save me,

335
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,680
my brother was bitten by
a two-headed snake.

336
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,720
He was systemic poisoning,

337
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,960
with paraplegia,

338
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,360
and he had only ten years to live.

339
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,240
So next year he's going to...?

340
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,480
What you said

341
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,640
is true?

342
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,440
So you look for the
blood night-blooming cereus

343
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,200
to save your brother.

344
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,040
But the cold poison in your body...

345
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,640
Are you worrying about me?

346
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,120
I just mentioned it casually.

347
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,440
As long as I don't use internal force,

348
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,760
I'll be fine.

349
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,400
But you had relapsed
several times before...

350
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,280
It relapses occasionally,

351
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,560
but it won't kill me.

352
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Mengmeng,

353
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,760
I know you're mad that I lied to you.

354
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,000
If I were you,

355
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,040
I won't forgive myself as well.

356
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,800
But if I have another chance,

357
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,040
I still do it.

358
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,640
It's out of my control.

359
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,480
Because of me,

360
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,800
my brother lost his
health and happiness.

361
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And my father painstakingly maintains

362
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,800
the balance between the world
and the imperial court,

363
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,720
but has been provoked by
Yu Qingzhu and Jing Yue Sect.

364
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,520
I have to take responsibility for it.

365
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,720
So you're playing the role of
a ridiculous prince,

366
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,600
and traveling around
the world as Yun Ya,

367
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,360
to uphold justice in the world.

368
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,040
You are the least person

369
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,800
I want to lie to in the world.

370
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,680
Because you are

371
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,480
the only selfish desire in my life

372
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,600
that is full of responsibility.

373
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,120
When you told me from your heart that

374
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,400
you wanted to cure me.

375
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,520
From that day,

376
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,960
for the first time,
I wanted to live for myself.

377
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,000
Except for the things
I am responsible for,

381
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,560
I can spoil you all I want,

382
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,960
love you,

Zhe Xiang.

411
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,760
Why are you here?

412
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,560
I brought you some food.

413
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,080
You are just in time.

414
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,680
I'm on my nerves.

415
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,440
You said Murong Chen is Yun Ya?

416
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,240
You're the only one who
knows this secret now.

417
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,880
He lied to you like that.

418
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,960
And you're still protecting him.

419
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,960
Actually, I'm angry, too.

420
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,720
And I said I'd never forgive him.

421
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
But...

422
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,200
But you still like him.

423
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,560
So...

424
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,520
Are you just going to forgive him?

425
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,080
No.

426
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,560
But...

427
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,120
He just gave me that
important cereus to me.

428
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,200
He gave you the
blood night-blooming cereus?

429
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,360
Yes.

430
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,200
The cereus is so important,

431
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,120
and he just gave it to me.

432
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,760
He didn't need to do it.

433
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,760
So I think that

434
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,400
he might be sincere.

435
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,120
If he can promise that
he'll never lie to me again.

436
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,520
How could this be?

437
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,200
What? What are you saying?

438
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,280
Nothing.

439
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,320
So what you were saying is that

440
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,200
if he promises not to lie to you again,

441
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,440
then you are willing to accept him.

442
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
Actually I don't know
what I am thinking.

443
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,360
Last time, you let

444
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,920
three of us to play a game.

445
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,000
As a result,

446
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,360
they are the same person.

447
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,600
So sometimes when I look at him,

448
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,840
I would think that

449
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,760
he is Murong Chen

450
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,560
that I know.

451
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,040
But sometimes,

452
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,160
I think I don't know about him.

453
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,600
Since you think that

454
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,480
you don't fully know about this person,

455
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,360
then there's no rush to make a decision.

456
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,000
You can make the decision

457
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,200
when you really know about him.

458
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,840
But I'm running out of time.

459
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,200
He's taking me to Murong Yi tomorrow.

460
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,120
I'll have to make a decision then.

461
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,320
Actually,

462
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,560
it's not that hard to
get to know someone.

463
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,840
Sometimes,

464
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,400
a moment can do.

465
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,440
A moment?

466
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,400
Why do you still use

467
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
such an old-school move?

468
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,280
I didn't mean to
attack you.

469
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,320
Then why are you sneaking around

470
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,640
and hiding behind the door?

471
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,000
So you're here to give me shoes?

472
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,560
Yes.

473
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,800
I saw that your shoes are worn out

474
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,000
when we had meal.

475
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,480
So I brought you a new pair.

476
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,520
Don't you know that one cannot
give others shoes as a gift?

477
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,080
Why?

478
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,480
Giving others shoes

479
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,240
means to send them away.

480
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,760
I didn't mean that.

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,200

00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,400
The blood night-blooming cereus

566
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,520
and medical supplement?

567
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,080
Why don't I know that?

568
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,760
Really?

569
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,920
The blood night-blooming cereus
is in Jiang Mengmeng's hand.

570
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,920
What about the medical supplement?

571
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,280
The medical supplement is
Jiang Mengmeng.

572
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,760
What a coincidence!

573
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,680
Does sister-in-law know about it?

574
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,800
I haven't told her yet.

575
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,640
But I made an appointment
with the three of us today,

576
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,960
I'm going to tell her

577
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,760
about it clearly.

578
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,600
Although enabling the
blood night-blooming cereus

579
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,840
just needs a little blood of her,

580
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,640
I am going to tell her personally

581
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,440
and let her make her decision.

582
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,920
Right.

583
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
That's how it should be done.

584
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,720
Sister-in-law...

585
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,880
Brother,

586
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,840
don't worry.

587
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,520
Mengmeng is warm-hearted.

588
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,240
She will do such favor

589
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,640
for us.

590
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
She was angry

591
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,400
because I hid too much from her.

592
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,880
Chen,

593
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,720
I'm sorry.

594
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,160
If it wasn't for me,

595
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,040
you wouldn't be in this mess
with sister-in-law.

596
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,240
Let's not talk about that,

597
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,480
I'll bring her here.

598
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,600
Murong Chen never told me

599
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,760
about the blood night-blooming
cereus and medical supplement.

600
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,240

and he accompanied me all along.

605
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,240
All of these are just
because he knew that

606
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,280
I am the medical supplement of
the blood night-blooming cereus,

he gave me the
blood night-blooming cereus.

Now I think it over,

619
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,640
I was so silly.

620
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,440
He did everything he could
to keep me around,

621
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,080
so as to keep that
blood night-blooming cereus,

622
