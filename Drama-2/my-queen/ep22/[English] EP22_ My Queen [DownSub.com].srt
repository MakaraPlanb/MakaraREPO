23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,200
Mengmeng.

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,000
Murong Chen, you finally come.

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,400
Mengmeng,

26
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,400
I come to take you back.

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,040
Great!

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,360
You all conspired to deceive me, right?

29
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,920
It's you who deceived me into
coming to Jing Yue Sect first.

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,480
Why can't I lie to you for once?

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,560
Zhe Xiang.

32
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,960
Sorry, Master.

33
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,920
When did you come to Jing Yue Sect?

34
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,360
Do you remember anything

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,640
before coming to Jing Yue Sect?

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,280
What are you trying to say?

37
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm going to tell you that

38
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,280
your real name is Qu Yao.

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,480
What are you talking about?

40
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
I mean

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,240
your real name is Qu Yao.

42
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,400
And Qu Yeming is your real father.

43
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,960
So you knew I am
from Jing Yue Sect long ago,

44
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,000
and did not expose me,

45
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,600
just because I'm the
daughter of Qu Yeming, right?

46
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,000
Not exactly.

47
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,520
I saw more of your kindness

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,080
and justice in you.

49
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,400
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have bothered to protect her

50
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,520
and take care of her.

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,080
You've just spent too much time
with Yu Qingzhu,

52
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,000
and forgot who you really are.

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,640
That's your bet.

54
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,920
What if you bet wrong?

55
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,440
I never bet on the evil of people,

56
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,000
but on the kindness.

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,120
How did you know I'd save you?

58
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,960
If you weren't here today,

59
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,040
I have other strategies.

60
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,480
If I die tomorrow,

61
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,480
Chang Kong will be the
next Tian Ji Pavilion owner.

62
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,000
He'll help me finish

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,840
what I have not done.

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,160
Do you think

65
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,160
all of these are worthwhile?

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,160
The individual will eventually fade,

67
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,600
but consciousness can be passed down
from generation to generation.

68
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,920
Just like

69
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,080
Uncle Qi entrusted
Tian Ji Pavilion to me.

70
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,640
I believe that

71
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,040
there will always be someone

72
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,920
who can finish what I have not done.

73
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,080
(Xue Fu Fragrance)

74
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,240
We can talk tomorrow.

75
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,280
What are you doing?

76
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,880
You!

77
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,720
Murong Chen,

78
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,640
how is he?

79
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,760
Is he alive?

80
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,200
(He's fine.)

81
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,520
Great.

82
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,200
Why did you bring all those men in?

83
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,800
Of course for developing
an imperial harem,

84
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,400
to enjoy the life

85
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,200
surrounded by handsome men.

86
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,680
(He told me to inform you of
the rescue plan.)

87
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,880
Didn't you say that

88
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,840
love is a matter between two people,

89
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,600
(What am I going to do?)
and cannot bear the third person?

90
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,520
I was too stupid,

91
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,400
and too naive before.

92
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,720
(To marry Song Che.)

93
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,480
You cooperated well.

94
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,920
Murong Chen,

95
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,560
I guess I've underestimated you.

96
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,520
Mengmeng,

97
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,960
thank you for trusting me this time.

98
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,800
This time,

99
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,080
I will never let go of your hand.

100
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,440
But unfortunately,

101
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,400
you cannot take her away today.

102
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,480
Brother!

103
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
Chen,

104
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,640
you shall take sister-in-law away first.

105
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,960
Just leave me alone.

106
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,040
Yu Qingzhu,

107
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,760
let them go.

108
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,040
You shall take sister-in-law away first.

109
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,080
Yu Qingzhu,

110
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,480
how dare you

111
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,000
take the crown prince hostage!

112
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,120
Don't say that in such a harsh way.

113
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,360
I do not take the crown prince hostage.

114
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,760
I just invited him to the wedding.

115
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,600
Yu Qingzhu,

116
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,640
what do you want?

117
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,600
What do I want?

118
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,280
I want to ask you.

119
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,160
Murong Chen, 5th prince

120
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,040
and Yun Ya,
Tian Ji Pavilion owner,

121
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,360
what do you want?

122
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,160
How did you fool my disciple to

123
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,960
steal the antidote for you

124
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,640
during the days
when I practiced Kung Fu?

125
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,280
So you knew all along.

126
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,400
Of course.

127
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,920
I raised you for so many years,

128
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,200
can't I tell from your

129
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,200
little mind and

130
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,800
little tricks?

131
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,280
So you knew all about it long ago,

132
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,080
and said nothing,

133
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,840
just for

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,080
luring us

135
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,840
into your trap today.

136
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,120
Yu Qingzhu,

137
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,400
let the others go,

138
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,120
and I'll stay.

139
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,520
5th prince,

140
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,000
you may have misunderstood.

141
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,760
Jing Yue Sect is just a small place.

142
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,000
There is no room for you.

143
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,440
You're certainly welcome here,

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,680
but I would never stand in your way
if you want to leave.

145
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,960
Are you really going to let us go?

146
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,280
Of course,

147
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,280
did you forget

148
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,560
what I said before?

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,680
If he comes to ruin the wedding,

150
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll let you go.

151
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,800
Great! Your Highness.

152
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,880
However,

153
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,200
Jiang Mengmeng and Murong Yi,

154
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,280
you can only take one with you.

155
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,200
Crazy woman,

156
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,680
why should we listen to you?

157
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,280
Don't be afraid.

158
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,400
I'll get you out of here.

159
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,800
Song Che.

160
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,600
5th prince,

161
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,080
you cannot get all you want.

162
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,760
You can only take one of them
away today.

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,280
If you want to take Murong Yi away,

164
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,560
alright,

165
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,760
just leave me Tian Ji Token

166
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,040
of you.

167
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,160
But I have to remind you that

168
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,160
without the virgin blood of
Jiang Mengmeng,

169
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,480
I'm afraid that Murong Yi
won't live for long.

170
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,280
But if you choose Jiang Mengmeng,

171
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,040
I don't have any condition,

172
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,920
and you can just take her away.

173
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,200
What do you think?

174
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,640
Your Highness.

175
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,800
Your Highness.

176
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,160
Once you lost Tian Ji Token,

177
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,200
you will not only lose Tian Ji Pavilion,

178
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,520
but also the peace of the world,

179
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
and the imperial court.

180
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,280
- I beg Your Highness to think it over.
- Murong Chen.

181
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,360
This is...

182
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,880
This is our last chance,

183
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,840
do you know?

184
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,960
Murong Chen,

185
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,840
there's not much time for making choice.

186
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Chen,

187
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,040
that includes ten years of
your painstaking effort,

188
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,480
so you cannot give her.

189
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
I am sorry.

190
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,600
I am sorry.

191
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,320
I didn't expect that

192
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,040
you could do this for Murong Yi.

193
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,360
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

194
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,360
Chen Yan.

195
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,400
Continue the wedding ceremony.

196
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,160
Take this traitor to the dungeon.

197
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,960
Zhe Xiang.

198
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
You stop.

199
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,160
If you want to keep her alive,

200
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,360
just continue the wedding ceremony.

201
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
So beautiful.

202
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,760
Mengmeng,

203
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,960
don't blame me.

204
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,600
I just wanted to test for you

205
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,520
how much Murong Chen loves you.

206
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,000
Now you should know.

207
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Yes,

208
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,000
as clear as crystal.

209
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Me,

210
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,040
Tian Ji Pavilion,

211
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,640
and ten years of painstaking effort,

212
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,160
cannot compare to

213
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,240
Murong Yi in his heart.

214
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,600
Maybe Murong Yi is his true love.

215
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,520
Alright.

216
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,560
See,

217
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,600
you are the most beautiful bride today.

218
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,480
Don't ruin your good mood

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,840
and this beautiful scenery
just because of

220
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,040
some unimportant people and things.

221
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,360
Put your clothes on.

222
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,720
It might make you feel better.

223
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
You don't get me wrong.

224
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,800
I didn't mean that. I...

225
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,280
I know.

226
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,280
In fact, this marriage

227
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,920
is not what you want.

228
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,880
You love Zhe Xiang.

229
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,160
Mengmeng.

230
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,080
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,680
Don't be.

232
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,640
The reason why you liked me

233
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,480
is just because I am the heroine.

234
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,720
You liked me,

235
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,240
all because of the setup.

236
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,600
The setup?

237
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,200
What is it?

238
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,000
You can interpret it as

239
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,160
a destiny.

240
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,120
Destiny.

241
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Song Che,

242
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,160
you have no idea how much I envy you.

243
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,200
You envy me?

244
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,320
Why?

245
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,920
Through the whole journey,

246
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,400
I've tried so hard

247
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,640
to get rid of the set plot line,

248
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,560
and choose the true love I really want.

249
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,760
In the end,

250
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,240
all of these are

251
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,240
just my fancy.

252
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,480
Even the rebellion and resistance

253
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
have been set in advance.

254
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,560
But you're different,

255
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,360
you are meant to be in this world.

256
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,800
Destiny is not watching you
all the time.

257
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,200
You don't demand it,

258
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
and just go with the flow.

259
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,600
Gradually you have your own thoughts

260
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,080
and have found someone you love.

261
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,120
You're really lucky.

262
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,240
I don't quite understand
what you said,

263
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,600
but I guess that was a compliment.

264
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,330
(Dungeon of Jing Yue Sect)

265
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,440
Don't you always
look down upon others?

266
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,120
Why?

267
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,400
Why are you not talking now?

268
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
What are you laughing at?

269
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,760
I'm laughing at you for being pathetic.

270
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
What you do today is

271
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,640
what you will suffer some day.

272
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,240
So you're still talking like that.

273
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,000
Don't you get it by now?

274
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,640
That's how Jing Yue Sect works.

275
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,200
Today she can value you,

276
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,360
tomorrow she can abandon you.

277
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
The Sect master is ruthless to men,

278
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,360
and she is also

279
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,160
ruthless to women.

280
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,240
You still talk nonsense

281
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,080
when facing the death.

282
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,840
(Hui County Post House)

283
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,720
I am sorry.

284
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,360
I am the one who dragged you down.

285
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,560
Brother,

286
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,200
it's not your fault.

287
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,600
It's my choice.

288
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,440
That woman was right.

289
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,680
Chen,

290
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,600
I am a dying man.

291
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,840
You exchanged me with
sister-in-law and Tian Ji Pavilion.

292
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,160
It's not worthwhile at all.

293
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,800
Uncle Qi and his all men

294
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,600
saved me and Mengmeng
regardless of the danger.

295
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,360
He made me understand that

296
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,080
lives are all equal.

297
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,640
If we sacrifice one person

298
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,640
to save more lives,

299
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,640
that is not the true kindness.

300
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,240
But you've lost everything

301
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,040
for me.

302
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,840
I haven't lost yet.

303
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,440
I have one last card,

304
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,720
which Yu Qingzhu hasn't noticed yet.

305
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,920
Now we have to find Tian Ji Token.

306
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
These years,

307
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,200
I am 5th prince of
Cang Yun Kingdom and

308
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,720
Tian Ji Pavilion owner.

309
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,520
But I have not used
the identity of the 5th prince

310
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,040
or my imperial connections

311
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,640
in dealing with affairs in the world.

312
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,160
I understand.

313
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,800
The imperial court and the world
have been acting in separate ways,

314
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,200
and do not interfere with each other.

315
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,440
This is the principle that
our father has always maintained.

316
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,520
Jing Yue Sect has been provoking
in the world for many years,

317
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,840
but maintains the boundary
to the imperial court.

318
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,560
Father cannot do anything,

319
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
so he just turns a blind eye to them.

320
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,640
But what if Jing Yue Sect provoke
the imperial court on purpose?

321
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,640
Chen,

322
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
you cannot do this.

323
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,080
It's too dangerous.

324
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,640
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

325
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,800
Brother,

326
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,480
I have my own plans.

327
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,960
But,

328
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,120
I need you to do me a favor.

329
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,200
What is it?

330
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,760
You need to write a letter
as a crown prince of Cang Yun Kingdom,

331
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,640
asking Ruo Shui Kingdom for help.

332
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,800
Alright, alright, alright.

333
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,840
Stop it.

334
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,200
Look at you, you're absent-minded.

335
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,240
You tell me

336
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,480
how to practice?

337
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,680
Then I'll give it up.

338
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,720
Just let me go.

339
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,120
Don't even think about it.

340
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,640
Don't look at it.

341
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,000
That stuff is used too much,

342
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,000
and I'm immune to it.

343
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,800
Fine.

344
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,400
If you really don't want to practice,

345
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,000
then I'll tell you a story.

346
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,520
More than twenty years ago,

347
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,400
I have a friend

348
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,400
who fell in love with a man.

349
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,560
One of them lived in
the imperial court,

350
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,800
the other one came from the world.

351
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,760
Despite their mismatched status,

352
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,600
they fell in love anyway.

353
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,680
My friend believed that

354
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,160
true love can overcome all the barriers.

355
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,280
She believed even more that the man

356
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,680
can give her a lifetime
of true love and happiness.

357
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,960
Until one day,

358
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,120
that man

359
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,640
abandoned her because of

360
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
power and high position,

361
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,080
and married a woman with

362
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,640
a powerful family.

363
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,000
Then?

364
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,920
Then,

365
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,320
my friend was sorrowful,

366
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,520
and broke up with him totally.

367
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,040
But when she left this man,

368
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,200
she found out that

369
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,440
she was pregnant with his child.

370
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,960
Her family regarded it as
an insult to them,

371
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,960
and expelled her.

372
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,360
She was friendless

373
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,160
and helpless,

374
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,080
wandering alone in the world.

375
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,360
My friend gave birth to her baby

376
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,640
on the day that man got married.

377
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,600
But because that child

378
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,440
was in poor health condition,

379
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,640
the child died soon.

380
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,880
More ironically,

381
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,760
right on the day when that man

382
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,760
had got a high position,

383
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,080
my friend was burying her child.

384
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,000
She just stood there

385
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,360
from a distance,

386
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,200
seeing her beloved man

387
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,400
with his wife and child

388
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,880
being cheerful

389
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,800
and admired by all people.

390
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,480
Are you the friend that

391
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,680
you are talking about?

392
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
That man

393
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,600
is the king of Cang Yun Kingdom,

394
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,920
Murong Shuo, right?

395
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,440
Then Murong Yi and Murong Chen

396
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,120
are his children, right?

397
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,240
Yes.

398
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,040
He killed my child.

399
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,640
Now I need to kill his children.

400
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,520
He wishes for peace in the world,

401
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,840
while I'm going to
make a bloody mess of it.

402
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,600
I will keep him in the imperial court,

403
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,160
without the peace in his life.

404
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,160
So you established the
Jing Yue Sect, right?

405
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
Yes.

406
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,840
I have never

407
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,000
told anyone about this before.

408
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,840
Right.

409
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,000
Just like you said,

410
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,200
everyone thinks that

411
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,360
I'm a crazy devil.

412
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,000
But no one would blame this hypocrite

413
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,040
with high position

414
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,320
for being sanctimonious.

415
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,520
Then why did you tell me?

416
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,840
Today,

417
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,880
I showed you my wound,

418
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,960
in order to let you know that

419
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,080
one man

420
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,640
would pretend to love you

421
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,280
and do anything for you

422
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,640
when he has no other choices.

423
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,800
But once

424
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,480
he has better options,

425
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,480
he'll abandon you,

426
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,280
and hurt you ruthlessly
without any hesitation.

427
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,720
Murong Shuo is this kind of person.

428
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,200
So is his son.

429
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,120
This is man.

430
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,560
The true love that those stupid women

431
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,720
have been chasing for a lifetime

432
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,960
is so fragile.

433
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,880
I'll practice the Blood Moon Power.

434
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,920
Are you okay on your own?

435
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,400
Brother, don't worry.

436
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,720
There are some things that

437
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,400
I have to do on my own.

438
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,440
Ok.

439
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,600
Brother,

440
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,200
we'll meet soon.

441
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,640
Take care of the crown prince.

442
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,720
Yes.

443
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,120
Chen, you have to be careful.

444
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,120
Those moves that I've been practicing

445
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,080
are good?

446
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,920
You're really getting better
with your sword.

447
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,320
You're good with your sword, too.

448
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
Alright.

449
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,040
Keep your promise.

450
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,360
We help you this time,

451
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,880
and you'll help us meet the saint lady.

452
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,160
Hurry up.

453
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,200
I'll keep

454
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,720
my promise.

455
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,280
Did you go to that rouge shop

456
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,360
at the south of the city?

457
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,680
I have no time.

458
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,640
I...

459
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,000
Two sisters.

460
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,680
Aren't you the toy boys
of the saint lady?

461
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,600
What are you doing here?

462
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,280
Since the saint lady is newly married,

463
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,880
and she loves to be with Song Che,

464
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,000
or practicing Kung Fu.

465
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,320
So I have been ignored,

466
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,800
and I can only be alone in my room.

467
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,040
So lonely!

468
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
So I was just looking for two of you

469
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,000
to have a chat,

470
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,160
and to divert myself from boredom.

471
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,720
You guys have a lot of nerve.

472
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,200
Alright.

473
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,240
How about playing
Werewolves of Miller's Hollow?

474
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,720
Have a look? Ok.

475
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,200
It's getting dark,
and close your eyes.

476
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,760
Don't waste your time.

477
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,480
I'm not going to say anything.

478
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,240
Zhe Xiang.

479
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,800
Song Che.

480
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,720
It's me.

481
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,600
Why are you here?

482
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,440
I am here to rescue you.

483
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,960
How did they do this to you?

484
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,160
It's ok.

485
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,080
I get used to it

486
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,280
since I was a kid.

487
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,640
Since you were a kid?

488
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,360
How have you been living
all these years?

489
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,440
I'm going to get you out of here.

490
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,720
No.

491
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,640
Why?

492
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,200
Yu Qingzhu did this to you,

493
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,000
do you still want to
stay at Jing Yue Sect?

494
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,440
No.

495
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,640
I can't get out now.

496
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,920
Think about it. If I get out of here,

497
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,200
