23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,560
Chang Kong,

24
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,080
you slept outside last night.

25
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,560
I...

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,280
A top-fighter like you

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,840
should notice if
someone kidnapped Xiao Ai,

28
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,400
even if it was midnight.

29
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,280
That is where it is strange.

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,560
I asked the people who slept beside her.

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
They said no one came close.

32
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,800
That does not make sense.

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,280
Neither from the roof,

34
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,800
nor from the door.

35
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,680
How did the criminal take her away?

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,040
We missed an important point,

37
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,600
which is

38
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,760
how he knows Xiao Ai is a girl.

39
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,120
Mengmeng,

40
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,640
you are a genius.

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,240
Yes.

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,880
Xiao Ai dressed like a man.

43
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,040
And she was among a bunch of males.

44
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,680
How did he discover that?

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,040
If a male-dressed girl is recognized,

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,520
she must have exposed something

47
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,760
unconsciously,

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,240
like when taking a shower,

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,240
or...

50
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,680
I got it.

51
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,920
These are the beads
from Xiao Ai's purse.

52
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,240
I got it.

53
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,560
Xiao Ai must have been kidnapped

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,600
in the toilet by someone ambushed here.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,840
It is evident Xiao Ai struggled here.

56
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,120
That makes sense.

57
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,640
What a dirty criminal!

58
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,240
He hid out here to take the victim.

59
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,840
Damn!

60
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,240
We must rescue Xiao Ai.

61
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,080
Why are you all looking at me?

62
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,120
Chang Kong,

63
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,600
Xiao Ai stays with me more.

64
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,800
Why are you more worried about her?

65
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,320
I...

66
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,280
I don't.

67
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,360
I just...

68
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,080
I understand...

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,280
We can tell that from your look.

70
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,160
Let's think about how to save her.

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,080
(Yi Chun Tavern)

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,800
It seems

73
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,600
I have to take all the responsibilities.

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,720
Lure the criminal.

75
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,920
Set him up.

76
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,480
Eliminate him.

77
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,480
Make peace.

78
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,880
No.

79
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,480
Last time in Bai Hua Village,

80
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,960
you nearly lost your life.

81
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,040
This time

82
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,400
I will never put you in danger.

83
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
No worries.

84
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,720
Last time I was alone.

85
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,040
Stuck there.

86
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,560
This time we will collaborate.

87
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,200
I will attract their attention.

88
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,760
You divide and close in upon.

89
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,760
It will be fine.

90
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,680
Mengmeng,

91
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,960
the thing with battles

92
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,960
is to know yourself and your enemy.

93
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,400
Look,

94
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
we don't even know who is the enemy.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,080
Besides, you can't fight.

96
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,040
You are putting yourself in danger.

97
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,480
True.

98
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,960
You are like

99
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,920
a lamb in the mouth of the tiger.

100
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,800
Only if there is one more girl among us,

101
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,360
I don't have to do it by myself.

102
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,120
It would be better if

103
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
two of us can operate

104
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,040
with and for each other.

105
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,720
Where can we find another girl?

106
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,640
Actually,

107
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,440
it doesn't have to be a girl.

108
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,080
What do you mean?

109
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,440
You and Xiao Ai can dress like men,

110
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,760
and vice versa.

111
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,000
You mean, a female-dressed boy?

112
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,560
No, no, no.

113
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,160
(This boy looks pretty.)

114
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,880
(Then it's you.)

115
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,440
Why are you all looking at me?

116
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,840
What a hustle and bustle!

117
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,800
Will this lure the criminal?

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,200
Yes, for sure.

119
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,120
Can't you see they are all watching us?

120
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,080
At this time, only you and me

121
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,360
dare to be on the street.

122
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,920
No wander they will watch us.

123
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,680
Rongrong,

124
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
let's buy some rouge.

125
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,600
Go.

126
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,160
My guests, want some rouge?

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,560
Wow, there is eyebrow powder.

128
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,200
Yes, take a look.

129
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,880
They are all new arrivals.

130
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,440
Mengmeng, look up.

131
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,040
What are you doing?

132
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,520
We are sisters.

133
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,840
I'll make you up.

134
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,080
Song Che,

135
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,440
what are you doing?

136
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,440
Murong Chen is taking advantage of her.

137
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,560
I need to warn him.

138
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,280
Now the criminal may be near.

139
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,560
You might make him notice.

140
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,800
I...

141
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,440
Let's make a full one.

142
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,920
You are so close.

143
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,800
Of course.

144
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,840
She is the best.

145
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,040
Are you from the outside?

146
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,960
Then you have to go back.

147
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,760
It's not safe here recently.

148
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,840
Not safe?

149
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,240
We got it.

150
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,040
We will go back soon.

151
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,400
One day passed and
no sign of the criminal.

152
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,280
I think he will appear tonight.

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Tonight?

154
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,960
Let's go, sis.

155
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Let's hang out.

156
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,880
In front of me,

157
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,240
he acts indecently.

158
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,640
Murong Chen,

159
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,200
- I'll kill you.
- Song Che.

160
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,560
I'll kill... kill you.

161
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,040
Well, Song Che.

162
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,800
Easy!

163
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,720
The cup will be broken.

164
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,160
They stick together in the daytime.

165
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,200
Now at night,
they are still in the same room.

166
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,280
It is a trap for the criminal.

167
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,600
We guard here.

168
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,280
Once he appears,

169
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,240
we bust him alive,

170
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,600
and force him to let Xiao Ai go.

171
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,640
You all care about Xiao Ai only.

172
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,240
No one cares about me.

173
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,840
Sis Mengmeng,

174
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,200
are you going to wear
so much and go to sleep?

175
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,800
Don't you feel hot?

176
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,080
I am not.

177
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,480
Even a little cold.

178
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,080
Did he come?

179
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,520
A cat.

180
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,920
Kind of hot.

181
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,640
Hot?

182
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,720
Yes, a little hot.

183
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,880
They put out the light.

184
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,120
I'll kill...

185
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,680
- I kill...
- Stop.

186
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
- I kill...
- Easy.

187
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,920
Stop it.

188
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,200
What are you doing?

189
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,720
If we sleep with lights on,

190
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,880
he will never come.

191
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It makes sense.

192
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,360
Why don't they come?

193
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Wait for a moment.

194
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,160
Maybe soon.

195
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,720
Song Che and Chang Kong

196
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,000
might have caught the criminal already.

197
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,520
We are here waiting for nothing.

198
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,840
Mengmeng,

199
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,400
sometimes do you feel...

200
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,560
Mengmeng?

201
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,080
Mengmeng?

202
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,920
Not good.

203
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,880
Toxic smoke.

204
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,960
Mengmeng!

205
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,040
Mengmeng, wake up.

206
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,480
Mengmeng, Mengmeng.

207
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,920
We lost him.

208
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,560
But

209
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,920
why did he run away alone?

210
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,720
Mengmeng...

211
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,880
Go.

212
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,960
Mengmeng!

213
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,360
Murong Chen, you are useless.

214
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,160
We are tricked away.

215
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,800
I am useless.

216
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,920
I didn't take care of Mengmeng.

217
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,560
Now there is no time to blame.

218
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,560
How about this?

219
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
We split up.

220
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,920
You inform the officials.

221
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,240
I ask around.

222
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,640
Come, come.

223
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,960
Itchy.

224
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,280
So itchy.

225
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,040
Look at my skin.

226
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,760
Your skin looks great.

227
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,120
Look, her skin is very good.

228
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,560
My head aches.

229
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,120
Mengmeng,

230
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,240
look around.

231
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,120
Are we in the Spiders' Cave?

232
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,920
I don't know.

233
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,240
What are they doing?

234
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,200
It is so strange.

235
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,000
The newcomers wake up.

236
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,120
Come.

237
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,840
- What are you doing?
- Don't be shy.

238
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,600
Come on, take it off.

239
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,120
Sis,

240
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,680
why are you wearing so much?

241
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,600
Xiao Mei,

242
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
come and help.

243
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,840
Xiao Mei,

244
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,040
what a familiar name.

245
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,400
I remember it.

246
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,000
The daughter of the old couple.

247
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,600
Why doesn't this one take it off?

248
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,000
She can't.

249
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,880
She is sick.

250
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,040
My sister has sensitive skin.

251
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,640
She can't touch hot water.

252
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
You are sisters?

253
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,880
Yes, she is Rongrong.

254
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,120
I'm Mengmeng.

255
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,800
We are biological sisters.

256
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,200
But you don't look like each other.

257
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,120
Really?

258
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,640
Your sister is more beautiful than you.

259
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,920
Yes.

260
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,640
Well,

261
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,480
I have sensitive skin.

262
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,560
So I can't enjoy the spring with you.

263
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,200
What a shame! It is a nice spring.

264
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,920
It seems you can't enjoy it.

265
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,040
Then I'll just have a rest over there.

266
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,360
Sisters,

267
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,880
enjoy yourselves.

268
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,400
You go alone.

269
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,920
Sisters,

270
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,760
let's sit and talk, come.

271
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,200
Sisters,

272
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,680
I'm new here.

273
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,840
I want to ask

274
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,600
if there are any rules here.

275
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,640
Nothing special.

276
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,400
Every day we just
smooth our skin in the water.

277
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,280
Make ourselves look beautiful.

278
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,960
It has this function?

279
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,520
Oh, sis.

280
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,200
Do you remember how you got here?

281
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,400
I don't remember.

282
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,800
Strange, me neither.

283
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,240
Do you miss your home?

284
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,840
Why?

285
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,760
Girls are supposed to be beautiful.

286
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,480
What about parents?

287
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,520
Well,

288
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
are you Xiao Mei?

289
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,680
How old are you, Xiao Mei?

290
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,760
(How do girls flirt with girls?)

291
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,840
Your nails are so beautiful.

292
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,880
You do feel so?

293
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,600
I made it by myself.

294
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It looks so good.

295
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,080
I want the same.

296
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,640
But I can't do it.

297
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Xiao Mei,

298
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,920
can you tell me how to do it?

299
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,120
Alright.

300
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,400
Really?

301
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,840
Great.

302
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,760
Well,

303
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,320
I want to ask you about something.

304
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,360
Do you still remember
where is your home?

305
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,560
No, I don't.

306
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,000
Sis, what about you?

307
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,800
- Me neither.
- You?

308
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,880
Do you remember?

309
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,240
Yes, I do.

310
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,880
My home is...

311
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,040
Where?

312
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,120
Where is my home?

313
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,520
Well, girls like you...

314
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,240
No, girls like us,

315
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,600
how many of us are here?

316
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,560
Eighteen, including you two.

317
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,680
It can't be right. One is missing.

318
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,480
Yesterday, there was one
who kept crying.

319
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,160
She was kept in a small room.

320
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,720
(She must be Xiao Ai.)

321
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,320
Where is my home?

322
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,520
What's wrong with you?

323
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,120
Mengmeng!

324
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,440
Mengmeng! Mengmeng!

325
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,480
Sis, what's wrong with you?

326
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,480
Mengmeng! Mengmeng!

327
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,960
- What happened?
- Don't know.

328
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,680
Mengmeng,

329
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,360
you are up.

330
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,920
You...

331
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,280
I...

332
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,880
Murong Chen, you...

333
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,320
- Don't thank me.
- I...

334
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,160
Don't thank me, for real.

335
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,600
We are caught here together.

336
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,840
It is normal I helped you.

337
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,880
I need to take care of you.

338
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,440
We help each other, right?

339
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,480
Well, you put me here?

340
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,720
Yes.

341
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
Then my clothes...

342
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,200
Yes.

343
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,280
No.

344
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,400
The girls helped with your clothes.

345
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,440
They did it for you.

346
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,640
Oh, they did it.

347
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,720
Jiang Mengmeng,

348
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,600
are you thinking I...

349
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,520
No.

350
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,200
I thought...

351
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,240
I thought they helped me.

352
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,320
Fine.

353
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,960
(Well, well, Jiang Mengmeng,)

354
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,680
(what is on your mind?)

355
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,600
(In the spring, you must have)

356
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,800
(lost your sanity.)

357
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Right, the spring.

358
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Murong Chen,

359
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,120
do you think something is wrong with it?

360
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,240
It seems the spring can surely wash out

361
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,760
one's memory.

362
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,160
Like you,

363
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,040
even if you just
touched it a little bit,

364
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,960
you lost your memory.

365
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,960
If I make it right,

366
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,560
the girls are the same as you.

367
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,640
They kept retrospecting.

368
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,760
Yet the more they did it,
the more the headache.

369
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,680
They may pass out just like you.

370
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,880
So they give up trying now.

371
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,480
They choose to forget
their past and families.

372
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,480
So that's why

373
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,600
they want to stay here.

374
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,960
And their mind keeps saying

375
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,960
girls are supposed to be beautiful.

376
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,040
Oh, what about Xiao Mei?

377
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,600
I talked with her.

378
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,520
Anything about Xiao Ai?

379
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,160
Close.

380
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,200
And then you passed out,

381
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
and the conversation broke.

382
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,080
Pity.

383
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,480
But I got another idea.

384
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,590
(Sang's house)

385
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,400
Your idea is

386
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,520
to search the rooms one by one?

387
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,800
What if we pick the wrong room?

388
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,440
Don't you cry.

389
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,640
You'll ruin the spring.

390
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,360
Madam will punish me.

391
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,800
I put some food here.

392
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,560
I will not eat it. Take it away.

393
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,120
Whatever.

394
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,280
Quick!

395
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,480
Go!

396
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,800
Let go!

397
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,120
Let's get in.

398
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,080
Yes.

399
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,960
Get in.

400
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,840
Xiao Ai.

401
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,680
I said I don't...

402
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm having illusion now.

403
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,680
The 5th prince is a girl now.

404
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,320
Xiao Ai, it's not an illusion.

405
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,760
It's us.

406
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,400
Your Highness.

407
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,400
It's OK now.

408
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,280
You keep it down.

409
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,080
Someone will notice.

410
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,040
But your tears are worthy.

411
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,320
Without them,

412
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,080
you might have forgotten me.

413
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,480
Your Highness.

414
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,240
I heard from the servant,

415
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,480
some Madam?

416
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,760
Do you know who it is?

417
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,120
I never met this person.

418
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,120
It's called Luo Bo,

419
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,720
Bo Luo, or Sang Luo.

420
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,000
I don't know.

421
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,560
Sang Luo?

422
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,560
Someone is coming.

423
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,360
Quick, hide.

424
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,280
It's me.

425
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,720
Xiao Mei?

426
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,560
I know where Sang Luo is.

427
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,360
You met my parents?

428
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,760
How are they?

429
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,760
No worries.

430
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,960
They are fine.

431
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,400
They're just worried about you.

432
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,120
Oh, Xiao Mei,

433
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,320
why is your memory
not washed out like others?

434
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,680
Actually, there is not much memory left.

435
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,520
I can't remember the look of my parents.

436
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,680
How come you...

437
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,280
Because every day back in the room,

438
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,080
I can recognize
the characters at my bedside.

439
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,160
Characters?

440
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,000
Every day before sleep,

441
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,040
I can feel the characters at my bedside.

442
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,760
It says "stay away from the spring".

443
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,840
I think I carved it long before

444
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,840
I forgot everything.

445
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,960
Right.

446
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,040
The characters.

447
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,600
You are so clever, Xiao Mei.

448
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,200
No wonder you didn't
go to the spring like others.

449
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,840
The characters kept me

450
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,200
away from the spring.

451
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,160
But as the time passes,

452
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,120
the spring affects me as well.

453
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,560
Then why didn't you run away?

454
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,720
I tried.

455
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,480
At some nights, I sneaked out.

456
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,600
But this place is well-guarded.

457
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,760
I couldn't get out.

458
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,320
But last night,

459
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,120
I found Sang Luo's room.

460
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,000
I eavesdropped beside the window

461
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,560
the conversation
between Sang Luo and two servants.

462
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,040
One servant said
two girls were conspicuous.

463
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,320
It may be a trap
set up by the officials.

464
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,320
But Sang Luo said
they only need two more girls.

465
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,800
It would be another month
if they missed the chance.

466
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,240
So Sang Luo sent one of the two servants

467
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,360
to attract the guards,

468
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,600
and the other one
to catch the two girls.

469
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,520
That makes sense.

470
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,400
Song Che is easy to

471
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,400
fall into the trap.

472
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,000
But besides Song Che,

473
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,800
Chang Kong fell into the trap as well.

474
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,240
Chang Kong

475
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,360
was affected by Song Che,

476
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,680
like I was affected by you.

477
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,640
Coo like a crow, and you like a...

478
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,200
I like what?

479
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,200
You like a... meow.

480
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,120
Lady, please behave yourself.

481
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,600
Oh, Xiao Mei,

482
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,240
Sang Luo talked about two girls

483
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,240
and one month.

484
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,800
Do you know the details?

485
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
Xiao Ai, do you know?

486
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,080
Xiao Ai did nothing but cry.

487
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,520
What is the whole thing?

488
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,280
You can stop thinking.

489
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,120
We can just poke around.

490
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,480
Someone is coming.

491
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,120
Quick, quick.

492
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,520
Mengmeng.

493
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,880
Mengmeng.

494
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,160
- What?
- Look!

495
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,800
Am I looking green?

496
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,320
To hide better, I put

497
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,760
a bunch of leaves on my head.

498
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,360
- Looks good?
- Green.

499
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,840
Xiao Mei, am I good?

500
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,000
Good, good.

501
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,520
You are the best in this house.

502
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,200
There, there.

503
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,200
Xiao Mei, later in there,

504
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,440
please cover us with Xiao Ai.

505
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,840
Take care of yourselves.

506
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,760
I am leaving.

507
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,440
Go.

508
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,040
Go.

509
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,880
Quick.

510
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Let me see.

511
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,600
Wait, wait.

512
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,600
Let me see.

513
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,600
You are so annoying.

514
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,200
Poke another hole.

515
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,600
Sleep now.

516
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,040
Stop crying.

517
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,960
Sleep early.

518
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,350
(Sang Luo)

519
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,440
All the skin care recipes

520
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,240
do not work at all.

521
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,880
Of course.

522
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,280
Dozens of ingredients on the face,

523
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,520
they will damage your skin.

524
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,240
My face looks bad.

525
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,160
Yes,

526
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,600
you clean others' memory.

527
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,560
How good can your face be?

528
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,240
Small wrinkles appear.

529
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,120
Only a facelift can help ones

530
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,520
in your age.

531
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,160
And a little inflammation.

532
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,720
An angry middle-aged woman!

533
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,080
You are sure to be inflamed.

534
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,400
It seems someone is talking to me.

535
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,240
Madam,

536
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,280
no one talks.

537
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,080
It must be an illusion.

538
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,720
Oh, where is my honey?

539
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,640
Honey?

540
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,200
Where is it?

541
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
- Take a look.
- Yes.

542
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,600
The servant.

543
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,040
What now?

544
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,760
What now?

545
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,880
Room check.

546
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,640
We are on bed now.

547
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,320
Something's wrong?

548
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,120
The two newcomers are obedient.

549
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,760
Why are you so slow?

550
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,800
Madam is impatient.

551
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,680
The night is dark.

552
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,840
I tripped.

553
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,200
Go.

554
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,080
I'm good at bondage.

555
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,480
Well, I don't want to eat.

556
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,520
Greasy and useless.

557
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,640
She has the blood night-blooming cereus.

558
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
Stupid.

559
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,720
The cereus seduced him.

560
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,400
What is on your mind?

561
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,200
My beautiful madam,

562
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,360
I just remembered

563
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,280
I have seen a skincare recipe.

564
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,680
I want to recommend it to you.

565
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,240
Shoot.

566
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,320
Use boiled aloe juice

567
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,600
mixed with honey

568
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,120
to make an Aloe Honey Mask.

569
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,320
Put it on your face.

570
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,280
It helps refresh your skin.

571
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,000
Dietetic invigoration
for facial treatment.

572
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,320
Wonderful ideas.

573
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,560
But I don't need it anymore.

574
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,920
Tomorrow night is the fifteenth.

575
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,800
The full moon will help me summon
the Blood Moon Tactics.

576
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,120
Blood of 18 young girls

577
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,080
will dip into the
blood night-blooming cereus.

578
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,200
Then I will never get older.

579
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,480
Never ever.

580
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,320
Oh god.

581
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,040
So evil.

582
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,360
What a new version of the plot!

583
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,920
(Information about the
blood night-blooming cereus)

584
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,480
On the fifth of last month,

585
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,440
someone in Qing Luo Town
sold a fake blood night-blooming cereus.

586
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,720
The buyer was

587
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,800
Sang Luo.

588
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,000
I can't imagine

589
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,080
Sang Luo is planning something horrible.

590
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,160
Xiao Ai doesn't want to die.

591
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,160
Don't cry.

592
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,680
We still have one day.

593
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,280
You seem calm

594
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,320
at this moment.

595
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,400
I should be calm.

596
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,040
I play the leading role. I fear not.

597
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,680
Why are your hands shaking?

598
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,000
My hands have their own thoughts.

599
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,120
What are you doing?

600
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,120
Listen,

601
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,040
don't be afraid.

602
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,880
In the world, your owner is

603
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,800
the smartest

604
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,360
and the bravest girl.

605
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,920
She will surely keep you safe.

606
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,640
And she is not alone.

607
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,840
There is me

608
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,800
as a mate.

609
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Childish.

610
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,080
Yes, let's pull together.

611
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,720
We still have one day.

612
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,440
Everything will be fine, right?

613
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,280
Good.

614
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,680
But

615
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,520
we have to deal with this guy now.

616
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,480
If he talks,

617
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,400
we can't make it tonight.

618
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,480
Indeed.

619
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,480
Wait.

620
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,840
Easy, easy.

621
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,400
