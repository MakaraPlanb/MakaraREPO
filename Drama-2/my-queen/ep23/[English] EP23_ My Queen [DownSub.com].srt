Master,

34
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,480
please forgive him.

35
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,600
I beg you. Let go of him.

36
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,520
Forgive him?

37
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,160
I have forgiven him once,

38
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,320
so now he can only blame himself.

39
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,320

our Jing Yue Sect,

41
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,160
and hurt my disciples.

42
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,400
Do you think I can forgive him?

43
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,200
Mengmeng,

44
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,360
you have achieved the fourth level

45
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400

Congratulations, Goddess.

47
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,280
Did you just leave?

48
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,120
How come you are back?

49
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,480
Mengmeng,

50
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,000
come back with me.

51
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,400

Leave him in Xi Xi House

57
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,960

62
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,600
I trust you,

63
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,040
forgive you,

64
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,200
and spare you a chance every time.

65
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,920
But you,

every time

67
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,640
you lied to me and abandoned me.

68
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,480
Do you think

69
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,920
if you put on a show

70
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,880
by hurting yourself this time,

71
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,880
so that I could forgive you,

72
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,760
and pity you again?

73
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,760
This time I come to you

74
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,360
not for your forgiveness,

75
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,960
but to see you. I miss you.

76
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,120

00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,520
Goddess is good-tempered.

196
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,200
Why is she in a mood

197
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,400
when seeing Murong Chen?

198
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,440
He cheated on her,

199
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,400
so she surely will torture him.

200
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
As far as I am concerned,

201
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,160
Murong Chen is nasty.

202
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,680
She humiliated him like that,

203
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,760
but he is still flattering.

204
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,800
I think,

205
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
the attitude of Goddess

206
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,040
toward the toy boys and Murong Chen

207
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,720
is quite different.

208
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,840
Is it true?

209
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,880
It's true.

210
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:38,528
(Go away!)

211
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,920
Goddess.

212
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,360
Go away!

213
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,240
What's the matter?

214
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Go away!

215
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,040
I just reminded her to
drink more hot water.

216
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,640
How did I piss her off?

217
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,560
Besides, why were four of us

218
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,840
driven out?

219
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,000
Indeed.

220
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,760
It seems Goddess's anger

221
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,800
is indiscriminate.

222
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,200
All of you get away.

223
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,560
A bunch of stupid boys.

224
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,160
Hateful guys.

225
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,680
Did I just drive you away?

226
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,840
Why are you back?

227
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,920
As they are gone,

228
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,480
I help you clean up.

229
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,440
It might hurt you.

230
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,920
You come here.

231
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,000
Stay closer.

232
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,360
I am fed up with

233
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,920
these men.

234
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,160
Maybe you are different.

235
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,480
Isn't this what you are fighting for

236
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,280
by forcing yourself to stay here,

237
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,480
and bearing all humiliations?

238
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,920
- Again?
- Well...

239
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,480
- How exciting!
- She has become truly obsessed

240
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,640
by practicing Blood Moon Power?

241
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,720
Murong Chen,

242
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,320
you are so ignorant.

243
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,760
I give you a chance to serve me.

244
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,880
It's your fortune.

245
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,680
How dare you bite me?

246
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,320
How cruel!

247
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,640
I feel that

248
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,520
Goddess

249
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,240
looks more like Master.

250
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
It's good that you three are here.

251
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,000
Put him into the dungeon.

252
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,000
It seems that your nightlife

253
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,720
has to last for a while.

254
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,560
Aren't you getting tired?

255
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,040
Not enough.

256
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,280
I want to revenge Murong Chen.

257
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,480
It is never enough to

258
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,120
humiliate him beside me.

259
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,720
I think the reason
he broke into Jing Yue Sect

260
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,640
is not out of love,

261
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,000
but to change my mind.

262
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
He doesn't want me to
practice Blood Moon Power,

263
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,760
in case I threaten the world,

264
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,560
and the royal court.

265
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,080
The more he doesn't want me to do,

266
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,360
the more I want to achieve.

267
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,800
I will make

268
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,080
all his concerns

269
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,400
and all his fear a reality.

270
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,280
That is my ultimate revenge.

271
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Sorry.

272
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,000
I will listen to you from now on,

273
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,920
and will not let you worry anymore.

274
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,240
I didn't expect that

275
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,680
you said these to me.

276
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,200
I am proud of you.

277
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,480
Great.

278
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,360
Since you are determined,

279
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,800
let's work harder.

280
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Next,

281
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,920
I will pass on you

282
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,760
the fifth level

283
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,560
of Blood Moon Power.

284
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,520
OK.

285
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,600
Infinite.

286
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,200
Infinite?

287
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,760
Endless moonlight

288
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
generates

289
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,840
boundless and weightless state,
and infiniteness.

290
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
When you reach that state,

291
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,440
it triggers

292
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,080
the light of blood moon that

293
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,120
emerges into heaven and earth.

294
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,720
At that time,

295
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,640
be it the royal court or the world,

296
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,400
everything in the universe

297
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,600
will be ruined and gain rebirth.

298
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,640
Everything

299
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,520
is under your control.

300
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,960
Really?

301
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
It's a pity that

302
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,640
I didn't achieve the fifth level.

303
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,280
But now,

304
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,360
I will teach you the spells.

305
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,960
Whether you can understand or not,

306
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,640
it depends on your intelligence.

307
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,680
Don't worry,

308
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,440
I still have one thing to say.

309
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
Say it.

310
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,040
It will be my 18th birthday,

311
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
and I want to hold a birthday party.

312
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,320
Of course.

313
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,400
At that time,

314
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,480
I want Murong Chen to witness it.

315
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,040
Murong Chen?

316
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,760
Our wedding was set

317
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,480
on my 18th birthday.

318
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,760
So...

319
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,160
- I think...
- Stop.

320
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
You can say no more.

321
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,880
I agree.

322
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Leave your birthday party to me.

323
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,440
You work hard on the Power.

324
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,640
How is it?

325
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,800
I'm fine.

326
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,120
Don't be disheartened.

327
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,200
The fifth level is hard to achieve.

328
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,520
Let's continue.

329
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,100
(Invitation)

330
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:58,780
(Yu Qingzhu invites Murong Chen to
Jiang Mengmeng's 18th birthday party.)

331
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,960
I need to go to some place first.

332
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,920
Why are you here?

333
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,480
You wanted to stay by my side,

334
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,720
and see me every day.

335
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,440
Well,

336
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,440
after a while,

337
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,960
you have changed your mind?

338
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,480
I am a prisoner now.

339
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,720
You can do everything

340
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,440
as you wish.

341
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,840
I am here to invite you

342
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,720
to my 18th birthday party.

343
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,320
It seems you remember this day.

344
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,920
Then I will say no more.

345
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,120
I know you are clear.

346
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,960
I am clear.

347
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,440
No one is clearer than me.

348
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Jiang Mengmeng,

349
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,840
come here,

350
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,000
I have some blessings for you.

351
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,080
Stay closer.

352
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,640
I only want to talk to you.

353
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,880
It doesn't matter.

354
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,000
A locked man

355
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,040
does me no harm.

356
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,240
Stay closer.

357
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,680
Murong Chen.

358
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,520
Dear families and friends,

359
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,440
thanks for coming here

360
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
to attend my 18th birthday party.

361
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,440
I am much honored.

362
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,040
I attach great importance to this party.

363
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,040
Before I was seventeen years old,

364
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,440
I was the princess of Ruo Shui Kingdom.

365
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,320
In the last year,

366
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,080
I've been to many places,

367
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,120
made a lot of friends

368
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,200
and experienced a lot as well.

369
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,320
All these

370
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,000
helped me grow up

371
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,240
from a headstrong

372
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,240
and spoiled princess

373
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,160
to a

374
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,840
self-dependent

375
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,080
and proactive

376
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,520
heroine.

377
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,040
In the process,

378
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,120
one person

379
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,200
has played a major role.

380
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,080
He has changed

381
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,040
how I understand the world.

382
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
The seat beside me is

383
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,720
left for him.

384
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,320
Some of you

385
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,880
have known him.

386
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,800
Some have not.

387
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,160
It doesn't matter.

388
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,200
Today let me reintroduce to you

389
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,320
the 5th prince of Cang Yun Kingdom,

390
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,840
Murong Chen,

391
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,680
as well the owner of Tian Ji Pavilion,
Yun Ya.

392
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,920
Tian Ji Pavilion owner?

393
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,240
- Indeed.
- Really?

394
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,120
- That's Murong Chen?
- Murong Chen.

395
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,160
The owner of Tian Ji Pavilion
looks like this?

396
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,040
He is the owner of Tian Ji Pavilion?

397
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,760
Today I am here

398
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,040
all because of him.

399
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,960
Let's make a toast to 5th Prince.

400
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,480
Today is the best day of my life.

401
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,480
I want to ask

402
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,360
5th Prince

403
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,440
to dance for us.

404
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,800
Look at him.

405
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
He is never a dancer.

406
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,880
If Goddess wants to see,

407
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,280
- I am willing to dance.
- Right.

408
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,000
- Come on.
- Normal dance...

409
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,920
may have been watched by everyone.

410
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,080
But I think you have never seen

411
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,800
dance in chains before.

412
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,960
Yes.

413
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,960
Mengmeng,

414
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,520
stop humiliating the 5th Prince.

415
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,360
I will dance.

416
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,240
Lend me your sword.

417
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,840
Today is

418
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,600
the birthday of Goddess.

419
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,720
I didn't prepare any gifts.

420
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,960
Nor I could dance.

421
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,360
Thus,

422
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,320
I can only play

423
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,960
with the sword.

424
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,040
Hope Goddess can appreciate it.

- Your Highness.
- Murong Chen.

458
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,560
Which side should we pick?

459
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
How about we pick the side
with more people?

460
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,280
Ok, that way.

461
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:47,960
Let's go.

462
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,240
Jiang Mengmeng.

463
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,560
I didn't expect that

464
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,160
you chose him at last.

465
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,400
Do you remember

466
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,320
how I treated you?

467
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,680
How he took advantage of you

468
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,000
and hurt you?

469
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,080
And you?

470
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,880
Aren't you taking advantage of me,

471
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,800
and lying to me?

472
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,410
(Jing Yue Sect)

473
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,040
This is Jing Yue Sect?

474
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,600
It should be.

475
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,160
It looks normal.

476
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,360
I'll clear

477
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,840
this place in

478
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,120
a single moment.

479
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,400
Dong Kui wants to know

480
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
why Your Highness took the initiative
to rescue 9th Princess

481
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,680
as she was stuck

482
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,120
in Jing Yue Sect?

483
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,200
It was all because of that letter.

484
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,120
- Soldiers!
- Yes.

485
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,240
Charge!

486
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,560
We need to wait for

487
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,440
the crown prince of Cang Yun Kingdom.

488
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
Right.

489
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,040
Murong Yi

490
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,320
requested in a letter the assistance

491
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,320
from Ruo Shui Kingdom.

492
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,400
How come he is late?

493
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,960
Your Highness, he is here.

494
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,800
What a handsome and charming man!

495
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,400
Master!

496
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,840
Something is wrong. Master!

497
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,480
Murong Chen with soldiers
of Cang Yun Kingdom,

498
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,760
and Jiang Sisi with soldiers
of Ruo Shui Kingdom

499
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,200
are besieging Jing Yue Sect.

500
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,120
What?

501
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,800
They are saying that we kidnapped

502
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,200
and tortured 5th Prince
and 9th Princess.

503
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,880
They united to fight with Jing Yue Sect.

504
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,920
Let's go.

505
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,840
When did we kidnap them?

506
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,080
It's you, Murong Chen.

507
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,960
You broke into Jing Yue Sect

508
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,600
to get hurt,

509
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,560
so that

510
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,120
Murong Yi and the royal court

511
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,480
will send soldiers here.

512
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,400
Right?

513
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,960
You finally understand.

514
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:05,800
Come on.

515
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,360
Bring me the poisons

516
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,160
and the weapons.

517
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:17,920
Let's go.

518
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,200
Let's go.

519
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:19,960
