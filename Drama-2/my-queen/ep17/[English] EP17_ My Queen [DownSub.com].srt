00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,190
(Beloved daughter, Ye Fei'er)

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,200
Stop pulling my clothes.

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,520
But I'm not pulling your clothes.

26
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,080
Then...

27
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,240
Then...

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
Who is?

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,240
It's your sword.

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,400
Sorry, my bad.

31
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,250
(Give regards to the dead)

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,480
Why did you stop?

33
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,840
Why are you still following me?

34
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,920
You take this side. I'll take that side.

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Then why did you make me follow you?

36
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,560
You decided that yourself.

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,720
Don't leave me behind.

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,040
Literally here.

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,360
Literally just a wee bit away.

40
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,360
Come here.

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,800
Now what?

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,480
Just...

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,600
You just

44
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,760
give me some time to mentally prepare.

45
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,400
Song Che,

46
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,160
from the minute you've entered,

47
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,640
I've been trying to put up with you.

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,320
I mean...

49
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,880
I mean you're a grown man.

50
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,200
You've been on battle fields.

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,440
You were even a young general.

52
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,480
Bodies everywhere,

53
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,360
all over the place.

54
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,440
You've seen such kinds of things.

55
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,960
Now you're scared of a single corpse?

56
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,840
Nah, no, nope.

57
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,200
This is completely different.

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,520
Dead people are dead people.

59
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,640
What's the difference?

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,400
It's just different, okay?

61
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,120
Just give me some time.

62
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,600
I need to mentally prepare myself.

63
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,680
Here.

64
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,880
Help me light it up.

65
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,360
Come on.

66
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,240
Lower.

67
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,560
You are so good at this.

68
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,800
Shut up.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,880
Say one more word.

70
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,160
And you're doing the Autopsy.

71
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,240
No need for that.

72
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,520
No need for that.

73
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,080
Multiple fractures all over the body.

74
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,720
Three broken ribs.

75
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,760
One went through her lungs.

76
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,480
Serious head injury.

77
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,560
Cerebral hemorrhage.

78
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,520
But none of these are fatal.

79
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,520
What does that mean?

80
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,480
She didn't fall to death.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,480
She didn't?

82
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,320
Nope, nope.

83
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,600
Look.

84
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,600
No.

85
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,360
Come on.

86
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,960
Eyes here.

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,800
What are these black spots?

88
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,800
She was poisoned.

89
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,560
To be more specific,

90
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,880
she was probably poisoned

91
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,200
before entering the teahouse.

92
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,560
When she was arguing
with Jiang Mengmeng,

93
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,040
the poison went into effect.

94
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
She lost all strength,

95
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,880
causing her to fall off the building,

96
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,000
which led the witnesses to believe that

97
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,560
she fell to death.

98
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,680
In that case,

99
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,640
Mengmeng is off the hook, right?

100
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
That's great.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,400
Can we go now?

102
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,360
Sure.

103
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,200
Chang Kong and Xiao Ai
are still waiting.

104
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,280
Sorry for disturbing you, rest in peace.

105
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,960
I didn't realize it when we came in.

106
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,760
These Lanterns are gorgeous.

107
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,480
Don't mess around.

108
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,480
And

109
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,080
put off your torch.

110
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,760
What are you worrying about?

111
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,440
We were fine on our way over here.

112
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Why worry on our way back?

113
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,840
What's this twinkly thing?

114
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,160
Don't touch it. That's the alarm.

115
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,560
Someone broke in. Hurry up!

116
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,240
Uh oh, they've been caught.

117
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,680
Hurry up.

118
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,840
So... What do we do now?

119
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,360
Do we come clean?

120
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
But with the only evidence we have,

121
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,640
we cannot have them believe us.

122
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,200
But if we say nothing,

123
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,600
we're going to be in more trouble.

124
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,840
Hey, you two.

125
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,360
Do you think I can't hear you?

126
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,120
Now answer me.

127
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,680
Why did you two break into my mansion?

128
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,080
What do you want to do to my daughter?

129
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,560
Answer me!

130
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,360
I guess we have to.

131
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,000
Risk it all.

132
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,560
We came here to do an autopsy.

133
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,040
According to our investigation,

134
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,520
Miss Ye didn't die due to the falling,

135
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,520
but due to being poisoned by someone.

136
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,600
And that someone

137
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,040
Is Ye Ling'er that is right next to you.

138
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Proofless nonsense!

139
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,520
Why would I believe you?

140
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,400
Oh, but I do have evidence!

141
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
You can go check yourself.

142
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,400
Ye Fei'er's nails turned black.

143
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,880
And there are seven black spots
behind her ear.

144
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,520
These are all symptoms
of being poisoned.

145
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,120
Dad!

146
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,240
I think

147
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,360
the two of them are just here

148
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,040
to clear Jiang Mengmeng's name.

149
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
They deliberately poisoned the body,

150
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,400
and are trying to frame it on me.

151
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,760
The so-called evidence

152
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,720
is due to the poison they used.

153
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,680
That's why
they can precisely describe it.

154
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,400
Dad.

155
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,920
Dad.

156
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,560
I feel so bad for my sister.

157
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
It's bad enough she was killed,

158
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,800
but to have her remains be insulted.

159
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,560
And now,

160
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,920
people are trying to use her
to frame me.

161
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,480
Dad.

162
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
If you truly suspect me,

163
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,840
kill me.

164
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,480
So that I can go company my sister.

165
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,520
But if I die too,

166
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,360
you will no longer have any offspring.

167
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,320
No one will mourn for you decades later.

168
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,240
Dad.

169
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,080
My baby girl.

170
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,960
It's dad's fault.

171
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,640
Dad has wronged you.

172
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,000
Fei'er is no longer with us.

173
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,520
Dad only has one baby girl left.

174
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,160
How could I possibly

175
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,240
kill you

176
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,280
for some outsiders with bad intentions?

177
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,440
Guards!

178
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,120
Take these two intruders outside.

179
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,800
And beat them to death!

180
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,920
Yes sir.

181
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,680
Hold up!

182
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,920
(Sai Pan'an?)

183
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,000
(Why is he here?)

184
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,480
Greetings, Your Highness!

185
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,320
You're finally here.

186
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,000
You may stand up.

187
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,480
Your Highness.

188
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,960
This is the last day of
the 3-day period.

189
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,800
You haven't been able
to find the killer.

190
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,120
And I can't do much about it.

191
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,160
But you can't just

192
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,640
come in here and rescue the two people

193
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,720
who insulted my daughters remains.

194
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Governor Ye.

195
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,080
I'll be honest with you.

196
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,480
These two were following my orders by

197
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,800
investigating the death
of your daughter.

198
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,200
Do you mean you also think

199
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,960
it was Ling'er who killed my Fei'er?

200
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,880
I know

201
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,200
you don't believe what we said.

202
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,640
What about a testimony from a witness?

203
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,160
It's hard to not believe that.

204
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,640
Childe Sai.

205
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,920
Now

206
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,400
please tell us

207
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,160
who actually killed Miss Ye,

208
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,200
Ye Fei'er.

209
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,680
The real murderer of Ye Fei'er is...

210
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,480
Ye Ling'er.

211
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,760
You...

212
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,640
The blood night-blooming cereus!

213
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,840
Why do you have it?

214
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,430
(Sai Pan'an's house)

215
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,800
Who's there?

216
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,880
Who's over there?

217
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,560
Who's there?

218
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,560
Who...

219
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,720
Who are you?

220
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,320
I'm your beloved Fei'er.

221
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
An'an!

222
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,520
I miss you so much.

223
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,720
Men and ghosts are different.

224
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,280
Since you're already dead,

225
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,240
go and reincarnate.

226
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,640
Don't come and bother me.

227
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,240
That's too much smoke.

228
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,640
My death was unjust.

229
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,720
I can't reincarnate.

230
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,520
An'an!

231
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
You know how unjust my death was.

232
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,560
But you never did anything about it.

233
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,440
I hate you!

234
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,200
I'm sorry.

235
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,240
I was threatened.

236
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,200
An'an!

237
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,400
An'an!

238
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,480
I don't believe you,

239
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,760
unless you come with me.

240
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,120
An'an.

241
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,160
An'an.

242
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,160
Okay, okay.

243
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,440
Ye Ling'er threatened me.

244
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,360
She came to me with the
blood night-blooming cereus.

245
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,600
She said if I had the loot,

246
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,400
we were on the same boat.

247
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,160
Then, she would no longer worry

248
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,720
I would let it be known
that she poisoned you.

249
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,600
That's enough.

250
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,720
An'an!

251
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,240
Where is
the blood night-blooming cereus?

252
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,720
It's you two.

253
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,200
It was you.

254
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,320
You stole
the blood night-blooming cereus.

255
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,320
You killed Fei'er.

256
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,200
The person who stole
the blood night-blooming cereus

257
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,360
wasn't me.

258
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,920
It was your baby girl, Ye Fei'er.

259
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,040
Impossible!

260
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,440
Impossible!

261
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,960
Why do you think

262
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,200
Ye Fei'er just suddenly

263
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,960
became so lovely and helpful,

264
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,600
gave you massages and brought you tea?

265
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,840
She only did those

266
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,600
so she could squeeze information

267
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,680
and steal
the blood night-blooming cereus.

268
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,960
What did Fei'er want
the blood night-blooming cereus for?

269
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
For Sai Pan'an.

270
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,880
Wait, what?

271
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,320
I'm so confused.

272
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,720
I and Sai Pan'an were a couple.

273
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,880
But that bully Ye Fei'er destroyed it.

274
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,840
Although she stole Sai Pan'an,

275
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,120
she was still worried that Sai Pan'an

276
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,560
would be stolen by someone else.

277
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,040
Legend says the blood night-blooming
cereus can control minds.

278
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,440
So, she decided to steal it

279
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,840
to consolidate her relationship
with Sai Pan'an.

280
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,080
Another tragedy caused by the
blood night-blooming cereus.

281
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,000
But she got one part right.

282
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,440
Sai Pan'an never changes.

283
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,680
He kept fooling around,

284
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,360
and hooked up

285
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,400
with Jiang Mengmeng.

286
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,360
What? I'm just spectating here.

287
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,760
How am I involved?

288
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,960
That day you were at the
ready-made clothes shop.

289
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,840
And you saw Sai Pan'an

290
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,560
interacting with Jiang Mengmeng.

291
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,160
So, you thought of an idea to
hit four birds with one stone.

292
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,360
First, you lured Jiang Mengmeng to
the teahouse with the note.

293
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,920
Then you encouraged Ye Fei'er

294
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,680
to set things straight
with Jiang Mengmeng

295
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,480
and poisoned her before she left.

296
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,080
I see.

297
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,000
So Zhe Xiang and I were right?

298
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,720
Does it have anything to do with you?

299
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,200
Come on.

300
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,080
So,

301
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Jiang Mengmeng would take the frame

302
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
and be executed.

303
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,560
Then, both Sai Pan'an

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,040
and the blood night-blooming cereus
are yours.

305
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,120
How...

306
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
How...

307
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,000
How could you be so disgraceful?

308
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,720
Me? Disgraceful?

309
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,000
Do you think Ye Fei'er was any better?

310
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,960
You...

311
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,800
All these years, she's used her status

312
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,720
and bullied her way
through in Hui County.

313
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,640
You can ask those who sent condolences.

314
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,400
All of them act as if they're in pain
in front of you,

315
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,960
and start celebrating
when they turn around.

316
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,960
Killing her

317
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,440
was doing society a favor.

318
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,840
You...

319
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,520
My god, everyone's a baddie here.

320
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,160
Governor Ye.

321
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
We've now found the killer for you.

322
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,560
I trust in you to make the decision.

323
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,680
Guards.

324
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,960
Stay away.

325
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,280
- Ling'er.
- Stay away.

326
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,680
Calm down.

327
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,440
Wicked woman.

328
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,200
Stop struggling.

329
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,240
You're not going anywhere.

330
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,760
You're right. I can't escape.

331
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,160
In that case,

332
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,080
we might as well be ghost couples
on the other side.

333
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,760
Now even without
the blood night-blooming cereus,

334
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,360
we'll still be together.

335
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,320
Ling'er.

336
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,880
My Ling'er.

337
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,480
Ling'er.

338
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,880
Why?

339
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,480
It's not the flower that hurts others,

340
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,760
but people.

341
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,480
Ling'er.

342
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,080
(Ye's Mansion)

343
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,320
Why are you holding it so tightly?

344
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,840
No one's going to steal it.

345
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,960
You're not my boss.

346
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,280
Cas is now closed.

347
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,160
And we're not far away from
the imperial palace of Cang Yun Kingdom.

348
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,800
Let's go return Murong Chen.

349
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,720
Then you two can get an annulment.

350
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,480
What?

351
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,400
You feel attached to me?

352
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,640
Let's get married in the palace then.

353
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,120
You wish!

354
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,000
If I could, I'd fly there right now,

355
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,400
get the papers, break off with you,

356
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,480
and never see you again。

357
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,680
Mengmeng finally realized
that I'm her true love.

358
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,600
We've been working hard lately.

359
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,320
I'm a bit tired now.

360
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,360
We can finally go home and rest.

361
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,880
Murong Chen.

362
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,840
You rogue.

363
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,320
Xiao Ai, let's go.

364
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,240
(Ye's Mansion)

365
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,360
You manipulated Ye Ling'er
to kill Ye Fei'er

366
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
and frame it on Jiang Mengmeng,

367
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,880
didn't you?

368
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,840
Are you questioning me
because of Jiang Mengmeng?

369
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,600
No, I would never.

370
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,040
I know.

371
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,680
For all these years,

372
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,800
you've been all by yourself.

373
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,720
Now you suddenly gain so many friends.

374
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,560
It's easy to forget who you are

375
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,160
and even start to rethink
what you stand for.

376
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,160
But it's inevitable.

377
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,840
You have been nothing but kind to me.

378
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,240
I've sworn to devote my life to you.

379
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,240
No matter what the outside world says,

380
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,720
you will always be my only family.

381
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,240
Jing Yue Sect will always be my home.

382
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,200
Of course, I believe in you.

383
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,360
I just want
the blood night-blooming cereus.

384
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,760
I never wanted to harm them,

385
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,000
especially Jiang Mengmeng.

386
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,240
Her blood of pure yang

387
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,600
is the medical supplement to restart the
blood night-blooming cereus.

388
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,840
Of course I wouldn't hurt her.

389
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,880
Then...

390
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,040
There's one more thing left.

391
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,800
And when it's done,

392
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,840
this mission is finished.

393
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,400
Have you

394
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,280
truly seen Jiang Mengmeng as a friend?

395
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,200
I just want her to be safe and happy,

396
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,080
and not get hurt.

397
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,000
Do you know that from the beginning

398
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,640
I never trusted you?

399
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,240
It doesn't matter.

400
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,560
But since Jiang Mengmeng
sees you as a friend,

401
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,800
I guess so should I.

402
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,240
Remember what you said earlier.

403
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,520
Why are you back again?

404
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,080
Zhe Xiang.

405
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,040
It's me.

406
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,800
Mengmeng?

407
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,600
Why are you here?

408
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
I couldn't sleep.

409
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,400
I want to chat with you.

410
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,440
Ok.

411
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,160
I didn't know that you and Yun Ya

412
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,960
had that type of history.

413
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,000
Now I don't understand.

414
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,040
You've got
the blood night-blooming cereus.

415
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,640
Shouldn't this be a happy ending?

416
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,960
Why are you still upset?

417
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
That's what I thought too,

418
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,520
until Yun Ya spoke to me.

419
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,800
He asked me,

420
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,600
if I restored my memories,

421
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,000
would I have nothing
but guilt towards him.

422
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,720
How did you answer him?

423
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,360
I didn't.

424
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,840
I thought I had figured it out.

425
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,800
Murong Chen is just a regular friend.

426
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,800
And Yun Ya is my true love.

427
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,240
But

428
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,800
after he put it that way,

429
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,320
I no longer know for sure.

430
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,560
And tonight, when Song Che suddenly said

431
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,600
to send Murong Chen back home,

432
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,360
I suddenly remembered

433
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,040
that the reason why we were together

434
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,840
was to send him home.

435
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,080
And now he's going home.

436
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,040
It feels unusual.

437
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,280
Like...

438
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,640
He's done so much for me.

439
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,760
Without him,

440
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,960
it just feels weird.

441
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,440
And you would miss him, right?

442
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,600
Have you ever properly
thought about that?

443
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,560
About feelings and responsibilities,

444
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,440
there isn't a way

445
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,920
to put a clear line between the two.

446
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,560
Let me put it this way.

447
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,120
About you and Murong Chen.

448
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,080
At first, you were responsible for him.

449
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
But as you two spent time together,

450
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,720
feelings emerged.

451
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,200
Or,

452
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,520
at first, you had feelings for Yun Ya.

453
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,120
But the two of you

454
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,360
had too many chains tying each other.

455
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,160
And feelings slowly
became responsibilities.

456
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,320
Do I have a foot in both camps

457
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,960
and fall in love with two men?

458
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,000
Well, it's not impossible.

459
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,280
Then what should I do?

460
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,480
You're a princess.

461
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,760
It's okay for you
to love more than one man.

462
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,760
It's not okay.

463
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,760
I know sometimes

464
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,760
I'm a bit of a fence sitter.

465
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
But I feel like when it comes to love,

466
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
it has to be between two people.

467
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,440
It can't have a third.

468
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,400
Besides,

469
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,360
even if they both agree,

470
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,160
I can't manage both of them.

471
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,640
There's one more thing left.

472
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,280
And when it's done,

473
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,640
this mission is finished.

474
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,120
I have an idea.

475
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,760
How about
the three of you meet together,

476
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,720
sit down and properly talk it through?

477
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,600
Wouldn't that be like a disaster?

478
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,840
It gives me shivers thinking about it.

479
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,760
No, I didn't mean that.

480
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,760
Think of it this way.

481
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,600
We solved the case without a hitch.

482
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,440
It's because of Yun Ya's help,
right?

483
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,400
Shouldn't you bring Murong Chen with you

484
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,800
to go and thank him?

485
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,520
I guess that makes sense.

486
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,680
But...

487
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,160
Stop worrying.

488
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,240
Worrying isn't going to solve anything.

489
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,160
How about

490
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,000
you complete your 'responsibilities'?

491
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,000
And then you'll know how you truly feel.

492
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,600
I guess that makes sense.

493
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,200
I'll go find Murong Chen.

494
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
It's too late now.

495
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,160
Wait till tomorrow morning.

496
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,160
You can look for him with Murong Chen.

497
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah, you're right.

498
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,000
It's the middle of the night.

499
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,560
Thank you, Zhe Xiang.

500
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,960
It's a bit late now.

501
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,200
I should go rest.

502
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,350
(Qinghui House)

503
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,080
Not bad.

504
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,320
It's got that taste.

505
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,080
You're awake.

506
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,240
What are you doing here so early?

507
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,840
To bring you breakfast.

508
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,240
Why are you so nice to me all a sudden?

509
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,120
Just taste it.

510
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,920
What is this?

511
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,800
This is my DIY Master Jiang's
instant noodles.

512
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,320
DIY Master Jiang's instant noodles?

513
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,080
Come on, taste it.

514
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,200
It's delicious.

515
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,240
It's my favorite.

516
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,160
Does it taste good?

517
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,280
- I love it.
- Hurry up.

518
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,480
There's someone I want you to meet.

519
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
Who are we meeting?

520
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,800
The owner of Tian Ji Pavilion, Yun Ya.

521
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
Are you okay?

522
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,200
Is it...

523
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,560
Is it too spicy?

524
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,920
No...

525
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,280
Why we're meeting him?

526
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,280
Wouldn't that be a bit awkward?

527
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,960
You'll know each other when you meet.

528
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,440
(I need to tell her the truth.)

529
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,480
(But this is not the time.)

530
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,040
Oh, by the way,
Chang Kong and Xiao Ai went out.

531
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,160
They haven't come back yet.

532
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,960
Let's wait for Chang Kong to get back.

533
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,000
Then we all go together.

534
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,280
Sure.

535
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,240
Then...

536
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,160
Never mind.

537
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,280
Let your food digest first, I guess.

538
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,560
Xiao Ai.

539
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Your...

540
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
What?

541
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,360
Never mind. Wait for me.

542
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
I'll be back soon.

543
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,640
(Tianxiang Jewelry)

544
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,120
Damn it!

545
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,720
I can't wait anymore.

546
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,520
Murong Chen, it's starting to get late.

547
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,760
How about we go first?

548
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,040
Murong Chen?

549
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,400
Come on, let's go.

550
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,600
But what about Chang Kong?

551
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,000
You're a grown-man.

552
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,120
We don't need to wait for Chang Kong.

553
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,560
I can lead too.

554
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,160
I...

555
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,800
Wait...

556
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,400
I think I forgot to bring something.

557
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,880
You don't have to bring anything.

558
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,840
Just go.

559
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,960
(Tian ji Pavilion)

560
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,360
No need to be so polite. Stand up.

561
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,000
Thanks!

562
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,880
Wait for a moment.

563
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,560
He should be here in a bit.

564
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,800
Be patient.

565
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,400
He might be busy now.

566
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,840
Maybe we should go.

567
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,760
We're already here.
There's no harm to wait a bit longer.

568
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,560
Murong Chen, are you okay?

569
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,920
You look sweaty.

570
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,520
I'm fine.

571
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,600
I think I might have a stomach ache.

572
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,760
I'm going to use the toilet.

573
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,040
Wait for me.

574
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,480
You...

575
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,200
What took you so...

576
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Yun Ya. You are here.

577
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,000
What's up?

578
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,600
We solved the Ye Fei'er case.

579
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,640
So, I and Murong Chen came to thank you.

580
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,320
I didn't actually help much.

581
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,320
You didn't need to come here
just to thank me.

582
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,560
Well, it's not just to thank you.

583
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,440
We...

584
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,480
It's mainly...

585
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,480
I want you two to meet each other.

586
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,680
Murong Chen,

587
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,600
the 5th prince of Cang Yun Kingdom.

588
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,240
I know him.

589
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,280
But you really didn't need to thank me.

590
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,920
Actually, I know

591
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,000
last time

592
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,360
because of the thing with Murong Chen,

593
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,600
you weren't really happy.

594
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,880
So...

595
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,840
So, I thought

596
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,960
you two could chat.

597
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,840
I just remembered

598
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I have business to attend.

599
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
Please excuse me.

600
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,800
Fine, fine.

601
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,480
What's the matter?

602
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,960
Yun Ya came.

603
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,000
Where is he?

604
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,760
He's gone again.

605
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,200
How about we leave first.

606
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,680
What's the hurry? Sit down.

607
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,680
My stomach is starting to ache again.

608
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,920
- You...
- I...

609
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,440
I need to use the toilet.

610
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,400
Wait for me.

611
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,680
Can't you just hold it in?

612
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,080
Where's Murong Chen?

613
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,600
He has a stomach ache.

614
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,640
And he keeps going to the toilet.

615
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,840
Sorry.

616
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,960
I'm not done with my business yet.

617
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,480
Please excuse me.

618
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,400
Sure.

619
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,760
Go ahead. Do what you have to do.

620
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,880
Again?

621
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,360
Go. Just be quick.

622
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,880
I might need more time.

623
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
Excuse me.

624
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,920
I need the toilet. I need the toilet.

625
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,040
No, you can't...

626
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Are the two of them switching accounts?

627
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,480
It feels like they're playing me.

628
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,000
Master.

629
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,160
I need to take a break.

630
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,360
Master, are you okay?

631
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,720
Not really.

632
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,000
If only Chang Kong was here.

633
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
He could help me out with the acting.

634
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,360
Of all times, now he goes missing.

635
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,640
Come on. Give it to me.

636
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,760
Master, your mask.

637
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,760
Thanks.

638
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,520
I couldn't find you.

639
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,280
I thought you ran into bad guys again.

640
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,560
It was the two kids.

641
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,760
They dragged me away.

642
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,720
Their ball was on the roof.

643
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,360
They wanted me to help them.

644
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,360
Oh right.

645
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,480
This is for you.

646
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,480
It's so pretty, Chang Kong.

647
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
Do you like it?

648
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,800
Thank you, Chang Kong.

649
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,920
You're welcome.

650
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,360
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

651
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,320
You're welcome.

652
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,120
Thanks.

653
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,720
Here.

654
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,720
You two did a good job.

655
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,960
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

656
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,040
Go have fun.

657
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,560
World Memoir.

658
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,920
I didn't know Yun Ya was into this type.

659
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,800
Ledger of Qian Xiu Workshop?

660
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,680
Why is it at Yun Ya's place...

661
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,720
Murong Chen reads World Memoir.

662
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,600
Yun Ya also does.

663
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,840
The two of them
has never been in the same room before.

664
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,960
He's fine.

665
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,520
You don't need to look for him.

666
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,320
He'll show up.

667
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,960
Murong Chen...

668
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,160
When it comes to Murong Chen,

669
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,360
he doesn't need to look anything up.

670
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,720
He knows what he's doing.

671
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,800
My name is A Mu.

672
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,280
A Mu.

673
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,120
Murong Chen.

674
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,160
It was so obvious.

675
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,960
