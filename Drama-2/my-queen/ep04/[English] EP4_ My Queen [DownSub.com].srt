How about having a drink

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,480
to heat up the atmosphere
on our wedding night?

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,360
Sure.

27
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,240
It's up to you.

(Double Happiness)

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,520
come on.

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,560
Come to the bedroom.

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,440
(Yin Hua)
Come here, hubby.

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:14,920
Come to the bedroom.

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,080
I will make up the bed.

35
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,520
Drink more.

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,800
Have some more.

37
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,080
Don't stop.

38
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,960
Have some more.

39
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,160
All the women in Bai Hua Village

40
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,920
are orphans

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,200
who have no parents

42
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
or anyone to rely on.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,440
Since we were young,

44
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
they liked to bully us.

45
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,560
We rob people

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,880
not only to survive,

47
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,840
but also

48
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,800
to get back

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,080
our pride.

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,080
Sure.

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
We will make everyone afraid of us.

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,640
So, they will never look down on us.

53
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,960
Look down...

54
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,400
Oh, no...

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,000
Look up to us.

56
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,360
Come on, let's drink.

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:13,920
Cheers.

58
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,880
I will fill it up for you.

59
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,640
Nowadays,

60
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,280
people around this area

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,600
all get scared when

62
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,560
they hear my name.

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,760
But I don't feel as happy as I thought.

64
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,280
Rather than having people afraid of me,

65
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,920
I hope that they love me.

66
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,320
Can you understand?

67
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,160
Yes, I can.

68
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,200
Come on, cheers.

69
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,160
Cheers.

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,480
After this toast,

71
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,800
I'll love you even more.

72
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:44,840
OK.

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,760
Cheers.

74
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,800
I will fill it up for you.

75
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,160
Love is sharing.

76
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,200
It's like this bottle of wine.

77
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,560
You won't enjoy it if
drink only by yourself.

78
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,360
But if we share it,

79
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,600
it will be tastier.

80
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,560
Right?

81
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Sharing?

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,360
Yes, sharing.

83
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,080
I'd love to share with you.

84
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,360
I'd love to share all my
good things with you,

85
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,840
including myself.

86
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,120
All with you.

87
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,320
You don't have to share yourself.

88
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,880
But

89
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,840
I heard that

90
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,520
you had got some good stuff recently.

91
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,840
Good stuff?

92
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,120
Yes.

93
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,320
Right.

94
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,680
I have tons of good stuff

95
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,040
that I like to share with you.

96
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,040
Good stuff.

97
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,200
Really?

98
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,720
Good stuff.

99
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,520
Over there. Over there.

100
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,760
Is this the blood night-blooming cereus?

101
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,880
It doesn't look like it.

102
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,840
I think this trip is all for nothing.

103
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,560
No.

104
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,240
It's not.

105
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,880
Happy wedding.

106
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,680
Are you trying to scare me to death?

107
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,480
Where is Yin Hua?

108
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,480
Passed out.

109
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,240
Good job.

110
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,680
You, too.

111
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,720
No,

112
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,920
we have to leave now.

113
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,560
It will be too late if they wake up.

114
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,600
Hurry up.

115
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,240
Let's go.

116
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,200
(Double Happiness)

117
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,530
(Feng Yi Palace)

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,520
Mengmeng has been missing
for the whole day.

119
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,880
And the 5th prince has been missing
for 2 days.

120
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,560
Why is there no news about them at all?

121
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,800
Xiao Ai, A Liang.

122
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,880
Did Mengmeng mention
where she was going?

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
I don't know.

124
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,680
Is there any clue about
where the 5th prince went?

125
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,480
8th brother, Song Che.

126
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,520
Any clue?

127
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,960
I found this

128
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,520
from a pawnshop.

129
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,560
This is...

130
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,880
It's a gift I gave to Mengmeng.

131
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,040
Ah right.

132
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,760
I remember that when Her Highness left,

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,320
she was dressed like

134
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,400
a cook.

135
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,320
She was holding knifes

136
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,240
and spatula in her hands.

137
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,160
Right.

138
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,200
We found the guy
who traded in the jade bracelet,

139
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,000
and he said that

140
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,440
Mengmeng used this jade bracelet to

141
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,720
trade all their cooking
equipment and clothes.

142
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,320
This information also matches
what Xiao Ai and A Liang said.

143
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,120
Recently, many cooks have gone missing.

144
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,600
Based on the investigation,

145
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,600
they are caught up
and sent to Bai Hua Village.

146
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,680
Bai Hua Village!

147
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,880
Bai Hua Village!

148
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,240
Quickly, this way.

149
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,560
Stop there.

150
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,440
I'm so exhausted.

151
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,720
Don't run.

152
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,360
How did they catch up so quickly?

153
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,160
Stop there.

154
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,000
Hurry, run.

155
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,040
Stop there.

156
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,680
How come there're so many people?

157
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,520
What should we do?

158
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,000
What else can we do?

159
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,720
Let's fight.

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,600
You have me here.

161
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,320
It will be ok.

162
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:29,760
Stay behind me.

163
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,400
Stop it.

164
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,160
Let me do it.

165
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,400
Can you handle it?

166
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Why are you pulling my clothes?

167
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,640
You told me to stay behind you.

168
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,480
I told you to stay behind me
so you can watch my back.

169
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,840
I can't watch my back by myself.

170
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,480
Be careful.

171
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,600
Don't move.

172
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,240
Don't move.

173
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,400
Kneel down.

174
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,440
Stay still.

175
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,760
Song Che.

176
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,720
You are finally here.

177
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,760
I thought you’d never come.

178
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,400
I thought I would die.

179
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,160
Mengmeng.

180
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,920
Don't be scared.

181
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,320
I'm here to rescue you.

182
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,280
Let's go.

183
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,360
Hurry.

184
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,200
But why are you here?

185
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,520
It's all arranged by Her Majesty.

186
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,200
Sister queen?

187
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,760
Sister queen.

188
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,520
Did you get hurt?

189
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,240
It's fine.

190
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,000
Just a little scratch.

191
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,800
But,

192
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:00,920
sister queen,

193
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,400
what's going on?

194
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,360
The bandits in Ruo Shui Kingdom

195
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,800
are always my big concern.

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,080
It has not been resolved for years.

197
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,080
This time, you and the emperor's
son-in-law went missing.

198
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,840
Your brother and Song Che found out

199
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,760
it has something to do
with Bai Hua Village.

200
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,600
We are here to take
all of them down once.

201
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,960
But this time,

202
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,920
you and the emperor's son-in-law
have made huge contribution.

203
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,240
We?

204
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,600
A piece of cake.

205
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,040
Because I know

206
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,960
our Mengmeng is very kind.

207
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,840
As soon as you knew cooks got kidnapped,

208
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,000
you would come to enemy's lair

209
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,320
to rescue them.

210
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,120
Right?

211
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,240
(What's going on?)

212
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,720
(Isn't this what Murong Chen made up?)

213
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,320
Sister queen, actually…

214
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,360
(Whatever.)

215
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,680
(The blood night-blooming cereus
is still missing anyway.)

216
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,360
(No need to spill out the truth.)

217
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,240
Sorry, sister queen.

218
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
I made you worried.

219
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,960
You bandits

220
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,000
have been doing all kinds of evil
for years.

221
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,160
Robbing and kidnapping.

222
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,800
Now you even dare to
kidnap my 9th princess.

223
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,960
9th princess?

224
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,040
If I don't bring you to justice,

225
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,240
Ruo Shui Kingdom will never be safe.

226
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:17,880
Guards.

227
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,320
Sister queen,

228
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,280
please let them go.

229
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,040
After all,

230
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,160
they're forced to do this
just for living.

231
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
And as bandits,

232
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,200
they only robbed people

233
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,360
without actually harming anyone.

234
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,840
This time, they kidnapped cooks

235
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,000
just for cooking.

236
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,760
I also feel they are guilty,

237
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,160
but they don't deserve to die.

238
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,040
How about this?

239
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,120
I have an idea.

240
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,200
Do you wanna hear it?

241
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,600
Speak out.

242
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,080
I think that,

243
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,400
rather than killing them,

244
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,800
why don't we guide them
to do good things?

245
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,520
I think that

246
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,040
we can order them to hand over
the spoils,

247
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,640
and we can use them to help the people.

248
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,160
In this way,

249
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,000
they can also have a second chance

250
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,880
to change and start over.

251
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,400
Sister queen, please.

252
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,840
OK.

253
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,520
You must check carefully
against the list.

254
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,640
Don't miss anything.

255
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,080
It's not right.

256
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,440
Some are missing.

257
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,000
What's missing?

258
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,080
Go and search around corners carefully,

259
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,360
and see if there's anything left.

260
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,200
There's no need.

261
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,600
Right, this is it!

262
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,360
This is the bracelet.

263
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,840
The white pearl necklace
is still missing.

264
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,440
Keep searching.

265
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,800
Right, right. It's that white one.

266
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,440
The colorful bead necklace
is also missing.

267
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,280
Still missing...

268
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,640
Missing...

269
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,560
The last one.

270
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,840
Now everything's here.

271
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,040
Found it!

272
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,040
You don't need to check it.

273
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,000
It's also fake.

274
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,920
This is much more complicated

275
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,840
than we imagined.

276
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,360
But there's one thing we can be sure of.

277
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,800
It was a right decision to
come to Ruo Shui Kingdom.

278
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,480
But Your Highness, you are now
the emperor's son-in-law.

279
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,440
If we continue to dig into it,

280
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm afraid that it won't be easy.

281
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,000
But if we somehow break off
the engagement,

282
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,520
we don't have excuse to stay here.

283
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,560
I have an idea.

284
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,840
What is it?

285
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,160
She also wants to get the
blood night-blooming cereus, right?

286
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,560
You mean the 9th princess?

287
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,680
(It shouldn't be like this.)

288
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,000
(Why did I feel nothing
when I hugged him?)

289
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,360
Brother.

290
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,360
Coming.

291
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,600
Brother.

292
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,080
Mengmeng.

293
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,160
What happened?

294
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,120
Hug me.

295
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,480
My sister,

296
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,080
although we've been close to each other

297
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,800
and used to hug, kiss and hold high,

298
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,440
you are a big girl now.

299
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,880
And it's a little...

300
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,200
Mengmeng,

301
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,320
did anyone bully you?

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,720
Tell me,

303
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,720
and I'll teach him a lesson.

304
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,280
Can you teach
the game designer a lesson?

305
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,080
Game design...

306
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,760
Designer?

307
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,840
Who is that?

308
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,000
Wait, Mengmeng.

309
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,960
Mengmeng?

310
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,920
Where does that designer live?

311
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,000
Energetic.

312
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,160
Powerful.

313
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,160
Loyal.

314
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,000
Enterprising?

315
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,960
Except for being a little
straightforward,

316
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,160
what went wrong?

317
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,160
Your Highness,

318
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,840
is there anything I can do for you?

319
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,560
Xiao Ai,

320
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,600
tell me,

321
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,840
Song Che and I,

322
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,160
do we match each other?

323
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,480
General Song has
powerful family background,

324
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,520
and he has achieved a lot at his age.

325
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,200
He's handsome and brave,

326
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,800
and he's grown up together with you.

327
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,120
Of course, you two match each other.

328
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,800
That's right.

329
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,840
That's what I thought.

330
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,840
When he came to save me

331
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,000
the other day at Bai Hua Village,

332
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,280
I ran into his arms.

333
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,320
It should be the kind of climax
of a love story.

334
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,800
Love story?

335
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,200
But I didn't feel anything.

336
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,360
What is a

337
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,240
love story?

338
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,760
My point is...

339
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
My point is...

340
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,120
Well... this...

341
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,000
Well...

342
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,200
I was supposed to feel nervous

343
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,000
and excited

344
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,840
with fast heartbeat.

345
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
But I didn't.

346
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,000
That's why I even tested
it out with the 8th brother.

347
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,000
I found that

348
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,440
I felt the same when

349
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,440
I hugged them.

350
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,760
Is the so-called destiny

351
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
determined by storyline
and character setting,

352
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,760
or by my real feelings?

353
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,000
No, no.

354
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,400
Even Song Che is not the right man.

355
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,360
How come that guy is. Impossible!

356
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,800
What's impossible?

357
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,760
Speaking of the devil.

358
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,240
Wow.

359
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,880
What is this?

360
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,000
What?

361
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,040
Oh...

362
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,720
Well.

363
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,760
What are you doing here?

364
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,680
Are you here to make fun of me?

365
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,120
That's misunderstanding.

366
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,040
You got hurt because of me after all.

367
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,600
Of course, I should

368
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,560
come to visit you.

369
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,240
This is

370
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,880
the special medicine
from our Cang Yun Kingdom.

371
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,240
It's particularly effective.

372
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,840
You can think of it as a gift in payment
for what you have done for me.

373
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,960
I saved your life.
You think this can suffice?

374
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,560
If you don't want it,
forget about it.

375
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,760
I do.

376
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,400
Speaking of which,

377
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,280
did you actually go to Bai Hua Village

378
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,000
to rescue those cooks?

379
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,080
What about you?

380
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,680
Since we don't trust each other,

381
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,520
let's talk frankly.

382
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,280
I went there

383
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,200
to look for something.

384
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,160
Stealing something!

385
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,920
Can those outfits
you ancient people wear

386
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,960
actually hold that many stuff?

387
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,200
Wow.

388
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,080
Is this the blood night-blooming cereus?

389
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,080
Yes.

390
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,480
Neither did I find it in
Jin Hua's room yesterday,

391
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,280
nor at the site where
we were counting the spoils.

392
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,120
This

393
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,280
was found in Yin Hua's room.

394
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,600
Yin Hua robbed this
behind Jin Hua's back.

395
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,920
That explains it.

396
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,360
Are you giving it to me?

397
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,640
Of course.

398
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,560
Take it.

399
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,840
This is the blood night-blooming cereus?

400
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,800
Why does it look so familiar?

401
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,920
Look.

402
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,600
It is fake.

403
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,080
The one at the lantern festival

404
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,280
and the one at Bai Hua Village this time

405
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,160
are both fake.

406
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,960
So, I come here today

407
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,640
to collaborate with you.

408
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,200
You want to collaborate with me?

409
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,280
Since we have the same objective,

410
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,000
rather than making things
difficult for each other,

411
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,600
it's better to cooperate.

412
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,680
When we find
the real blood night-blooming cereus,

413
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,200
we can each get half of it.

414
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,840
What do you think?

415
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,480
Deal.

416
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,560
You and me, we can work together.

417
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,520
Then from now on,

418
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,200
we are partners.

419
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,520
Okay, come on.

420
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,840
Give me five.

421
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,440
Are you praising my good looking?

422
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,910
(Jing Yue Sect)

423
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,780
(Qing He)

424
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,680
(Yu Qingzhu,)

425
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,560
(Cold-blood Godmother)
(founder and master)

426
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,560
(of Jing Yue Sect,)

427
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,840
(planned to use the blood
night-blooming cereus)

428
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,120
(to master blood moon superb skill,)

429
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,960
(so that she can rule
the martial arts circles)

430
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,720
(and become more powerful than
the Empire.)

431
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,520
Master,

432
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
so far there have been

433
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,480
two fake blood night-blooming cereuses.

434
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,880
Do we need to take action?

435
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,920
(Zhe Xiang,
top disciple of Jing Yue Sect.)

436
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,320
(Aloof and domineering lady)
(Beautiful, cold yet powerful.)

437
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,240
(She's got full marks in attacking.)

438
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,160
(She believes in fighting over arguing.)

439
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,480
No hurry.

440
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,120
These years I've spread out

441
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,920
many rumors around,

442
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,000
just to wait for this to start.

443
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,480
Finally, someone comes into our trap,

444
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,840
and it's still not the time for us
to tighten the ring of encirclement.

445
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,160
Yes.

446
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,040
Let's leave these small potatoes

447
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,920
struggling in the trap for a while.

448
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,920
This is what I asked Xiao Ai
to buy on the market.

449
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,280
These three jade boxes are different in

450
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,840
materials,

451
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,920
crafts

452
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,560
and prices.

453
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,280
But their patterns and
looks are almost the same.

454
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,720
These are the hot sales on the market.

455
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,400
What are hot sales?

456
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,200
Hot sales are the products
that sell well.

457
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,920
It seems like this counterfeiter
is very cautious.

458
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,840
So, I'm afraid that
the clue of jade box is useless now.

459
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,720
Ah right.

460
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,320
The guy who gave us the clue.

461
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,360
Zhao Qian?

462
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,080
We got nothing from him?

463
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,920
Zhao Qian is only a speculator.

464
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,080
He didn't even know

465
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,320
the blood night-blooming cereus
he had was fake.

466
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,000
And this fake one had been sold

467
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,840
many times already.

468
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,040
We won't get anything from him.

469
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,640
It sounds like

470
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,880
the fake flower was mass produced.

471
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,040
Mass produced?

472
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,880
You mean

473
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,080
there are many fake flowers
like that on the market?

474
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,080
Think about it.

475
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,240
Zhao Qian just lost a fake one,

476
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,560
and he bought another one right away.

477
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,960
This is the best evidence
that proves my point.

478
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,080
It's surprising to see that

479
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,200
you look bewildered most of the time,

480
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,720
but you have a clear mind when
it comes to something serious.

481
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,240
You bet.

482
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,920
So, are you admiring my wisdom?

483
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,800
Put it on for me.

484
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,120
Why?

485
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,840
Someone's here.

486
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,840
Well, my dear Mengmeng,

487
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,080
you have such pretty hands.

488
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,440
Come on,

489
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,680
put on the expensive bracelet
I bought for you.

490
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,160
Such a beautiful jade
on such a pretty girl.

491
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,880
It's amazing.

492
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,200
Nice taste.

493
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,440
So pretty!

494
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,560
The color looks good, too.

495
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Thank you.

496
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,960
You're welcome.

497
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,560
I want to buy you even more things.

498
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,080
Well.

499
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,600
What I did was nothing
but saving your life.

500
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,800
This is too much.

501
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,560
I don't deserve them.

502
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,320
Let's go.

503
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,960
I didn't expect that

504
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,200
you prepared all these.

505
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,760
I have to buy some other stuff

506
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,880
as a cover.

507
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,560
That makes sense.

508
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,280
What?

509
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,200
Reimbursement.

510
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,480
You need to pay for these stuff.

511
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,880
The amount doesn't seem right.

512
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,880
How come it's only this little?

513
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,880
It's too little for you?

514
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,640
We made a deal.

515
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,880
Each of us gets half of the blood
night-blooming cereus.

516
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,480
Of course, we will also
share the expenditure.

517
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,320
You...

518
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,600
Unbelievable.

519
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,840
You said that this flower
was mass produced?

520
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,360
Right.

521
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,600
I bought all these from the
flower shop on Jin Xiu Street.

522
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,560
It seems like this counterfeiter has

523
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,280
invested a lot for it.

524
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,320
It's an investment.

525
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,880
You need a high cost for a high return.

526
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,000
As long as there could be
a dozen of stupid

527
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,560
people like you who pay a lot
for fake flowers,

528
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
he can earn it back.

529
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,800
What did you just say?

530
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,920
Did you say I'm stupid?

531
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
You dare to say it again?

532
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,200
What?

533
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,720
Someone's here.

534
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,600
Thank you, Murong Chen,

535
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,960
for giving me such a pretty flower.

536
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Of course.

537
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,720
Beautiful flower should belong

538
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,200
to beautiful girls like you.

539
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,200
Here, I will put it on you.

540
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,880
Well.

541
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,920
It's so embarrassing.

542
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,200
Why did you hit me?

543
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,120
You pricked too hard.

544
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,920
Did I?

545
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,640
So beautiful!

546
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,800
Mengmeng,

547
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,120
you are so adorable.

548
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Have they gone?

549
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,040
They've gone for a while.

550
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,520
It's not the jade box

551
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
or the dry flower.

552
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,560
So, the only thing left is…

553
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,080
- The paint.
- The paint.

554
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,120
(The book)

555
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,480
Jiang Mengmeng,

556
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,840
you are so smart.

557
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,240
You found it so quickly.

558
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,760
I'm the princess of Ruo Shui Kingdom.

559
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,800
How would a book trouble me?

560
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,280
I've read it before

561
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,040
bringing it to you.

562
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,960
The mineral
that Qian Xiu Workshop bought

563
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,200
over the past half year is
half of the whole amount.

564
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,640
I know what you want to say.

565
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,080
I will go to sister queen right now,

566
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,320
and ask for a leave.

567
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,040
Ah right,

568
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,120
I need to return this.

569
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,720
Your Highness,

570
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,040
why didn't you tell the 9th princess
from the very beginning

571
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,080
that she should track the paint?

572
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,840
Jiang Mengmeng thinks that she's smart.

573
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,360
Of course, I should use some
help from the engagement.

574
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,360
So, it would be easier to make moves.

575
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,320
Also, I need her to feel that

576
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,840
she‘s the one who leads everything.

577
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,120
Although she's made some detour,

578
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,840
she is not too stupid

579
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,880
and finally will come
back on the right track.

580
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,000
What's going on?

581
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,200
Didn't she go to see Song Che
quite often those days?

582
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,920
How did she suddenly get so

583
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,360
close to Murong Chen?

584
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,200
It was like that before.

585
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,880
But ever since she came
back from Bai Hua Village,

586
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,160
I often see them

587
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,520
chatting and laughing together.

588
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,240
The 5th prince also bought
the 9th princess

589
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,880
many gifts to make her happy.

590
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,440
Today the 9th princess also
went to Liu Guang Palace

591
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
to find the 5th prince.

592
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,720
Is it because they were kidnapped

593
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,040
together at Bai Hua Village,

594
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,000
and Jiang Mengmeng
blocked the knife for him?

595
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,560
So, they started have feelings
for each other?

596
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,400
So far it seems reasonable.

597
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,640
Jiang Mengmeng is so freakish.

598
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,080
No way.

599
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,880
I can't let them continue like this.

600
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,720
Song Che,

601
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,560
I thought you'd never come.

602
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,560
I thought I would die.

603
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,200
Young general.

604
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,240
Young...

605
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,200
Who closed the gate?

606
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,400
Young general,

607
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,680
this is the wrong way.

608
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,520
It should be this way.

609
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,240
It's my pleasure

610
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,560
to see you, My Highness.

611
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,360
You like my sister,

612
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:16,920
right?

613
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,560
Then do you know that she's

614
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,440
already with Murong Chen?

615
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,320
Mengmeng and the 5th prince?

616
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,800
It is impossible.

617
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,240
Mengmeng told me that their

618
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,000
engagement was an accident.

619
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,120
There's nothing real between them.

620
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,760
They became

621
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,960
so close lately.

622
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,680
Everyone at He Palace has seen it.

623
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,760
You are the only one
who still has no idea.

624
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,080
Self-deceiving.

625
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,360
I trust Mengmeng.

626
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,320
She'll never lie to me.

627
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,560
Besides,

628
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,960
even if they seem close now,

629
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,400
Mengmeng will have her own hardship.

630
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,040
A man and a woman.

631
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
A fiance and a fiancee.

632
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,880
They spend every day together.

633
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,800
What else can it be?

634
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,000
You are so ignorant.

635
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,560
Why are you so worried

636
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,480
about it?

637
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,840
I...

638
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,800
No matter what you decide to do,

639
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,640
you don't have to worry about

640
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,600
Mengmeng and me.

641
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,840
I still have work to do.

642
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,560
Excuse me.

643
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,240
Stupid.

644
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,200
I heard from Hai Qian that

645
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,960
you have stayed low
in the palace these days.

646
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,680
How's your hand?

647
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,160
Sister queen,

648
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,400
it has recovered.

649
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,840
The saying that you and the 5th prince

650
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,360
are getting close to each other

651
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,760
seems real.

652
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,720
(How come there are gossip
spreaders everywhere?)

653
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,120
(These nosy people.)

654
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,080
Hai Qian was right about it.

655
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,160
After the engagement,

656
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,360
you were well-behaved.

657
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,040
Sister queen,

658
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,320
I want to ask for a little favor.

659
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,240
Say it.

660
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,000
I will permit anything.

661
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,680
I want to...

662
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,720
I want to go out of the palace.

663
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,400
Sister queen.

664
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,960
I just said you had been good,

665
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,440
and now you want to go out again.

666
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,320
No.

667
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,640
It's all because it's too depressing

668
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,200
to stay in the palace
for such a long time.

669
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,080
Also, the 5th prince

670
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,560
must be even more bored than me.

671
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,520
Think about it.

672
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,280
He travelled to our kingdom

673
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,440
by himself from thousands of miles away.

674
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,800
He hasn't even had time

675
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
to travel around

676
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,080
and see how nice and beautiful
the Ruo Shui Kingdom is

677
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,920
before he was locked within the palace.

678
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,160
Poor guy.

679
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:43,960
How bored he must be.

680
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,520
Right?

681
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,880
It's not completely unreasonable.

682
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,000
Ever since men get married,

683
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,520
they are like the canary in the birdcage

684
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,400
without freedom.

685
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,240
However,

686
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,560
since you are already
so considerate of him,

687
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,880
he might become

688
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,200
haughty and willful
after you are married.

689
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,200
Sister queen.

690
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:05,880
Make a finger heart.

691
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,720
Make a finger heart.

692
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
Make a finger heart.

693
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,280
What?

694
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,520
You are saying that sister
queen permitted them to go out?

695
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,160
Yes.

696
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,440
Another chance for them to get closer.

697
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,680
Exactly, Your Highness.

698
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,720
How about we go to

699
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,320
talk with Song Che again?

700
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,040
It's useless.

701
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,200
He's as stupid as a piece of wood.

702
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,000
Then you mean...

703
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,080
Since she wants to go out,

704
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,120
I will keep her out forever.
