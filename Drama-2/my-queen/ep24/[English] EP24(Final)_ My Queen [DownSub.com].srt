Hurry up.

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
Hurry up.

26
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,520
Oh no.

27
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,400
(Are Mengmeng,)

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,440
(Song Che and others...)

29
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,080
(No.)

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,400
(I have to get out and save them.)

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,320
We have finally completed the mission.

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,320
Let's go.

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,560
You did this?

34
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,960
It's not me, unfortunately.

35
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,760
It's me.

36
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,120
When preparing for the wedding,

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,560
I asked Xiao Ai to bury the

38
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,120
fireworks and firecrackers for me.

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,240
Then Jin Hua and Yin Hua helped me

40
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,560
take out the bombs.

41
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,800
We did it ahead of the time.

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,320
At that time...

43
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,640
Send the people to guard each entrance

44
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
to save the time.

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,720
After all our support armies arrive,

46
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,600
all their armies would be kept out.

47
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,600
Yes.

48
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
You shouldn't do such dangerous things
in the future.

49
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,520
I was thinking that I might be able

50
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,800
to help from the inside

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,960
when you were attacking
from the outside.

52
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,160
Let me see.

53
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,320
Did you get hurt?

54
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,360
No.

55
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,120
I was lucky

56
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
that it helped.

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,320
Enough.

58
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,560
That's weird.

59
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,920
Why does it take so long?

60
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,840
Stop struggling.

61
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,320
All the branch information

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,920
you have collected these days

63
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,280
were forged by Chang Kong's
subordinates.

64
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,520
You have no support now.

65
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,800
What?

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,160
But I have the support.

67
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,960
Just in case,

68
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,160
I have blocked all paths in the world

69
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,400
that people might take to

70
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,880
support Jing Yue Sect.

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,440
How come there are two Tian Ji tokens?

72
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,120
Did you give me a fake one?

73
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,360
If it's fake, how is it possible for me

74
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,680
to lose all my power and

75
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,120
break into Jing Yue Sect all alone?

76
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,520
Well...

77
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,680
The one you have is mine.

78
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,040
Sorry.

79
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,200
I will listen to you from now on,

80
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,120
and will not let you worry anymore.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,840
Well...

82
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,600
You...

83
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,680
You!

84
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,320
Yu Qingzhu,

85
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,320
stop waiting.

86
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
All the branches of Jing Yue Sect

87
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,560
have been controlled by the

88
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,080
branches of Tian Ji Pavilion.

89
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,640
Jiang Mengmeng,

90
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,440
it never occurred to me.

91
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,960
I put so much trust in you,

92
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,560
but you betrayed me.

93
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,920
Did you fake everything

94
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,920
in front of me,

95
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,360
including

96
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,200
maltreating him,

97
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,320
and insulting him?

98
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,600
Did you put on a show?

99
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,480
That's right.

100
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,000
Since the day he broke into
Jing Yue Sect all alone,

101
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,120
I knew that he must have got

102
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,840
new plans.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I also knew that you have sent

104
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,880
people to watch me closely.

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,640
So, I carried out a counterplot

106
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,120
and showed you everything

107
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,080
that you want to see

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,160

cure his cold poison?

140
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,640
Of course. Otherwise how was it possible

141
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,760
for him to go through

torturing in the dungeon,

144
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,760
Then what about everything

145
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,440
that happened among you,

146
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,960
Song Che and other toy-boys every night?

147
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Just a show.

148
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
It was just a show.

149
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,120
Jiang Mengmeng,

150
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,360
you are so ruthless.

151
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
I still don't get why you would

152
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,880
still choose the man

153
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
who has once

154
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,400
betrayed you.

155
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,800
I admit that

156
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,000
at the very beginning

157
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,400
I was mad,

158
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,840
and I was even brainwashed and bewitched
by you,

159
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,480
until your words helped me
clear my head.

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,920
What words?

161
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,080
You said that

162
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,480
he chose to abandon me

163
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,120
in a dilemma.

164
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,480
At that time, I suddenly remembered

165
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,080
a very classic choice question

166
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,160
that no one can answer correctly.

167
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,800
What is it?

168
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,320
If your wife and mom fall in the water
at the same time,

169
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,800
who would you save first?

170
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,640
But the reality is,

171
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,480
no matter whom the man
decides to save,

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,840
he should not be criticized.

173
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,680
It doesn't mean that
he only saves that person,

174
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,960
instead, he can only save that one.

175
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,960
It also doesn't mean that

176
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,480
he doesn't love the other one.

177
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,200
To be honest, I was very glad

178
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
that he didn't choose me.

179
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,840
If we have to sacrifice
other people's lives,

180
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,040
and put families in danger

181
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,320
just for our love,

182
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,640
then I'd rather not have it.

183
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,880
Yu Qingzhu,

184
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,080
you've always believed that you were
good at seeing through people,

185
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,920
and finding inner darkness of people.

186
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,720
But what you don't know is that

187
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,680
the meaning of life

188
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,480
is not finding the darkness
and sinking into it,

189
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,040
but looking for the bright side

190
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,800
even when you are in darkness.

191
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,520
That's so funny.

192
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,520
Do you think that I would listen to you

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,040
just because you are giving this speech?

194
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,640
You are too naive.

195
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,520
You've put me in the desperation

196
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,240
and I will not turn back.

197
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,600
Listen to me!

198
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,280
Let's fight together!

199
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,400
I swear to live and die
together with Jing Yue Sect.

200
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,440
I swear to live and die
together with Jing Yue Sect.

201
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,720
Why are you so stubborn?

202
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,520
I have no other choices.

203
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,600
Let's kill them.

204
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,720
Stop it.

205
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,720
Put the knife down,

206
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,720
otherwise I will kill her!

207
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,720
Zhe Xiang!

208
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,160
What?

209
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,400
Are you going to kill me?

210
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,280
Yes. I'm going to kill you

211
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,920
and revenge for my dad.

212
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,680
Revenge?

213
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,040
Did you forget that

214
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,720
although your dad had taken care of you
for ten years,

215
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,440
I also had taken care of
you for ten years?

216
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,040
You took care of me?

217
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,320
You took care of me just to cultivate

218
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,800
a killing machine that

219
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,560
helped you fight Tian Ji Pavilion

220
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,800
and take revenge on my dad.

221
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,960
Stupid kid,

222
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,480
you have misunderstood me.

223
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,600
How are you so stupid?

224
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,960
I saved your life because

225
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,040
your bright eyes

226
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,840
looked just like those of my kid

227
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,360
who died upon birth.

228
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,240
That's why I treated you

229
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,280
as my real daughter

230
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,040
and protected you

231
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,440
while taking care of you.

232
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,520
Don't believe her!

233
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,760
Think about it.

234
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,160
If I brought you up as
the daughter of my enemy,

235
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
wouldn't I get scared

236
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,680
that one day you would

237
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,560
take revenge on me

238
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,880
or kill me?

239
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,120
You know my temper.

240
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,320
I'd rather kill billions of
innocent people,

241
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,640
than letting the dangerous one live.

242
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,800
- Stop it.
- But I...

243
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,880
But I let go of you.

244
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,040
What are you thinking?

245
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,200
Did you forget all the time we spent

246
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,280
together in these 10 years?

247
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,920
I taught you Kung Fu

248
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,040
and gave you everything
that you have now.

249
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,520
How can you be so cold-hearted now

250
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,080
that you even want to kill me?

251
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,720
Are you OK?

252
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,120
Did you forget

253
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,280
what I've taught you?

254
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,160
Love is something that
can get you killed.

255
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,800
I can't believe that

256
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,720
you still don't get it

257
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,560
even until now.

258
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,000
So you were lying about

259
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,200
what you just told me, right?

260
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Yes.

261
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,520
Just know for yourself.

262
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,520
Since you are desperate to be together,

263
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,920
I will make your wish come true.

264
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,320
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

265
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,280
Jiang Mengmeng.

266
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,000
Did you forget that your
Blood Moon Power

267
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,960
has only reached the fourth level?

268
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,280
You are too young and

269
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,280
your practice is so elementary.

270
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,840
You will be the only one who is defeated

271
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,000
if you continue to force yourself.

272
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,000
Don't you forget that I
have a hundred-year

273
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,240
blood night-blooming cereus

274
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,080
inside my body.

275
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,000
In terms of the age

276
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,720
or practice,

277
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,560
you have to call me grandma.

278
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
Endless moonlight

279
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,680
is infinite,

280
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,560
weightless and boundless.

281
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,520
Beyond the limitless state,

282
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,400
multiply the limitless state.

283
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,160
Within the infiniteness,

284
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,760
conceal the infiniteness.

285
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,360
Good and evil,

286
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,760
living and death,

287
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,440
as well as love and hate

288
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
used to have no boundary.

289
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,000
Since there's no boundary,

290
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
there's no impediment.

291
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,520
Everything happens in a breath.

292
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,600
Yu Qingzhu.

293
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,040
Mengmeng, are you OK?

294
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,120
I'm fine.

295
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,800
Yu Qingzhu,

296
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,560
are you OK?

297
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,720
Are you OK?

298
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,320
What happened?

299
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,040
Sorry.

300
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,960
I didn't want to do this.

301
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,720
I just wanted to save them,

302
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,880
and I didn't know this would happen.

303
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,360
Blood moon in the sky,

304
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,160
and the blood

305
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,840
has spread the heaven and the earth.

306
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,440
I saw it.

307
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
I really saw it.

308
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,360
I was defeated by

309
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,520
the power I failed to achieve.

310
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,000
I am happy.

311
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,520
Jiang Mengmeng,

312
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,040
thank you.

313
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,600
Thank you.

314
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,140
（Shuo）

315
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,160
Give it back to him for me.

316
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,120
If we could have

317
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,000
met earlier,

318
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,640
maybe the ending

319
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,320
will be different.

320
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,720
Yu Qingzhu, Yu Qingzhu,

321
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,320
Yu Qingzhu.

322
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,040
Yu Qingzhu, Yu Qingzhu,

323
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Yu Qingzhu.

324
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,440
Mengmeng.

325
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,000
Let's go.

326
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,080
Brother.

327
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,000
Little brother,

328
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,440
sister-in-law,

329
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,680
I'm glad you are all fine.

330
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,160
We will leave now.

331
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,160
Let me.

332
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,710
(Cang Yun Pavilion)

333
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,400
Mengmeng, that's enough.

334
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,920
Mengmeng, that's enough.

335
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,320
What if it's not enough?

336
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,360
Your brother has been sick for so long.

337
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,640
Let's add more.

338
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,920
That's enough.

339
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,440
Thank you, Mengmeng.

340
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,920
Bind up for my sister.

341
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,320
I will save your brother first.

342
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,760
Does it hurt?

343
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,160
Yes.

344
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,680
Look at you.

345
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,520
You haven't changed your temper at all.

346
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,720
You've always been so competitive.

347
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,480
Tell me,

348
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
why my fourth-sister seemed so emotional

349
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,480
when I saved your brother?

350
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,240
She likes my brother.

351
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,600
Really?

352
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,320
But her temper...

353
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,920
Murong Chen,

354
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,720
you have to save your brother.

355
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,040
It's all fate.

356
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,680
You are so scheming.

357
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,240
Don't you like my scheming?

358
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,520
By the way,

359
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,600
I would like to meet your
father Murong Shuo.

360
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,480
Well...

361
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,400
I have to prepare it well,

362
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
and choose a good time to

363
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,400
bring you to visit him.

364
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,160
Why are you going too?

365
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,360
Why don't I go?

366
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,240
It's not meeting parents for marriage.

367
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,080
I...

368
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,440
I want to visit him because
I have a favor to ask.

369
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,120
Does it still hurt?

370
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,120
A little bit.

371
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,800
So naughty.

372
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,520
But I like it.

373
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,200
Your Majesty.

374
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,400
(Cang Yun Kingdom palace)
I'm here today to show you something.

375
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,700
(Murong Shuo)

376
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,080
Yu Qingzhu gave this to me
before she died.

377
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,560
It seems like that

378
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,440
it was broken once

379
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,080
and was stuck together.

380
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,160
When we had the last fight,

381
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,840
I realized that

382
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,000
she hasn't even achieved

383
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,960
the first level of the Blood Moon Power.

384
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,960
This first level is called "Heartless".

385
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,120
I think that

386
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,520
the reason she has been making

387
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,880
so much chaos in the world
for these many years

388
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,800
many years might not actually
be threatening the imperial court,

389
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,240
but making you remember her.

390
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:27,710
（Zhu）

391
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:38,210
(Zhu Shuo)

392
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,840
Are you still thinking about what
happened the other day?

393
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,680
Actually I feel scared

394
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,840
when I think about it.

395
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,000
Murong Chen,

396
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,520
how about destroying my Kung Fu?

397
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,520
I can do it but

398
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,200
aren't you going to regret?

399
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,800
Isn't it a pity?

400
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,000
It's a pity,

401
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,120
but I worry more about

402
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,760
doing something that cannot be undone

403
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,320
when I lose control one day.

404
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,800
I'm also scared that I become
the second Yu Qingzhu.

405
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,840
You are not her,

406
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,720
and you will never become her.

407
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,640
How can you be so sure?

408
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,440
There's nothing wrong
with kung fu itself.

409
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,080
The blood night-blooming cereus
has hurt so many people,

410
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,800
but ever since you had it,

411
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,960
you have helped the weak,

412
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,160
and save patients, right?

413
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,640
It's the same with Blood Moon Power.

414
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,960
As long as you have good will,

415
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,120
it will be used in the right way.

416
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,160
Really?

417
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,040
Haven't you always wanted
to become a heroine?

418
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,480
What are you trying to do?

419
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,400
Didn't you lose something?

420
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
What is it?

421
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,680
Who does this belong to?

422
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,840
It's mine.

423
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,960
Then you need to keep it well,

424
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,560
and don't lose it again.

425
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,000
Let's go.

426
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,120
Let's tell 5th prince and
9th princess.

427

428
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,880
(Mengmeng and I will help the weak,)

429
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,080
and travel around the world.)

430
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,320
(Now I leave Tian Ji Pavilion to you.)

431
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,560
(You have managed Tian Ji Pavilion
with me for these many years.)

432
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,880
(You must have known everything well.)

433
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,120
(All the branches all have
strong faith in you.)

434
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,960
(I leave the Tian Ji Pavilion to you.)

435
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,760
(Hope that you can lead it,)

436
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,720

439
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,240
Are you going to leave without
saying goodbye again?

440
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,440
I don't know how to face you all.

441
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,840
