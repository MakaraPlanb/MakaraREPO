All my thinking was in vain,

24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,960
as Xiao Ai made a good point.

25
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,080
You are here!

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,520
What's the matter?

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,560
He is always so cold.

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,160
Forget it.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,520
I will get engaged in four days.

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,880
Congratulations.

31
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,640
How come you said that.

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,960
You know I like...

33
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,080
Well, first things first.

34
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,600
I want you to help me
escape from the marriage.

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,320
I will not help you.

36
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,520
Don't refuse me in a hurry.

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,920
I am not asking you.

38
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,760
I am making a deal with you.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,440
A deal?

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,400
You help me run away from the palace.

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,680
And I will find you
the blood night-blooming cereus.

42
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,520
I know I am right.

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,680
You need the blood night-blooming cereus
for treating cold poison.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,920
Right.

45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,200
So how do you help me find
the blood night-blooming cereus?

46
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,680
I am the leading role.

47
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,240
I can definitely find it.

48
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,040
Don't worry.

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,320
I will help you find it.

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,680
Just tell me

51
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,520
deal or not?

52
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,200
Deal.

53
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,640
At midnight after three days,

54
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,840
let's meet at the
north gate of the palace.

55
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,360
All right.

56
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,320
It is a beautiful night.

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,400
Yes.

58
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,920
Your Highness.

59
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,480
Chang Kong doesn't understand

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,560
why Your Highness
is still in a good mood,

61
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,720
as 9th Princess wants
to cancel the wedding.

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,240
Look at her temper.

63
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,880
She will definitely cancel the wedding.

64
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,880
I would take her away,

65
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,320
instead of letting someone else
take her away.

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,200
But I didn't realize that

67
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,120
she is smarter than I thought.

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,840
She used the blood night-blooming cereus
to make a deal with me.

69
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,640
No wonder I am in love with her.

70
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,440
Does 9th princess know everything?

71
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,400
Yes, but not all.

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,040
One thing I don't understand.

73
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,760
What's up?

74
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,680
She was so confident
about finding the cereus.

75
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
We were together all the time.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,400
And we shared the same clues.

77
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,040
Did I miss something?

78
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,960
Your Highness.

79
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,840
You have seen this account book

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,840
for several times?

81
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,920
I must take the wrong way.

82
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,680
The key doesn't lie in the entries.

83
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,640
But the characters.

84
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,560
The characters?

85
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,160
Chang Kong.

86
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,520
Fetch me a scissor.

87
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,720
OK.

88
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,000
(Egret Villa)

89
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,520
(Egret Villa)

90
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,800
That's it.

91
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,880
I even mocked her handwriting before.

92
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,360
Your Highness.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,800
What's the matter?

94
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,000
If I don't make it wrong,

95
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,480
in order to hide the secrets,

96
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,120
Egret Villa's accountant

97
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,520
wrote with a magic pen.

98
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,800
On one side, the ink appears as normal;

99
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,880
On the other,

100
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,600
the ink disappears after a while.

101
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,480
When they were writing,

102
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,640
they reversed the pen.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,720
Then without a trace,

104
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,080
one buyer became three ones,

105
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,080
and their purchases were dispersed.

106
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,400
I am sending someone
to inspect Egret Villa right now.

107
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,640
Wait!

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,520
People in Egret Villa aren't
ordinary ones.

109
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,880
They even deceived me.

110
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,680
Tian Ji Pavilion can

111
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,760
only find what they want us to know.

112
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,280
Your Highness, you mean?

113
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,720
I will go by myself.

114
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,480
Just take it.

115
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,840
This is the aloe vera honey facial mask.

116
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,000
And this is the almond facial mask.

117
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,200
These are ingredients.

118
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Listen to me.

119
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,040
A woman should take care of her skin
as early as possible.

120
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,400
It becomes too late after the age of 25.

121
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,720
A Liang.

122
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,520
Just take it.

123
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,400
I made Werewolf cards by myself.

124
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,920
I think,

125
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,480
in this palace,

126
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,160
you are the most gifted player.

127
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,160
Keep going!

128
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,360
Hope you can promote this great game.

129
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,240
A Liang will never fail you.

130
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,280
Well,

131
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,480
it is late.

132
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,000
It's time to sleep.

133
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,880
Well,

134
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,920
A Liang will leave.

135
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Good night.

136
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,720
Xiao Ai.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,920
Go to sleep.

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,080
Why are you crying?

139
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,920
You will leave soon.

140
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,040
How did you know?

141
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,440
What you said

142
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,160
can cheat A Liang.

143
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,680
instead of me.

144
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,960
You are not sending gifts to us.

145
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
You are

146
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,680
bidding farewell to us.

147
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,080
(Xiao Ai,)

148
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,720
(why can't you play your lovely role?)

149
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,760
(How come you are being so smart?)

150
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,680
Xiao Ai knows clearly that

151
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,760
Your Highness will leave soon or later.

152
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,880
But...

153
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,400
But when you suffered a memory loss,

154
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,880
I thought you forgot about it.

155
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,600
But you didn't.

156
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,520
(What a plot!)

157
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,880
It seems you can't remember anything.

158
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,480
But,

159
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,760
your personality didn't change.

160
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,880
You are still stingy,

161
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
fooling around,

162
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,440
and keeping the same habit
of saving money.

163
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,640
Do you have to be so straightforward?

164
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,400
(Since you know I am about to leave,)

165
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,920
(then I...)

166
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,280
Then leave!

167
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,160
In my heart,

168
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Your Highness is the most
important person.

169
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,400
And Xiao Ai hopes Your Highness

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,120
can find true love.

171
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,760
Xiao Ai.

172
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,360
Until now, I truly know that

173
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,440
you are the one who cares
most about me in the game,

174
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,640
and the one I trust most.

175
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,920
Your Highness!

176
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,360
No!

177
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,800
If you let me go,

178
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,680
what about you?

179
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,640
At most, they would beat me up.

180
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,600
Well.

181
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,200
Well.

182
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,320
How about going with me?

183
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,680
Alright.

184
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
But,

185
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,840
we have to steal

186
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,000
- another suit of A Liang's clothes.
- Alright.

187
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,320
We will soon get to
the north gate of the palace.

188
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,440
Who are you?

189
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,640
Who are you?

190
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,600
Damn!

191
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,720
Palace patrols.

192
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,440
What's the matter?

193
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,560
There are two eunuchs acting stealthy.

194
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,000
I suspected that they took something

195
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,560
out of the Palace.

196
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,440
I know them.

197
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,960
Their father is ill.

198
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,120
Life is at stake.

199
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
General permitted them
to leave the Palace tonight.

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,480
This is his permission.

201
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,360
(Their father is badly ill and they are
allowed to go home to take care of him.)

202
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,200
It was a mistake.

203
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,800
Take you time.

204
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,920
9th Princess.

205
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,920
You are Song Che's guard？

206
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,920
Yes.

207
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,200
General gave you these.

208
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,920
He said that it was conspicuous to

209
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,480
wear eunuch suits outside.

210
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,440
I have done what he said.

211
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,520
I am leaving now.

212
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,840
Thank you.

213
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,360
Though Song Che refused to help us,

214
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,080
he still did.

215
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,960
Let's go.

216
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,960
General Song.

217
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,800
I wandered over here.

218
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,200
Mengmeng.

219
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,960
Can you see

220
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,920
it rains heavily when you leave?

221
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,600
Forgive me I can't send you off.

222
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,760
I am afraid,

223
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,320
once I see you,

224
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,520
I can't let you go.

225
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,720
By using skills

226
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,760
instead of inner strength,

227
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,240
you are looking down upon me.

228
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,040
Mengmeng!

229
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,160
(Northern Gate of Palace)

230
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,880
Your Highness.

231
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,320
It is already midnight.

232
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,040
Where is Yun Ya?

233
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,400
(What is the plot?)

234
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,640
(Trick of missing the appointment?)

235
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,960
It will never happen.

236
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,600
Be patient.

237
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,760
Damn!

238
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,520
I have cold poison attack again.

239
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,000
No!

240
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Mengmeng is waiting for me.

241
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,000
Mengmeng.

242
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,120
Why are you here?

243
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,920
It isn't safe in the palace.

244
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,880
So you are sending us off?

245
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,280
I…

246
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,800
I leave with you.

247
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,880
You may leave the palace,

248
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,280
but you can't leave the city.

249
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,640
No one knows the city

250
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,240
better than me, be it every corner

251
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,360
or every checkpoint.

252
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,520
In the past,

253
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,520
I followed the command

254
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,160
of Her Majesty and my father.

255
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Now I want to rely on my own.

256
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,640
You are ambitious.

257
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,360
(He is not here now.)

258
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,560
(I guess he will never come.)

259
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,480
So let's go.

260
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,520
Alright.

261
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,480
Let's go.

262
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,600
Your Highness.

263
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,080
Why are you here?

264
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,600
I didn't see Your Highness
at the appointed place.

265
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,160
I am worried about you.

266
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,080
So here I am.

267
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,600
Your Highness.

268
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,560
You have cold poison attack again?

269
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,080
I am fine.

270
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,520
Song Che suddenly appeared.

271
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,680
He was a tough opponent.

272
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,160
I had to use

273
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,600
my inner strength.

274
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,760
What about 9th Princess?

275
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,600
She left with Song Che.

276
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,200
So what shall we do now?

277
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,880
There is a change.

278
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,880
We can only bid farewell to the Queen.

279
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,800
You said that Jiang Mengmeng

280
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,520
escaped from marriage with Song Che?

281
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,440
Yes.

282
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,960
Terrific.

283
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,360
I worked so hard

284
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,080
to stop them from getting married.

285
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,680
But she fled the palace.

286
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,840
Now Murong Chen

287
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,880
belongs to me.

288
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,040
But...

289
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,200
But what?

290
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,840
5th Prince left as well.

291
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,800
What?

292
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,200
Sister queen.

293
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,160
4th Princess.

294
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,120
- 4th Princess!
- Go away.

295
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,640
You can't break in, 4th princess.

296
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,160
Sister queen.

297
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Sisi,

298
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,840
why are you

299
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,080
so mad this morning?

300
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,280
Let's apply this

301
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,840
aloe vera honey facial mask together.

302
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,240
9th Princess has left.

303
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,600
And you are still
caring about the facial mask.

304
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,520
All of you can leave now.

305
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,720
You don't worry about 9th Princess.

306
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,680
I...

307
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,080
Calm down.

308
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,240
Mengmeng and 5th Prince
will take a tour before the wedding.

309
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,480
Tour before the wedding?

310
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,520
I know my sister.

311
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,240
She will not be tamed

312
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,880
until she sees the outside world.

313
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,920
Your Majesty.

314
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,800
I request to bring back 9th Princess.

315
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,960
What if you couldn't make it?

316
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,520
If I don't bring her back,

317
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,280
I won't dare to marry her.

318
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
You are a determined,

319
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,920
and courageous person,

320
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,040
with the royal demeanour of Cang Yun!

321
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,640
Your Majesty.

322
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,000
I will protect 9th Princess

323
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,400
from any danger.

324
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,840
And

325
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,360
when I leave,

326
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,760
4th Princess can calm down.

327
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,480
Please allow me, Your Majesty.

328
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,840
I leave Mengmeng to you.

329
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,320
Young people are really full of ideas.

330
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,400
Far from our reach.

331
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,480
Sister queen,

332
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,200
why do you let them go?

333
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,200
It does not matter.

334
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,960
Our parents let us go as well.

335
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,640
It is different.

336
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,160
Sister queen, you are being partial.

337
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,440
No matter how 9th Princess acts up,

338
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,840
you always spoil her.

339
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,720
I raised

340
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,640
all of you.

341
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,320
I should be fair with each of you.

342
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,720
But do you know

343
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,920
why I favor 9th Princess?

344
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,680
Yes, I know.

345
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,520
When our Mother suddenly passed away,

346
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,320
you inherited the crown.

347
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,560
When 9th Princess
dropped into the river that year,

348
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,040
you blamed yourself
for being devoted to the work

349
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
and neglecting her.

350
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,120
Thus you felt guilty,

351
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,440
and wanted to compensate her.

352
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,240
I want to ask you one more question.

353
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,920
Do you want to be someone like Mengmeng,

354
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,440
or someone like me?

355
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,480
Of course, I take pride in sister queen.

356
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,960
I want to be someone like you.

357
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,520
Good.

358
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,440
Sisi,

359
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,880
I am aware of

360
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,160
what you are up to.

361
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,400
But you have to give up

362
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,000
something

363
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
in life.

364
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,800
I have no descendants.

365
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,800
So I will pass the crown down

366
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,680
to either you or Mengmeng.

367
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,840
She isn't interest in power and fame.

368
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,240
She only wants a happy life.

369
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,200
But you are different.

370
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,320
You are my hope,

371
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,440
the future of the Ruo Shui kingdom.

372
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,480
So you have to

373
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,400
give up something.

374
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,040
Sisi understands that.

375
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,640
I am being too capricious.

376
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,680
It's good you can understand me.

377
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,800
Think about it.

378
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,600
There are plenty more fish in the sea!

379
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,360
Next year you still have the chance.

380
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,360
Or the year after next.

381
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,480
I will find someone better for you.

382
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,880
A man who bears the
whole country in mind.

383
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,920
A man versed in both
literature and military affairs.

384
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,120
A man that shares the
same future with you.

385
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
Thanks, sister queen.

386
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,400
I understand.

387
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,050
(The Imperial City to Qing Luo Town)

388
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,800
(Finally in a new map.)

389
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,930
(Qing Luo Town)

390
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,680
Do you find it strange that

391
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,240
there are so few pedestrians

392
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,360
in daylight?

393
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,800
And each of them is in a hurry.

394
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,480
I find it a little strange.

395
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,760
But Your Highness.

396
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,320
What should you call me outside?

397
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,240
Childe.

398
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,520
Right.

399
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,800
What did you want to say?

400
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
I wanted to say

401
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,280
it is so late.

402
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,240
Maybe everyone is going home for dinner.

403
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,080
Look, there is an inn.

404
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,760
I'll check out if they have empty rooms.

405
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,800
You stay here.

406
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,560
Don't run about.

407
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,960
Ok, you can go.

408
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,400
Let's go, Da Huang.

409
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,320
Now it is two of us.

410
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,400
Xiao Mei.

411
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,520
I finally find you.

412
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,160
- Come home with me.
- I...

413
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,280
Wait! What are you doing?

414
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,120
Do you find the wrong person?

415
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,240
You are my daughter.

416
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,120
My husband, I found...

417
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,560
- My wife.
- I found Xiao Mei.

418
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,360
I found Xiao Mei.

419
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,400
You come home with me now.

420
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,320
Wake up, you find the wrong person.

421
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,400
Sir, what is the matter?

422
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,120
The only daughter in my family,

423
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,920
Xiao Mei has disappeared lately.

424
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,680
My wife missed her daughter so much

425
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,200
that she lost her mind.

426
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,680
She calls everyone her daughter.

427
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,920
These days she has been seriously ill.

428
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,400
She can't even distinguish the gender.

429
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,960
Did you request help from the officials?

430
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,560
To tell you the truth,

431
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,720
this month,

432
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,680
in Qing Luo Town,

433
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,080
fifteen girls have disappeared

434
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,600
without a clue.

435
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,120
Even the officials can't find them.

436
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,800
Fifteen girls!

437
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,840
You are lucky

438
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,440
as you are men.

439
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,640
Yes, we are lucky.

440
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,080
Sorry for our offence.

441
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,400
Please forgive us.

442
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,480
- I understand.
- We will leave.

443
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,720
- Excuse me.
- We will leave.

444
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,000
Well, my wife.

445
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,720
Let's go.

446
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,880
Hope you can find your daughter.

447
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,720
Xiao Ai, I still feel strange
about this place.

448
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,720
I am a little afraid that

449
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,880
someone is following us.

450
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,880
Stay close. Don't turn around.

451
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,960
Let's go.

452
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,560
(Yi Chun Tavern)
Innkeeper.

453
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,720
Two decent rooms.

454
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,120
You are lucky.

455
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,240
We happen to have two rooms available.

456
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,920
Really?

457
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,520
How many of you will check in?

458
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,560
Three.

459
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
Two friends and I.

460
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,800
Please wait for a moment.

461
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,320
Where are they?

462
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,280
Childe,

463
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,000
how come there is

464
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,200
a stick in the package?

465
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
You'll need some weapon

466
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,000
when you are in the outside world.

467
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,560
You always fall for me.

468
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,960
Fall for you?

469
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,680
I was so scared of you.

470
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,960
Tell me

471
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,960
why you are following us.

472
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,520
To have a talk.

473
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,680
Who are you?

474
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,080
You want to return to Cang Yun kingdom?

475
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,680
Yes.

476
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,760
9th Princess escaped from the marriage.

477
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,640
I am an abandoned husband.
What else can I do?

478
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,680
You are not here to bring back Mengmeng?

479
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,480
If I want to bring her back,

480
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,640
will there only be Chang Kong and me?

481
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,840
That makes sense.

482
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,160
Well,

483
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,800
nothing serious now.

484
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,760
How about we split up?

485
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,160
Mind our own business. Right?

486
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,440
Wait!

487
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,360
What's the matter?

488
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,960
You are the 9th Princess
of Ruo Shui kingdom.

489
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,560
Why are you so irresponsible?

490
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,240
That day I was...

491
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,360
That day I was not intentional.

492
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,560
And,

493
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,040
we drank a lot.

494
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,080
Being so drunk,

495
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,040
we couldn't do anything.

496
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,600
That day...

497
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,160
That day...

498
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,000
I didn't mean it that day.

499
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
I wanted to say

500
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,560
you should be responsible for me.

501
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,000
Send me home.

502
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,280
Send you home?

503
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,080
Send you home!

504
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,360
So you agree?

505
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,720
You are setting me up.

506
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,160
I am sincere.

507
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,360
Think about it.

508
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,600
I travelled a long way
to Ruo Shui kingdom for matchmaking.

509
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,360
Everyone knew
I was the future 9th royal son-in-law.

510
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,560
But you escaped from the marriage.

511
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,920
If I returned home by myself,

512
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,560
it would be awkward for me.

513
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,000
Even if I get engaged
in the future,

514
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,360
everyone will laugh at me.

515
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,840
So,

516
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,040
you should be responsible for me.

517
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,720
Send me back to Cang Yun kingdom.

518
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,040
And take back your invitation.

519
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,760
Then we will officially break up.

520
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,840
In the future,

521
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,160
let's take care of our own marriage.

522
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,800
Do you think so?

523
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,480
Of course.

524
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,760
I figured it out that

525
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,200
I won't force you to marry me.

526
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,000
I won't force you.

527
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,360
Jiang Mengmeng,

528
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,480
I give up on you.

529
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,360
(When he said he gives up on me,)

530
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,200
(I felt a little bit sad.)

531
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,640
What?

532
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,760
You don't want me to give up on you?

533
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Don't be a narcissist.

534
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,280
I even want to celebrate.

535
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,480
Then everything is fine.

536
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,360
We can be relieved.

537
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
Murong Chen.

538
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,200
A handsome man.

539
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,640
In term of the appearance,
family, and talent,

540
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,000
I am outstanding!

541
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,800
Why should I always

542
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,480
like you?

543
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
(That is to say...)

544
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,640
(Right.)

545
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,680
(Just because I play the leading role,)

546
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,720
(I thought I didn't have to choose him.)

547
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,560
(But he had to like me.)

548
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,040
(That's right. It must be like that.)

549
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,480
Murong Chen,

550
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,960
you should behave like this earlier.

551
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,160
I would be the nice guy

552
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,120
to send you up to Hea...

553
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,160
to send you back home.

554
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,560
That's a deal.

555
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,120
(If he goes back to Cang Yun kingdom,)

556
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,840
(he will go with Mengmeng)

557
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,880
(day and night.)

558
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,720
Objection!

559
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,480
Overruled. Overruled.

560
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,440
(Damn)

561
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,520
(I ignored these two.)

562
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,720
It is late.

563
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,320
Let's check out the rooms.

564
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,200
Right.

565
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,760
Xiao Ai.

566
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,640
- They two.
- We will pay the bill.

567
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,080
Stop watching. Let's go.

568
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,120
I know that

569
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,920
you break up with Mengmeng

570
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,200
as an excuse for stalling.

571
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,840
You still like her.

572
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,280
It is the same with you.

573
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,200
You stay close to her as a friend.

574
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,640
In fact, you
retreat in order to advance.

575
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,760
You also like her!

576
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,360
Don't worry.

577
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,160
I will send you back to Cang Yun kingdom

578
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,520
safe and sound.

579
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,600
Thank you.

580
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,280
Stop!

581
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,840
What are you doing?

582
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,760
I am

583
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,920
admiring the moon.

584
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
How come you

585
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,080
admire the moon on a cloudy night?

586
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,400
Stop it. Let's go.

587
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,120
What?

588
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
Only one room is available?

589
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,800
Two rooms were available
in the afternoon.

590
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,080
When you were away,

591
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,320
one room had been booked.

592
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,640
Someone here is

593
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,240
unreliable.

594
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,880
If you didn't come to mess up,

595
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,720
I couldn't miss the booking.

596
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,400
Well,

597
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
I can share the room with Mengmeng.

598
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,680
You find your own place.

599
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,280
I...

600
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,360
Stop!

601
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,600
It is all about a room.

602
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,800
The room isn't available in this inn.

603
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,920
- We can find another one.
- Let's go.

604
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,160
There's no need!

605
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,480
Qing Luo Town is a small place.

606
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,680
At this time,

607
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,080
the room isn't available in all inns.

608
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
If you don't make your decision,

609
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,720
you will miss the last room.

610
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,880
(Another trick of one room left)

611
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,120
How about this?

612
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,560
Our common room has two beds.

613
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,960
You two can sleep there.

614
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,600
And you three share the
last decent room.

615
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,680
No!

616
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,240
You are three men.

617
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,720
What is the matter?

618
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,560
I mean the room is too small.

619
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,400
Yes.

620
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,760
Well then,

621
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,640
waiter,

622
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,360
place another bed in their room.

623
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,120
Let's go to sleep.

624
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,520
You.

625
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,600
Sleep over there.

626
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,800
Mengmeng, let's go.

627
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,800
Why?

628
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,760
Because we grow up together.

629
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,280
We slept together since we were kids.

630
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,480
Are you saying I haven't slept with her?

631
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,320
Mengmeng and I are still a couple.

632
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,840
I am entitled to sleep with her.

633
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,640
Mengmeng, let's go.

634
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,720
You will break up.

635
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,120
If you sleep with her,
you will ruin her reputation.

636
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,280
You are a healthy bachelor.

637
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,120
If you sleep with her,

638
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,600
you will not ruin her reputation?

639
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,480
Stop!

640
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,400
Both of you want to sleep with me?

641
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,440
Yes.

642
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,120
How about you sleep together?

643
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,480
Is the bed small for you?

644
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,520
A small bed is never comfortable.

645
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,920
But we are rough men.

646
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,080
We can put up with
inconveniences tonight.

647
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,840
No big deal.

648
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,120
I am rough?

649
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,960
I am not rough as you!

650
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,880
Are you rough or not?

651
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,600
I am rough.

652
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,160
Mengmeng, just go to sleep.

653
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,400
I can put up with
inconveniences tonight.

654
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,360
Alright.

655
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,920
Stay away.

656
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,640
Give me that.

657
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,920
No.

658
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,120
Give me.

659
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,800
- No!
- Give me!

660
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,200
No means no.

661
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,400
There isn't enough room for me.

662
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,800
And you want to take the quilt.

663
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,080
You can only blame
yourself for being thin.

664
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,320
Just take it.

665
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,480
Don't you dare wake up Mengmeng.

666
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,400
No. I said No.

667
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,440
No.

668
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,440
No.

669
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,200
Earthquake?

670
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,920
Why are you so passionate?

671
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,440
I want...

672
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,400
What do you want?

673
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,080
I want to ask you if it is too crowded.

674
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,600
Yes.

675
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,840
I.

676
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,240
I'd rather sleep outside.

677
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,000
Breakfast is ready.

678
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,160
You guys are good.

679
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,640
You didn't sleep at all,

680
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,720
and you owe the inn one bed.

681
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
Well, just eat something.

682
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,520
Save some food
for Xiao Ai and Chang Kong.

683
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,280
Did you hear that?

684
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,680
Last night, another girl disappeared.

685
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,760
Again?

686
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,160
And,

687
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,360
she disappeared in this inn.

688
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,520
For real?

689
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,560
So weird.

690
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,560
Now all the girls of this town

691
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,920
have been sent away for safety.

692
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,560
I think the criminal

693
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,960
must keep an eye on the girls
from the outside.

694
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,480
I am full. Let's go.

695
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,600
Well, where are Xiao Ai and Chang Kong?

696
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,840
Xiao Ai disappeared.

697
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,720
