(The Auction)

25
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,920
Friend.

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,120
May I ask

27
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,680
what will be auctioned today

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,040
as there are so many people?

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,080
I heard of something rare and precious

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,520
named...a kind of flower.

31
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,920
Blood night-blooming cereus

32
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,440
Right, that's it.

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,440
I come to the right place.

34
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,640
Two rows of people beside here

35
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,080
seem to be the officials.

36
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,080
Governor Ye is in charge of

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,840
the security of the auction.

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,560
The security reaches top level.

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,880
No more talks.

40
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,600
It's last day for the sign-up.

41
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
I am in a hurry for it.

42
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,160
- Alright.
- I am leaving now.

43
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,400
Thanks...

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,120
Listen,

45
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,400
the officials never interfere
with the world.

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,640
Yet this Governor Ye

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,760
is in charge of the security.

48
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,920
It means the auction won't be peaceful.

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,920
It doesn't matter.

50
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's sign up.

51
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,280
Come on.

52
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,960

We live here tonight?

55
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,040
You don't like it?

56
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,760
No.

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,840
I like it.

58
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,800
But for a house with such a big yard,

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,040
how much does it cost?

60
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,160
Free.

61
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,520
Free?

62
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,640
You regard it as your home?

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,000
Childe Murong.

64
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,280
Please check it out.

66
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,640
The house belongs to you from now on.

67
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,680
Then I'll just leave.

68
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,840
I am leaving now.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
Now it's free.

70
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,440
Murong Chen,

71
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,600
you bought this place?

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,600
Yes.

73
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,720
Why?

74
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,720
How much is it?
You are wasting money.

75
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,920
Well, well. Murong Chen.

76
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,280
How about it?

77
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,720
This is much better than Egret Villa.

78
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Of course.

79
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,080
So ostentatious.

80
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,880
Then don't touch.

81
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,760
I was short of money
in the world before.

82
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,200
Now that we are here
in Cang Yun Kingdom,

83
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,000
I should provide you with the best.

84
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,400
From now on, I will pay all
expenses of everyone,

85
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,680
except for Song Che.

86
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,880
I...

87
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,960
Right, you shall keep

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
the auction ticket properly.

89
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,840
It's for You.

90
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,440
Auction ticket?

91
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,760
It's for Chang Kong.

92
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,680
Keep it properly.

93
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,200
Or you can't attend the auction.

94
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,720
Well,

95
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,560
when I was signing up,

96
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,640
I heard that the security is tight.

97
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,040
And there is a body check.

98
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,240
Body check?

99
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,160
Why?

100
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,440
It is about the
blood night-blooming cereus.

101
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,440
They fear that someone may attend
the auction in disguise.

102
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,680
In disguise?

103
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,880
Well.

104
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,880
Zhe Xiang, Xiao Ai,

105
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,720
how about we go for a walk

106
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
after the dinner?

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,880
It is so boring.

108
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,080
I want to stay here.

109
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,600
Stand up.

110
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,080
Who ask you to sit?

111
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,880
This is mine.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,480
Hui County is a small place,

113
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,840
but there are a lot of

114
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,480
interesting places and delicious food.

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,800
Here's for you.

116
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,640
So generous.

117
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,560
That's my pleasure.

118
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,560
This is the power of money.

119
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,920
So cocky!

120
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,320
Come on, I'll show you around.

121
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,140
(Clothing Store)

122
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,760
Look at this one.

123
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,240
Zhe Xiang.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,880
You can choose one suit.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,720
No, thanks.

126
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,760
Enjoy yourselves.

127
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,960
I am fine with this one.

128
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,840
No way.

129
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,080
I think this one suits you.

130
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,280
Follow me.

131
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,000
So beautiful.

132
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,040
Not bad.

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,800
Zhe Xiang,

134
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,840
you look terrific.

135
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,520
I picked this suit for her.

136
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,640
But I don't find it fit.

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,440
It fits.

138
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,120
It fits very well.

139
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,640
We want this one.

140
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Yes.

141
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,360
But I find it a little strange.

142
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,280
You always dress like a heroine.

143
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,800
This one fits you.

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,920
Look at yourself.

145
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,040
It's perfect.

146
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,200
Yes, lady.

147
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,880
You look great in this suit.

148
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,280
You are elegant,

149
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,280
charming,

150
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,600
and delicate,

151
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,120
with the golden ratio.

152
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,480
No one looks better

153
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,840
than you in this suit.

154
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,000
The owner is so good at compliments,

155
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,320
though it's true.

156
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,280
But if I am in this,

157
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,720
how can I fight?

158
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,280
Zhe Xiang,

159
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,320
how come you think of
fighting every day?

160
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,720
Tomorrow we will attend an auction,

161
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,360
instead of a competition
in martial arts skills.

162
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,480
You're right.

163
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,560
Check out, please.

164
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,000
Here is for you.

165
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,280
- Let's go.
- Wait.

166
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
Well, I'm in a hurry.
I am leaving now.

167
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,880
Are you still mad about
the matter of this morning?

168
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,080
Are you...?

169
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,760
You remember me.

170
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,680
You mentioned it.

171
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,080
I know,

172
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,040
it was Fei'er's fault.

173
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,240
She offended you,

174
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,120
and you should be angry.

175
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,720
How about

176
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,560
I invite you to dinner?

177
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,000
And I apologize to you on behalf of her.

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,080
Well, we have to refuse.

179
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,200
We are busy.

180
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,520
We will leave now.

181
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,120
Wait, please.

182
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,880
Ladies.

183
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,600
Ladies, wait.

184
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,000
Come on, let's go.

185
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,880
Ladies, wait.

186
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,440
- Song Che.
- Mengmeng.

187
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,440
- Why are you here?
- To pick you up.

188
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,960
Great.

189
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,400
What's wrong?

190
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,760
Sand in your eye?

191
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,760
What sand?

192
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,440
A weirdo is following us.

193
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,520
Hello.

194
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,040
What do you want?

195
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,720
What do I want?

196
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,040
Kill you!

197
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,880
Song Che.

198
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,240
Well,

199
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:05,880
are you

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,680
amazed by the beauty of Zhe Xiang?

201
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,200
Mengmeng.

202
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,120
What...

203
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,160
what are you talking about?

204
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,120
As you dress like this,

205
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,600
you can't even fight.

206
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,920
Zhe Xiang!

207
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,600
What is wrong with you?

208
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,800
Dumbhead!

209
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,840
What's wrong with me?

210
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
I got it.

211
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,560
The boys in their puberty

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,440
don't speak the truth.

213
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,920
They just piss the girls they like off.

214
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
No, I am not.

215
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,880
Mengmeng,

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,800
trust me.

217
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,240
I swear to God,

218
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,080
I love Mengmeng only.

219
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,840
Really?

220
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,440
Men!

221
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,360
Let's go.

222
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,760
Mengmeng,

223
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,840
listen to me.

224
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,920
I...

225
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,280
I can't...

226
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,200
Xiao Ai, Xiao Ai,

227
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,080
you believe me.

228
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,120
You stay outside all day.

229
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,720
I asked you to wash the clothes.

230
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,280
(Maid Wang)
Look at the pile of clothes.

231
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,880
(Ye Ling’er)
If the Mistress knows,

232
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,600
she will kill you alive.

233
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,200
Mistress! Mistress and I

234
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,520
have the same surname.

235
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,600
Why is she the Mistress,

236
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,800
while I am only a servant?

237
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,640
The Mistress comes from a noble family.

238
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,640
Who are you?

239
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,800
I have to punish you today,

240
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,280
or you don't know who you are at all.

241
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,880
Wash the clothes.

242
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,840
Just do it.

243
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,560
Quickly.

244
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,800
I'll do it.

245
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,880
- I'll do it.
- Do it, quickly.

246
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,800
Poor girl.

247
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,400
Who are you?

248
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,760
How did you get in?

249
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,720
That is none of your business.

250
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,680
But don't be afraid.

251
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,640
I am here to help you.

252
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,640
Don't you want to get back

253
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,120
everything that has belonged to you?

254
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,520
Me?

255
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,800
(The Ticket)
Row 14.

256
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,240
I am in the back,

257
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,920
and I barely see anything.

258
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,040
We signed up late.

259
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,280
It is lucky we can still have a seat.

260
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,160
8th Prince?

261
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,800
Is that 8th Prince?

262
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,640
Oh, no!

263
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,520
Will he take me back?

264
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,480
8th Prince, it's you.

265
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,480
Mengmeng.

266
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,480
Why are you here?

267
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,640
Why are you here?

268
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,320
You have disappeared
for more than half a year.

269
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,000
Where have you been?
You vanished without a trace.

270
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,240
Everyone misses you. Do you know?

271
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,800
I miss you, too.

272
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,040
Well,

273
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,800
after the auction completes,

274
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,240
let's come back to the palace together.

275
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
By the way, 8th Prince,

276
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,240
why are you here?

277
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,680
I come here on behalf of sister queen.

278
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,560
She received an invitation

279
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,800
for this auction.

280
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,720
But she is busy with work,

281
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,760
she can't leave the palace.

282
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,240
So here I am.

283
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,400
Sister queen wants blood
night-blooming cereus as well?

284
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,760
Well,

285
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,240
you also want it?

286
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,920
I just check it out.

287
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,960
Check it out.

288
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,640
It's easy.

289
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,400
I will buy it.

290
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,760
Then I'll give it to you.

291
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,720
Really?

292
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,280
What about Sister Queen?

293
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,600
Dear sister,

294
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
I will get everything for you

295
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,560
as long as you want.

296
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,520
As for Sister Queen,

297
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,760
I'll just tell a lie.

298
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,280
Hooray!

299
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,320
5th Prince.

300
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Song Che.

301
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,720
Your Highness.

302
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,960
Why are you here?

303
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,680
We...

304
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,000
You three...

305
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,960
8th Prince,
we happened to meet each other.

306
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes, that's it.

307
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,920
Well, 8th Prince,

308
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,800
let me introduce

309
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,280
a new friend

310
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,680
named Zhe Xiang.

311
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,680
Well, Mengmeng,

312
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,280
you stay here with me.

313
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,280
But there are many of us.

314
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,000
I reserved

315
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,120
all the VIP seats.

316
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,800
Sit wherever you want.

317
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,400
Thank you, 8th Prince.

318
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,440
Thanks.

319
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,040
- Thanks.
- Take your seats.

320
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,520
Lu Feibai, why are you here?

321
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,880
Sang Luo, Xi Qing,

322
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,320
uncle,

323
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,160
Jin Hua and Yin Hua,

324
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,600
why are all of you here?

325
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,840
9th Princess,

326
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,120
we received the invitation as well.

327
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
- We are here to check it out.
- Yes.

328
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,400
I am here to have a look

329
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,440
at the real blood night-blooming cereus.

330
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,640
He and I are here

331
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
to find a treatment for his eyes.

332
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,320
Sorry, Mengmeng,

333
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,920
I didn't know blood night-blooming
cereus was fake before,

334
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,320
and I sent it to you.

335
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,040
It's alright. Just forget it.

336
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,240
It turns out

337
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,560
you sent her fake
blood night-blooming cereus.

338
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,120
Who are you?

339
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,200
You were the Fox Man

340
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,040
who wanted to assassinate and rob me.

341
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,880
Rob?

342
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,720
Fox Man?

343
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,480
Not me.

344
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,920
It's a mistake.

345
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,000
It's you.

346
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,080
I...

347
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Mengmeng.

348
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,000
Mengmeng, let's deal with him later.

349
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,680
Take your seat.

350
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,080
Just sit.

351
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,440
The auction starts now.

352
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,640
Yeah!

353
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,040
Here we have the seller
and the item that is auctioned.

354
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,640
Yeah.

355
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,720
Let's welcome Mr. Xi.

356
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,080
Yeah.

357
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,240
This outfit.

358
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,760
Is it Mr. Xi?

359
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,100
(Mr. Xi)

360
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,240
Blood night-blooming cereus.

361
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,200
(The thing my master wants.)

362
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,000
Blood night-blooming cereus.

363
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,000
- It is the real cereus.
- Mengmeng.

364
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,560
It seems you really like the cereus.

365
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,800
- The real cereus.
- It's real.

366
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,720
Your eyes can be cured.

367
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,800
The auction begins.

368
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,840
Opening bid.

369
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,480

Five hundred Liang.

377
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,280
Murong Chen, are you insane?

378
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,680
Such a high bid!

379
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,200
Six hundred Liang.

380
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,720
Raise up.

Eight hundred Liang.

382
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,160
Are you playing against me?

383
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,880
For one more bid,

384
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,160
it is yours.

385
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,040
You...

386
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,400
Beat him up!

387
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,080
Go!

388
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:03,920
Beat him up!

389
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,400
I know you do it for me,

390
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,480
but the bid

391
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,840
is not worthy.

392
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,080
One thousand Liang.

393
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,280
8th Prince,

394
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,600
why do you...?

395
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,160
I said that

396
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,840
I would help you bid for the cereus.

397
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,160
- But...
- One thousand and five hundred Liang.

398
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,920
- Murong Chen.
- Two thousand Liang.

399
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,160
Why are you against each other?

400
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,720
Three thousand Liang.

401
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,200
I beg you two.

402
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,240
- Stop raising.
- Three thousand and five hundred Liang.

403
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,280
Too expensive.

404
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,440
- Don't worry.
- Don't worry.

405
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,960
- I am rich.
- I am rich.

406
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,000
Five thousand Liang.

407
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
8th Prince.

408
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,160
Either of you can stop now.

409
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,560
- Why...?
- Six...

410
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,400
Stop, please.

411
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,880
I know you are rich,

412
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,520
but have you ever thought

413
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,200
this cereus may be fake as well?

414
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,400
Be it real or fake,

415
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,480
it will never be auctioned. Don't worry.

416
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,880
Why?

417
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,000
Six thousand Liang.

418
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,280
What's up?

419
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,480
Six thousand Liang.

420
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,080
I can't afford six thousand Liang.

421
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,200
I dare to buy it.

422
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,880
Do you dare to sell it, Mr. Xi?

423
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,560
No.

424
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,800
I mean Lu Feibai.

425
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,440
Morong Chen,

426
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,400
that's nonsense.

427
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,960
Lu Feibai sits there.

428
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,760
Murong Chen, that's enough.

429
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,240
He is not Lu Feibai.

430
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
What's the matter?

431
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,840
Lu Feibai is
the master of counterfeiting.

432
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,640
Everybody knows that

433
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,760
the cereus can be fake,

434
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,480
and so is the man.

435
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,560
That is to say

436
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,400
the real cereus and the fake one

437
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,280
are both made by him.

438
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,880
Mr. Xi,

439
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,080
please take off your veil.

440
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,040
Let's check out

441
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,520
if you are Lu Feibai or not?

442
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

443
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,040
Yes, are you Lu Feibai or not?

444
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,800
Take it off.

445
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,800
Take it off.

446
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,520
Show yourself.

447
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,920
He is Lu Feibai!

448
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,240
He is Lu Feibai!

449
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,320
He is!

450
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
I want to know

451
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,840
how you recognized me.

452
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,640
A forty-year-old man

453
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,600
can't have delicate hands.

454
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,400
The forever young Xi Qing

455
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,840
can't even make it.

456
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,480
Twenty years have passed,

457
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,000
but Xi Qing keeps the same appearance.

458
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,680
Yet his hands are no longer delicate.

459
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,480
It's true.

460
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,840
The devil is in details.

461
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,720
However,

462
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,720
I have a question.

463
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,000
No one can find blood
night-blooming cereus in the world.

464
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,720
How did he find it?

465
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,160
He didn't have to.

466
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,800
Do you remember

467
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,280
the story I told you at Egret Villa?

468
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,440
Cereus Villa?

469
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,120
As is known to all,

470
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,960
eleven years ago,

471
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,640
Cereus Villa was destroyed.

472
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,080
The master of Jing Yue Sect,

473
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,320
Yu Qingzhu took away
blood night-blooming cereus.

474
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,280
After a year, it was stolen again.

475
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,320
Nowhere to find it.

476
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,400
There are numerous legends.

477
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,360
But one year ago,

478
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,600
blood night-blooming cereus
appeared in the world.

479
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,800
That's when I bought the fake cereus.

480
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,080
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

481
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,960
Yes, I got the cereus at the same time.

482
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,800
I'd say it was the same with us.

483
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,920
No more suspension.

484
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,200
What do you mean?

485
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,440
Lu Feibai bought
the ruin of the Cereus Villa

486
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,280
and built the Egret Villa

487
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,440
one year ago.

488
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,160
If I am taking it right,

489
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,560
the blood night-blooming cereus
everyone looks for in the world,

490
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,560
has been in the Cereus Villa

491
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,160
for ten years.

492
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,800
But Cereus Villa was destroyed.

493
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,320
There is no villa,

494
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,880
but the ruin remains.

495
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
I got it.

496
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,000
The most dangerous place is the safest.

497
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,360
When the blood night-blooming cereus
was stolen,

498
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,880
it was buried

499
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,840
under the ruin of Cereus Villa.

500
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,760
As Cereus Villa was destroyed,

501
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,320
it was a haunted house,

502
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,400
and no one dared to go there.

503
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,600
Even the killer Yu Qingzhu,

504
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,200
won't go there.

505
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,880
Lu Feibai is a businessman,

506
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
who believes in no God or ghost.

507
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,960
He dared to buy it

508
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
and live in it.

509
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,480
When he rebuilt the villa,

510
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,000
he found the real
blood night-blooming cereus.

511
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,280
But,

512
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
why did Lu Feibai counterfeit

513
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,880
when he got the real cereus?

514
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,960
I just said

515
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,760
he is a businessman.

516
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,000
Everyone in the world wants
blood night-blooming cereus.

517
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,160
The cereus is useless to him,

518
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,600
except for...

519
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,000
selling it.

520
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Yes,

521
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,960
he wanted to sell
blood night-blooming cereus.

522
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,720
But blood night-blooming cereus

523
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,080
everyone wants in the world

524
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,480
can't be sold openly.

525
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,400
He might be assassinated.

526
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,800
So he set up a fraud.

527
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,760
With fake cereus in circulation,

528
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,120
battle in the underground

529
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,600
was exposed to the surface,

530
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,680
and

531
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
it lured all the potential buyers.

532
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,800
Damn.

533
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,960
You

534
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,680
tricked all of us.

535
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,920
What a fraud!

536
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,280
At the climax of the fraud,

537
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,280
he invited all the buyers

538
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,160
to attend this auction.

539
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,840
And he showed up in the
disguise of Mr. Xi,

540
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,400
expecting to make a fortune

541
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,840
with the real
blood night-blooming cereus.

542
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,080
If I didn't uncover the fraud,

543
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,200
after the auction completes,

544
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,160
Mr. Xi would disappear
from the world,

545
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,680
but the businessman
Lu Feibai would remain.

546
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,560
- That's it.
- I got it.

547
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,680
Murong Chen,

548
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,240
you are as smart

549
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,920
as Holmes.

550
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,680
(Murong Chen.)

551
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,080
(I looked down on you before.)

552
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,760
Chang Kong,

553
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,440
your master is a genius.

554
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Of course.

555
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,760
He is just normal.

556
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,520
I...

557
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,080
I am a genius as well.

558
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,720
Lu Feibai,

559
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,680
am I missing

560
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,200
something?

561
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,760
Your deduction is terrific

562
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,920
and flawless.

563
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,440
But I don't think

564
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,400
you could figure out everything

565
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,560
solely based on my hands?

566
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,080
Your hands surely don't tell everything.

567
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,600
But do you know

568
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,000
you made a huge mistake?

569
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,600
You shouldn't have
lured us to Hui County.

570
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,880
Before the auction started,

571
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,480
when Jiang Mengmeng
chatted with her friends,

572
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,760
I found that

573
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,280
all the buyers in VIP seats

574
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,760
were tricked by the fake
blood night-blooming cereus.

575
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,840
However,

576
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,280
only Jiang Mengmeng and I
were not invited.

577
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,960
I thought about

578
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,080
why Mr. Xi

579
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,440
didn't invite me and Jiang Mengmeng.

580
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,680
The answer can only be that

581
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,000
Jiang Mengmeng and I were
already invited by him in person.

582
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,040
I didn't expect that

583
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,120
one missing step

584
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,840
unravelled the whole fraud.

585
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,200
The two roles you were playing

586
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,000
without a perfect performance

587
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,280
can be lethal

588
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,920
when missing any one step.

589
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,680
I give up.

590
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,200
However,

591
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,480
don't you have weak points
in your performance,

592
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,560
pavilion owner?

593
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,480
Mengmeng,

594
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,080
last time you told me about

595
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,480
VIP

596
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,640
and monthly subscription.

597
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,600
I still have some questions.

598
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Hopefully,

599
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
I can learn more from you.

600
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,200
Why does he mention it now?

601
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,600
The use value

602
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,920
of a product

603
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,280
depends on the buyer.

604
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,720
The seller cares only

605
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,240
about the price.

606
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,720
He is talking about...

607
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,480
The use value

608
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,920
of a product

609
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,200
depends on the buyer.

610
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,600
The seller cares only

611
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,040
about the price.

612
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,640
How much is your information?

613
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,040
(He is Zhao Qian.)

614
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,480
What?

615
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,640
Mengmeng.

616
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,640
What's the matter?

617
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,800
Song Che, come on.

618
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,880
Blood night-blooming cereus.

619
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,000
- Mengmeng.
- The cereus disappeared.

620
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,280
- Blood night-blooming cereus.
- Protect Mengmeng.

621
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,320
- Mengmeng.
- Blood night-blooming cereus.

622
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,360
Let's go.

623
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,760
Your Highness,

624
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,480
how about sending someone
from Tian Ji Pavilion

625
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,440
to search for Lu Feibai?

626
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,600
No need.

627
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,080
Lu Feibai didn't take
blood night-blooming cereus.

628
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,800
He didn't?

629
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,200
But he disappeared with
blood night-blooming cereus.

630
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,040
Lu Feibai is the most eager to sell

631
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,040
blood night-blooming cereus
in the world.

632
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,560
How come he took away

633
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,400
blood night-blooming cereus in the end?

634
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,800
And,

635
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,200
he told me at the end
of the auction that

636
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,680
he knew my true identity.

637
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,000
He has already known it!

638
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,080
He must have prepared for his death.

639
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,040
Then he...

640
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,720
The mantis stalks the cicada,

641
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,000
unaware of the oriole behind.

642
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,280
Now he must have been
someone else's scapegoat.

643
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,560
That is to say,

644
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,920
blood night-blooming cereus
belonged to someone else.

645
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,000
Then all our efforts
turn out to be vain.

646
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,800
Not really.

647
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,600
Let me ask you,

648
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,160
when you visit someone,

649
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,840
you lost your stuff,

650
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,800
then who will you turn to?

651
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,240
The host, of course.

652
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,480
Now it's time to meet Governor Ye

653
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,210
(Ye Manor)

654
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,520
Mistress, you are back.

655
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,000
Why are you so happy?

656
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,400
Happy? I am really happy.

657
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
I'll take it.

658
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,960
Don't touch my stuff.

659
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,320
Sorry.

660
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,120
(Ye Manor)

661
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,720
Nothing here.
What about you?

662
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,200
No, what about you?

663
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,320
No.

664
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,120
Let's go there and have a look.

665
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,760
Alright, let's go.

666
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,880
We are leaving.

667
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,800
Are you leaving?

668
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,720
We are here just to have a look.

669
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,000
Now that the cereus disappeared,

670
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,400
we have to leave.

671
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,120
All of us in Bai Hua Village

672
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,240
will always remember Your Highness.

673
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,640
Later,

674
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,440
if Your Highness needs our help,

675
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,040
feel free to find us.

676
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,440
Life is hard in the world.

677
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,760
Hope we can still meet.

678
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,280
Take care, 9th Princess.

679
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,760
Take care!

680
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,680
Come on.

681
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,520
You are leaving as well.

682
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,800
Xi Qing and I have already
stayed away from the world.

683
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,480
This time I was lured by the cereus.

684
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,160
It seems we are not lucky enough.

685
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,440
I know one can never be too greedy.

686
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,080
Everything is fine for us now.

687
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,480
I promise you that

688
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,920
after we come back,

689
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,120
I will stay away from the world

690
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,160
with you.

691
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,960
We are leaving now.

692
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,040
Take care.

693
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,920
I envy them.

694
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,400
Alright,

695
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
I need to report to Sister Queen.

696
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Mengmeng,

697
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,880
let's go back.

698
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,400
But...

699
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,800
Well,

700
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,280
you don't want to go back?

701
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,880
Do you still want to look for
blood night-blooming cereus?

702
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,040
The cereus is that important to you?

703
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,000
It's not about the cereus,

704
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,600
actually...

705
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,640
I can't go back with you.

706
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,280
Well,

707
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,520
Mengmeng

708
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,840
is old enough

709
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,960
to have her own secrets.

710
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,240
Since you don't want to go back,

711
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
I won't force you.

712
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,280
What about Sister Queen?

713
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,960
I never met 9th Princess in Hui County.

714
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,600
My brother.

715
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,440
Dear sister,

716
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,760
do what you want.

717
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,000
I can't stay with you forever,

718
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,480
but I will support you.

719
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,800
To me,

720
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,440
nothing compares

721
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,680
to your happiness.

722
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,680
When you feel tired someday,

723
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,960
or if you miss your home,

724
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,400
I will be there waiting for you.

725
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,800
Thank you.

726
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,400
The world is dangerous.

727
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,720
Be more careful.

728
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,040
Take care of her.

729
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,800
Yes.

730
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,280
I am leaving now.

731
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,840
Childe Murong and Chang Kong.

732
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,120
I nearly forget about them.

733
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,400
Where are they?

734
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,800
I haven't seen them

735
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,120
after the auction completed.

736
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,920
Not good.

737
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,080
Murong Chen has no sense of directions.

738
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,400
What if he is lost?

739
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,000
Who is Jiang Mengmeng?

740
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,200
Childe Murong

741
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,520
wanted me to give you this.

742
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,040
Childe Murong.

743
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:23,960
Murong Chen.

744
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,490
(We have found the clue of cereus.
Wait for us in the teahouse.)

745
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,360
Mengmeng,

746
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,400
what did he say?

747
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,560
He said Chang Kong and he
have found the clue.

748
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,040
He asked us to wait for them in the
teahouse.

749
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,680
Teahouse?

750
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,720
Why don't they come to find us?

751
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,280
Maybe they are in a hurry.

752
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,240
Let's get there.

753
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,320
Let's go.

754
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,170
(Teahouse)

755
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,520
Do Murong Chen and Chang Kong
come here?

756
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,480
No, they don't.

757
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,320
Where are they two?

758
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,040
Right.

759
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,280
Coquette!

760
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,440
Come out!

761
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
You seduced my man.

762
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,400
Do you dare to come out?

763
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,120
I will kill you alive.

764
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,840
Come out.

765
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,360
What happened?

766
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,320
Is she the woman who
rode the horse that day?

767
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,680
There is adultery!

768
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
What a coincidence!

769
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Don't let her see me.

770
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,920
She is there.

771
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,960
I shouldn't have said that.

772
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,240
Coquette, you are here.

773
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,880
- Where?
- Who?

774
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,000
I am speaking of you! You!

775
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,880
Me?

776
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,440
If it's not you, who else can it be?

777
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,600
You...

778
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,560
I'll shut her up.

779
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,720
It doesn't matter.

780
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,760
I am not afraid of her.

781
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,440
Listen to me.

782
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,600
The coquette, she

783
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,000
seduced my fiance.

784
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,480
Don't slander me!

785
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,000
I'll sue you.

786
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,160
Stop being cunning.

787
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,200
I am being cunning?

788
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,600
Come on,

789
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,680
I don't even know who is your fiance.

790
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,120
You won't admit it, right?

791
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,520
That day,

792
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,400
you got in my way,

793
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,480
and scared my horse.

794
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,720
You pretended to be pitiful

795
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,320
to seduce my An'an.

796
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,080
He begged forgiveness for you.

797
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,520
Then you started flirting
with each other.

798
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,720
I was so stupid

799
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,800
that I didn't figure it out.

800
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,920
An'an?

801
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,200
Who is An'an?

802
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,840
The dumbhead?

803
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,040
He is your fiance?

804
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Well, you remembered?

805
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,200
I do remember.

806
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,600
But you regarded this

807
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,680
as flirting?

808
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,400
Are you blind?

809
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,000
You still won't admit it?

810
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,920
Well,

811
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,480
how about the next time?

812
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,040
You dated each other
when buying clothes.

813
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,200
My maid and the passersby all saw it.

814
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,800
I saw she flirted with Childe Sai

815
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,120
on the street.

816
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,120
The passersby had seen them.

817
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,600
They flirted on the street!

818
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,480
So you are the passersby.

819
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,560
You are the haters, right?

820
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,120
That day,

821
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,560
your fiance came to me.

822
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,520
He said he wanted to apologize
on behalf of you.

823
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,600
He even invited us to dinner.

824
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,560
We left him behind.

825
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,720
- Stop lying.
- Stop making the noise.

826
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,240
I am saying the truth.

827
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,400
Xiao Ai and Zhe Xiang can
demonstrate the fact.

828
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,360
It's true.

829
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,360
Yes, it is.

830
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,200
He drove the man away.

831
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,040
What she said is true.

832
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,280
Your witnesses

833
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,800
are your friends.

834
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,400
They are partial.

835
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,120
Useless conversation.

836
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,360
Where is Murong Chen?

837
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,400
Well, let's go.

838
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,200
Well, are you afraid?

839
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,400
You want to leave?

840
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,560
I am afraid?

841
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
Whatever.

842
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,000
Let's go.

843
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
If you don't admit it,

844
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
- you can never leave.
- Stay away from me.

845
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,200
Admit it!

846
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,600
- Let go of me.
- Stay away from me.

847
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,000
- Let go of me.
- Stay away from me.

848
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,600
Let go of me.

849
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,200
