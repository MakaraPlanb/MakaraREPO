That's the woman.

25
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,200
After luring me away,

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,200
she found the
blood night-blooming cereus,

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,880
and kept it for herself.

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,160
It's you...

29
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,960
Quit your nonsense.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,360
Nonsense?

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,040
There's only going to be one side

32
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,640
that walks out with the cereus today.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,720
Brothers,

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,520
charge!

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,680
You are all respected

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,160
people with known names and reputations.

37
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,840
You all claim to be decent men,

38
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,360
but yet act like thugs.

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Just because you can't find it,

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
you feel entitled to rob it?

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,160
Let's stop wasting our time.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,920
Charge!

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,440
Mengmeng.

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,360
What did you say to her?

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,240
Well, what did you do to her?

46
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,560
You said you wanted to
bring Mengmeng happiness.

47
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,680
Is this the happiness you meant by?

48
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,280
I just told her the truth.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,600
Ask yourself whether

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
you told her the whole truth.

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,920
What's that sound out there?

52
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,880
What's going on?

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,560
It sounds like a fight.

54
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,920
Where's Her Highness?

55
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,240
Zhe Xiang is also missing.

56
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
His Highness...

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,880
Crap.

58
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,320
You guys stay here,

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,520
and protect His Highness.

60
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,120
You two take care.

61
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,840
Mengmeng, are you OK?

62
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,760
It seems like...

63
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,000
I really am the medical supplement.

64
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,120
The blood night-blooming cereus...

65
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,800
It's glowing.

66
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,000
It's mine!

67
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,240
Protect His Highness and
seize the blood night-blooming cereus.

68
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,080
Your Highness, be careful!

69
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,560
Mengmeng, hurry!

70
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,400
Mengmeng, hurry!

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Your Highness, be careful!

72
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,240
Go.

73
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,360
Go.

74
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,440
Mengmeng, give me the flower.

75
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Give me the flower.

76
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,440
Give me the flower.

77
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,000
Give me the flower.

78
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,240
Give me the flower.

79
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,360
Give me the flower.

80
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,600
Give me the flower. Give it to me.

81
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,960
In front of greed,

82
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,640
lives can be destroyed,

83
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,320
families can be ruined,

84
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,040
justice can be trampled,

85
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,600
and love can be used.

86
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,200
I can't alter
where the story is heading,

87
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,200
but at least

88
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,120
I have the ability to end it

89
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,800
So long,

90
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,000
this stupid game.

91
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,200
Mengmeng.

92
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,640
Your Highness, stay back.

93
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,640
The blood night-blooming cereus
is recognizing the master.

94
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,600
The blood night-blooming cereus
has been collecting Reiki for centuries.

95
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,800
The power it contains

96
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,920
is far beyond what
a human body can bear.

97
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,880
9th princess is just a normal person.

98
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
She doesn't know Kung Fu,

99
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
let alone any inner power.

100
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,120
The cereus will eat her alive,

101
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,400
and burn her organs.

102
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,960
She will die from
bursting carotid blood vessels.

103
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,920
She's asking for her own demise.

104
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,200
How did things end up like this?

105
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,160
I can't believe I bring this to her.

106
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,240
No.

107
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,440
I'm the one to blame.

108
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,560
If it wasn't for me,

109
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,520
you wouldn't have had the chance.

110
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,560
What are you talking about?

111
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,960
What's going on with Mengmeng?

112
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,000
Mengmeng,

113
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,480
if you die here today,

114
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,520
I'll keep you company,

115
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,720
even if that means going through hell.

116
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,960
She controlled the
blood night-blooming cereus.

117
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,080
The cereus has chosen the master.

118
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,480
They've now become one.

119
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,400
So that means princess won't die?

120
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,480
Great, now I have the plot armor.

121
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,800
I can't even die when I want to.

122
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,680
She won't die.

123
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,040
But it might be more
frightening than dying.

124
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,280
Mengmeng,

125
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
come here.

126
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,960
Mengmeng,

127
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,040
you're in great danger now.

128
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,400
Come with me.

129
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,680
I can protect you.

130
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,960
What do you want this time?

131
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm protecting her.

132
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,160
- Meng...
- Enough!

133
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,280
Murong Chen,

134
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,280
you said I can have the right to choose,

135
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,920
right?

136
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,200
Annoying trash.

137
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,120
9th princess

138
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
has been controlled by the cereus.

139
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,240
What have I done?

140
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,840
- Mengmeng.
- Mengmeng.

141
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,640
Your Highness.

142
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,200
Your Highness, are you OK?

143
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,640
I've fine now.

144
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,560
It's my fault.

145
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,040
If it wasn't for me,

146
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,320
she wouldn't have misunderstood you,

147
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,840
wouldn't have eaten
the blood night-blooming cereus,

148
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,360
and then forced to leave.

149
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,800
Brother...

150
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,320
What does the
blood night-blooming cereus

151
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,680
have to do with the crown prince?

152
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Murong Chen,

153
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,920
what's going on?

154
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,400
Oh, and

155
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,640
when did your Kung Fu skills
get so good?

156
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,280
It's almost like

157
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,120
you were possessed by Yun Ya.

158
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,320
Was it something I said?

159
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,400
Song Che,

160
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,600
the truth is

161
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,760
I am Yun Ya.

162
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,640
What?

163
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,680
5th prince,

164
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,400
so you have been lying to our
princess this whole time.

165
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,560
No wonder...

166
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,840
No wonder our princess wanted to
break up with you that day.

167
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,320
A Chen.

168
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,720
Song Che,

169
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,600
have you lost your mind?

170
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,080
His Highness is still wounded.

171
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,240
Wounded?

172
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,640
I would rather beat him to death.

173
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,560
If it wasn't for him,

174
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,600
could Mengmeng end up like this?

175
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,600
Chang Kong,

176
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,040
let him go.

177
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,600
But...

178
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,920
I said let him go.

179
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,160
You're right.

180
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,600
I used and lied to you from the start.

181
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,120
Since we were in Ruo Shui Kingdom,

182
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,440
I've decided to travel with you guys.

183
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,880
Also for Jiang Mengmeng,

184
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,840
I've been using her this whole time,

185
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,600
so she could help me get the cereus.

186
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,040
And today,

187
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,800
I wanted to use her blood
as the medical supplement

188
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,360
to activate the
blood night-blooming cereus.

189
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,160
But I didn't expect

190
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,640
there to be such a scene.

191
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,840
And now,

192
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,280
both the cereus and Mengmeng are gone.

193
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,800
All previous efforts are wasted.

194
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,040
It's not true.

195
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,040
What?

196
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,960
Why didn't you just do it?

197
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,920
You only said those things

198
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,080
to invoke me,

199
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,200
so that I would beat you up.

200
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,720
And that would make you feel better,

201
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,480
right?

202
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,520
When did you get so smart?

203
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,680
I don't care if you're
Murong Chen or Yun Ya.

204
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
Mengmeng ended up like this.

205
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,080
You are also the one to blame.

206
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,480
When I bring Mengmeng back,

207
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,320
I'm going to make you kowtow
and apologize to her.

208
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,200
But before that,

209
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,800
the priority is to find Mengmeng.

210
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,720
That's exactly right, Song Che.

211
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,560
The more pressing the situation is,

212
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,440
the more we need to stay calm.

213
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,280
And also, what's with Zhe Xiang?

214
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,320
She rescued Mengmeng,

215
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,080
but didn't say a word.

216
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,160
Where did she bring Mengmeng?

217
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,800
I know!

218
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,520
Zhe Xiang is from Nan Cang.

219
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,640
She must have brought Mengmeng there.

220
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,320
I'll go find her right away.

221
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,800
She didn't go to Nan Cang.

222
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,360
How do you know that?

223
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,760
Song Che,

224
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,520
I'm going to be honest with you.

225
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,160
Zhe Xiang is just like me.

226
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,480
She has two identities.

227
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,280
Her real identity

228
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,880
is the first disciple of 	Jing Yue Sect.

229
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
You...

230
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,400
You mean...

231
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:11,920
She's...

232
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,720
from Jing Yue Sect.

233
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,040
Correct.

234
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,280
She pretended to be an oiran to join us,

235
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,280
and her real goal was

236
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,440
to get close to Jiang Mengmeng
and the blood night-blooming cereus.

237
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,280
No way...

238
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,960
Giving others shoes indicates
that you want them to leave.

239
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,080
With the IQ you have,

240
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,800
you're going to be tricked by others.

241
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,320
So at that time she already...

242
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,000
All of you

243
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,480
are just a bunch of lairs.

244
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,280
All efforts are wasted.

245
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,880
The blood night-blooming cereus is gone,

246
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,840
and there will be no hope for
me to practice Blood Moon Power.

247
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,880
What's the point of keeping her?

248
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Master,

249
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,520
could you please leave her be.

250
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,120
Zhe Xiang,

251
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,560
I've kept you for years.

252
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,680
You've been with them
only for a few months.

253
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,600
How could you be silly enough

254
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,880
to give away your true heart?

255
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,960
It's my fault for not
trying hard enough.

256
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,680
If master must punish someone,
let it be me.

257
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,480
I'll willingly accept it.

258
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,600
I only beg you to let Jiang Mengmeng go.

259
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,440
You will definitely be punished,

260
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,080
but Jiang Mengmeng...

261
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,600
Master.

262
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,240
- What's wrong?
- Master.

263
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,400
Senior.

264
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,680
Jiang Mengmeng is
tearing the house apart.

265
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,320
You should check on it.

266
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,000
You did all this?

267
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,320
Mengmeng,

268
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,640
are you OK?

269
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,440
I didn't mean to...

270
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,920
I don't know what's wrong with me.

271
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,440
I can't control myself.

272
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,080
It must be the
blood night-blooming cereus.

273
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,840
(This is so mystical.)

274
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,360
(The cereus is fully absorbed.)

275
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,680
(She is the chosen one.)

276
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,960
(The chosen one!)

277
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,960
Master.

278
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,160
Rest assured.

279
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,720
I won't hurt her.

280
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,680
On the contrary,

281
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,680
I'll treat her well.

282
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,320
(Jing Yue Sect's Secret Chamber)

283
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,920
Let's begin.

284
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,880
Feel the power inside you.

285
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,080
Try to control the way it flows.

286
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,680
Your body has absorbed the
blood night-blooming cereus.

287
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,560
But for you,

288
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,120
it's way too powerful.

289
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,920
It's trapped in this mortal body,

290
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,520
and all it wants to do is escape,

291
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,800
which may cause destruction.

292
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,360
After you can fully control it,

293
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,880
I will teach you the
first level of Blood Moon Power.

294
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,000
The Secret Chamber is forbidden.

295
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,320
Only master and
our senior Zhe Xiang is allowed in.

296
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,720
But now,

297
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,360
master allows that Jiang Mengmeng

298
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,680
to enter as well.

299
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,800
I don't know what she's thinking.

300
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,560
(Chen Yan, Luo Xue)
Does master want her to be a disciple?

301
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,680
Oh, god!

302
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,200
I don't want this monster
to be my junior.

303
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,520
Senior,

304
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,320
did you bring home a Trojan horse?

305
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,960
When did 	Jing Yue Sect's affairs

306
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,760
become something you can moan about?

307
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,720
Listen clearly.

308
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,000
Jiang Mengmeng is
the saintess of Jing Yue Sect

309
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,840
and also my only heir.

310
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,040
Disrespecting her

311
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,280
is disrespecting me.

312
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,160
Do you understand?

313
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,040
- Yes.
- Yes.

314
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,480
I can't take it anymore.

315
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,480
I'm going to rescue Mengmeng right now.

316
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,880
Do you even know what kind of place
Jing Yue Sect is?

317
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,080
Like Bai Hua Village,

318
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,520
just a bunch of women.

319
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,680
I can rescue Mengmeng
from Bai Hua Village,

320
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,040
and Jing Yue Sect will be the same.

321
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,800
You know nothing about 	Jing Yue Sect.

322
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,160
You breaking in like that

323
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,840
is asking for your own demise.

324
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,760
Of course,

325
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,480
Mr. "Master of Tian Ji Pavilion",

326
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,480
and Mr. Know-it-all.

327
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,480
You knew that Mengmeng's blood

328
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,480
is the key to activate the cereus.

329
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,760
You also knew Zhe Xiang
is a spy from Jing Yue Sect.

330
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,080
But you still let all of this happen,

331
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,720
just watching Zhe Xiang take Mengmeng.

332
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,640
Now I want to rescue her,

333
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,520
and you're trying to stop me.

334
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Murong Chen,

335
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,800
what on earth is going on in your head?

336
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,320
Song Che,

337
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,680
- His Highness...
- Chang Kong.

338
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,080
Jiang Mengmeng has eaten the cereus,

339
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,680
and almost started a slaughter.

340
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,880
This has spread all over the world.

341
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,120
So what?

342
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,320
If Jiang Mengmeng

343
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,560
shows herself in public now,

344
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
people will want to kill her.

345
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,120
Why?

346
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,560
Her Highness didn't do anything wrong.

347
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,120
Well, others don't think like that.

348
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,680
You men of the world,

349
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,560
are ridiculous.

350
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,080
Initially, you fought against each other
for the blood night-blooming cereus.

351
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,320
Now that the power of the cereus

352
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,040
shifted to Jiang Mengmeng,

353
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,000
you regard her as a common enemy.

354
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,440
Being frustrated won't solve anything.

355
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,320
Jiang Mengmeng is now
staying in 	Jing Yue Sect,

356
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,720
and that's much safer than
being out in the world.

357
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,560
On the topic of rescuing her,

358
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
we need time and
discussion on strategies.

359
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,680
Are you hearing yourself?

360
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,480
Mengmeng is with Yu Qingzhu.

361
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,600
She's probably suffering right now.

362
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,480
When you're done with your discussing,

363
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,960
Mengmeng could be dead by then.

364
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
Zhe Xiang is there,

365
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,480
and she'll find ways
to protect Mengmeng.

366
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,960
Everything we're going through

367
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,720
is caused by Zhe Xiang.

368
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,640
How can you still trust her?

369
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,720
Anyway,

370
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,280
I trust her.

371
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,600
I get it now.

372
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
Your goal was the
blood night-blooming cereus.

373
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,080
Now that the cereus is gone,

374
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,880
Mengmeng no longer has value to you,

375
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,360
so you never thought of saving her,

376
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,280
right?

377
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,840
No response.

378
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,040
Fine.

379
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,520
Since you don't care about her,

380
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,560
I will.

381
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,760
I will rescue her,

382
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,800
even if that means losing this life.

383
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,280
Xiao Ai,

384
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,040
Song Che can't even find where
Jing Yue Sect is.

385
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
You sure you want to follow him?

386
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,560
I...

387
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,200
Chang Kong,

388
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,720
return to Tian Ji Pavilion.

389
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,880
Yes.

390
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,440
Why...

391
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,360
Why did everybody leave?

392
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,760
I...

393
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,480
Your Highness...

394
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,480
I did that?

395
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,800
You've learned it,

396
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,120
and all it took was once.

397
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
I didn't expect that

398
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,720
this good memory skill

399
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,280
can have added buff.

400
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,360
What?

401
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,680
What's buff?

402
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,440
Buff is like...

403
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,360
an enhancing skill.

404
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,280
Like when I ate the
blood night-blooming cereus,

405
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,960
that's also like a buff.

406
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,880
What's this?

407
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,960
It smells nice.

408
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,520
This is...

409
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,520
something called Xuefuxiang,
and it improves your power.

410
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,040
They all call you a demon.

411
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,040
Is that so?

412
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,880
But I think you're a nice person.

413
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,880
Why so?

414
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,800
Because like,

415
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,400
I ate your blood night-blooming cereus,

416
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,680
and tore apart your house.

417
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,600
But you didn't punish me.

418
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,880
Instead, you teach me Kung Fu,

419
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,640
and also how to control my power.

420
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,480
So I think

421
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,400
you're a nice person.

422
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,240
Are you trying to flatter me?

423
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,600
Oops, you can tell.

424
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,120
To be honest,

425
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,200
when I first heard you ate the cereus,

426
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,160
I was very upset.

427
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,280
I wanted to kill you right away.

428
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,480
But then I realized,

429
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,480
the cereus has seen you as its master.

430
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,160
Then I thought,

431
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,560
this might not be a coincidence.

432
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,120
Everything has a reason.

433
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,040
I've worked hard for so many years.

434
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,360
But I never could master
Blood Moon Power.

435
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,480
And I definitely
couldn't single-handedly

436
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,880
accomplish 	Jing Yue Sect's great cause.

437
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,720
But you

438
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,520
might be my god-given buff.

439
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,680
You learn pretty quick.

440
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,680
So rest assured.

441
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,640
I won't wake up one day
and decide to kill you.

442
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,880
Thank you then.

443
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,600
But I have another question.

444
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,800
Just ask.

445
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,120
That Blood Moon Power thing...

446
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,200
Could I maybe not learn it?

447
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,760
What did you just say?

448
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,360
You said...

449
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,840
you were not going to kill me.

450
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,840
The pre-condition for that

451
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,280
is that you must be
Jing Yue Sect's saintess,

452
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,640
and be my only heir.

453
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,320
As long as you behave,

454
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,720
in the future,
Jing Yue Sect will own the world.

455
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,840
And it will all belong to you.

456
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,440
Why would a nobody like me
want to own the world?

457
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,640
Try me and say that again.

458
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,360
I mean I'll learn it.

459
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,720
I'll learn it, OK?

460
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,920
I will.

461
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,760
We shall continue.

462
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,280
The Blood Moon Power have five levels.

463
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,360
No feelings,

464
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,360
no thoughts,

465
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,760
no form,

466
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,880
no ego,

467
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
and no end.

468
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,680
The first level, no feelings.

469
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,960
This means you must
cut all ties and all relationships.

470
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,520
Mortals have feelings.

471
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,360
Therefore, they have strings attached.

472
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,360
If you can overcome feelings,

473
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,680
you can overcome mortals,

474
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,880
and become fearless.

475
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,400
Everything will then seem like nothing,

476
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,520
and even iron walls
will seem like paper.

477
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,920
I mean... The first level
is already quite awesome.

478
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,080
Just follow me and learn.

479
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,680
(Jing Yue Sect's Medicine Storage)

480
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,440
(Ecstasy Incense)

481
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,680
Qing He.

482
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,760
What's the matter, senior?

483
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,480
Why is there one missing?

484
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,760
The incense can control people's minds.

485
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,560
Losing it can cause big trouble.

486
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,800
Master took one this morning.

487
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,480
I forgot to register it.

488
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,600
Master?

489
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,320
Where is she now?

490
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,320
She's teaching the Saintess
in the Secret Chamber.

491
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,160
(Jiang Mengmeng)

492
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,120
(Was I helping you)

493
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,160
(or bringing harm to you?)

494
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,520
Chang Kong,

495
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,200
send out the Tian Ji Token.

496
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,200
Rally all members from other branches,

497
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,920
and destroy every 	Jing Yue Sect branch.

498
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes.

499
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,360
Have you seen a girl that's

500
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,760
very tall,

501
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,520
very fierce,

502
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,240
and very badass when she fights?

503
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,480
Have you seen a...

504
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,680
Jing Yue Sect.

505
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,760
Where's Jing Yue Sect?

506
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,720
I don't know.

507
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,360
Jing Yue...

- Zhe Xiang. Zhe Xiang.
- What are you doing?

510
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,080
Where are you, Zhe Xiang?

511
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,680
Zhe Xiang, come out to see me?

512
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,080
Zhe Xiang.

513
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,760
- Zhe Xiang.
- Get out.

514
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,200
- Zhe Xiang.
- Get out.
