OK.

25
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,200
OK. Let's go.

(Qian Xiu Workshop)

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Is this the place?

28
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,720
Mr. Rong,

29
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,200
this shop seems too small

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,400
to offer us the 500kg

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
dyestuff that we asked for.

32
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,920
You are right.

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,160
Let's check out another store.

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,760
Dear customers,

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,280
wait up.

36
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,520
I heard that you need 500kg dyestuff.

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,680
This store seems too small.

38
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,360
Let's check out another one.

39
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,120
Customer, you were wrong.

40
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,400
Although this store seems small,

41
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,360
Qian Xiu Workshop can rank

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,680
top 3 or 4 throughout the whole

43
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,400
Ruo Shui Kingdom.

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,520
There's no problem to place

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,880
the order of 500kg dyestuff with us.

46
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,280
Really?

47
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,280
Mr. Rong is really
the top unscrupulous...

48
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,720
silk merchant in the North Desert.

49
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,760
We have very strict rules for

50
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,280
the partners we work with.

51
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,600
How about this?

52
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,040
I will send someone to
show you two around.

53
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,520
You can decide after knowing more

54
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,840
about the store.

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,680
How does that sound?

56
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,360
Alright.

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,640
Waiter.

00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,280
Boss.

59
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,720
Show these two customers
around the backyard.

60
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:18,920
OK.

61
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
This way, please.

62
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:20,800
This way, please.

63
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,040
This way, please.

64
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,160
This is our dyehouse.

65
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,400
We do all

66
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,320
the clothes dying here.

67
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,400
That is our warehouse over there.

68
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,920
Our warehouse is very large.

69
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,560
We put all the dry clothes

70
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,080
inside the warehouse.

71
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,760
It is our accountant house here.

72
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,600
We have finished the touring.

73
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,360
Please follow me to the front hall.

74
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,160
What's wrong, Mr. Rong?

75
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
My jade pendant fell somewhere.

76
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,240
My father gave it to me.

77
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,720
It is a family heirloom.

78
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,840
I will send some people
to help you look for it.

79
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,720
It's OK.

80
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,520
I remember that it fell

81
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,320
somewhere in the front hall.

82
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,600
You can go to the front hall first,

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,840
and we will meet you there soon.

84
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,240
Sounds good.

85
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,360
Then I will go there first.

86
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,520
My god. Look at these.

87
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,720
The boss was telling the truth.

88
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,360
It is a top 3 or 4 dyestuff workshop.

89
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,320
How to search for it?

90
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,720
The number of accounts is so huge.

91
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,560
Even they might have
difficulty looking for it.

92
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,520
But these seem to be arranged

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120

97
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,160
The book storage room.

98
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,640
Let's look for it.

99
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,360
You take a look first.

101
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,320
Can you tell anything?

102
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,760
Too many.

103
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,080
I still need some time.

104
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,280
Boss,

105
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,600
I will bring it to you right away.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,400
This way.

107
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,720
Your heartbeat is so fast.

108
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,920
Someone's coming.

109
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,200
I'm afraid that we get exposed.
So, I'm nervous.

(Stock-Out)

111
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,120
It was so scary.

112
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:12,880
Let's go.

(Stock-Out Account Book)

114
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,640
There's not enough time.

115
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,720
Could you tell anything?

116
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,960
I can remember everything I saw?

117
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,360
Did Mr. System add
this new skill for me?

(Ping Shan Bamboo Forest)

119
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,880
We finally made it back.

120
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,520
I wonder if Xiao Ai is worried.

121
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,600
I told Chang Kong to bring

122
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,480
Xiao Ai to the pavilion
and wait for you.

123
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,080
Let's go.

124
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,000
Watch out.

125
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,680
- Catch them.
- Stop running.

126
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,320
Stay there.

127
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,800
- Catch them.
- Stop running.

128
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,160
Hurry up.

129
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,640
- Stay there.
- Don't run.

130
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,640
No, no.

131
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,400
It's useless to keep running like this.

132
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,080
They all know Kung Fu
and we cannot run away.

133
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,040
Let's do this.

134
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,200
I will run along the main road

135
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,360
and lure them away.

136
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,480
So, you can hide here.

137
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,120
Then what about you?

138
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,440
Do you really think I will
give up my life for you?

139
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,440
You run away and call others

140
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,360
to come save me.

141
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,280
But...

142
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,000
There's no "But".

143
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,920
Believe in yourself.

144
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,520
I gotta go.

145
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920

147

Go after her.

Help!

149
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,440
What took them so long?

150
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,520
They would not run into anything, right?

151
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,120
It's getting late.

152
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,600
How about this?

153
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,440
You can go back to the gate.

154
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,720
I will find the 5th prince
and the 9th princess.

155
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,600
Alright.

156
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,240
Murong Chen, you will be widowed

157
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,600
if you don't show up soon.

158
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,120

Fighting!

162
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,760
He threw a punch.

163
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,840
Our hero hit the vital
part of the enemy.

164
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,040
Such a pity.

165
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,080
The enemy escaped it.

166
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,840
But it's OK.

167
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,400
Right way.

168
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,840
That's too bad.

169
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,960
The 3 enemies started
fighting our hero back.

170
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,280
Can the situation be
changed in 10 seconds?

Oh, my god.

172
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,960
He did it.

173
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,280
Our hero successfully escaped.

174
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,520
Yes, that's right.

175

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:45,920
Wake up.

192
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,200
Wake up.

193
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,280
Uncle Qi,

194
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,120
(Young Jiang Mengmeng)
I found someone.

195
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,840
(Yun Qi)
Last month,

196
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,720
I found you by the river,

197
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,840
and I found another person this month.

198
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,440
I almost became a
professional life saver.

199
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,040
Xiaomeng,

200
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,920
do you really want him to stay?

201
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,120
Uncle Qi,

202
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,440
please let him stay.

203
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,640
If we don't let him stay,

204
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,840
he will die.

205
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,840
If you're afraid that the money
is not enough to cover our living costs,

206
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,480
I can share my buns
and porridge with him.

207
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,080
It's fine.

208
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,480
Little guy,

209
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,880
you can stay.

210
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,640
But there's something
I have to say first.

211
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,520
This place is not for unoccupied people.

212
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,120
After your injury gets better,

213
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,840
come beg with us.

214
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
Thank you, master.

215
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,360
Don't call me master.

216
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,160
I can't teach you anything.

217
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,000
Well,

218
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,440
you can call me Uncle Qi
as Xiaomeng does.

219
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,440
Yes.

220
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,120
Uncle Qi.

221
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,680
What is your name?

222
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,960
My name is Mu…

223
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,920
My name is A Mu.

224
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,560
A Mu.

225
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,680
Then I will call you A Mu
from now on.

226
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,280
A Mu, this will be
your home now.

227
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,160
Don't run away again.

228
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,360
If you get lost again,

229
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,720
there's no one who's as kind as me.

230
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
Game over?

231
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,520
This is not my home.

232
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:26,960
You awake?

233
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,480
You saved me?

234
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,160
(Falling into water.)

235
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,120
(Shabby house.)

236
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,200
(Fire pit.)

237
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,160
(This story...)

238
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,400
He is a swordsman.

239
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,600
So, I cannot use what I learned
in the royal court dramas.

240
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,360
Right.

241
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,520
Knight-errant dramas.

242
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,040
A weak girl in a knight-errant
drama should be like this.

243
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,360
If you didn't show up and save me,

244
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,280
I would've died already.

245
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,680
May I know your name?

246
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,240
My name is Yun Ya.

247
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,600
Swordsman Yun.

248
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,040
If you hadn't saved me…

249
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,280
There's nothing I can pay you back,

250
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,240
but to marry...

251
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,160
Excuse me,

252
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,960
have you been to Liang City?

253
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,720
Liang City?

254
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,840
I've never heard of it.

255
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,960
(She did forget everything.)

256
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,760
(Why did he suddenly mention
Liang City?)

257
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,200
(Don't tell me it's some
vulgar story about substitute lover.)

258
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,320
(Is he going to say that)

259
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,440
(I look like someone he used to know?)

260
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,840
You look like someone I used to know.

261
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,120
(Sure enough!)

262
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,840
(This is the kind of story
I hate the most.)

263
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,120
(Although I like
Yun Ya's character setting,)

264
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,040
(I don't like the storyline.)

265
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,280
Swordsman Yun,

266
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,040
well,

267
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,800
I have nothing to pay you
back for saving my life now,

268
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,280
but I will be at your
service in my next life.

269
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,240
I gotta go.

270
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,360
Xiaomeng.

271
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,680
Come on, Mr. System.

272
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,800
I don't want to follow this storyline.

273
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,880
Are you going to chop me or what?

274
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,360
Fine.

275
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,480
Come, strike me.

276
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,640
I'm not leaving.

277
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,520
Strike me now.

278
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,440
You win.

279
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,560
Well...

280
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,720
It was lightning and I'd better...

281
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,560
Are you OK?

282
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,600
Your hands are so cold.

283
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,920
I'm fine.

284
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,560
It's just a small wound.

285
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,120
You call this small wound?

286
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,200
Did you get hurt when you saved me?

287
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,320
Small wound might have triggered

288
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,800
my previous illness.

289
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,840
Don't worry.

290
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,320
Ah, right,

291
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
why are you back?

292
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,720
It's all this system's fault.

293
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,040
You heard it?

294
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,600
It seems like

295
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,360
we have to spend the night here.

296
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,600
Are you really OK?

297
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,240
Miss,

298
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,440
you should have some rest.

299
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,160
I...

300
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,400
You...

301
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,800
Don't worry about me.

302
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,800
Since you said that.

303
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,600
Take care.

304
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,040
I'm telling you.

305
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,600
I do this because I don't want to
be called ungrateful.

306
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,360
Don't misunderstand me.

307
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,680
I don't like you at all.

308
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,680
And I'm definitely not
the person you knew in Liang City.

309
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,160
Fell asleep?

310
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,120
No, no.

311
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,840
What if he's a wanted criminal?

312
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,360
If I see his face...

313
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,080
Jiang Mengmeng,

314
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,600
keep your life for relationship.

315
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,760

Murong Chen, run.

328
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Xiaomeng,

329
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,840
from now on,

330
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,200
no matter it's Murong Chen

331
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,400
or Yun Ya,

332
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,760
I will never let anyone hurt you.

333
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,280
Did you figure it out?

334
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,520
Yes, I did.

335
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
Those men in black were
sent by the 4th princess.

336
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,680
It's her?

337
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,000
I don't have any resentment with her.

338
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,760
Why does she want me dead?

339
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,800
The 4th princess is not trying to
kill you.

340
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,640
Instead,

341
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,800
she fell in love with you.

342
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,400
What?

343
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,320
Ah, right,

344
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,760
how is the 9th princess?

345
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,200
She's fine.

346
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,680
But...

347
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,520
I don't want to break off
the engagement any more.

348
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,680
Why?

349
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,000
You know what?

350
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,880
Jiang Mengmeng

351
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,080
is Xiaomeng, the one I've been
searching for years?

352
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,280
It's her?

353
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,520
I've been looking for her for so long,

354
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,400
and I finally found her.

355
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
This time,

356
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,920
I will not let go.

357
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:50,800
Your Highness.

358
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,080
As expected,

359
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,400
you used your inner power again,

360
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,360
and it triggered the
cold poison in your body.

361
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,160
It's fine.

362
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,920
It was urgent

363
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,960
to save Jiang Mengmeng,

364
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,880
and I couldn't care that much.

365
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,360
Your Highness,

366
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,560
it's not because of emergency.

367
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,840
It is because of love.

368
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,080
You knew that you may get killed

369
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,240
if the cold poison is triggered
too many times.

370
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,680
Is it worth it?

371
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,760
As long as it's for her,

372
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,160
it's all worth it.

373
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,240
Swordsman Yun?

374
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,840
Swordsman?

375
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,840
He left without saying goodbye
as expected.

376
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,880
Typical!

377
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,280
Cheer up, Jiang Mengmeng.

378
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,240
He's just a non-player character.

379
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,040
Yes.

380
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,640
I should just run off.

381
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,840
After I go back, I have to spend so much

382
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,560
effort on looking for
the blood night-blooming cereus.

383
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,240
Rather than breaking off the engagement,

384
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,000
it's easier to just run off.

385
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,120
No.

386
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,440
Xiao Ai is still in the palace.

387
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,320
Whatever. I already know
everything anyway.

388
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,600
But all my money...

389
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,960
Money in the game is all fake.

390
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,600
Fake.

391
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,000
Murong Chen came out together with me.

392
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,640
Damn Murong Chen.

393
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,120
He will be accused.

394
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,160
He can explain it.

395
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,400
No, no.

396
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,520
Even if he does, no one would listen.

397
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,440
No one would believe either.

398
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,840
Such damn sense of justice.

399
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:53,840
Go.

400
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,320
Did you see a girl who is

401
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,160
short with big eyes

402
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,240
and who looks cute?

403
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,960
No, no, no.

404
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,640
No, I haven't seen one.

405
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:12,960
Hi,

406
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,640
did you see a girl who is

407
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,240
short with big eyes

408
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,520
and who looks cute?

409
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,920
No, I haven't.

410
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,080
Song Che.

411
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,280
Song Che.

412
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,280
Mengmeng.

413
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,680
Are you OK?

414
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,000
Did you get hurt?

415
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,840
Are you OK?

416
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,960
I was OK,

417
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,480
but now I'm a little dizzy.

418
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,800
Sorry.

419
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,960
I was too worried about you.

420
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,280
You don't know.

421
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,720
During the day you went missing,

422
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,480
the whole palace

423
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,040
became a mess.

424
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,160
Really?

425
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,160
Let's go.

426
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,680
Let's go home.

427
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,640
OK.

428
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,040
5th prince,

429
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,320
you and the 9th princess
were in danger by the river.

430
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,880
As the queen's son-in-law,

431
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,160
you not only let dangerous thing happen,

432
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,160
but also left her there.

433
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,680
She fell into the water, got hurt,
and stayed outside for a night.

434
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,320
You cannot get away from it.

435
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,920
Since Mengmeng is now back,

436
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,960
she will decide how
you should be punished.

437
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,840
Break off the engagement.

438
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,880
(This is a good chance
to break off the engagement for sure.)

439
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,560
Sister queen, there is
no need to punish him.

440
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,680
No punishment?

441
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,720
Since the 5th prince did nothing wrong,

442
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,720
he doesn't deserve any punishment.

443
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,560
On that day,

444
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,160
I asked him to run first.

445
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,240
Sister queen, I, as the 9th princess
of Ruo Shui Kingdom,

446
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,400
should undertake the responsibility

447
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,600
to protect the country and the people.

448
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,040
The 5th prince is not only
the queen's son-in-law,

449
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,360
but also my man.

450
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,600
How can I protect the country

451
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,680
if I can't even protect my man?

452
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,240
5th prince, you can see yourself out.

453
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,600
Thanks, Your Majesty.

454
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,040
Thank you, Mengmeng.

455
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,160
If I didn't sacrifice myself
and save you this time,

456
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,600
your life would be in danger.

457
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,640
How is it?

458
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,040
Am I generous?

459
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,000
It is a big favor,

460
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,240
and I have to repay it.

461
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,840
How do you want to repay it?

462
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,400
I will repay it

463
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,720
by marrying you.

464
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,800
Your Highness.

465
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,000
Chang Kong,

466
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,160
let's go.

467
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,840
You are biting the hand that feeds you.

468
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,880
What are you laughing at?

469
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,780
(Ling Xi Palace)

470
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,080
The 9th princess is not here.

471
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,640
It doesn't matter
whether she's here or not.

472
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,600
I'm here to send the stuff
from the 5th prince.

473
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,960
The 9th princess said that

474
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,800
she would not see anyone
or take anything.

475
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,680
Whatever.

476
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,000
I've delivered the stuff anyway.

477
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,000
Why are you so obedient?

478
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,480
You are totally...

479
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,560
well...

480
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,320
a simp.

481
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,920
I will leave the stuff here.

482
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,520
I will not see anyone.

483
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,600
I'm not at Ling Xi Palace.

484
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,160
Your Highness,

485
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,560
I've sent the person away.

486
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,360
But

487
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,640
he left the food here.

488
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,040
What?

489
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,720
This shall not happen again.

490
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,040
Your Highness,

491
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,480
you cannot hide from
the 5th prince like this forever.

492
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,520
You will meet sooner or later.

493
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,800
I'd hide as long as possible.

494
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,600
Let me tell you.

495
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,160
That Murong Chen

496
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,560
has been constantly
showing his affection.

497
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,360
He's bought me all kinds of stuff.

498
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,840
Xiao Ai, you really don't know

499
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,680
how scary it is

500
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,560
when a bad dog becomes

501
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,760
a simp.

502
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,120
Tell me,

503
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,640
did his brain get injured

504
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,800
the other day when we

505
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,200
were chased after?

506
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,960
I think

507
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,280
he was attracted by how you were

508
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,680
defending him bravely

509
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,240
in front of the queen last time.

510
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,560
So, he fell in love with you.

511
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,440
Wait,

512
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,840
are men in this game
that easy to take down?

513
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,440
Take down?

514
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,080
Well, this does taste good though.

515
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,360
What's wrong?

516
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,400
Why are you so mad
after delivering the stuff?

517
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,600
It's all because of
the maid of the 9th princess.

518
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,000
She said that I am

519
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,360
a dog.
[*simp means flattering dog in Chinese]

520
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,520
Dog?

521
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,960
What's wrong with dog?

522
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,800
Isn't it adorable?

523
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,640
Your Highness,

524
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,680
why are you also...

525
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,280
Fine.

526
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,800
Xiao Ai is not that kind of girl.

527
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,600
It must be taught by her master.

528
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,920
Speaking of which,

529
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,600
the 9th princess is treating
you as a stranger,

530
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,880
and not responding
anything to your affection.

531
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,360
Why don't you tell her directly

532
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,440
about the past between you two?

533
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,280
That memory is

534
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,480
not a good memory.

535
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,800
It's better be forgotten.

536
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,680
There're too many things
that I'm bearing.

537
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,920
I don't want her to get involved.

538
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,520
It is OK that she doesn't know anything.

539
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,760
I just want her to be happy.

540
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,600
I trust our fate.

541
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,000
Even if she doesn't remember anything,

542
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,560
I can still make her
fall in love with me again.

543
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,080
Your Highness,
you do have high confidence.

544
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,440
But now, the 9th princess doesn't
even want to see you.

545
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,800
How is it possible for her
to fall in love with you?

546
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,160
If she doesn't want to see me,

547
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,080
I will go to see her.

548
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,240
If she doesn't walk towards me,

549
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,320
I will walk towards her.

550
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:05,960
Your Highness,

551
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,160
is this...

552
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,400
sort of...

553
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,400
simp?

554
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,560
Simp?

555
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,120
Simp.

556
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,240
Simp?

557
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,760
What does it mean?

558
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,080
Murong Chen went out of the palace.

559
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,400
The guard saw it by himself.

560
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,840
The 5th prince left the palace
with Chang Kong since morning.

561
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,040
Great.

562
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,760
I've been staying in the room for days

563
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,320
just to avoid him.

564
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,880
I'm about to go crazy.

565
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,530
(Jin Xiu Gate)

566
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,720
No way.

567
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,080
Your Highness.

568
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,880
Is there anything we can help?

569
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,280
Nothing.

570
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,920
I'm just walking around.

571
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,080
You can go.

572
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:11,840
Yes.

573
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,080
No way.

574
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,920
Picking up money
right after coming outside?

575
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,160
Even more?

576
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,120
What kind of luck am I having today?

577
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,080
Didn't you get out of the palace?

578
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,640
Yeah.

579
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,000
I took a walk outside.

580
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,440
But somehow

581
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,760
nothing is more attractive than you.

582
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,080
So, I came back.

583
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,240
Then what about these?

584
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,040
You didn't accept any of the

585
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,960
gifts I gave you before.

586
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,280
So, I thought about it

587
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,120
and figured that you must not like them.

588
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,280
Then, I will give you
something you will like.

589
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,080
You do know me well.

590
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,080
Otherwise,

591
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,680
how can we be a perfect couple?

592
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,280
Since you have already led me here,

593
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,840
I will make it clear to you.

594
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,920
The account book of Qian Xiu Workshop?

595
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,000
You remember them all?

596
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,640
I told you that I can
remember everything I saw.

597
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880
You don't believe it.

598
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,430
(Account Book of Qian Xiu Workshop)

599
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,000
But

600
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,040
the handwriting is too bad.

601
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,560
Is my handwriting bad?

602
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,600
The handwriting on that
account book was this bad.

603
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,600
What are you trying to tell me

604
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,920
by showing me this?

605
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,360
I want to tell you that,

606
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,960
a few days ago,

607
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,920
we were still partners who look for
the blood night-blooming cereus.

608
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,760
Why can't we continue to be like that?

609
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,280
We find the blood night-blooming cereus

610
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,240
and then get separated.

611
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:49,920
Isn't it good?

612
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,760
No.

613
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,200
I want the flower,

614
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,680
and the marriage.

615
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,520
Do you know why I need to find
the blood night-blooming cereus?

616
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,520
I think...

617
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,760
I don't know.

618
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,720
I want to find it and

619
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,840
give it to my sister queen,

620
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,760
so that

621
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,800
I can break off the engagement.

622
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,680
Although we are engaged,

623
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,640
I don't like you.

624
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,440
Not to mention marrying you.

625
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,080
I thought it was something big.

626
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,880
It's okay that

627
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,600
you don't like me.

628
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,440
As long as I like you,
everything will be fine.

629
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,120
Relationship should be

630
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,160
mutual and equal.

631
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,080
Others might be like that,

632
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,920
but I'm different.

633
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,720
It's enough for me to like you.

634
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,160
Such a crooked thought.

635
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,800
Do you have any childhood trauma?

636
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,440
No, I don't.

637
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,000
Then,

638
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,720
what do you like about me?

639
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,200
Tell me,

640
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,560
so that I can change it.

641
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:56,840
Look at you.

642
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,240
You are a princess.

643
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,680
Pureness,

644
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,360
beauty,

645
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,160
dignity,

646
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,080
elegance,

647
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,160
and demureness.

648
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,400
These good qualities

649
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,600
have nothing to do with you.

650
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,080
You don't

651
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,760
look like a princess all over.

652
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,640
You're more like

653
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,480
a palace maid.

654
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,760
If you stand among the palace maids,

655
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,760
Xiao Ai would be more like
a princess than you.

656
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,160
And...

657
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,280
And the other one around you.

658
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,280
What is he called?

659
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,200
A Liang!

660
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,040
If he puts on female makeup,

661
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,560
he would look more like
a princess than you.

662
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,520
Is that enough?

663
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,240
But...

664
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,640
You are frank, righteous

665
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,160
and smart when in danger.

666
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,160
I'm very happy being with you.

667
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,040
I feel safe.

668
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,000
You feel

669
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,200
very happy

670
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,200
and safe with me,

671
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,760
right?

672
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,840
Are you sure you want to
wait for the sunrise here?

673
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,280
Aren't you cold?

674
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,600
Of course I have to wait.

675
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,000
(It seems that I underestimated
the cold night in late spring.)

676
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,480
(It's so cold.)

677
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,360
(Look at Murong Chen's
spoiled little body.)

678
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,080
(I guess he'll cry for
going back in a minute.)

679
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,880
It's so cold.

680
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,840
Now you know you were wrong?

681
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,560
Jiang Mengmeng! You…

682
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,280
I'll never watch the sunrise
with you again!

683
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,560
Don't you feel cold?

684
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,200
It's not that cold.

685
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,960
Are you really not cold?

686
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,960
Yeah.

687
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,560
I even feel warm.

688
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,800
Xiaomeng,

689
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,880
you know what?

690
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,880
I…

691
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,560
I hope that

692
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,520
in the whole life,

693
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,680
