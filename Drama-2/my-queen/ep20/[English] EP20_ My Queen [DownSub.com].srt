23
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,760
What happened?

24
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,200
If you still love someone,

25
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,200
you will be hurt by Blood Moon Power
when wielding the power.

26
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,640
You still have a heart

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,880
to love Murong Chen.

28
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,680
I...

29
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,520
I don't know what's wrong with me.

30
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,120
Once entering this chamber,

31
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,240
it seems that I will
change into another person.

32
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,040
My brain will be out of control

33
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,320
and I will do whatever
you tell me to do.

34
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
But just now,

35
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
he became Murong Chen

36
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,480
in front of me.

37
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,840
I couldn't do it anymore

38
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,560
and I could hardly control myself.

39
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,240
(Her will)

40
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,800
(actually made her immune
to the incense.)

41
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,960
(That's unbelievable.)

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,120
(It seems that I underestimated)

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,880
(her feelings for Murong Chen.)

44
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,760
I'm such a good-for-nothing.

45
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,160
You must be disappointed,

46
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,920
for I still have feelings for him now.

47
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,280
Mengmeng,

48
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,400
you are just a beginner.

49
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
I can understand

50
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,720
that you are unstable.

51
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,800
Don't push yourself too hard.

52
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,880
Now that

53
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
you can't forget him,

54
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,640
just remember him.

55
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,480
Remember...

56
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,600
Remember him?

57
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,920
Remember what he did to you

58
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
and how he deceived,

59
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,720
used and hurt you.

60
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,240
The medical supplement
is Jiang Mengmeng.

61
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,040
Help His Highness get the blood
night-blooming cereus.

62
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,480
Mengmeng, give the flower to me.

63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,440
Do you remember

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,960
how Murong Chen deceived you?

65
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,640
He used his dual identity to make
you fall in love with him,

66
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,400
so you can help him find the cereus.

67
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,640
And then, he waters the flower

68
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,200
with your blood.

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,040
Don't remind me of this.

70
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,240
I don't want it.

71
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,520
You have to recall!

72
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,040
You have to!

73
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,480
Why did he treat you well

74
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,200
and protect you?

75
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,480
Because he wanted to trade your life

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,200
for Murong Yi's life.

77
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,360
The one he cares about

78
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,440
is his brother,

79
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,760
not you.

80
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,240
He said he had been looking for you.

81
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,360
But in fact,

82
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,360
he had already forgotten you.

83
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,280
It is Tian Ji Pavilion.

84
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,560
If he really wanted to find you,

85
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,200
how could he have no clue
in the past ten years?

86
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,040
What a coincidence!

87
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,960
As soon as blood night-blooming cereus
reappeared in the world,

88
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,600
he found you.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,200
You have been missing for many days,

90
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,720
but he didn't come for you.

91
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,800
Why?

92
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,760
Because you ruined the medicine that
can save his brother.

93
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,360
He hates you.

94
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,000
How could he come to you?

95
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,600
Wake up, girl.

96
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,520
Murong Chen.

97
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Tell me

98
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,360
what you are thinking now.

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,440
I hate him.

100
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,760
That's my girl.

101
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,280
Remember,

102
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,800
as for what men can do,

103
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,400
we women can do it too.

104
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,480
We are not their belongings.

105
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,280
We are queens

106
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,480
who can rule the whole world.

107
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,320
(Tian Ji Pavilion)

108
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,320
Miss, you can't go in there.

109
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,320
Miss, you can't go in there.

110
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,520
Miss, please stop.

111
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,760
You can't.

112
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,440
Stop where you are.

113
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,520
Our master is busy now

114
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,960
and no one is allowed to interrupt him.

115
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,040
Oh,

116
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,000
I thought he had been
missing for so long

117
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
to save the princess.

118
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,360
It turned out that he had been minding
his own business.

119
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,760
I'd like to see what kind of business

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,920
made him ignore

121
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,320
the life of our princess.

122
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,360
Murong Chen,

123
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
come out!

124
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,200
Come out, Murong Chen!

125
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,320
It's Xiao Ai.

126
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,000
What is she doing here?

127
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,520
Murong Chen,

128
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,400
come out.

129
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,920
You can't disturb the master.

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,720
Master,

131
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,640
I'm sorry I didn't stop her.

132
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,960
It's okay. Leave us.

133
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,080
Yes.

134
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,720
Murong Chen,

135
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,000
do you even have a heart?

136
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,200
Her Highness may be facing death now,

137
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,760
but you are hiding here and living your
peaceful life.

138
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,520
Xiao Ai,

139
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,680
where are your manners?

140
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,880
Song Che said you didn't even
care about her,

141
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,640
but I didn't believe him.

142
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,920
I believed...

143
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,680
I believed you would go save her.

144
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,800
I believed you had feelings for her.

145
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,880
But now,

146
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,080
after she did all those things for you,

147
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,080
you turned your back to her.

148
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,480
You are heartless.

149
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Are you done?

150
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,840
Chang Kong, walk her out.

151
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,080
You!

152
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,480
Stop!

153
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,360
I'll walk you out.

154
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,280
Chang Kong,

155
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,040
you aren't with me either.

156
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,040
Chang Kong,

157
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,360
I was wrong about you.

158
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,840
Both you and your master

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,640
are selfish!

160
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,840
Xiao Ai,

161
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
stop it.

162
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,720
Chang Kong,

163
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,200
you are with him, aren't you?

164
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,520
Alright.

165
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
Since our princess

166
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,160
has nothing to do with your master now,

167
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,640
it's same for us.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,280
- Xiao Ai
- Chang Kong

169
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Come back.

170
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,600
You still have work to do.

171
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,320
Chang Kong,

172
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,920
are you blaming me?

173
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,960
I...

174
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,480
I'm not.

175
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,720
I've followed Your Highness since
childhood.

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,640
Your Highness is like an elder brother
of mine,

177
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,880
so I'll help with

178
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,120
anything that Your Highness wants to do.

179
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,840
I will spare no effort,

180
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,920
with no hesitation.

181
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,680
It is sad

182
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,440
that you love a person,

183
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,560
but

184
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,280
you are not allowed.

185
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,520
Then you decide to forget,

186
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,560
still you are not capable.

187
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,680
Time

188
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
can make you forget everything

189
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,640
but

190
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,680
that memory.

191
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,360
Take a rest

192
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,440
and eat something.

193
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
I'm not hungry yet.

194
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,800
Leave it there.

195
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,120
Why?

196
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,400
Got something else?

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,720
Do you remember who I am?

198
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,880
I do.

199
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,800
You are the first disciple of master,
Zhe Xiang.

200
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,080
Why do you ask?

201
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,920
Don't you blame me

202
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,160
for deceiving you so long?

203
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,720
Oh, this.

204
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
Don't worry.

205
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't blame you.

206
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,040
On the contrary,

207
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,640
I thank you

208
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,680
for helping me see what kind of person
Murong Chen is.

209
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,840
Mengmeng,

210
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,160
you were not like this before.

211
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,000
Before...

212
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,880
I was like what?

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,120
In the past, you were

214
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,920
always laughing and fooling around,

215
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,400
footloose

216
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
and fancy-free.

217
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,440
But now, you are

218
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,240
cold.

219
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Sometimes, it makes me feel
like you're a stranger.

220
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,520
So

221
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,920
you prefer the old me.

222
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,160
Yes.

223
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,560
Why are you laughing?

224
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,280
It's too bad.

225
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,840
The old Jiang Mengmeng has died.

226
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,200
I have to do my practice.

227
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Please leave me alone.

228
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,600
What did you say?

229
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,480
Release Jiang Mengmeng?

230
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,040
I don't want to see her

231
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,760
lose herself like this.

232
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,720
I hope she can be herself again.

233
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Xiang'er,

234
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,320
I think you've been pushing
your luck lately.

235
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,760
You begged me to keep her alive

236
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,880
and I approved.

237
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,040
What's more, I taught her
everything I know.

238
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,680
Now you want me to release her?

239
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,640
I didn't...

240
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,480
I didn't know

241
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,240
she would become like this.

242
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,120
If I knew,

243
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,960
- I would have...
- You what?

244
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,360
You wanted to say you would

245
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,200
have betrayed me and

246
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,120
helped them to kill me, right?

247
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Alright.

248
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I can release her.

249
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,040
But she'll decide herself

250
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,880
where she would go.

251
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,240
Congratulations.

252
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,440
You've finally mastered the first level
of Blood Moon Power.

253
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,400
Really? I made it?

254
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,960
And you only spent half my time.

255
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,560
I was right about you.

256
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,040
However,

257
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,680
I got a mission for you.

258
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,560

Mengmeng.

It's really you.

262
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,040
Well,

263
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,920
it's been such a long time that

264
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,640
you couldn't even recognize me?

265
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,520
I really wanted to see you.

266
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,480

As the first disciple of
Jing Yue Sect,

357
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,280

woman who would stay at our Sect

360
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,240
must pass this test.

00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,360
Jiang Mengmeng is no exception.

362
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,800
So you mean

363
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,680

364
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,800

365
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,680

366
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,760
I must know

367
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,960
if she really doesn't love anymore.

368
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,880
Only in this way

369
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,160
can I think of her as one of us

370
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,240
and protect her

371
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,080
from everything that may hurt her.

372
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,400

What's more,

374
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,440
I'll make her

everything she wants.

379
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,880
Don't be dramatic.

380
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,320
You are a man.

381
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,880

383
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,000
are a jinx,

384
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,360
always making trouble.

385
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,240
Now,

386
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,680
you failed to save Mengmeng

387
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,960
and

388
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,320
you are hurt badly.

389
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,560
And you keep moaning

390
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,720
and moaning!

391
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,640
Can't you be gentle?

392
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,360
Now you are giving me orders.

393
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,720
It's done.

394
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,640
I probably should've let you die.

395
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,520
Song Che,

396
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,120
you...

397
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,400
The wound isn't too serious.

398
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,840
It didn't hurt the vital part

399
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,920
after all this.

400
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,360
But...

401
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
Easy!

402
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Alright.

403
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,200
I don't know how to detoxify you.

404
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,560
No other choices.

405
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,440
I have to see Murong Yi.

406
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,000
Maybe he knows how to deal with it.

407
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,360
No.

408
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,440
Don't.

409
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,280
You can't let my brother know.

410
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,120
You are still worried about your brother

411
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,760
even at this moment?

412
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,160
Alright.

413
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,240
I won't go see him.

414
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,280
I'll find you a doctor.

415
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,920
No.

416
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,320
Can't do this,

417
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,880
and can't do that.

418
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,560
Then you can wait here and die.

419
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,760
Anyway,

420
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,600
don't let anyone know

421
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,480
that Mengmeng is practicing
Blood Moon Power.

422
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,160
Okay.

423
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,480
Then

424
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,840
I'll go to Tian Ji Pavilion.

425
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,360
Is that OK?

426
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,440
Don't go there either.

427
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,600
There are no people there right now.

428
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,000
It turns out that Chang Kong and
you are the only two people in it.

429
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,400
What the hell are you doing?

430
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,400
I...

431
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
Never mind.

432
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,880
You won't understand.

433
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,720
Leave me alone.

434
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,160
If you say so,

435
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
I'm leaving!

436
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,400
You think I want to take care of you?

437
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,720
Water.

438
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,600
Water.

439
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,480
You can stay thirsty!

440
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,040
Water.

441
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,280
Drink it.

442
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Cold.

443
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm cold.

444
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,560
You are cold?

445
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,120
I feel cold too!

446
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,560
It's so cold.

447
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,200
Stop it, stop!

448
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,360
Cold.

449
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,040
I feel cold.

450
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,280
It's cold.

451
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,840
You are still cold?

452
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,760
Cold.

453
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,600
Whether you're cold or not,

454
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,320
I don't have any clothes
to take off for you.

455
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,240
I must have owed you something

456
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,000
in my previous life.

457
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,080
Where's Chang Kong now?

458
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,280
At normal times, your sidekick

459
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,000
followed you every day.

460
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,680
Now he's gone when you need him.

461
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,040
That Tian...

462
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Tian Ji Pavilion of yours.

463
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,680
Dismiss it!

464
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,920
All the disciples of Jing Yue
Sect stationed here

465
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,440
were captured.

466
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,990
(Ruo Shui Branch of Jing Yue Sect)

467
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,760
Keep making false
statements to Yu Qingzhu,

468
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,640
according to the data on it,

469
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,960
creating the illusion that this
place is still in normal operation.

470
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
OK.

471
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,290
(Jing Yue Sect)

472
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,240
How many are there so far?

473
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,840
Eight.

474
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,960
Four more to go.

475
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,800
Carry on.

476
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,360
OK.

477
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:59,392
(Jing Yue Sect)

478
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,120
The so-called nirvana

479
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,360
requires you to abandon all the
distracting thoughts and delusions.

480
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,600
You should purify your heart

481
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,560
by abandoning all the
distracting thoughts

482
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,320
and your past,

483
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,760
present and future.

484
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,560
Then you can control
every thought with no thought.

485
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,240
Do you understand?

486
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,760
You mean

487
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,800
I can't be distracted

488
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,320
and must be serious, right?

489
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,160
You can take it that way.

490
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,240
Master,

491
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,920
reports sent by branches.

492
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,200
What did I tell you just now?

493
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,840
Concentrate.

494
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,960
Well done.

495
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,590
(Bamboo Hut in countryside)

496
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,760
Murong Chen.

497
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,000
Murong Chen.

498
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,080
Died?

499
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,000
Are you dead?

500
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,640
It's so hot.

501
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,080
Don't think I'm willing
to take care of you.

502
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,520
I'm just afraid you'll die here.

503
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,080
And then,

504
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,240
your dad,

505
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,960
Chang Kong,

506
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,920
and your brother

507
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,880
will come to kill me.

508
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,440
Murong Chen,

509
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,240
it's time for medicine.

510
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,800
I leave it here.

511
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
There is no way that I will feed you.

512
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,880
Open it!

513
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,120
I haven't even served my father,

514
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,480
let alone my mother.

515
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,040
But why...

516
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,840
When I'm staying with you guys...

517
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,040
That feeling...

518
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,440
