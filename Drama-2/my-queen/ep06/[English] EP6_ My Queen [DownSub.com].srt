(Ling Xi Palace)

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,640
Your Highness.

25
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,520
Why did you do that?

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,480
You have got a cold.

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,200
I never thought he was so cunning.

28
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,760
I can't believe he could
bring a small stove up there.

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,840
Your Highness.

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,000
Xiao Ai thinks that

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,120
you'd better not fight with 5th prince.

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,120
5th prince is so smart.

33
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,080
Xiao Ai thinks that
Your Highness cannot win.

34
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,400
Xiao Ai.

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,600
Which side are you on？

36
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,280
How come you

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,520
boost his morale
instead of ours?

38
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,680
Murong Chen,

39
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,880
you want to play, right?

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,480
I'm going to play it out with you.

41
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,360
What else do you want to do?

42
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,520
Sister queen has run out of
the facial masks that

43
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,520
I gave to her?

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,680
Your Highness, you want to ask
5th prince to stir up a hornet's nest.

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,600
Have you carried it too far?

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,720
It's ok. He is willing to do it.

47
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,480
Just wait and see how he looks.

48
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
Help!

49
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,880
What are you doing?

50
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,400
Yesterday, 5th prince

51
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,080
went to consult the beekeepers,

52
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,040
and borrowed
special clothes and tools.

53
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,480
You win.

54
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,400
You want to make some honey facial masks
for queen.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,720
How about I help you pick the honey?

56
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,000
Is that very touching?

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,360
Hehe.

58
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,200
Where is it?

59
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:48,920
Xiao Ai.

60
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,240
Why does he always have solutions to
problems raised by me?

61
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,000
Xiao Ai.

62
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,040
A lot of bees fly towards us.

63
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,640
Your Highness.

64
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,280
Run.

65
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:05,960
Your Highness.

66
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,720
Run.

67
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,480
Run!

68
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
Run! Your Highness.

69
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,160
Run! Xiao Ai.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
Xiao Ai! Run!

71
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,840
Help!

72
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,480
I

73
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,080
really didn't mean it.

74
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,840
Guess what 9th princess did.

75
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Tell me. Tell me.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,560
She

77
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,280
let 5th prince collect honey.

78
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,400
Finally,

79
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,680
she got stung all over herself.

80
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,240
Well,

81
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,200
it looks like they made a good match.

82
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,600
Yes, I think so.

83
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,440
4th princess.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,840
Oh, so funny.

85
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,280
It is so funny.

86
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,600
I was worried that
they both have a bad temper.

87
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,120
and they would fight a lot.

88
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800
But now, it seems

89
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,200
they are a perfect couple.

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,240
I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

91
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,800
Besides,

92
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,600
sharing happiness is much better than
enjoying happiness by your own.

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,400
Hai Qian.

94
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,520
Fetch me a pen and paper.

95
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,040
I have to write a letter to
Cang Yun Kingdom.

96
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,840
That's impossible.

97
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,080
It's true.

98
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,000
The messengers left this morning.

99
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,200
Your Highness.

100
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,040
What should we do now?

101
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,360
Don't worry.

102
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,720
We can't mess with ourselves.

103
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,040
Princess has a plan?

104
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,400
Under the current situation,

105
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,080
there should be
someone who is more anxious than me.

106
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,960
Your Highness, you mean...

107
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,800
General Song?

108
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes.

109
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,160
But last time
I went to meet him and got stuck.

110
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
If I try again,

111
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,520
he should be very alert.

112
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,320
He can't be fooled easily.

113
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:06,960
By the way,

114
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,800
those maids love to gossip, right?

115
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,400
In the afternoon,
everyone is tired and sleepy.

116
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,440
(Jin Xiu Door)
Cheer up!

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,480
Yes.

118
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,680
9th princess is so smart.

119
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,040
She always comes up with
so many fancy ideas.

120
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,560
5th prince is smarter.

121
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,080
He loves to join her every time.

122
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,800
They're a perfect couple.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,880
Perfect match.

124
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,760
You're right.

125
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,600
Her majesty wrote to
His Majesty in-laws.

126
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,400
Something good is about to happen
in the palace.

127
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,280
Time for shift change.

128
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,760
I got to go.

129
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,000
It's weird.

130
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Normally, Deputy General

131
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,280
will talk about all the details
before he leaves.

132
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,480
Why is he in such a hurry today?

133
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,130
(Ling Xi Palace)

134
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,880
Xiao Ai.

135
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,640
When can we recover?

136
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,520
Though I'm not pretty,

137
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,640
but I have delicate features.

138
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,880
Such bee stings,

139
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,600
really affect my appearance.

140
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,880
These days,

141
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,640
I can't look straight up.

142
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,040
By the way, Your Highness,

143
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,120
this is for you.

144
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,880
What's it?

145
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,360
This is...

146
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,480
Why am I starting to speak like them?

147
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,480
What's this stuff?

148
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,680
I found it last time

149
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,280
when I was washing your clothes.

150
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,000
Which clothes?

151
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,480
The clothes you wore

152
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,120
when you got in danger.

153
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,120
When?

154
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,120
Is this what Yun Ya left me?

155
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,560
(I decided not to follow his plot line.)

156
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,680
(Why did he leave this for me?)

157
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,920
I want to forget it.

158
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,720
But I can't.

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,120
I want to throw it away.

160
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,440
But I hold it tightly.

161
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,360
I want to escape.

162
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,280
But it's also in vain.

163
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,400
Does it mean...

164
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,080
What do you mean?

165
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,720
What do you mean?

166
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,920
I mean, we're good friends.

167
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,640
But you go into a girl's room
without asking.

168
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,280
That's a little bit rude, right?

169
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,280
I'm sorry, Mengmeng.

170
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,720
I was in a hurry.

171
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,080
Sorry. I was a little bit rude.

172
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,440
Because they said...

173
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,000
Because they said...

174
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
Murong Chen and you...

175
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,040
Is that true?

176
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,520
(Is the fact that I got stung like this)

177
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,320
(spread all over the palace?)

178
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,400
(I've been so quiet lately.)

179
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,320
(I have just stayed at home.)

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
Really?

181
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,600
Song Che.

182
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,320
I never thought
you were that gossipy before.

183
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,120
Now,
you come here to prove it by yourself.

184
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,880
Ok, then.

185
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,880
Look,

186
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,440
this is the fact.

187
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Do you really

188
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,640
like him?

189
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,680
What?

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,960
4th princess came to warn me

191
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,680
that you were
intimate with Murong Chen.

192
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,280
I didn't believe her.

193
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,040
But I never thought

194
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,600
you would accept the marriage.

195
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,560
You have no regard for my feelings.

196
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,840
Oh, my goodness.

197
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,040
I forgot that there is

198
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,400
a plot line of childhood sweetheart.

199
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,200
Song Che.

200
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,680
I think.

201
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,320
I have to explain more.

202
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
I had

203
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,800
amnesia before,

204
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,920
then I

205
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,000
misunderstood that

206
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,360
I...

207
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,400
I...

208
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,160
like you.

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,480
But,

210
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,600
after we met several times,

211
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,520
I think you are my good friend.

212
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,080
Good, good...

213
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,080
good friend,

214
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,920
like my relative and brother.

215
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,240
But, it is...

216
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,000
Why are you telling me this now?

217
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,520
You came to my mansion that day,

218
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,760
and told me

219
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,480
your engagement to Murong Chen was fake.

220
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,480
You also wanted to escape from
the palace

221
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,280
to  live a free life.

222
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,640
Do you know how happy I was?

223
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,680
I went to Bai Hua Village
to save you.

224
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,200
You cried and fell into my arms.

225
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,360
I swore

226
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,840
I would protect you forever.

227
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,600
And when you got lost,

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
I thought I was going to lose you
for the rest of my life.

229
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,080
It was a pain

230
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,640
I had never felt
in my near-death experience

231
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,800
on the battlefield.

232
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,960
Over and over again,

233
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,080
You've made me feel happy of finding
what I have lost.

234
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,840
Now, you tell me

235
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,240
I still lose you.

236
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,080
You don't lose me.

237
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,560
We are good friends,

238
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,240
the same as before.

239
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,520
We were friends before.

240
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,120
But from now on,

241
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,960
we are not.

242
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,400
Why is this man so stubborn?

243
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,320
Does a game of finding love

244
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,960
really need to be like this?

245
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,520
This is the birth information
of 9th princess

246
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,040
sent by Her Majesty.

247
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,400
Your Highness and 9th princess's
wedding date has been set.

248
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,760
According to the traditions, it is
necessary to exchange birth information.

249
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,880
The birth information of Your Highness
has been sent to Her Majesty.

250
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,840
This is the birth information of

251
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,280
9th princess.

252
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,960
It will be sent to Cang Yun Kingdom

253
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,520
Your Highness wants to have a look?

254
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,200
No.

255
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:23,260
(Ling Xi Palace)

256
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,280
Well, I can go out now.

257
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,720
Too bad.

258
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,760
As a homebody in the game,
I've had a hard time.

259
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,960
No soap operas.

260
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,760
No variety shows.

261
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,200
I will be a fool
when keep being a homebody.

262
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,480
I'm going out.

263
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,640
On the left side, draw Yun Ya.

264
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,480
On the right side,
draw a pair of mandarin ducks.

265
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,360
Place them here.

266
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,600
Hurry up.

267
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,880
Put them here.

268
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,240
Ok, you can leave.

269
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,760
What's this?

270
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,440
Sister queen is so generous.

271
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,000
I just hurt a little bit,

272
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,000
and took a few days of rest.

273
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,120
I am too embarrassed to accept them.

274
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,760
9th princess,

275
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,160
these are not from Her Majesty.

276
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,280
Not from her?

277
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,040
Who sent them?

278
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,240
Jiang Hao?

279
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,080
No.

280
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,120
These are

281
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,480
engagement gifts from Cang Yun Kingdom.

282
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,360
Engagement gifts?

283
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,360
The wedding will be held
in February next year.

284
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,880
On 18th birthday
of 9th princess.

285
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,040
Oh, my goodness.

286
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,160
Your Highness.

287
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,360
I have gone too far.

288
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,080
I have finally decided what I want,

289
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,400
but I am now led by the plot.

290
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,680
It is the destiny.

291
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,480

don't marry him.

I am a princess.

315
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,120
I can't decide many things by myself.

316
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,400
In order to break off the engagement,

317
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,040
I have tried every method.

318
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,560
As a result, things always

go in the opposite direction.

346
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,560
I'm the heroine.

347
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,760
I can decide

348
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,560
how to play the game.

349
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,040
Xiao Ai.

350
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,880
(Luming Terrace)
What are they celebrating for?

351
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,760
Four princes

352
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,640
are discussing to hold a

353
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,840
party for 5th prince,

354
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,040
to celebrate the end of his single life.

355
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,920
Oh, a bachelor party?

356
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,240
I didn't realize my brothers
were so fashionable.

357
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,720
That's not right.

358
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,600
They're my brothers.

359
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,640
Why do they hold a party
for Murong Chen?

360
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,280
It's called "celebration".

361
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,280
Actually,

362
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,560
the princes are worried about
9th princess and

363
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,800
want to take advantage of
this opportunity to

364
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,800
test the prospective bridegroom.

365
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,560
That means that

366
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,800
all the men in this palace

367
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,120
will join the party?

368
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,160
Let's go.

369
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,680
Song Che

370
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,600
is absolutely useless.

371
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,160
It looks like this marriage

372
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,480
is inevitable.

373
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,360
That is not necessary.

374
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,080
Though I cannot rely on Song Che,

375
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
I can do it myself.

376
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,000
Your Highness.

377
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,880
I feel upset.

378
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,160
Leave me alone.

379
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,280
Yes.

380
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,280
Don't look at me like that.

381
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,520
I didn't do it deliberately.

382
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,560
All the men in the palace
are going to Luming Terrace tonight

383
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,480
to join the party.

384
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,080
I won't get a chance if I don't go.

385
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,000
It's not a poison.

386
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,720
When I was making facial masks,

387
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,720
I also developed
this soothing fragrance.

388
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
I know
you're not comfortable being tied up.

389
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,280
It would be better to fall asleep.

390
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,560
Just be obedient and

391
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,920
get a good sleep.

392
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,040
After I leave,

393
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,280
you can't avoid punishment.

394
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Take good care of yourself.

395
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,480
Come on.

396
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,240
Cheers.

397
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,640
5th prince.

398
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,840
We have a tradition.

399
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,920
Among brothers,

400
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,000
we should have two drinks.

401
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,200
It means

402
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,320
brotherhood with deep ties.

403
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:31,760
Come on.

404
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,280
5th prince.

405
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,360
Come on!

406
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,960
Wine tasting is decent.

407
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,600
But it's tacky when you drink too much.

408
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,040
5th prince.

409
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,520
Try my cherry wine.

410
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
Quite decent!

411
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,760
Please try it.

412
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,760
It is made of the wild goose purple

413
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,200
sweet cherries that
were picked in April.

414
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,840
This kind of cherry is

415
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,760
juicy and sweet.

416
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,480
It is good for making wine.

417
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,280
Nice.

418
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,920
Cheers.

419
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,360
We drink with the 5th prince.

420
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,480
One more drink.

421
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,400
How is it?

422
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,440
Good.

423
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,680
5th prince.

424
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,640
You can't drink too much,

425
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,920
or you will be drunk.

426
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,640
You're so mean.

427
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,120
You're so mean.

428
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,690
(Luming Terrace)

429
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,280
Cheers.

430
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,120
Chang Kong.

431
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,160
You have one drink, too.

432
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,360
No.

433
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,640
Why are you so serious?

434
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,240
Look, everyone is drinking

435
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,200
except you.

436
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,360
How disappointing!

437
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,680
I need to take care of His Highness
and send him back later.

438
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,640
Only one drink.

439
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,720
Moreover,

440
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,280
so many brothers here

441
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,720
can help you send
Your Highness back.

442
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,640
Then, I will have

443
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:47,960
one drink.

444
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,520
Let's go.

445
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,000
Two bees...

446
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,800
Come on!

447
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,040
Two bees...

448
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,720
Flying in the flowers...

449
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,000
Flying...

450
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,680
Flying...

451
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,360
Flying...

452
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,480
Flying...

453
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,520
Flying...

454
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,320
5th prince.

455
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,360
5th prince.

456
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,240
I need to ask you some questions.

457
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:11,920
Tell me.

458
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,560
Before you met Mengmeng,

459
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,080
have you been with other girls?

460
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,600
Yes, of course.

461
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,760
Miao Miao.

462
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,560
I used to spend a lot of time with her.

463
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,400
She liked to hug me,

464
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,280
and kiss me.

465
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,600
She slept with me every night.

466
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,520
Hug you?

467
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,000
Kiss you?

468
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,720
Sleep with you?

469
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,400
Is Miao Miao

470
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,520
pretty?

471
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,960
Very pretty.

472
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,000
Her eyes are dark blue,

473
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,600
as gemstone.

474
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,400
And her fur is very bright.

475
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,160
Her paws are pink.

476
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,960
5th prince is talking about

477
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,920
a cat?

478
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,160
Right,
what do you think I'm talking about?

479
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,960
Oh, a cat.

480
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,960
Come on.

481
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,360
(Luming Terrace)
Keep drinking.

482
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
One more drink.

483
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,000
5th prince.

484
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,960
You're good at drinking.

485
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,120
You're really good at drinking.

486
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,480
Cheers.

487
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,760
(Yun Jin Door)

488
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,520
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hit you.

489
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,760
I'm so sorry.

490
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,720
It's my fault.

491
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,760
It doesn't matter.

492
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,480
I have to go now.

493
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,720
So dangerous. So dangerous.

494
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,120
I almost got caught.

495
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,280
But that voice sounded
a little familiar.

496
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,640
Just forget it.

497
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,360
Escaping is more important.

498
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,280
One more drink.

499
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,040
I wonder who drank a little.

500
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,680
The eunuch's voice sounded

501
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,200
a little bit familiar.

502
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,280
Forget it.

503
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,640
Mind my own business first.

504
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,520
Come and help me stand up.

505
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,120
One more drink.

506
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:36,960
Ok.

507
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,960
I will help you stand up.

508
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,520
Let's go.

509
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:40,920
Let's go.

510
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,000
Be careful.

511
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,920
Here we are.

512
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,440
Come on.

513
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,720
Drink more. Drink more.

514
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,600
Come here and lie down.

515
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,200
Drink more.

516
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,080
Finally, just you and me.

517
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,600
After tonight,

518
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,840
you are my man.

519
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,920
At that time,

520
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,520
what's done cannot be undone.

521
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,800
Even if 9th princess
does not detest you,

522
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,520
sister queen will never let

523
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,560
a man who had lost his virginity
before marriage to marry 9th princess.

524
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,520
Your Highness is so smart.

525
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,120
How to deal with 4th princess?

527
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,240
Leave her to you.

Yes.

529
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,080
You really want to run away.

530
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,040
You really hate me so much?

531
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,000
You would rather run away

532
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,640
than marry me.

533
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,240
I hope when you wake up tomorrow,

534
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,840
you will not be too angry.

Wake up. Wake up.

Let's go.

541
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,800
Why was I sleeping here?

542
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,000
Stop.

543
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,160
No. No. No.

544
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,200

No. No.

546
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,480
We didn't do anything.

547
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,320
We didn't do anything.

548
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,400
Don't get me wrong.

549
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,640

Don't...

552
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,120
When I was drunk,

553
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,040
you didn't have to do that to me.

554
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,000
You know.

555
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
I will not reject you.

I really didn't do that.

559
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,480
Who wrote this stupid script?

560
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,240
Last night, at Luming Terrace,

561
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,880
9th princess was in a hurry,

562
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,320
and slept with bridegroom.

563
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,760
It was a wonderful scene!

00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,520

566
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,080
It's time to have a meal.

567
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,560
I don't want to eat,

568
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,760
and drink.

569
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,560
I'm uncomfortable.

570
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,320
Your Majesty is thinking about
the affair of 9th princess

571
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,080
and 5th prince?

572
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,800
Yes.

573
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,680
I never know what Mengmeng

574
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,880
will do next.

575
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,360
Maybe,

576
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,640
we are the same.

577
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,080
At that time, I also...

578
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,960
I've gotten carried away.

579
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,760
What happened last night
has been spread all over the palace.

580
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,200
If I had known that
this was going to happen,

581
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,600
I would not

582
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,120
write the letter,

583
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,440
check their birth information,
and plan the wedding date.

584
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,520
As soon as the marriage competition
was over,

585
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,320
I would just send them

586
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,360
straight to the bridal chamber.

587
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,360
Your Majesty.

588
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,080
This affair is neither big nor small.

589
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,880
Go on.

590
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:38,920
Sure.

591
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,440
That's good. Just do it.

592
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,160
I was in the imperial garden last night.

593
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,280
Why was I in Murong Chen's bed?

594
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,040
The system

595
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,000
had to fix the bug

596
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,120
of the plot created by me

597
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,160
and sent me here again?

598
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,840
Or,

599
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,720
this is where the world line ends.

600
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,280
No matter how far
I am from the original plot line,

601
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,360
I have to be back here.

602
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Your Highness, what's a "bug"?

603
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,480
And what is a "world line"?

604
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,840
It is...

605
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,160
Here comes the imperial edict.

606
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,530
(The Imperial Edict)

607
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,200
According to the queen's edict,

608
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,960
Murong Chen,
5th prince of Cang Yun Kingdom

609
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,320
is nice, gentle, brilliant and handsome.

610
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,000
I appreciate that.

611
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,000
9th princess has chosen him
as her fiance.

612
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,920
They love each other and

613
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,240
they are a perfect couple.

614
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,040
I am quite pleased.

615
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,360
So I choose the date

616
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,880
after 7 days,
to hold the engagement ceremony.

617
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,280
Issued by Her Majesty.

618
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,520
Your Highness.

619
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,080
Xiao Ai. A Liang.

620
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,440
What happened just now?

621
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,960
Maidservant Hai
came to issue the edict.

622
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,720
After 7 days,

623
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,440
she will hold an engagement ceremony

624
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,600
for you and 5th prince.

625
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,600
I must have been dreaming.

626
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,280
Your Highness.

627
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,680
The edict is on your hand.

628
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,200
Oh, Mr. system.

629
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,160
Why do you treat me like this?

630
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,440
(Han Yuan Palace)

631
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,360
You have to help me escape.

632
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,320
Be quiet.

633
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,440
Why?

634
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,800
Do you need to ask?

635
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,080
I don't want to get married.

636
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,320
I don't want to marry Murong Chen.

637
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,600
But, you two have...

638
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,760
agreed this marriage, right?

639
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,440
Moreover, you two have already...

640
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,080
It's hard for me to explain more now.

641
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:08,840
In a word,

642
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,640
last time, it was a misunderstanding.

643
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,240
This time, it is an accident.

644
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,320
Song Che.

645
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,120
Don't worry.

646
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,000
I will never give you a hard time.

647
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,200
I am just thinking that

648
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,080
you are a guard of the palace,

649
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,640
and if I try to escape,

650
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,240
can you please do me a favor?

651
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,800
Let me go.

652
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,640
Sorry.

653
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,040
I can't help 9th princess.

654
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,680
Song Che.

655
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,000
At least think about it
before you say no.

656
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,080
We have been friends
for more than ten years.

657
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,360
You have to help me.

658
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,640
Yes.

659
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,360
Friends for more than ten years.

660
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,560
Now,

661
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,720
I realize that
I don't even know you.

662
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,400
What do you mean?

663
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,160
Sometimes,
you rejected me because of Murong Chen.

664
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,040
Sometimes, you tried to be close to me,
in order to escape from the marriage.

665
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,760
You played with my emotions
over and over again.

666
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,200
Is it fun?

667
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,840
You mean that

668
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,440
I played with your emotions?

669
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:04,880
Otherwise?

670
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,680
When you hurt me badly,

671
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,160
did you ever think of
our over 10 years' friendship?

672
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,560
Now, as you need me,

673
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,440
you mention this friendship.

674
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,840
I, Song Che, is straightforward.

675
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,920
But I am not stupid.

676
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,160
I don't want to be led around

677
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,720
by the nose like a stupid cow.

678
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,840
Why did Mr. System arrange

679
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,960
this kind of guy for me?

680
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,720
Song Che.

681
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,160
Listen to me.

682
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,880
I, Jiang Mengmeng,

683
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,240
has never played with your emotions.

684
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,960
From the beginning,

685
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,680
you have been my best friend.

686
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,560
I have treated you sincerely.

687
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,800
Today,

688
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,400
I also treat you as my best friend.

689
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,360
So I come to ask for your help.

690
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,120
Fine.

691
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,760
You don't want to help me.

692
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,160
I don't blame you.

693
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,360
But you can't
judge me with the malice.

694
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,720
I, Jiang Mengmeng,
am not that kind of person.

695
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,760
I don't believe that

696
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,280
I can't figure it out.

697
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,360
My opponent

698
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,800
is not Murong Chen.

699
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,680
(Character Relationship Map)
Not Jiang Sisi.

700
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,800
Not any of the people here.

701
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,840
My biggest opponent

702
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,240
is Mr. System.

703
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,560
It should be the plot.

704
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,200
To reverse the trend,

705
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,160
I have to find the breakthrough

706
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,120
in this system.

707
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,120
Mr. System said

708
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,960
this is a system of ancient world style.

709
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,160
And I've spent
most of my time at the palace.

710
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,560
So I only focus on the palace.

711
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,240
But the plot and character
relationship outside the palace

712
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,160
are more important.

713
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,480
Stealing flowers
in the Lantern Festival.

714
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,400
Finding flowers
in Bai Hua Village.

715
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,240
The account book of Qian Xiu Workshop.

716
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,920
Assassination by the river.

717
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,440
Blood night-blooming cereus.

718
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,240
Until now,

719
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,840
all the plots here

720
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,480
are related to
blood night-blooming cereus.

721
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,600
I thought

722
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,560
it would be a game of finding love.

723
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,840
Normally,

724
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,880
I'm the heroine
and I should be the focus of the game.

725
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,200
However,

726
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,200
blood night-blooming cereus
is the focus of the game.

727
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,840
Golden flowers.

728
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,520
Stallholders.

729
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,520
That's not right.

730
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,520
They're all game characters.

731
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,400
(Xiao Ai, Murong Chen, Jiang Sisi)
Then,

732
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,040
(Song Che, 8th Prince, Yun Ya)
the one related to ancient world is

733
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,360
Yun Ya.

734
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,920
Yun Ya
and blood night-blooming cereus...

735
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,000
Your Highness.

736
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,240
Her Majesty has asked me to bring
the engagement dress

737
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,320
to Your Highness for trying it.

738
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,840
Don't talk about engagement.

739
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,200
I find it very annoying.

740
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,360
If Your Highness doesn't
want to get engaged,

741
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,400
Xiao Ai has an idea.

742
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,840
Tell me.

743
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,000
