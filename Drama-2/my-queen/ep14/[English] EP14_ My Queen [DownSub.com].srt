That's amazing!

You are so brilliant.

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,320
Oh,

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,360
Landlord Lu,

28
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,080
why did you build such a mansion

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,280
in a place where a family
was slaughtered?

30
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,960
Murong Chen,

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,240
stop talking nonsense!

32
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,200
It's scary.

33
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,200
It's not me who said it.

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,040
It's from a book.

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,800
Book?

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,480
Book?

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,560
What book?

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,800
The one that Chang Kong usually reads,

39
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,880
World Memoir.

40
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,760
Me?

41
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,200
Yes,

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,120
I read it a lot.

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,920
The book said that

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
11 years ago,

45
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,560
Jing Yue Sect was

46
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,720
leading the martial arts circle

47
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
and did evil things.

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,920
The leader Yu Qingzhu wanted to
practice Blood Moon Power and forced

49
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,640
Cereus Villa to hand in

50
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,600
the blood night-blooming cereus
they had been developing for years.

51
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,840
It's said that this flower
blooms only once per 100 years.

52
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,800
Of course, the landlord of Cereus Villa

53
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,440
would not be willing to hand it over.

54
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,520
So, Yu Qingzhu slaughtered them all

55
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,680
out of anger.

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,480
She killed more than 100 people,

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,720
stole the blood night-blooming cereus,

58
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,240
and then burned Cereus Villa

59
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,920
into ash.

60
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,920
Which means

61
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,000
this place...

62
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,480
No. No. No. It's not possible.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,680
It just occurred to me too.

64
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,840
Oh, Chang Kong,

65
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,640
the Cereus Villa mentioned in the book

66
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,560
seems to be this place, right?

67
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,680
Yes, Your Highness.

68
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,920
Such a street flimflam.

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,680
It's all bullshit.

70
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,440
I can't believe that you
actually bought it.

71
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,240
Exactly.

72
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,640
Are you saying that it's not
true that Jing Yue Sect

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,640
slaughtered Cereus Villa,

74
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,960
or it's not true that Egret Villa

75
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,840
used to be Cereus Villa?

76
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,080
As far as I'm concerned,

77
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,200
none of them sounds reliable.

78
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,680
Murong Chen,

79
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,480
stop reading that kind of raving books

80
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,960
or scaring others.

81
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,800
I...

82
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,240
I did not try to scare you.

83
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,440
If you don't believe it,

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,200
you can ask Landlord Lu about it.

85
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,880
Landlord Lu?

86
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,280
I'm just a businessman and

87
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,840
I don't know much about
those historical stuff.

88
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,800
I bought this villa last year,

89
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,000
but back then,

90
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,840
I did so only because
the land was cheap.

91
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,600
As for what happened here before,

92
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,080
I have no idea.

93
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,920
I'm sure that

94
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,000
you were fooled by someone

95
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,280
and bought this haunted place.

96
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,440
Save it, Murong Chen.

97
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,040
It's getting dark.

98
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,360
I've prepared nice rooms for everyone.

99
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,680
After having dinner,

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,480
I will lead you to the rooms to rest.

101
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,560
Thank you so much.

102
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,360
After this long journey,

103
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,480
we finally had something nice to eat

104
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,040
and a place to sleep.

105
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,600
What's on your mind, Murong Chen?

106
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,920
You all think

107
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,800
this Lu Feibai is not suspicious?

108
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,240
You just had a meal that he provided

109
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,640
and now you are talking bad behind him?

110
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,440
Come on.

111
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,960
I think he's quite a nice person.

112
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,000
What's nice about him?

113
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,480
He's good-looking,

114
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,440
full of wisdom,

115
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,520
good at business,

116
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,880
straightforward, welcoming and friendly.

117
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,160
Isn't he nice?

118
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,000
You've only known him for one day,

119
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,920
and you are now complimenting him.

120
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,840
You can ask Xiao Ai and Zhe Xiang

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,080
and see if they feel the same way.

122
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,360
Why are you all so easy to be fooled?

123
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,880
- Easy to be fooled?
- Actually,

124
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,280
I think that Lu Feibai

125
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,920
is a nice person.

126
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,800
Song Che,

127
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,400
how could you get bribed

128
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,520
only by a meal?

129
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,040
No.

130
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,960
I did not like him

131
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,240
when I just met him.

132
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,320
But look,

133
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,720
you talked about

134
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
such horrible things that
happened here before,

135
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,640
and you were saying
this place was haunted.

136
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
But he did not haggle over it

137
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,800
or drug you in the meal.

138
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,040
Based on that,

139
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,120
he seems to have a lot of tolerance.

140
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,640
How does it make him have
tolerance just by not drugging me?

141
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,800
What kind of logic is that?

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,720
Then you tell me,

143
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,840
why are you so sure
that he's suspicious?

144
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,480
I have proof.

145
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,440
What proof?

146
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,360
My proof is that

147
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,680
when I asked him about

148
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,120
why he bought this place,

149
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,400
he

150
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,560
smiled at me.

151
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,560
I'm not finished.

152
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,480
Listen to me.

153
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,200
Well,

154
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,480
when we just got here,

155
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,160
he showed two personalities, didn't he?

156
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,280
He was very nice and friendly

157
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,040
when he welcomed you ladies,

158
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,200
with passion.

159
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,880
However, in front of Song Che,

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,640
Chang Kong and me,

161
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,960
he was cold

162
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,960
and indifferent.

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,760
However, he smiled at me in the room.

164
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,600
There must be something wrong with him.

165
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,000
Murong Chen,

166
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,000
you should've tried to
make up the story better.

167
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,600
So

168
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,120
none of you believe in me?

169
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:36,880
Alright.

170
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,680
Everyone must be tired.

171
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,560
Let's all go back to sleep.

172
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,960
Let's go back to sleep. Let's go back.

173
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,280
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

174
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,160
You should sleep early. Sleep.

175
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,560
Good night, Mengmeng.

176
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,520
Let's go.

177
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,200
Mengmeng.

178
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,400
Why are you back...

179
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,520
Have a seat.

180
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,720
Sit down, sit down.

181
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,720
What are you doing?

182
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,680
Listen to me.

183
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,160
It's okay if they don't believe me.

184
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,200
But it's different with us.

185
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,160
Why don't you believe me, either?

186
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,960
I know what you are thinking.

187
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,920
Think about it.

188
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,800
This Egret Villa

189
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,880
made such a cunning movement to

190
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,320
purchase so much pigment
from Qian Xiu Workshop.

191
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,120
Not to mention that Lu Feibai

192
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,600
was specialized in
fake goods business.

193
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,720
So it was totally
possible for Lu Feibai

194
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,480
to be the leader behind this.

195
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,800
Then why were you...

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,040
But have you ever considered that

197
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,800
the signature on
Qian Xiu Workshop's account book

198
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,400
is Egret Villa

199
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,720
instead of Lu Feibai?

200
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,200
You are saying...

201
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,640
I'm saying that

202
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,200
think about it,

203
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,480
Egret Villa is such large-scaled.

204
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,160
There must be lots of
people ruled by Lu Feibai.

205
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,160
Yes, it is possible
that Lu Feibai did it.

206
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,920
But it's also possible that

207
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,160
one of his subordinates did it

208
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,560
by covering it under
the name of Egret Villa.

209
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,560
If we act so hastily

210
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,960
and question Lu Feibai,

211
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,240
it is not only highly possible
for us to point at the wrong person

212
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,880
and wrong him,

213
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,160
but also alert the enemy

214
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,800
and scare away the
real person behind it.

215
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,640
You have a point.

216
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,040
Don't tell me that you are saying this

217
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,240
because he's gentle, passionate

218
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,800
and considerate.

219
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,280
Why are you reciting my lines?

220
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,040
No, I mean,

221
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,680
do I look like that kind of person

222
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,120
who only cares about handsome guys?

223
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,320
Definitely.

224
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,720
But you're right.

225
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,160
Even with such handsome,

226
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,160
good-looking guy like me,

227
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,880
you were also...

228
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,240
OK, I see.

229
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,560
Murong Chen,

230
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,520
if you really think like that,

231
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,960
let's separate.

232
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,760
- Wait.
- Anything else?

233
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Where are you going?

234
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,360
I'm going back to my room.

235
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,360
Here...

236
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
This room is yours.

237
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,520
Go back to your room.

238
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,800
Alright.

239
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,160
I'm being serious.

240
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,600
This Lu Feibai is the
most suspicious one.

241
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,040
I will find proof to show you.

242
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,000
What's your plan?

243
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,440
Aren't you afraid that
we might alert the enemy?

244
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,560
It's time now.

245
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,560
It's easy to get things done at night.

246
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,360
There must be something wrong with

247
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
gathering at such late night.

248
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,640
(I paid close attention to
this place in the daytime,)

249
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,280
(and I didn't find anything suspicious.)

250
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,000
(What exactly did I miss?)

251
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,320
(It's cold,)

252
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,480
(which means that)

253
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,200
(those people were here just now,)

254
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,800
(but did not turn on the light.)

255
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,600
(No light was needed,)

256
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,520
(which means this is
not their destination,)

257
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,200
(but just a passway.)

258
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,280
(Vase, cup, red coral,
and luminous pearl)

259
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,280
(are all movable.)

260
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,080
(They can't be the switch.)

261
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,000
(Then it must be...)

262
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,440
This painting is real.

263
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,840
The real may be fake,
and the fake may be real.

264
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,800
This Lu Feibai is so interesting.

265
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,680
Among so many fake things,

266
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,120
there's actually something genuine.

267
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,270
(Secret Chamber of Egret Villa)

268
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,840
So many!

269
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,720
Such a businessman.

270
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,640
Who is it?

271
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,800
Mengmeng, it's me,

272
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,920
Lu Feibai.

273
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,960
Childe Lu.

274
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,600
Why did you come here at this late time?

275
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,360
I'm delivering some quilts for everyone.

276
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,200
That's so nice of you.

277
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,280
As the landlord, you deliver
the quilts on your own?

278
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,680
I was neglectful and
I'm trying to do my best.

279
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,880
Then, rest well.

280
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,040
Good night, Mengmeng.

281
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,040
Wait.

282
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,320
Landlord, are you going to deliver
the quilts for everyone else?

283
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,200
- Yes.
- (Holy shit.)

284
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,000
(Murong Chen is not
in his room right now.)

285
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,720
Well,

286
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,720
Childe Lu,

287
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,400
would you like to have a cup of tea?

288
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,800
I have some business-related topics

289
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,520
that I would like to discuss with you.

290
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,520
Sure.

291
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,880
Sit down, please.

292
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,920
I will drop the quilt first.

293
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,160
- You can go back first.
- OK.

294
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,320
(Why is he still not coming out?)

295
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,480
(Did anything happen?)

296
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,840
(Why is she here?)

297
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,280
Is this the best you
can do, sneak attack,

298
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,440
when you can't beat someone?

299
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,640
Who said that I can't beat you?

300
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,120
I was just testing your

301
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,520
reaction speed.

302
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,920
At Yun Xiang House,

303
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,560
in the Fog Forest,

304
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,120
and along the way,

305
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,840
you never won me.

306
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,440
I have reasons

307
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,680
which prevented me
from using my best power.

308
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,200
You are so good at comforting yourself.

309
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:42,840
You...

310
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,800
There's no use to talk to you more.

311
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,760
Get ready.

312
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,880
Limited edition.

313
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,840
Designer collection.

314
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,040
Celebrity favorite.

315
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,480
Special offers.

316
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,200
Clearance sales.

317
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,000
Purchase limitation.

318
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,920
Double 11.

319
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,800
Double 12.

320
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,160
Mengmeng is such a
rare talent for business.

321
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,200
How did I never think about

322
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,400
the ideas that you mentioned?

323
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,480
(No, I'm not a rare talent.)

324
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,160
(In reality, my purse was drained)

325
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,920
(because of all these
marketing strategies.)

326
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,200
(Why is Murong Chen
still not coming back?)

327
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,560
(I've already shared
everything I can think of.)

328
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,680
(If he doesn't come back soon,
there's not much I can do.)

329
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,000
It was very helpful to discuss all these

330
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,200
with you tonight.

331
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,680
I will deeply study about
these strategies after I get back,

332
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,360
and I'm sure that they will
help me become more successful.

333
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,520
Childe Lu,

334
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,680
I suddenly remember that

335
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,560
there's one more strategy,

336
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,960
a strategy called...

337
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
monthly renewal.

338
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,600
Monthly renewal?
[*Renewal sounds like pimping in Chinese]

339
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,320
Right.

340
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,600
I'm afraid that this kind
of business is a little...

341
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,800
No, you are getting me wrong.

342
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,440
It's not the kind of renewal
that you are thinking.

343
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,440
This renewal is

344
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,240
actually a VIP policy.

345
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,240
VIP?

346
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,080
What is that?

347
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,440
VIP

348
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,480
is a kind of membership policy.

349
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,960
Why are these two fighting each other?

350
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,600
You gave up?

351
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,880
Are you scared of me?

352
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,320
I should actually get going.

353
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,600
It's getting too late.

354
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,320
Well,

355
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,440
Childe Lu,

356
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,600
then I will see you off.

357
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,160
Thank you for the treat.

358
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,040
Don't forget to have breakfast.

359
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,640
However, Zhe Xiang.

360
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,600
You went too far, didn't you?

361
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,960
He picked up the fight first.

362
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,400
I just wanted to practice
with this woman.

363
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,040
Who would know

364
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,600
this woman is so brutal?

365
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,560
I actually think that

366
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,720
Zhe Xiang is very nice.

367
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,240
You picked up the fight,

368
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,320
but she didn't beat you to death

369
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,200
or get you handicapped.

370
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,080
It seems that she has tolerance.

371
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,880
Murong Chen, you...

372
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,720
I...

373
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,760
Don't move.

374
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,960
Childe Lu.

375
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:15,800
Is he OK?

376
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,640
Please forgive us.

377
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,640
These friends of mine were too active.

378
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Sorry for the trouble.

379
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,560
We might have to bother
you for one more day.

380
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,080
I've said that

381
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
you can stay as long as you want.

382
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,000
I would like to discuss more

383
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,480
about business strategies with you.

384
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,800
This is the medicine
for treating injury.

385
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,680
Thank you.

386
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,320
Then I will leave for now.

387
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,160
Please come to me whenever
you need something.

388
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,240
Of course,

389
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,680
feel free to bother me for no reason.

390
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,760
OK.

391
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,320
You are sure that you saw it last night?

392
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,120
What?

393
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,440
Are you still believing
that he's innocent?

394
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,400
Just because

395
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,200
you spent the whole night
talking about business with him?

396
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,560
Murong Chen,

397
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,280
what kind of words are those?

398
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,880
You think I enjoyed talking with him?

399
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,400
You didn't know how much effort

400
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,800
I put into convincing him to stay

401
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,200
the other night just to cover for you.

402
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,480
I've told him everything.

403
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,800
The next thing I could think
of is to knock him off.

404
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,440
Did you really think this way?

405
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,200
Otherwise?

406
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,960
I really don't know what is

407
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,400
in your head.

408
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,640
I'm thinking about you.

409
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
What?

410
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,480
I way saying

411
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,520
I'm thinking about
bringing you to the basement.

412
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,960
Everything would come into light then.

413
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,080
Here.

414
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,680
There's really a secret path here.

415
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,440
Quickly, go inside.

416
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,080
There's a snake.

417
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,600
Snake! Snake!

418
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,240
Where is it?

419
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,520
- Where is it?
- Snake!

420
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,800
Where is it?

421
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,120
You didn't see them yesterday?

422
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
No, I didn't see them yesterday.

423
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,040
Why did they show up today?

424
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,760
Why is it not moving?

425
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,960
It's OK.

426
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,920
It's just a rope.

427
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,480
You can come down.

428
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:42,920
Really?

429
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,920
It's OK. I'm here.

430
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,800
Don't be afraid.

431
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,880
It's really a rope.

432
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,240
It scared me to death.

433
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,920
Over there.

434
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,480
Let's go.

435
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,600
Murong Chen,

436
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,880
didn't you say that

437
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,800
this place is full of fake blood
night-blooming cereus?

438
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,880
It's so strange.

439
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,920
I'm sure that I did...

440
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,560
Why are they gone just in one day?

441
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,480
Come on, Murong Chen.

442
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,160
Are you bringing me here for fun?

443
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,120
No, I actually saw it yesterday.

444
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,960
This is where Lu Feibai
makes fake stuff.

445
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,520
If you want drinks,

446
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,240
you can just say it.

447
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,120
I'm a generous person,

448
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,680
and if you ask me for it,

449
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,800
I would definitely give to you.

450
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,920
Why are you all here?

451
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,520
Brother Lu said that
he has medicinal liquor

452
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,800
for me to recover sooner,

453
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,320
so he took all of us here.

454
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Medicinal liquor?

455
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,160
Such a nice move, Lu Feibai.

456
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,360
I can't believe that you
brought everyone here.

457
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,240
Seems like the guilty
party files the suit first.

458
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
I don't know whether
I did something wrong

459
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,720
to upset you

460
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,880
and make you talk bad about me.

461
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,480
I think he's just envying you.

462
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,880
Song Che,

463
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,760
can you think before you do anything?

464
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,880
You are the one who made a mistake.

465
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,160
Why are you blaming me?

466
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,760
- Me?
- I know.

467
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,240
I'm like an old friend with Mengmeng

468
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,800
and we got close to each other.

469
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,960
I'm afraid that you're
upset because of that.

470
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
But I just...

471
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,600
Although I own this
villa and all the businesses,

472
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,280
and I may look like that
I have had everything,

473
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,120
actually I don't have any friends.

474
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,200
Seeing you all here
to visit the villa,

475
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
I'm really happy.

476
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,160
Yes.

477
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,760
Childe Lu is treating us really well.

478
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,760
I also know that

479
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,320
I met Mengmeng by chance and

480
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,960
there's not much I ask for.

481
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,760
I only hope to have some talk

482
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
with her as friends.

483
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,800
If she can smile back from time to time,

484
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,040
it would be more than enough for me.

485
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,400
Does it make me so guilty to just

486
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,040
have such little wish?

487
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,320
I don't deserve to be loved,

488
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,920
but can't I at least have the right

489
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,240
to like someone in silence?

490
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,280
Brother Lu, I can understand

491
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,360
how you feel right now.

492
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,480
It's so hard.

493
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,480
We have been gone through

494
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,520
so many things together.

495
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,000
We were there for each
other during hard times,

496
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,520
and nothing could stop it.

497
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,360
We ate together,

498
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,400
and slept together.

499
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,760
Through this journey,

500
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,200
I've been taking care of everyone.

501
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,920
But I didn't expect that

502
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
I would lose to this man

503
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,880
who we all just met.

504
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,000
You only care about the new people

505
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,480
and ignore the old friend.

506
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,600
Since now I know this,

507
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,200
I should just leave.

508
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,320
Murong Chen.

509
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,680
Murong Chen.

510
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,240
Wait up.

511
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,120
You are not going to
keep me from leaving?

512
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,640
Then I will leave for real.

513
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,040
Childe Lu,

514
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,360
excuse us.

515
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,240
Wait for me.

516
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,160
- Murong Chen.
- Your Highness.

517
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,560
Look at you.

518
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,240
Murong Chen, what are you doing?

519
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,040
Didn't you only trust that toy boy?

520
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Why did you come out?

521
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,840
When did I say that I trust him?

522
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,320
Then why didn't you say anything for me?

523
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,240
Under that situation,

524
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,080
did you two leave any
room for me to jump in?

525
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,440
I don't care. I'm mad.

526
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,360
Like the kind of mad that can't
be relieved no matter what you say.

527
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,440
Are you pouting now?

528
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,880
You don't believe me anyway.

529
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,080
I believe you.

530
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,480
Why?

531
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,480
You are a guy who

532
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,480
has a pampered guy look,

533
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,440
is self-centered,

534
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,480
has low tolerance,

535
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,920
and likes to argue a point to death.

536
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,440
So that is how I am

537
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,680
in your heart.

538
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,680
But you love and hate frankly.

539
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,240
When you like someone,
you just like this person.

540
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
When you hate someone, you just hate.

541
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,880
You like gossiping about other
people in front of them

542
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,720
and talking bad behind them,

543
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,040
but you would never

544
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,960
scheme or try to set anyone up.

545
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,080
You will not and

546
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,440
you don't like to bother
to do anything like that.

547
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,640
It seems like you do
know something about me.

548
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,400
Otherwise?

549
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,960
Do you think that the time we
spent together was all for nothing?

550
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,000
Also, don't forget.

551
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,800
We are teammates.

552
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,960
How would I not trust my own teammate,

553
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,400
but to trust a stranger?

554
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,520
Then,

555
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,440
about what he said,

556
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,800
do you actually have no feeling at all?

557
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,920
To be honest,

558
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,760
it is impossible to not
have any feeling.

559
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,120
You...

560
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
At first,

561
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,240
I thought it was just a bad fate.

562
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,600
But soon I realized that

563
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,560
he was just making the buzz

564
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,360
and trying to take the lead.

565
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,040
People are

566
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,360
emotional animals

567
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
who can easily fall into the

568
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,240
emotion traps set up by others

569
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,600
and lose what they've
been holding on to.

570
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,360
In this way,

571
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,800
people's standpoints are easily changed.

572
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,240
So he could achieve what he wanted.

573
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,680
Seems like you are not stupid.

574
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,920
Do you actually think that

575
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,400
everyone is like you?

576
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,280
Right.

577
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,800
I'm the stupidest person.

578
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,680
Well, just stop getting mad

579
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,240
at Xiao Ai and Song Che.

580
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,760
They've been emotionally controlled

581
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,960
by Lu Feibai unconsciously.

582
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,160
Their thoughts have been changed

583
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,520
without knowing it.

584
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,280
Although I couldn't follow,

585
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,200
I can forgive them

586
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,560
because of what you said.

587
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,880
Let's get down to business.

588
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,440
As far as you're concerned,

589
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,280
how is it possible for
an underground workshop

590
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,360
to transfer such large amount of stuff

591
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,320
within one day?

592
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,040
I've checked carefully.

593
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,000
This is the only entrance
to the secret path.

594
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,480
Then how did they

595
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,320
transfer all these stuff during the day

596
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,600
without any of us knowing it?

597
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,000
Don't tell me that...

598
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,560
Can it be that...

599
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,320
- they have never been transferred out.
- they have never been transferred out.

600
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,400
This Murong Chen is going too far.

601
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,600
Brother Lu,

602
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,040
don't mind it.

603
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,160
It's fine.

604
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,800
I'll go get the
medicinal liquor for you.

605
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,080
Thank you so much.

606
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,520
Sorry, Landlord Lu.

607
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,760
I was acting recklessly.

608
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,200
It's OK.

609
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,840
It's just a little misunderstanding.

610
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,720
I didn't mind it.

611
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,000
I thought Childe Lu wanted
to offer us drinks.

612
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,320
I will suit myself then.

613
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:11,960
Childe Lu,

614
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,520
don't you want to share
good liquor with us?

615
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,880
How come?

616
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,960
I just want to introduce
some good liquor to you.

617
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,000
I know a lot about liquor.

618
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,320
Don't bother.

619
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,680
I can do it myself.

620
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,640
Murong Chen,

621
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,000
you are so unabashed.

622
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,800
How can you still drink his liquor?

623
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,080
Song Che.

624
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,440
This...

625
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,240
This is the blood night-blooming cereus.

626
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,800
It's the fake one.

627
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,280
Lu Feibai,

628
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,160
what else do you want to say?

629
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,480
I have nothing to say.

630
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,040
Holy shit.

631
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,960
Lu Feibai,

632
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,520
you are the sanctimonious liar.

633
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,560
Are you behind

634
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,560
all those

635
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,920
messed up things in the world?

636
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,440
Say it.

637
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,240
Where is the real
blood night-blooming cereus?

638
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,600
I don't know.

639
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,520
I have never

640
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,720
seen the real one.

641
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,760
You are a liar.

642
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,360
It doesn't make sense
that a person who makes

643
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,880
fake blood night-blooming cereus
has never seen the real one.

644
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,080
Mengmeng,

645
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,920
there's no use to say more.

646
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,280
I will chop his hands and feet off

647
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,160
and make him tell the truth.

648
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,640
Stop it.

649
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,600
Don't go that far.

650
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,560
He should do it.

651
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,160
You should do it.

652
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,640
I chop...

653
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,520
Don't. I will tell the truth.

654
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,600
About half a year ago,

655
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,680
there was a customer called Mr. Xi

656
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,080
who gave me a blueprint

657
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,440
and placed a huge order

658
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,480
to make me mass-produce
the fake blood night-blooming cereus.

659
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,880
I'm just a businessman.

660
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,640
I will do whatever

661
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,800
the customer asks for.

662
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,320
As for the buyers of the fake flowers,

663
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
I have no idea.

664
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,520
Mr. Xi?

665
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,440
Who is Mr. Xi?

666
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,440
How old is he?

667
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,680
How does he look like?

668
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,080
I don't know.

669
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,840
He said that he doesn't know.

670
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,400
I chop...

671
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,680
Mr. Xi has only been here three times.

672
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,760
One time for placing the order,

673
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,640
one time for checking the goods,

674
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,800
and the last time for re-ordering.

675
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,720
He wears black outfit and bamboo hat

676
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,840
every time he visits.

677
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,440
So I've never seen his face.

678
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,160
The only thing I know is that

679
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,440
he sounds like in the 40s.

680
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,320
I don't know anything other than that.

681
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,760
Then try to remember more clearly.

682
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,800
What other features does he have?

683
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,240
There's a special floral smell on him.

684
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,000
It smelt like sophora flower.

685
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,360
Sophora flower?

686
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,480
Chang Kong.

687
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,320
Is it this smell?

688
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,040
Yes.

689
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,080
This is it.

690
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,240
Sophora flower

691
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,000
is the most famous flower in Hui Zhou.

692
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,520
Hui Zhou?

693
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,160
That means that...

694
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,120
Exactly.

695
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,280
Cang Yun Kingdom.

696
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,480
Hui Zhou.

697
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,410
(Egret Villa to Hui Zhou)

698
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,080
(Hui Zhou)

699
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,640
Hui Zhou,

700
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,960
I'm here.

701
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,880
This is Cang Yun Kingdom.

702
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,200
Isn't it pretty?

703
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,760
Well, it's almost as pretty as Ruo Shui.

704
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,560
(We are finally sending
Murong Chen away soon.)

705
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,120
Song Che.

706
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,640
Why are you laughing so wildly?

707
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,760
Nothing.

708
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,280
As soon as I think about that

709
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,680
we are going to solve a

710
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,600
legendary case,

711
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,600
I cannot help feeling happy.

712
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,680
That is so pretty.

713
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,120
Yes.

714
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,160
Go.

715
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,340
(Hui Zhou Street)

716
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,280
Go.

717
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,880
Get off my way.

718
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,760
Get off my way.

719
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,960
Get off my way now.

720
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,720
(Ye Fei'er)
Ignorant people!

721
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Get off right now.

722
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,440
How dare you catch my whip?

723
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,840
You ignorant unruly people!

724
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,200
Oh no. These two people
are about to fight.

725
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,240
You do have some skills.

726
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,000
You hurt people on the street

727
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,280
and commit crime on a horseback.

728
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,040
Let me teach you a lesson.

729
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,960
You lawless shrew.

730
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,200
Stop it.

731
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,440
(Sai Pan'an)

732
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
Let's not waste time on this

733
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,960
over our business.

734
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,360
It's none of your business.

735
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:53,920
Go away.

736
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,280
Zhe Xiang,

737
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640
let's stop it.

738
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,040
Hit her.

739
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,520
Stop eating.

740
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,720
What does it have
anything to do with you?

741
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,160
I thought that

742
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,320
women in Ruo Shui Kingdom
are already mighty enough.

743
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,760
I didn't expect that

744
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,640
the women at Cang Yun Kingdom
are even more mighty.

745
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,760
You are wrong about it.

746
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,520
It's rare to see women like this.

747
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,840
Chang Kong.

748
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,320
The women in Cang Yun
