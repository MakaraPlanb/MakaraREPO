23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,440
I have not eaten meat for a long time.

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,840
On hearing that,

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,560
I want to eat meat, too.

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Right?

27
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,200
I miss...

28
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,800
hotpot, rice and Big Plate Chicken.

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,880

stewed pork ribs,

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,440
and braised pork.

Ok, ok.

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,200
That's enough.

34
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,560
I am hungry.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,800
Your Highness,

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
I'll find you some food.

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,000
Mengmeng,

38
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,320
wait here.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,880
Chang Kong.

40
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,680
Chang Kong, you are awesome!

41
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,360
Here you are.

42
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,520
Thank you!

43
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
In wildness...

44
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,840
In such wildness, it is impractical
to be so exquisite.

45
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,880
Food won't be any different
after you eat it.

46
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,400
As someone like you...

47
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,080
Forget it.

48
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,680
As members of royal family,

49
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,480
we should always be modest,

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
elegant,

51
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,280
and suave all the time outside.

52
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,120
How can we be like you?

53
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,760
Mengmeng.

54
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Thank you.

55
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,240
Xiao Ai, you can eat some.

56
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

57
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,720
Thank you.

58
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,560
Hey,

59
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,160
we eat meat now,

60
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,240
and it'd be better if we have wine.

61
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,200
You're right.

62
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,000
I have not drunk wine for a long time.

63
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,400
Mengmeng, this is for you.

64
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,640
Thank you.

65
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,760
Murong Chen,

66
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,000
how do you get all these stuff on you?

67
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,120
- This is for Xiao Ai.
- Thank you.

68
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,880
You know how to perform
conjuring tricks, right?

69
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,640
- This is for Chang Kong.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

70
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,040
What about me?

71
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,440
Yes, wait...

72
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,520
You have more?

73
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,880
Chang Kong, in the cloth-wrapper.

74
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,760
Come on...

75
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,160
Cheers!

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,560
Cheers?

77
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,520
Like this...

78
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,840
Cheers!

79
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,880
Cheers!

80
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,320
I

81
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,480
am the heroine, Jiang Mengmeng,

82
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,320
9th princess of Ruo Shui Kingdom.

83
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,120
I am beautiful and smart.

84
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,400
If using one word to describe me,

85
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
do you know what it is?

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
Perfect!

87
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,320
You all are so lucky to meet me.

88
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,120
So lucky.

89
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,360
No way!

90
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,040
I am the one who is
so lucky to meet you all.

91
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,640
From past till now,

92
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,720
all of you have been

93
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
around me,

94
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,480
protecting me

95
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,440
and accompanying me.

96
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,480
I cannot make it through

97
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,760
if I am without you all.

98
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,240
I came here for true love at first.

99
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,680
But you all become my friends

100
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,600
that are very important to me.

101
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,160
No matter what will
happen in the future,

102
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,960
or what the ending is,

103
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,360
I won't forget that

104
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,200
we drink wine and eat meat together,

105
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,160
we take an adventure together,

106
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,200
and we genuinely
take care of each other.

107
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,400
Xiao Ai.

108
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,800
Your Highness.

109
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,200
You are kind-hearted and cute.

110
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,240
Chang Kong,

111
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,280
you are not talkative,

112
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,520
but you are reliable,

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,640
giving people a sense of security.

114
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,280
Thank you, 9th princess.

115
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,440
Song Che.

116
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,240
Here!

117
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,280
You are dull sometimes,

118
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,320
straightforward,

119
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,800
reckless and impulsive,

120
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,120
not thinking about the consequences.

121
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,040
However,

122
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
however!

123
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,360
You always rush in front of us,

124
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,680
and you are our bravest general.

125
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,200
Mengmeng,

126
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,680
Mengmeng,

127
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,320
what about me?

128
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,600
Murong Chen,

129
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,040
Murong Chen, you...

130
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,840
You...

131
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,520
I'll take her aside to throw up.

132
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,080
Why did you drink so much?

133
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,320
Come back soon!

134
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,640
I'll tell you a secret.

135
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,520
You cannot tell Murong Chen.

136
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,480
You are really drunk.

137
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,880
Ever since that day I thought
he was going to die

138
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,600
and promised to leave him
one last good memory,

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,480
I didn't feel comfortable

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,520
when making eye contact with him.

141
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,640
But you said,

142
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,520
just pretend it was a dream

143
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,920
and forget it.  Right?

144
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,960
I said so,

145
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,400
but I know that

146
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,280
we can't go back to the past.

147
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,520
No matter how hard I try

148
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,800
to act like I don't care,

149
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,160
I can't help but thinking about

150
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,520
his true love confession,

151
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,760
my fake confession,

152
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,280
and that kiss.

153
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,640
I have Yun Ya already.

154
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,600
I should not think about
Murong Chen.

155
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,560
Actually,

156
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,760
you don't have to be torn
between Murong Chen and Yun Ya.

157
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Forget it.

158
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
Maybe I've pushed you too hard.

159
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,520
I should have given you more time

160
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,360
to think it over,

161
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,240
and to figure out

162
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,840
what you really want.

163
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Xiaomeng,

164
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,120
I really hope

165
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,480
I can be with you like this forever.

166
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,560
Do you think you can run away from us?

167
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,080
Senior,

168
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,120
(Yun Zong)
Leave it to us.

169
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,240
You can leave now.

170
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,680
Let's go!

171
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,520
I want to know

172
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,040
how far you can run?

173
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,840
A Mu,

174
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,200
I'm so scared!

175
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,600
Don't be scared.

176
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,080
I will protect you.

177
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,680
Your Highness, are you awake?

178
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,800
Your Highness, are you fine?

179
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,960
Yes.

180
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,680
I had a strange dream.

181
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,720
Leave me alone.

182
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,360
Wait!

183
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,960
What's the matter?

184
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,120
I have a question to ask you.

185
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Last night, I was drunk.

186
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,920
Did I say anything weird?

187
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,760
You said a lot last night.

188
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,800
Chang Kong, Xiao Ai and Song Che
all heard you.

189
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,880
I didn't mean these.

190
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
I mean,

191
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,360
did I say anything

192
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,960
that I am not supposed to say?

193
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,160
Yes.

194
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,280
You said...

195
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,480
I am the most handsome

196
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,200
and beloved person that
you have ever seen in the world.

197
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
And you really regretted that
you broke off the engagement.

198
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,000
You wanted to marry me right away.

199
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,840
And you asked Song Che
to be our marriage witness.

200
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,280
And I agreed.

201
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,280
Is that fun?

202
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,360
No.

203
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,760
I'm glad I didn't say anything weird.

204
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,160
And what are you wearing on your head?

205
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,080
So ugly.

206
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,480
Ugly? Then I'll change the other one.

207
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,720
Wait for a moment.

208
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,560
Same as ever.

209
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,800
It's a shame that
I have entangled in him for so long.

210
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,680
Jiang Mengmeng,

211
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,760
you just made a mistake

212
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,640
that every woman did in the world.

213
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,600
A momentary confusion does not matter,

214
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,000
as long as the beloved one
remains unchanged.

215
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,360
Perseverance prevails.

216
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,120
Fighting!

217
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,520
The beloved one?

218
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,520
Is Mengmeng talking about me?

219
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,720
I knew it!

220
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,760
Murong Chen is no match for me.

221
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,680
(From He Zhao County to Liang City)

222
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,040
(Liang City)

223
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,040
Here is Liang City.

224
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Liang City.

225
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,320
It does not seem to be prosperous here.

226
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,840
But by seeing the people on the street
and the stuff for sale,

227
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,520
it seems to be prosperous.

228
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,000
For Liang City,

229
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,760
although the natural conditions
are extremely poor,

230
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,520
the location is great.

231
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,920
North Desert is to the north.

232
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,520
Nan Cang is to the south.

233
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,680
Ruo Shui is to the west.

234
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,800
Cang Yun is to the east.

235
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,400
It is the only way to do business

236
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,200
between many countries and regions.

237
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,520
That's why there is
such a fantastic scene

238
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
that poverty and wealth
exist in one place.

239
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,000
General Song,

240
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,280
as you have years of experience at war,

241
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,720
your knowledge of geography is profound.

242
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,560
A Mu,

243
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,160
just cry!

244
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,360
I can't.

245
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,640
No crying, no money.

246
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,080
Do you want Uncle Qi
to starve to death with us?

247
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,760
A Mu,

248
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,000
we've got money now.

249
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,120
Uncle Qi, Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!

250
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,320
Where did the money come from?

251
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,720
Two days ago,

252
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,160
we earned the money by wailing at
funeral for the County Master.

253
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,840
Nonsense!

254
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,560
Such little money cannot
buy all these stuff.

255
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,600
Did you steal the money from others?

256
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,200
Tell me!

257
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,920
Who did it?

258
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,240
Tell me!

259
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,680
It's me!

260
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,640
Being so wicked at such young age.

261
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,720
Steal things from others!

262
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,480
Steal things!

263
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,360
Steal things!

264
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,520
Stop, Uncle Qi!

265
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,920
I picked the money up on the street.

266
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
This is not picking.

267
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
It is stealing.

268
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,000
I did not steal.

269
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,880
It is... It is called
robbing the rich to feed the poor.

270
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,960
Feed the poor?

271
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,200
Who is the poor?

272
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,440
We are the poor.

273
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,200
Aren't we poor enough?

274
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,720
Not to mention the person
was sneaking around,

275
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,720
I bet the money was
from unknown sources.

276
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,360
I think I did it right.

277
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,920
You still think you're right?

278
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,840
Ok.

279
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,520
Then I'll show you

280
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,040
the person who was robbed?

281
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,400
Son,

282
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,720
it's all my fault.

283
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,480
I lost the money I had
managed to scrape together.

284
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Don't worry.

285
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,320
I will scrape the money tomorrow.

286
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,280
I will make it

287
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,440
to cure your disease.

288
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,840
I am sorry, Uncle Qi.

289
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,320
I am wrong.

290
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,520
I didn't know...

291
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,440
I'll give the money back to her.

292
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,280
Remember,

293
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,880
there are many poor people in the world.

294
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,880
Don't ruin other people's lives

295
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,880
just to keep yourself alive.

296
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,800
Take a close look,

297
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,560
there are a lot of beggars around here.

298
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,200
Chang Kong.

299
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
It is because

300
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,520
Liang city has great
passenger flow volume,

301
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
so it became a gathering place
for beggars.

302
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,520
Stop anyone they see.

303
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,480
There's always someone
to give them money.

304
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,240
So, aren't they

305
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
the professional beggars
in tourist spots?

306
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Murong Chen

307
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,080
needs to pay a lot of money.

308
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,000
Alright, don't worry.

309
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,280
Childe, I beg you some money.

310
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,480
Childe, I beg you some money.

311
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,880
Xiao Ai.

312
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,040
This is for you,

313
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,240
and this is for you.

314
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Thank you, childe.

315
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,480
Childe, you are very kind-hearted.

316
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,760
You can leave now!

317
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,680
You dropped something.

318
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,240
Kids!

319
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,400
- Mengmeng!
- Your Highness!

320
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,520
I go for her.

321
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
Mengmeng!

322
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,440
- Kids!
- Mengmeng!

323
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,400
Kids!

324
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:46,920
Mengmeng!

325
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Take it slow.

326
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,520
You dropped something.

327
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,720
Wait.

328
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,120
- Kids!
- Two kids ahead.

329
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,680
Today we met someone kind.

330
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,840
Where's Mengmeng?

331
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,000
Her Highness went after little beggars.

332
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,320
What about Song Che?

333
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,840
He went after Her Highness.

334
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,120
Oh no!

335
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,600
What?

336
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,080
Maybe it is a kidnapping.

337
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Kidnapping?

338
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,120
The group of beggars that just came up

339
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,200
acted as if

340
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,920
they were distracting us.

341
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,640
But I don't think anyone
could kidnap 9th princess

342
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,640
with Song Che around.

343
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,360
I'm sure Song Che can handle it

344
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,960
if confronting the tough with toughness.

345
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,760
I am afraid that

346
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
they are not kidnapping aboveboard.

347
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,920
But Song Che said,

348
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,760
here is the intersection
among several countries,

349
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,200
what if Her Highness is sold to

350
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,640
North Desert or Nan Cang?

351
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,680
- Alright, Xiao Ai.
- Your Highness.

352
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,280
Your Highness.

353
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:50,880
Xiao Ai.

354
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,520
You wait here.

355
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,960
Chang Kong and I will look for them.

356
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,120
We'll meet here when we find them.

357
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,880
Your Highness.

358
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,240
Mengmeng.

359
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,240
- Kids!
- Mengmeng!

360
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,000
- Kids!
- Mengmeng!

361
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,360
Take it slow, Mengmeng.

362
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,680
Those two kids are running out of sight.

363
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,280
Forget it, we'd better go back.

364
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,520
Customers, excuse me!

365
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,080
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

366
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,620
(Yun Xiang House)

367
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,800
Great!

368
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,680
Great!

369
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,600
Great!

370
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,800
This way.

371
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,200
The red-light district.

372
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,880
Mengmeng, Mengmeng.

373
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,120
Let's go!

374
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,280
Customers, why are you
leaving in a hurry?

375
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,800
This is just the opening dance.

376
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,640
Tonight is the debut date of

377
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,960
our popular courtesan, Xie Yumian.

378
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,760
You...

379
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
You call this a debut here?

380
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,400
So aesthetic!

381
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,680
Of course!

382
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,640
This Yumian

383
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,680
is cultivated by Mother herself.

384
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,080
She is perfect at both charm and art.

385
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,440
And she is our treasure that
we have valued for two and a half years.

386
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,880
Tonight is her first time on stage.

387
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,440
Is she the individual trainee with

388
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,400
training period of two and a half years?

389
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,640
So diligent!

390
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,440
What are you saying?

391
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,560
Just leave now.

392
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,160
(Such brutal and inhuman thing.)

393
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,440
(Is it the scene that Yun Ya,
as a swordsman,)

394
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,800
(would come out to save the girl who)

395
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,240
(was forced to be a courtesan?)

396
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,320
(Song Che, I'm sorry.)

397
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,000
(You have to be a cat's paw
for a little while.)

398
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,520
Just stay for a while, Song Che.

399
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,960
Since we are here,

400
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,160
we can see the beautiful girl
before we leave.

401
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,000
No way.

402
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,760
Do you know where is here?

403
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,120
This is brothel.

404
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,400
I know.

405
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:55,920
You...

406
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,960
You are not...

407
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,160
I can't do that,

408
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,840
but I can see.

409
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,280
Just see.

410
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,280
Is it coming soon?

411
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,520
In a moment, in a moment.

412
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,320
Thank you for waiting.

413
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,880
(Procuress)
I think all of you here

414
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,440
are coming for Yumian?

415
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,200
Yes.

416
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,120
As you all know,

417
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,680
Yumian is my favorite daughter.

418
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,680
In the last two and a half years,

419
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,640
I gave her everything I had.

420
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,840
I hired a dance teacher,

421
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,800
music teacher,

422
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,640
and fitness teacher to train her.

423
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,280
I assigned her the top resources,

424
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,560
to cultivate the top star.

425
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Alright, stop talking.

426
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,960
We want to see Yumian.

427
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,320
- Yumian! Yumian!
- Yumian! Yumian!

428
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,880
- Awake overnight for you!
- Awake overnight for you!

429
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,200
- Yumian! Yumian!
- Yumian! Yumian!

430
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,320
- Awake overnight for you!
- Awake overnight for you!

431
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,080
Do you know Xie Yumian?

432
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,720
No.

433
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,440
Yumian! Yumian!

434
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,520
Cheer for her!

435
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,760
You have to cheer for her

436
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,960
whether you know her or not.

437
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,440
- Yumian! Yumian!
- Yumian! Yumian!

438
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,120
Xie Yumian!

439
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,680
- Yumian!
- She is so beautiful!

440
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,000
Yumian!

441
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,080
Tell me, where are they?

442
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,880
Who...who are they?

443
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,520
I am just a beggar.

444
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,840
I have no idea what you're saying.

445
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,320
Did you spend all the money I gave you

446
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,800
on the wine?

447
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,640
This...

448
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,680
This wine is not bought by your money.

449
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,520
Then where is the person

450
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,880
who gave you money?

451
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,480
I don't understand what you're saying.

452
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,480
Old man,

453
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,280
I don't want to put you on the spot,

454
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,400
but if you don't say anything...

455
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,240
Chang Kong.

456
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,640
Got it.

457
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,760
I'll...I'll tell you.

458
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,040
It...

459
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,600
It was a masked woman.

460
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,240
None of us have seen her face.

461
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,520
She told us to stop you in the street,

462
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,520
then let two little beggars

463
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,880
lure the other childe
to Yun Xiang House.

464
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,120
Yun Xiang House?

465
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,200
Yes, yes.

466
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,600
The format of this year's campaign is
different from that of previous years.

467
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,120
My daughter

468
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,320
aims high,

469
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,440
and only goes after talent

470
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,280
instead of money.

471
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,880
So,

472
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,360
this year, we don't do
the simple bidding auction.

473
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,880
Instead, Yumian will
raise the question herself.

474
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,840
One question.

475
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,080
Only the one with correct answers

476
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,560
can be the one who
spends tonight with her.

477
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,200
(Love you, Yumian)
Only one question?

478
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,320
What if we all answer correctly?

479
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,120
Impossible.

480
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,640
No, no.

481
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
No, no, no!

482
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,560
Mengmeng, we shall leave!

483
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,920
Let's go!

484
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,600
Think about it.

485
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,600
There will be one question.

486
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,800
- Maybe I could answer correctly.
- No.

487
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,840
If yes, so what?

488
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,000
Just for a try.

489
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,440
Alright, let's check it out first.

490
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,920
I'd like you to pick the one rouge
that I am wearing on my lips

491
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,520
among these 40 boxes of rouge.

492
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,640
And then apply it
on the back of your hand.

493
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,640
Is it...?

494
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,880
Who could answer that?

495
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,840
Let's check it out.

496
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,200
Go, go.

497
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,200
Tonight's makeup of Xie Yumian

498
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,440
goes with her purple outfit.

499
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,440
The lip is in plum color.

500
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,880
First, to exclude the

501
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,760
(Color and number of rouge)
reddish-brown color,

502
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,240
barbie pink color

503
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,680
and pumpkin color.

504
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,360
Then the rest of

505
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,640
deceptive colors

506
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,360
are rose red and purple colors.

507
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,440
These several colors are close to it.

508
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,720
No.

509
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,080
It's easy to fall into a trap.

510
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,960
The closest color would be

511
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,320
No.32 color.

512
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,880
No.

513
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
The texture does not match.

514
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,840
No.32 color would be matte
after being applied.

515
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,840
But the lips of Yumian

516
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,000
are shiny.

517
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,080
The color must be correct.

518
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,800
Then, there is only
one possibility left.

519
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,160
Alright, time's up.

520
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,560
Please give me your answers.

521
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,320
(15)

522
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,720
I know!

523
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,760
You used several colors on your lips.

524
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,760
First, you used No.32 matt plum color,

525
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,480
then overlaid with No.15
shiny light pink color.

526
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,880
Congratulation to this childe

527
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,680
on spending the night with Yumian!

528
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,320
What?

529
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,080
What are you doing?

530
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,720
What are you doing? Loser.

531
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,920
No! She can't...
[*Same sound in She and He in Chinese]

532
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,200
What? Why?

533
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
She... she is...

534
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,560
She... she is...

535
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,200
What are you doing?

536
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,080
Where are you taking me?

537
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,640
Where are you taking me?

538
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,000
Yu...Yumian!

539
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,080
Don't be nervous!

540
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,880
It is a long night.

541
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,880
We have enough time.

542
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,680
The story should not be like this.

543
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,680
It should be the woman
who was forced to sell her body

544
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
and refuses to do it even into death.

545
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,240
If she is so happy,

546
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,320
then Yun Ya would not come to save her.

547
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,680
Yumian,

548
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,280
please pardon me,

549
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,640
maybe you should have struggled a bit,

550
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,480
or yell for help, right?

551
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,520
So you like that?

552
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,520
No, no, no!

553
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,680
You misunderstood me.

554
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,800
I...

555
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,760
I...

556
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,640
Yumian.

557
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,880
I wonder if you can

558
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,360
share your story with me,

559
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,240
or some reason to be stuck here?

560
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
If you want to talk,

561
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,720
I'm willing to listen.

562
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,960
So, you want to listen me
telling the story?

563
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,880
Then,

564
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,400
it should go with a nice glass of wine.

565
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,000
Stay calm.

566
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,240
Or we'll have a hard time with you.

567
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,040
Do you want to listen me
telling the story?

568
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,520
Just drink this glass of wine.

569
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,760
Whether you want me to tell the story,

570
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,760
or yell for help,

571
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,200
I can do them all.

572
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,560
(Just a glass of wine.)

573
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,560
Ok!

574
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,600
Yumian.

575
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,360
I thought it's for me?

576
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,160
(Mr. System.)

577
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,120
(Are you kidding me?)

578
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,040
(This game includes girls' love line?)

579
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,960
(I am straight

580
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,960
but if the girl is so beautiful...)

581
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,960
(I...)

582
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,760
Mengmeng!

583
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,080
- Yun Ya!
- Mengmeng!

584
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,080
Are you okay?

585
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,400
Bad girl!

586
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
You got hurt.

587
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,840
Maybe I got hurt too much lately,

588
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,200
I'm not aware of it.

589
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,520
Raise your head.

590
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,800
Does it hurt?

591
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,440
No.

592
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
You...

593
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,080
Why do you put yourself
in danger every time,

594
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,200
in order to let me save you?

595
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,320
Actually, I do not want you
to save me this time.

596
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,320
This time, I want you

597
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,960
to save...

598
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,480
Song Che.

599
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,520
You can just fight with her.

600
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,680
Why did you take her clothes off?

601
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,240
No. I didn't.

602
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,840
You...

603
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,280
You are so...

604
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,360
Yun Ya.

605
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,960
You are so great, Yun Ya.

606
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,760
Awesome.

607
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,840
Say it.

608
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,440
Who sent you?

609
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,280
Why did you assassinate?

610
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,560
Don't you want to hear my story?

611
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,080
Ok.

612
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,520
I'll tell you.

613
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,640
I am Zhe Xiang,

614
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,400
from Nan Cang.

615
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,880
Rhymed.

616
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,360
Ruo Shui Kingdom and Nan Cang
having been at war all the year round.

617
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,040
My brother, whom I lived by,
died in battle.

618
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,080
There's only

619
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,360
me left alone.

620
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,800
I am lonely and helpless,

621
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,320
sold to the brothel.

622
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,040
I was going to kill myself tonight.

623
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,440
But I didn't expect to meet you.

624
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,320
I think before I die,

625
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,960
I have to kill you, 9th princess of
Ruo Shui Kingdom,

626
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,280
to avenge my brother's death.

627
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,400
If you wanted to revenge,

628
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,240
you should look for
General Song.

629
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,040
Yes.

630
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,360
Not Jiang Mengmeng.

631
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,760
She grew up in the palace,

632
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,280
and knew nothing about the war.

633
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,680
She is innocent.

634
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,040
Innocent?

635
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,240
People in high positions

636
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,960
have the power of life and death,

637
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,680
and soldiers are just
swords in her hand.

638
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,720
Is she innocent if one man died,

639
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,920
and she just said it's
the soldiers' fault

640
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,120
instead of hers?

641
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,440
No more talking.

642
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,000
I can't get my revenge anyway.

643
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,640
Kill me if you want to.

644
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,720
Fine.

645
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,760
I'll do it as you want.

646
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,160
Move over.

647
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,560
Move over.

648
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,320
Zhe Xiang,

649
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,880
I think you're reasonable,

650
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,360
why don't you just listen to me?

651
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,040
Nan Cang is always humid and hot,

652
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:29,840
with flourish vegetation,

653
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,680
and is not conducive to
agricultural development.

654
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,240
So it had been using fruit and wood to

655
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,240
exchange our medicinal materials
and food all year round.

656
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,880
It is so peaceful

657
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,120
and beneficial.

658
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,760
But in recent years,

659
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,840
Nan Cang is ambitious,

660
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,360
and no longer satisfied with
resource exchange.

661
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,880
It has repeatedly invaded
Ruo Shui's border,

662
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,680
trying to invade Ruo Shui's territory.

663
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,240
Mengmeng.

664
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,880
I thought you were
idling away in seeking pleasure.

665
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,520
I didn't expect that
you know a lot about state affairs.

666
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,480
You just said,

667
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,600
soldiers are swords.

668
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,520
Then you should know,

669
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,600
your brother is just a tool used

670
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,040
by those people in positions of power.

671
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,840
If he dies unjustly,

672
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,720
what about the innocent people

673
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,440
and soldiers on our border?

674
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,280
Moreover,

675
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
according to your theory,

676
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,400
maybe I should kill you first

677
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,720
to avenge the death
of innocent people

678
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,960
and soldiers?

679
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,200
And then I kill you, you kill me.

680
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
I kill you, and you kill me.

681
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,240
Does this make any sense?

682
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,560
I won't kill you tonight.

683
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,160
I just want you to know that

684
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,960
war is just a tool to

685
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,960
end the revenge.

686
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,920
And revenge is meaningless at all.

687
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,560
Over.

688
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,080
How could this be?

689
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,960
Did I do wrong?

690
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,520
Girl,

691
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,520
you need to understand that

692
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,920
the most important thing of people

693
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,240
is to live.

694
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,960
I don't have a revenge target now.

695
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,680
To live means to be ruined.

696
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,880
I'd rather die.

697
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,480
I can redeem you, ok?

698
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,600
No way.

699
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,560
Why do you have so many opinions?

700
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,560
No.

701
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,240
Where did you get the money?

702
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,320
My cloth-wrapper was stolen.

703
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,960
- The richest Murong Chen is not here.
- Right.

704
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,680
So...

705
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,400
I can make it!

706
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,280
