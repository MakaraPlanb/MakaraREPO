(Ye's Mansion)

My Lord.

25
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,040
(Governor Ye)
Why didn't you tell me about the guest?

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,720
I knew you were busy, so...

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,640
Hasn't my daughter come back yet?

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,040
She has.

29
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,120
But she went out again.

30
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,640
Where did she go?

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,880
You,

32
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,320
go and get her back.

33
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,160
Yes.

34
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,160
And tell her,

35
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,040
don't go outside these days.

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,360
It's not safe recently.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,080
- Go.
- Yes, my Lord.

38
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,600
Mr. Murong,

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,680
sorry to keep you waiting.

40
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,800
My apologies.

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,920
I knew official duties kept you busy.

42
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,680
I should have notified you in advance.

43
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,840
Have a seat, please.

44
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,560
Why are you sighing, Lord Ye?

45
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,560
Is it because the auction items were
stolen,

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,840
isn't it?

47
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
It is.

48
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,800
If you don't mind,

49
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,200
you can talk to me,

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,120
Lord Ye.

51
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,320
You?

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,480
Lord Ye,

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,680
Lu Feibai's scam

54
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
was exposed by my master.

55
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,120
It's you!

56
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,280
My apologies.

57
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,840
Mr. Murong,

58
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,280
to be honest,

59
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,320
I'm just a local governor,

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,200
so I shouldn't have meddled in it.

61
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,080
But…

62
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,560
But Mr. Xi gave you so much

63
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
that you couldn't turn him down.

64
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,960
That's right, Mr. Murong.

65
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,400
However,

66
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,440
I'm not a greedy man

67
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,840
who will do anything for money.

68
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,320
I did this all for my daughter.

69
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
I have to dower her in the near future.

70
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,960
But who knows she is so self-willed!

71
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,200
Of all the men,

72
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,880
she chose this...

73
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,400
I'm sorry to bother you

74
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,760
with these trifles.

75
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,080
It's alright.

76
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,520
I can understand

77
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,960
a father's feeling.

78
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,080
How about telling me

79
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,600
the security measures of the auction.

80
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,760
I‘ll see if there is any weak point.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,880
Well...

82
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Alright.

83
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,680
Things of the auction were like…

84
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,120
Get out of the way!

85
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,720
Who did this?

86
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,680
It's her!

87
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,760
She pushed my lady

88
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,120
off the building.

89
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,480
Go get her!

90
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Resisting arrest,

91
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,640
obstructing the course of our duty.

92
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,680
Arrest this man too!

93
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,720
Try it.

94
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,160
Go get him!

95
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,760
- Mengmeng!
- Don't move!

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,880
Put down you weapon!

97
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,000
If you don't want her to die in
front of you,

98
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,840
surrender yourself!

99
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,480
You've got the wrong person.

100
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,280
I told you,

101
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,720
it's hard to fight in a skirt.

102
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,200
Move, move.

103
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,520
Move.

104
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,440
Move.

105
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,440
Your Highness!

106
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,400
Move!

107
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,520
(Penitentiary of Hui County)
Hurry up!

108
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,960
Hurry!

109
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,480
Move!

110
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,480
- Let go of me!
- Move!

111
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,960
Get in!

112
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,960
- Hurry up!
- Mengmeng!

113
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,280
Mengmeng!

114
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,680
Leave her alone!

115
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,760
Let her go!

116
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,760
Mengmeng!

117
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,360
- Zhe Xiang!
- Mengmeng!

118
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,120
- Zhe Xiang!
- Mengmeng!

119
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,600
- Get in!
- Over there!

120
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
Calm down, gentlemen!

121
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,480
- Mengmeng!
- Please don't!

122
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,080
It wasn't me!

123
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,240
I didn't kill her!

124
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,800
You didn't?

125
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,880
- Mengmeng!
- What are you doing?

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,320
Mengmeng, what are they doing to you?

127
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,680
- Whip you, of course.
- No, no, no.

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,280
Wait a moment, man!

129
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,520
I'm only supposed to be a suspect.

130
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,960
You shouldn't torture me!

131
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,120
You should abide by the procedural law!

132
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,800
Shouldn't you?

133
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,560
Procedural law?

134
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,080
Of which kingdom?

135
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,640
I've never heard about that.

136
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,040
Me neither.

137
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,920
You are in jail now.

138
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,840
You are supposed to be tortured.

139
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,520
You think you come here to visit?

140
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,680
I want to go back.

141
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,200
Don't talk nonsense to her.
Let's do as usual.

142
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,160
Do it.

143
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,840
Mr. System,

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,280
I want to go back to the society ruled
by law!

145
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,040
Salt?

146
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,800
I've heard of putting salt on wounds,

147
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,760
but not putting it before the torture.

148
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,200
Good for you.

149
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,440
I'll show you today.

150
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Stop it!

151
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,360
Mengmeng, hang in there!

152
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,160
I'm coming for you!

153
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,520
Have you lost your mind, Song Che?

154
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,960
They are beating Mengmeng.

155
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,680
I'll kill you!

156
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,320
All of you!

157
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,440
Let me out!

158
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,160
If this is the case,

159
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,360
the security system is basically
foolproof.

160
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,120
There should be no one breaking in.

161
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,400
Let alone

162
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,160
throw a smoke bomb and

163
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,360
take away the flower and people
in public.

164
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,520
Right.

165
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,200
I also can't figure it out.

166
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,360
What's wrong?

167
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,200
My lord!

168
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,640
Bad news!

169
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,040
Why are you so flustered?

170
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,720
That's inappropriate.

171
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,080
- Tell me. What happened?
- Bad news!

172
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,520
You asked to me
to find your eldest daughter.

173
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,000
I found her, but she...

174
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,200
What happened to her?

175
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,760
She died!

176
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,480
Who killed my daughter?

177
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,760
The killer is called

178
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
Jiang Mengmeng.

179
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,000
What?

180
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,960
Hurry.

181
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,400
Mengmeng, Mengmeng!

182
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,480
It's so hard to open it.

183
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,760
Hurry up.

184
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,800
Leave her alone!

185
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,880
- Step away.
- Mengmeng!

186
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,680
Mengmeng!

187
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,000
Why is he so anxious?

188
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,840
Hurry.

189
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,640
Mengmeng! I'm gonna kill you!

190
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,200
Murong Chen, Murong Chen!

191
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,160
Song Che, where is Mengmeng?

192
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,440
Help her, help her!

193
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,000
Help her, over there!

194
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,640
Come on, hurry!

195
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,480
Mengmeng, Mengmeng.

196
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,680
Stop it!

197
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,400
It's her who killed my daughter?

198
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,520
Yes.

199
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,440
Give it to me.

200
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,400
You…

201
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,440
The torture is illegal!

202
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,600
My daughter was murdered by her!

203
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,760
It wouldn't work off my anger
even if I killed her.

204
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,000
Who dares to hurt the 5th prince?

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,520
He is the 5th prince of Cang Yun
Kingdom, Murong Chen.

206
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,680
Your Highness!

207
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,320
I'm sorry, Mengmeng.

208
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,440
I'm late.

209
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,600
Murong Chen.

210
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,280
Is that you?

211
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,680
It's me.

212
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,200
I am here.

213
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,320
No one can hurt you anymore.

214
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,800
Why are you staring blankly?

215
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,280
Get everyone out.

216
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,760
Well…

217
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,280
Governor Ye,

218
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,640
you can rest assured that

219
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,160
I'm not abusing my power.

220
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,320
Today I just bail the three of them.

221
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,760
I'll find out

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,480
who killed your daughter in three days.

223
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,680
I promise.

224
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,720
Hurry. Let those two out of the jail.

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,360
Mengmeng, Mengmeng.

226
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,080
Song Che.

227
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,760
Old bastard!

228
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,960
You whipped Mengmeng.

229
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,680
I'm gonna kill you!

230
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,880
- You…
- Song Che!

231
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,080
Mengmeng is badly hurt.

232
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,640
What happened?

233
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,280
We've only been apart for a while,

234
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,600
how come Mengmeng became like this?

235
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,480
You…

236
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,000
You are now blaming me?

237
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,400
If you hadn't written to us to wait for
you in the teahouse,

238
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,960
how could Mengmeng suffer from this?

239
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,360
Wrote to you?

240
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,040
I never wrote to you.

241
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,560
It's a set up.

242
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,080
It seems that they were prepared.

243
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,320
You guys take care of Mengmeng.

244
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,520
Where are you going?

245
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,600
I'll find it out.

246
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,320
Come on.

247
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,960
Are you really going to keep your
promise?

248
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,640
You are the 5th prince.

249
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,040
Even if you can't find the real
murderer,

250
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,600
Governor Ye dares not to
do anything to you.

251
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,680
Of course he dares not.

252
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,720
But I have to keep my promise,

253
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,560
and find the murderer.

254
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,400
Then Mengmeng will be innocent.

255
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,560
But it's too dangerous.

256
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Like you said,

257
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,480
they are well prepared.

258
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,160
What if there's a bigger trap waiting
for you?

259
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,880
I've thought about it.

260
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,680
Take care of Mengmeng.

261
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,160
Chang Kong,

262
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,080
follow me.

263
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,040
Yes.

264
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,280
How did Murong Chen

265
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,320
suddenly become mature.

266
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,320
He used to fool around.

267
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,160
That's because someone

268
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,920
touched his bottom line.

269
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,760
No matter how casual a person is,

270
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,560
he will become serious

271
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,840
when he meets the things he cares about.

272
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,370
(Qinghui House)

273
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,280
Are you suspecting that

274
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,120
Ye Fei'er's death is related to the
theft of blood night-blooming cereus?

275
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,160
I've investigated the auction.

276
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,080
I found the security there extremely
tight.

277
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,680
It's hard for outsiders to do it.

278
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,040
If I'm right,

279
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,640
it should be an inside job.

280
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,080
That's why I went to talk to
Governor Ye.

281
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,720
Judging from his reaction, Governor Ye

282
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,000
knew nothing about it.

283
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,760
He didn't look like pretending.

284
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,240
If it wasn't Governor Ye,

285
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,120
who would it be?

286
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,520
At first,

287
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,440
I also thought it's a dead end,

288
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,120
until

289
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,120
governor's daughter was murdered,

290
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,320
which brought us some new clues.

291
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,800
You had a clue already.

292
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,200
No wonder you promised to
find out the truth in three days.

293
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,560
I'll handle this thing.

294
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,360
You stay and take care of Mengmeng.

295
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,400
I'm staying?

296
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,880
But isn't Her Highness already
protected

297
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,640
by Song Che and Zhe Xiang?

298
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,640
Song Che

299
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
is simple-minded

300
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,880
and easily deceived.

301
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,520
As for Zhe Xiang...

302
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,200
You still suspect her?

303
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,720
Although she

304
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,600
hasn't done anything out of line now,

305
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't totally trust her.

306
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,920
This is about Mengmeng.

307
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,280
I'm more relieved if you stay.

308
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,520
I got it.

309
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,160
Be careful, Your Highness.

310
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Her Highness is awake.

311
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,040
Mengmeng.

312
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,680
Mengmeng.

313
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,040
How do you feel?

314
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,200
Your Highness,

315
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,440
do the wounds still hurt?

316
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,680
I'm fine.

317
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,920
Don't worry.

318
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,560
Where's Murong Chen?

319
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,600
His Highness has gone to investigate
Ye Fei'er's case.

320
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,800
Is he alone?

321
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,280
Why didn't bring you.

322
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,080
You have just been bandaged.

323
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,440
Don't move.

324
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,560
Murong Chen is very dangerous now.

325
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,520
I need to go get him.

326
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,720
Your Highness,

327
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,720
you will fall down

328
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,440
as soon as you stand up.

329
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,640
Your Highness,

330
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,400
His Highness didn't wait for you to
wake up,

331
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,040
because he didn't want to see you
like this.

332
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,960
You'd better take good care of
yourself,

333
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,440
and don't let him down.

334
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,360
Have a rest.

335
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,080
Don't worry.

336
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,080
As if she has nothing to do.

337
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,560
Ye Ling'er.

338
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,400
Why didn't you wash the clothes again?

339
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,560
I don't want to.

340
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,680
Don't think the elder lady is gone,

341
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,880
so you can do whatever you want.

342
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,280
I have to teach you a lesson today!

343
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,960
You…

344
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
How dare you!

345
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,520
How dare you.

346
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,520
The elder lady is gone.

347
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,880
I'm your new master from now on.

348
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,680
Understand?

349
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,040
Go wash clothes.

350
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,920
You…

351
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,240
you...

352
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,700
(Xuanya House)

353
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Murong Chen,

354
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,720
I know you meant well.

355
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,600
But

356
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,680
how can I repay you?

357
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,840
What are you thinking about?

358
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,760
Nothing.

359
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,960
Right.

360
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,920
Do you have any news about Murong Chen?

361
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,720
Mengmeng,

362
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,560
don't worry about him.

363
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,280
Murong Chen should

364
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,200
be fine.

365
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,080
I'm hungry.

366
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,200
Song Che,

367
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,440
I'm hungry.

368
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,200
Having porridge everyday

369
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,200
can't make me feel full,

370
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,520
and it isn't tasty.

371
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,360
Hunger is a good sign.

372
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,080
What do you want to eat?

373
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,480
I'll have the kitchen cook it for you.

374
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,120
I want

375
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,200
Beggar's Chicken.

376
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,040
Well...

377
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,920
I don't think they can cook that
for you.

378
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,600
How about something else?

379
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,120
Alright then.

380
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,560
Then I'll have to sleep hungry.

381
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,320
It must be Beggar's Chicken?

382
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Wait here.

383
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,560
I'll get it for you.

384
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,440
I'll await.

385
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
Take your time.

386
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,440
He is so easy to be deceived.

387
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,960
Master.

388
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,960
Have you got it?

389
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,600
Here's all the ties of kinship of
Ye family,

390
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,720
and all the information related to
Ye Fei'er.

391
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,800
(Information of Ye family)

392
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,320
Well done.

393
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,920
Master.

394
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,440
Lord Chang Kong asked me
to investigate Zhe Xiang.

395
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,280
Here is the information about her.

396
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,520
I thought we couldn't get any info
about her.

397
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,040
It was difficult to
start with Zhe Xiang.

398
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,440
However, another team

399
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,160
made an unexpected discovery

400
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,400
when sorting out the chronological
data of Jing Yue Sect,

401
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,240
and found the information.

402
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,780
(Information of Zhe Xiang)

403
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,320
The information in this booklet

404
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,880
cannot be told to anyone else.

405
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,800
Yes.

406
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,840
Mengmeng.

407
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,040
I'm lucky.

408
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,800
I can't bear it.

409
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,120
I‘m tired.

410
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,280
I can't make it.

411
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,440
If my Health Points run out,

412
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,400
I have to leave the game.

413
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,520
Murong Chen,

414
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,000
where are you.

415
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,120
Hurry up.

416
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,320
I can't hold out.

417
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,120
Mengmeng.

418
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,920
Mengmeng.

419
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,960
Murong Chen.

420
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,160
The game is over.

421
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,520
No.

422
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,840
Here is...

423
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,400
Hui County Branch of Tian Ji Pavilion
in Cang Yun Kingdom.

424
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,480
You are in my room now.

425
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,660
(Branch of Tian Ji Pavilion)

426
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,520
Yun Ya.

427
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,720
It's...

428
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,600
It's you.

429
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,400
You passed out by the road,

430
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,120
so I took you back.

431
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,760
Looks like I'm hurt badly.

432
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,640
Actually,

433
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,560
you fainted from hunger.

434
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,160
Go eat something.

435
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,720
Come on.

436
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,880
Looks like you're really hungry.

437
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,120
Water, I need water.

438
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,000
I really can't understand

439
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,360
why a patient has to eat porridge only.

440
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,840
How could I recharge by only eating
that?

441
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,720
Am I right?

442
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,880
The better way, I think,

443
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
is to eat meat.

444
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,760
Right.

445
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,640
You are right.

446
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,600
Yun Ya,

447
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,720
I have something to tell you.

448
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,000
It's important.

449
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,240
Go ahead.

450
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,080
I want to ask you to do me a favor.

451
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,720
Help me find Murong Chen.

452
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,240
That's all?

453
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,520
That's all.

454
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,720
How about Ye Fei'er's case?

455
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,080
You knew it already?

456
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,960
I met you

457
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,840
because I was investigating the case,
too.

458
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,640
You were doing it for me?

459
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,640
You hadn't shown up for so long.

460
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,560
I thought you didn't know what had
happened to me recently.

461
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,240
I'd rather say

462
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,320
you hadn't thought of me for too long.

463
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,080
Before you knew I was A Mu,

464
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,600
you would come to me

465
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,920
for nothing.

466
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,960
Now,

467
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,040
you are in danger

468
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,880
and need help.

469
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,920
But you didn't think of me.

470
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,720
I was just...

471
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,520
Let me ask you a question.

472
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,920
You got hurt and ran out alone tonight.

473
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,800
Who was you thinking of

474
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,160
at the moment you passed out?

475
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,080
I was thinking of...

476
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Murong Chen.

477
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,360
I'm worried about Murong Chen,

478
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,000
because he is my teammate.

479
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,360
We had an agreement

480
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,800
that we would find the
blood night-blooming cereus together.

481
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,560
What's more, I find the flower for you.

482
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,560
Alright then.

483
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,240
I'll help you.

484
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,320
Really?

485
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
But

486
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,200
I only do you one favor.

487
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,120
What does that mean?

488
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,600
I'll help you find Murong Chen,

489
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,920
or I'll prove that you are innocent.

490
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,120
Do I have to choose one of them?

491
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,520
Then I'll choose the former.

492
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,680
Help me find Murong Chen.

493
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,000
So,

494
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,560
is finding him more important

495
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,640
than your own life?

496
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,120
My life is more important, of course.

497
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
Then why you...

498
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,080
I can save my own life

499
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,120
and prove my own innocence.

500
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,640
But he is my teammate.

501
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,320
I can't watch him in danger

502
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,080
and don't save him.

503
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,640
Jiang Mengmeng,

504
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,160
you've grown up.

505
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,440
In the past,

506
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,600
you were always thinking about
relationship

507
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,160
and ran away

508
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,880
when you faced danger.

509
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,080
But now,

510
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,240
you know you need to protect
your teammate

511
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,520
despite the danger.

512
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,800
You've become braver

513
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,920
and more responsible.

514
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,200
Stop it.

515
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,160
I feel embarrassed.

516
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,960
Actually,

517
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,120
I can help you with everything.

518
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,120
But now,

519
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,200
since you want to face this alone,

520
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,920
I'll tell you some leads I've got.

521
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,520
Really?

522
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,240
If you want to find out
Ye Fei'er's case,

523
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,880
you have to start with the people
around her.

524
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,360
People around her...

525
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,760
I saw

526
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,640
her and Mr. Sai fooling around
in the street.

527
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,720
Many passers-by saw it too.

528
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,960
She pushed my lady off the building!

529
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,200
It's her.

530
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,400
Thanks, Yun Ya.

531
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
I know what to do.

532
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,440
So, Murong Chen...

533
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
He's fine.

534
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,200
You don't have to find him.

535
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,120
He will show up.

536
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,320
Alright.

537
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,720
I trust you.

538
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,920
Yun Ya,

539
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,840
wait for me.

540
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,600
When I get
the blood night-blooming cereus,

541
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,720
I'll cure your cold poison.

542
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,680
Okay.

543
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,200
I'll wait for you.

544
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,280
But

545
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,080
I got one more question.

546
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,080
What's that?

547
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,160
After you restored your memory,

548
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,720
did I only leave guilt and remorse

549
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:41,080
in your heart?

550
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,320
Fei'er,

551
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,120
we went shopping and bought rouge
together the other day.

552
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,520
How could you leave me!

553
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,040
Fei'er!

554
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,040
(Give regards to the dead)

555
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,920
It's that maid.

556
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,320
It's weird.

557
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
Aren't only the relatives of the
deceased

558
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,720
eligible to receive mourners?

559
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,560
She's standing by Governor Ye.

560
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,840
Dad.

561
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,040
Don't be too sad, dad.

562
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,280
What's that?

563
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,680
Governor Ye adopt

564
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,360
a maid

565
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,160
as soon as his daughter died?

566
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,440
My sister doesn't

567
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,600
want to see you being so sad.

568
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,720
My Fei'er!

569
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,040
Governor Ye,

570
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,120
my condolences.

571
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,840
- Fei'er!
- Stand up.

572
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,600
May I have a word with you, lady.

573
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,600
What's the matter?

574
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,520
I want to ask you a question.

575
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,760
Didn't Governor Ye have only one
daughter?

576
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,320
Why he has another one today?

577
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,120
You're not local, are you, young lady?

578
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,240
I'm not.

579
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,000
I came recently.

580
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,440
No wonder you don't know.

581
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,360
That girl

582
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,440
is the illegitimate daughter
of Governor Ye.

583
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,200
Her mother died a few years ago.

584
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,080
So, she came to Governor Ye.

585
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,640
Governor Ye

586
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,560
didn't want to admit her origin.

587
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,000
But he was also afraid she
would discredit him

588
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,080
if he didn't take her in.

589
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,760
So, he accepted her as a servant girl
in the house.

590
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,760
I see.

591
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,960
Poor girl.

592
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,000
But there will be an end to her
miseries.

593
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,200
Since the elder daughter has died,

594
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,120
and Governor Ye must have an offspring,

595
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,400
she was admitted

596
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,920
and became the 2nd lady.

597
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,640
A daughter of a concubine! What a story!

598
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,200
I'm leaving if you don't have other
things.

599
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,200
Alright. Thank you.

600
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,480
Help the Lord to have a rest.

601
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,680
I want to be with Fei'er.

602
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,320
Fei'er.

603
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,480
She deserves an Oscar.

604
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,640
She acted sad in front of people,

605
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,200
but actually she is glad.

606
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,360
There must be something wrong with her.

607
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,640
Mengmeng.

608
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,280
Mengmeng.

609
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,680
Can you stop disappearing

610
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,520
without saying a word?

611
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,160
I've been looking for you all night,

612
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,440
thinking you were taken by some bad guy.

613
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,720
I'm sorry.

614
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I won't do that again.

615
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,080
(It's because
you're so easy to be deceived.)

616
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,560
I promise.

617
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,000
Your Highness,

618
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,320
how do you know there is something
wrong with Ye Ling'er.

619
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,280
Oh, it's Yun...

620
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,480
(No, I can't tell them about Yun Ya.)

621
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,920
It's because I'm smart.

622
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,040
Listen up.

623
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,920
There were so many onlookers
on the first floor,

624
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,000
but no one saw

625
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,760
how Ye Fei'er fell.

626
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,000
But Ye Ling'er insisted that it was me
who pushed Ye Fei'er down.

627
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,280
What's more,

628
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,760
when Ye Fei'er accused me,

629
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,520
Ye Ling'er was beside her

630
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,560
and helped to dramatize.

631
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,640
It's obviously a frame up.

632
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,560
You are so smart, Your Highness!

633
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,680
Murong Chen.

634
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,000
You weren't there that day.

635
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,840
Why do you also suspect Ye Ling'er?

636
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,360
Whom I suspect is not Ye Ling'er,

637
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,320
but Sai Pan'an.

638
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,880
Sai Pan'an?

639
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,080
Is he...

640
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,040
Is he the fiance of Ye Fei'er?

641
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,320
Yesterday was the first day of
Ye Fei'er's funeral,

642
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,400
and I was at the gate all day.

643
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,240
I felt something wrong.

644
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,600
I didn't figure out until night

645
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,920
that it was because of Sai Pan'an.

646
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
He should have been there,

647
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,320
but he did not show up.

648
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,520
I thought he was too sad

649
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,720
to come.

650
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,480
So, I went to his house.

651
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,680
Do you know what I saw?

652
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,440
I saw Ye Ling'er came in his house.

653
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,360
As soon as his fiancee died,

654
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,200
his sister-in-law came to his house.

655
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,200
I thought it's a story

656
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,720
about a daughter of a concubine
who became evil and turned the tables.

657
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,120
It turns out
it also involved family ethics.

658
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,640
Anyway, this Sai Pan'an

659
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,000
must not be a nobody.

660
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,040
It must have something

661
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,120
to do with him.

662
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,800
Now we have the suspect.

663
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
We need to get the evidence.

664
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,720
Evidence.

665
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,440
Ye Fei'er.

666
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,750
(Ye's Mansion)

667
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,120
Let's go.

668
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,320
Lady first.

669
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,920
I think I stepped on something.

670
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,120
You stepped on my shoe.

671
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,760
I'm sorry.

672
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:38,910
(Beloved daughter, Ye Fei'er)

673
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,040
Stop pulling my clothes.

674
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,280
But I'm not pulling your clothes.

675
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,240
Then…

676
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,800
Then…

677
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,720
