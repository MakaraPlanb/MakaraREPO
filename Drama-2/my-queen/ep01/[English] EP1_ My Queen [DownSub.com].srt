Come. Let's go together.

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,400
(Qin Group)
Okay.

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,800
What do you want to eat?

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,400
- Hot pot?
- OK.

27
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,560
Jiang Xiaomeng,

28
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,360
it seems that on Fridays,

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,920
you will be the first to leave.

30
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,240
Hurry to meet some guy?

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,200
Sure.

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,560
I don't want him to wait.

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,480
Showing off.

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,960
This is completely showing off.

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,880
Gotta go.

36
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,400
- Bye.
- Bye.

37
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,600
(Jiang Xiaomeng,)

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,920
(Corporate slave and single since born)
(a nobody who has a dream.)

39
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,000
(She seems to only care about
money and good-looking guys,)

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,240
(but she's actually a soft-hearted girl)

41
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,120
(who wants to have a perfect boyfriend)

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,160
(like one of those heroes in dramas.)

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,080
(Unfortunately, she's been
single since born.)

44
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,240
(Qin Han, 30 years old,)

45
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,440
(An aloof and high-handed boss)
(the president of Qin Group,)

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,760
(boss of Jiang Xiaomeng,)

47
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,480
(a workaholic)

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,160
(who's cold and reserved.)

49
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,960
Mr. Qin,

50
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,280
I've sent you the email.

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,920
For the party on Saturday

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,560
and golf gathering on Sunday,

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,400
Assistant Chen will
make schedules for you.

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,280
If there's nothing else,

55
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,880
I will leave now.

56
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,480
(Jiang Xiaomeng's apartment)

57
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Sorry for the wait.

58
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Damn Qin Han.

59
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,640
Damn work.

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,720
I'm going to finish all the episodes

61
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,680
that I didn't catch up this week.

62
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
So sweet.

63
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,000
Awesome.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,040
(Destined)
This is a message for a game beta test.

65
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,840
Are you bothered by
the 9-9-6 working routine

66
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,560
and single life?

67
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,920
Are you moved by the love of others

68
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,640
in the dramas?

69
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,360
Are you worried that the destined love

70
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,840
will never come to you?

71
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,560
Is the big data

72
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,480
monitoring my life?

73
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,440
Don't close it.

74
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,400
Don't close it.

75
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,960
AI?

76
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,080
Let me ask you.

77
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,320
I will find my true love

78
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,800
just by playing this game?

79
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,480
Of course.

80
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,360
This game is featured
with personalization.

81
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,400
We can pair the
best storyline and characters

82
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,240
based on the game players.

83
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,840
It will guarantee the
top level love experience.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,840
Really?

85
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,880
Whatever I like?

86
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,680
Yes.

87
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,680
Would you like to start setting?

88
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,800
Start pairing.

89
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,080
What's your dream life?

90
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,960
No need to work, but I can
still have money and time.

91
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,680
Do nothing but playing around every day

92
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,800
and hanging out

93
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,080
with the person I like.

94
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,680
What's your preference
for the storyline?

95
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,080
It has to be sweet, of course,

96
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,120
but not too sweet.

97
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,600
It can be circuitous somewhat,

98
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,480
but not too circuitous.

99
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
What's your preference for the hero?

100
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,120
The hero

101
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,400
should be cold and reserved.

102
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,320
A soulful and loyal lover
seems not bad either.

103
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,280
I'm also okay with spoiled type.

104
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,640
Younger guy, older guy,
daddy-type boyfriend.

105
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,400
Anyway,

106
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,360
the hero guy should be cold and soulful

107
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,800
with loyalty, entrepreneurial spirit

108
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,560
and understanding of my hobbies.

109
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,920
He should also spoil me
and know me well.

110
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,640
He can be a little scheming

111
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,640
and a little stupid.

112
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,720
Most importantly,

113
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,400
he needs to be good looking.

114
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,760
Mr. System?

115
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,480
Hello?

116
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,640
Liar.

117
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,560
Setting complete.

118
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,840
An ancient society
system is ready for you.

119
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,760
Your character in the game
is called Jiang Mengmeng.

120
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,520
Please put on your VR glasses
and enter the game.

121
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,120
The hint for this game is that

122
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,000
no matter how many times I forgot you,

123
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,040
I will fall in love with you again.

124
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,800
What the hell is this place?

125
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,280
Woman disguised as a man?

126
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,840
What kind of story is this?

127
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,160
Skillful thief

128
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,000
or noble princess who ran away?

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,320
Or I'm a chivalrous expert
who helps the poor?

130
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,720
What is this?

131
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,680
Up?

132
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,760
Do you mean to climb to the rooftop?

133
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,720
Psycho.

134
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,200
Move forward.

135
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,480
(Ruo Shui Kingdom)

136
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,720
Take a look.

137
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,560
Childe Meng, check out this flute.

138
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,200
It's made of top-level materials.

139
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,240
It's full of originality.

140
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Would you like to buy one?

141
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,800
Come and buy a flute.

142
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,320
It's made of top-level materials.

143
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,720
It's full of originality.
Come and buy one.

144
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,080
Childe Meng, you are here.

145
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,800
You know me?

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Is there a second Childe Meng?

147
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,280
- Childe Meng.
- Childe Meng.

148
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,600
Childe Meng.

149
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,880
Childe, you are our frequent visitor.

150
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,800
There's no one who doesn't
know you on this street.

151
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,800
Childe, would you like a lantern?

152
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Sorry, I don't have...

153
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,680
Money?

154
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,760
Buy one get one free
on Lantern Festival.

155
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,680
Childe Meng, buy a flute.

156
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,480
I'll buy it. I'll buy it.

157
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,080
(Old Tavern)

158
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,600
(Jixiang Antiques and Paintings)
Take care.

159
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,680
Are you...

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,640
(An arrogant childe)
(Murong Chen,)

161
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,720
(the 5th prince of Cang Yun Kingdom.)

162
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,880
(He owns nothing but good appearance.)

163
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,400
(He is weak-hearted but sharp-tongued.)

164
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,840
(He is squeamish and
has no sense of direction.)

165
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,040
(Thanks to his identity as a prince,)

166
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,600
(he has been idling away
and seeking pleasure,)

167
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,000
(but with no entrepreneur
spirit at all.)

168
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,640
Qin Han?

169
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,640
Wait, it's a game.

170
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,320
The game designer must be an idiot

171
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
and creates the modeling
based on a demon president

172
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,800
who is very annoying.

173
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,160
Wait,

174
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,680
it's not like he's the real Qin Han.

175
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,960
Why am I afraid of him?

176
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,800
Not to mention that this is my game.

177
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,680
Be confident, Jiang Mengmeng.

178
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,320
Wait.

179
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,680
How can I help you?

180
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,800
Come on.

181
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,440
Look at what you did.

182
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,640
Childe,

183
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,080
if you want to blackmail me,

184
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,360
you should do it better.

185
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,960
I blackmail you?

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,960
It seems that you have never
been educated by the society.

187
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,840
Today, let me show you what's

188
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,080
real blackmailing.

189
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,600
You broke my stuff

190
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,000
and pushed me.

191
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,800
Is this loss of humanity

192
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,240
or dejection of morality?

193
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,600
- It's the distortion of humanity.
- Never mind.

194
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,000
How much do you want?
I will give it to you.

195
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,760
100 Liang.

196
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,200
100 Liang?

197
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,360
You want 100 Liang

198
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,040
for those garbage? I...

199
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,920
Alright, alright.
I will give it to you.

200
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,400
Was that person your companion?

201
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,320
You cover him and

202
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,400
he steals stuff, right?

203
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,400
It's okay if you don't
want to pay the money.

204
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,920
But you shouldn't frame me up.

205
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,600
Let me tell you.

206
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,160
That box is very important to me.

207
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,720
As long as you help me
find your companion

208
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,720
and I take my stuff back,

209
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,840
I promise that

210
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,320
I won't follow up with this issue.

211
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,440
I can even give you a bunch of money.

212
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Boring.

213
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,840
What I hate the most is
when someone pulls my hair.

214
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,600
You ruined my mood for today.

215
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,000
I will beat you to death.

216
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,200
You are a girl?

217
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,280
Don't run, thief.

218
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,640
Stay there.

219
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,840
Help catch this pervert.

220
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,560
Help catch this pervert.

221
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,480
Stay there. Don't run!

222
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,240
Stop!

223
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,440
Stop!

224
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,320
Catch the pervert.

225
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,560
Thief, stop right there.

226
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,160
Don't run!

227
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,600
Catch that pervert!

228
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Catch that pervert!

229
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,960
Catch that pervert!

230
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,640
Catch that pervert! Catch him!
Catch that pervert!

231
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,880
Catch that pervert! Catch....

232
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,400
You really lost something.

233
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,440
You...

234
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,200
Please make sure before shouting out.

235
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,320
Let's go.

236
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,280
It's nothing but a

237
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,920
dry flower.

238
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,880
There she is.

239
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,320
Crap! I did steal something?

240
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,600
And the owner is coming after it.

241
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,480
You can forget about the 100 Liang.

242
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,560
- You...
- What if we get exposed?

243
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
There's no time to think.
Let's go after her!

244
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,360
I see.

245
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,080
They have been after
me for the whole night.

246
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,760
Why are they still not giving up?

247
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,200
Stay there!

248
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,720
Why are they so persistent?

249
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,320
It's just for a little money and they've
been following me for 3 blocks.

250
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,280
Your Highness,
(Xiao Ai, A Liang)

251
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,480
please come back with us.

252
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,400
No.

253
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,720
Your Highness?

254
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,760
(Jiang Mengmeng,)

255
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,880
(The 9th princess of Ruo Shui Kingdom,)
(a laggard princess)

256
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,640
(who has lots of treasure and power.)

257
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,280
(She likes to disguise as a man
and sneak out of the palace.)

258
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,920
(People like to call her Childe Meng.)

259
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,760
(The Palace of Ruo Shui Kingdom)

260
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,190
(An old doctor)

261
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:06,880
(Jiang Wan,)

262
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,840
(The one who loves her sisters crazily)
(queen of Ruo Shui Kingdom,)

263
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,720
(beautiful and powerful,)

264
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,080
(who loves skin care.)

265
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,840
How is it?

266
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,760
I have finished the checkup.

267
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,640
There's no trauma on the princess.

268
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,600
She might be slipped off the wall
by accident and hit her brain,

269
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,560
which led to internal injury that
caused the loss of memory.

270
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,200
Such boring storyline.

271
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,960
When will her memory come back then?

272
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,600
Well,

273
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,200
I cannot tell.

274
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,960
Maybe 10 days.

275
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,520
Maybe 10 years.

276
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,760
You can see yourself out.

277
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,120
Bye.

278
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,000
My poor little sister,

279
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,880
why is your brain
damaged just like that?

280
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,280
Hold on, Ms.

281
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,280
Calm down.

282
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,240
Don't insult people.

283
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,480
She still remembers me.

284
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,120
She still remembers that
I'm her older sister.

285
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,320
Great!

286
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,160
The princess remembers the queen.

287
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,720
(Xiao Ai,)

288
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,040
(Adorable)
(the maid of Jiang Mengmeng.)

289
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,640
(She is good at jinxing and
yet she's usually right.)

290
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,280
(Bad things can happen when spoken of.)

291
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,680
Queen?

292
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,880
The magic fairy castle?

293
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,400
Well...

294
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,520
You really forget everything?

295
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,840
Mr. System,

296
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,720
how can I know everyone

297
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,160
when you don't give me
any character introduction?

298
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,680
I will reckon with you later.

299
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
So this is the memory-loss storyline.

300
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,680
I can do it.

301
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,400
How come I don't remember anything?

302
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,240
What is this place?

303
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,760
Who am I?

304
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,720
Who are you people?

305
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,800
Who are you?

306
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,600
9th sister, 9th sister,

307
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,600
my pretty sister.

308
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,360
You are the 9th princess
of Ruo Shui Kingdom,

309
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,040
and my most beloved sister.

310
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,160
This is your Ling Xi Palace.

311
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,280
These people are the maids
and eunuchs who

312
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,560
have been serving you for years.

313
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,520
It's okay.

314
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,880
You should've told me earlier.

315
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,280
I will write it down.

316
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,480
Let me find a...

317
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,640
How come there's
actually a notebook here?

318
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,760
Never mind. Let me write it down.

319
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,160
This is...

320
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,400
which kingdom? Ruo...Ruo... Ruo... Ruo Zhi
[*Ruo Zhi means idoit in Chinese]

321
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,240
Shui

322
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,280
Ruo Shui Kingdom.

323
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,160
I'm the 9th sister.

324
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,200
9th sister, 9th princess.

325
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,360
Right.

326
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,480
Xiao Ai.

327
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,280
A Liang.

328
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,040
Sister.

329
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,760
Sister. Queen.

330
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,920
Your Majesty.

331
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,840
Sister queen.

332
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Alright, alright.

333
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,720
It's so down-to-earth.

334
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,800
Right.

335
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,440
How old am I?

336
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,000
Your Highness, you are 17 years old.

337
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,760
17?

338
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,600
17 years old?

339
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,200
I'm only 17 years old?

340
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,240
Is there a mirror? Well, it's like a...

341
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,480
just a mirror.

342
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Oh my god.

343
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,520
This is me when I was 17?

344
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,760
Look at the collagen,

345
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,760
the hairline,

346
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,760
the dense hair,

347
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,360
and the wealthy appearance.

348
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,280
I'm indeed a heroine now!

349
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,040
I'm the heroine!

350
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,360
This heroine temperament.

351
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:38,750
(Haha!)

352
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,240
So, you are saying that

353
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,320
this blood night-blooming
cereus is fake,

354
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,440
and it was dyed into red?

355
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,960
I couldn't believe that

356
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,400
she did a huge favor for me.

357
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,400
She?

358
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,400
(Chang Kong,)

359
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,200
(A powerful loyal servant)
(the most trustful one to Murong Chen.)

360
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,880
(He's a top fighter and a loyal server.)

361
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,000
Who are you referring to?

362
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,520
Nothing.

363
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,040
Just a female gangster.

364
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,920
Why not

365
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,360
make the deal with the identity
of Tian Ji Pavilion?

366
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,400
Tian Ji Pavilion has too many stories
with the blood night-blooming cereus.

367
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,880
Before the truth is discovered,

368
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,280
it's not proper to
expose Tian Ji Pavilion.

369
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,400
In the past years,

370
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,200
there were many
fake news about the flower.

371
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,160
In this deal,

372
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,840
I did not put too much hope.

373
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,360
Since the fake flower appeared,

374
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,280
the seller must have seen the real one.

375
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,040
I'm worried that this trip is a trap.

376
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,360
The enemy is hidden in the
darkness, while we are exposed.

377
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
How can we catch the fish

378
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,600
without having the bait?

379
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,560
Go find out all the sellers.

380
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,000
Ask Tian Ji Pavilion to keep looking
for the woman with pure Yang destiny.

381
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
I must say that

382
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,040
this game is really true to life.

383
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,360
But when will my hero

384
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,080
show up?

385
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,160
Your Highness, look who's here.

386
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,680
Mr. Charmings of Ruo Shui.

387
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,840
Such old-fashioned love storyline

388
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,000
where there're multiple heroes.

389
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,000
So exciting.

390
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,680
Why is me who is painful

391
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,640
(5th prince)
when it's you who get hurt.

392
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,480
(6th prince)
As long as you are good,

393
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,880
nothing else matters.

394
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,960
Woman, listen up.

395
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,120
(7th prince)
From now on, without my permission,

396
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,760
don't get yourself hurt.

397
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,750
(8th prince)

398
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,720
If you feel sad,

399
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,080
I'll always be here for you to rely on.

400
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,520
Such straightforward confession.

401
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,960
How can I make the choice?

402
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
This is for you.

403
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,360
For me?

404
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,640
Come on.

405
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,760
Understand my preference

406
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,160
and spoil me.

407
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,520
Maybe my hero is him.

408
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,480
Do you like it?

409
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,120
Yes.

410
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,400
It's such a pity that

411
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,040
you only remember the thing you like,

412
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,080
not the person.

413
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,320
Sorry. I shouldn't have forgotten you.

414
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,720
What are you laughing at?

415
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,960
Four princes,

416
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,840
please stop joking around.

417
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,360
Prince?

418
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,520
You are my brothers?

419
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,000
Xiao Ai said that you hit your head

420
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
and lost all the memories.

421
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,080
At first, we didn't buy it.

422
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,440
But now it seems that it's true.

423
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,680
Exactly.

424
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,280
But, my little sister,

425
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,360
you are stupid as always.

426
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,640
Are you done?

427
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,040
Get out.

428
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,000
OK.

429
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,560
Mr. System,

430
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,840
are you kidding me?

431
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,920
Without character introduction

432
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,160
and story background,

433
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,640
how am I supposed to
know who everyone is?

434
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,920
I'm so mad.

435
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,080
You do have a heart.

436
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,240
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

437
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,440
I wonder

438
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,800
my relationship here.

439
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,280
Her Majesty is your eldest
sister.

440
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,120
Your Highness, you also have
six elder brothers and an elder sister.

441
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,000
The 2nd prince and the 3rd prince...

442
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,480
Wait a minute. I'll write it down.

443
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,480
The 2nd prince and the 3rd prince

444
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
are already married and currently
live outside the palace.

445
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,680
The 5th prince, 6th prince,

446
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,200
7th prince and 8th prince
haven't got married yet.

447
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,040
They are still living in the palace.

448
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,080
All of them love you very much.

449
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,120
Among them, the 8th prince, Jiang Hao
is about the same age as you.

450
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,200
You two are also the closest.

451
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,760
So it seems that I'm everyone's
favorite based on the setting.

452
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
- That's good.
- But,

453
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,880
your elder sister,

454
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,920
the 4th princess, Jiang Sisi

455
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,760
doesn't like you much.

456
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,840
The 4th princess, Jiang Sisi.

457
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,200
Another question.

458
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,360
In this palace, besides my brothers,

459
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,680
are there any other guys?

460
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,400
Ruo Shui Kingdom is
female-controlled.

461
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,520
The officers are also

462
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,440
mostly female.

463
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,120
As for guys,

464
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,200
there're only

465
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,400
doctors, bodyguards

466
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,920
and...

467
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Your Highness, desserts.

468
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,480
I see.

469
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,760
Prince.

470
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,760
Brother sister love?

471
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,720
That seems a little messed up.

472
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,880
Eunuch?

473
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,600
It seems like a sad love story.

474
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,880
So the rest would be

475
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,360
bodyguards and doctors.

476
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,480
I'm having a headache.

477
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,280
My head

478
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,960
starts to hurt again.

479
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,120
I will call the doctors right away.

480
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,840
No, it's okay.

481
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
I will go by myself.

482
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,800
(The Imperial Hospital)

483
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,310
(Doctor Xu)

484
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,280
Your Highness, you are not feeling well?

485
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,520
I feel dizzy.

486
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,560
Not sure if it's because of
the past injury.

487
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,480
Your Highness,
your injury has been cured.

488
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,240
Maybe it's just because it's cold today.

489
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,560
I will write you a prescription

490
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,840
for you to stay healthy.

491
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,320
Okay.

492
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,720
Doctor Xu,

493
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,120
how old are you?

494
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,240
Are your parents still alive?

495
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,560
Do you have any siblings?

496
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,080
Do you have a house?

497
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,080
Do you have a car? Driving permit?

498
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,080
Oh, they don't have this.

499
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,520
Do you own any land?
Do you have insurance?

500
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,040
Daddy, daddy. I'm starving.

501
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,000
When are we going home for dinner?

502
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,720
- Daddy?
- Good boy.

503
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,640
Your Highness, please excuse us.

504
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,400
My wife is not in a good condition

505
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,480
and the kid is still young.

506
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,800
So Her Majesty gave me the
permission to bring him here.

507
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,240
Early marriage.

508
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,840
Your Highness, your prescription.

509
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,960
No, it's your prescription.

510
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,600
Mengmeng,

511
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,920
what's wrong?

512
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,280
You used to

513
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,560
like these stuff.

514
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,800
Brother Hao,

515
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,600
as far as you're concerned,

516
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,680
is there any chance that
we are not real siblings?

517
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,280
For example, I might actually
be a fake princess,

518
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,760
just like Princess Pearl.

519
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,400
And I might be adopted
by mom.

520
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,680
Hold on.

521
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,200
Where did you get this?

522
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,280
It doesn't matter.

523
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,280
Do you think that this person

524
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,560
looks a little familiar?

525
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,680
When did you draw this? That's me.

526
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,280
No, no. Watch...

527
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,240
Here.

528
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,080
A mole?

529
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,160
Don't tell me that...

530
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,040
Yes.

531
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,000
This is how our mom looked
like before she passed away.

532
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,200
You two

533
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,680
look

534
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,720
exactly the same.

535
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,360
Therefore,

536
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,560
you can't be adopted.

537
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,160
You are right.

538
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,280
This game designer is such a stupid guy.

539
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,040
All the male characters
in this game are so handsome.

540
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,320
But for me,

541
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,440
just a mole?

542
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,040
Mengmeng.

543
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,920
What?

544
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,880
Do you still want these?

545
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,200
Yes.

546
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,750
(Chao Lan Palace)

547
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,840
Today is such a good day.

548
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,240
I heard that the 9th princess
injured her head

549
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,280
last time when she
sneaked out from the palace.

550
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,360
I thought that she might
keep quiet a little bit.

551
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,760
But it seems that she becomes
even louder than before.

552
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,120
It'll be impossible

553
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,920
for her to be quiet

554
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,200
for three days.

555
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,200
(Jiang Sisi,)

556
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,280
(A fan for good-looks)
(the 4th princess of Ruo Shui Kingdom.)

557
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,040
(She's very proud and she
cares a lot about appearance.)

558
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,040
Never mind.

559
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,360
It's time for me to say hi to my sister.

560
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,200
I've been busy with
the government affairs

561
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,200
and couldn't make the time to visit you.

562
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,840
Are you feeling better now?

563
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,960
I'm OK now. You are...

564
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,760
I heard that you hit your head.

565
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,600
It seems that it's true.

566
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,560
Since you still haven't recovered,

567
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,680
you should rest in the palace.

568
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,960
Don't run around.

569
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,080
Otherwise, you might get hurt
again and get handicapped.

570
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,000
It's fine that you become handicapped,

571
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,240
but don't encumber all the
people in the palace.

572
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,480
Sharp and mean.

573
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,120
Don't tell me

574
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,080
you are the...

575
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,120
the one who doesn't like me.

576
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,040
Four... Jiang Four Four.

577
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,920
Not liking you?

578
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,800
I know.

579
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,440
It's the standard mean girl setting.

580
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,560
You have talent and pretty
face, but you are very proud.

581
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,800
But sister queen and the brothers

582
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,480
all like me better.

583
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,200
- You...
- You must feel bad.

584
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,080
And you keep wondering why

585
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,880
you can't beat a useless sister

586
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,680
when you are so perfect.

587
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,920
So you hide in the corner every day

588
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,000
and peep me

589
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,600
in order to find
some disadvantages of me.

590
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,120
You will try to get me into troubles

591
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,400
whenever you have the chance, won't you?

592
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,320
Watch out your words.

593
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,200
You... You...

594
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,160
Right, you.

595
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,000
You are the kind of character who

596
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,280
always tries to stir up troubles
next to your master.

597
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,320
- I...
- You seem loyal,

598
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,640
but you can't live your life calmly

599
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,360
without stirring up troubles, can you?

600
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,760
- I...
- Well, you are running out of words.

601
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,600
Let's be straightforward, sis.

602
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,800
I'm here

603
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,280
to find true love.

604
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,840
Please don't waste your time on me.

605
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,280
I will go find my man

606
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,320
and you will be the
support female character.

607
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,840
Let's do our own jobs,

608
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,600
alright?

609
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,200
Gotta go.

610
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,040
I haven't even said anything yet.

611
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,280
Let me ask you.

612
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,520
Who was that?

613
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,440
Your Highness,

614
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,000
that is the prince of Wu Ze Kingdom.

615
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,760
In a few days, it will be the 4th
princess' marriage competition.

616
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Besides all the princes in our kingdom,

617
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,480
all the princes from
the alliance kingdoms

618
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,360
will come.

619
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,520
I see.

620
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,000
You can go now.

621
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,600
The man of a support character.

622
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
Such a waste.

623
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,000
The guy whom this 4th sister chooses

624
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,680
is so unlucky.

625
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,920
Among all these princes,

626
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,560
there's not a single one you like?

627
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,160
(Lu Hua Palace)
In such a huge world,

628
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,600
there's not even a single pretty guy
that can match me.

629
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,140
(Murong Chen,
5th prince of Cang Yun Kingdom)

630
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,600
Your Highness,

631
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,240
how's the investigation going?

632
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,160
I found the trail of
the seller yesterday,

633
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,880
but he was very cunning

634
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,480
and he ran off.

635
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,320
Keep looking.

636
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,200
Yes.

637
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,800
It's time to enter the palace.

638
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,520
The goal of this trip to the
marriage competition is only

639
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,920
an excuse to look for the blood
night-blooming cereus in Ruo Shui.

640
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,840
Since we have found some clues,

641
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,320
you can just pretend
to be sick and skip it.

642
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,480
The event is a huge
matter for the kingdom.

643
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,800
Since I'm here,

644
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,560
I have to go.

645
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,040
But I'm worried.

646
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,400
You are worried that I'm so perfect

647
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,400
and will be favored by the princess?

648
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,800
Yes.

649
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,480
Don't worry.

650
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,000
I have my way to get away.

651
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,160
(Feng Yi Palace)

652
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,400
Prince has made a long trip here.

653
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,560
The trip was not easy.

654
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,840
Please rest early.

655
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,860
(The Prince of Wu Ze)

656
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,640
This is the last one for today, right?

657
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,880
Yes.

658
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,520
Recently, I have to meet
many of them every day.

659
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,800
It's even more tiring
than going to court.

660
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,600
(Maidservant Hai)

661
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,240
How is Mengmeng doing lately?

662
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,800
I've been too busy working
on the marriage competition

663
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,000
for Sisi and I haven't
seen her for a while.

664
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,080
Her Highness hasn't caused
too much trouble lately.

665
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,000
But she doesn't usually
stay in her palace.

666
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,960
She often goes around.

667
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,640
My little sister

668
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,480
has been very disconcerting since young.

669
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,160
My mom passed away so early,

670
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,600
and I have to take the responsibility
as the oldest sister.

671
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,320
I'd love to keep taking care of her,

672
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,320
but there are too many government
affairs I need to attend to.

673
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,240
So I can't stay close
to her all the time.

674
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,240
If Your Majesty wants to find
someone to take care of her,

675
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,080
there is a way.

676
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Tell me about it.

677
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,000
Next year, the 9th princess

678
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,920
will reach the age
when she needs to get married.

679
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,800
How did I become like this?

680
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,240
Today is the marriage competition

681
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,200
and it's an important day for you.

682
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,880
Isn't the marriage competition
for the 4th princess?

683
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
What does it have
anything to do with me?

684
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,680
Xiao Ai, what is going on?

685
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,240
Your Highness,

686
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,400
I don't know either.

687
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,600
Her Majesty was worried
that you would reject,

688
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,200
so she did not tell you earlier.

689
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,000
It was supposed to be the
4th princess' marriage

690
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,400
competition today, but Her Majesty
cares a lot about you,

691
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,720
so she wants you to join the event too.

692
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,200
I can join too?

693
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,600
In that case,

694
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,560
I can also select handsome guys

695
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,560
like prince from Wu Ze?

696
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,680
Exactly.

697
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,000
That is awesome.

698
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,320
I can't go with this makeup.

699
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,840
This is too normal

700
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,920
and not eye-catching at all.

701
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,720
And the clothes are too conservative.

702
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,520
My hero might be on this competition,

703
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,440
so I need to be the star on this event.

704
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,260
(Feng Yi Palace)

705
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,080
How elegant she is!

706
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:10,680
