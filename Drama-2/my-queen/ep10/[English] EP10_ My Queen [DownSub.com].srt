23
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,560
Chang Kong,

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,040
maybe I should not lie to her?

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,240
Your Highness means...

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,440
I thought

27
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,200
her fascination with Yun Ya

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,680
was just a passing fad.

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,600
But I did not expect it

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,680
to be real.

31
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,440
Now I feel like

32
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,840
I've been using her to
find the blood night-blooming cereus...

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,880
Well...

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,600
Isn't it what you want?

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,600
You...

36
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,320
Fine.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,040
I admit.

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,080
At first, indeed.

39
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,520
But when I found out that
she is Xiaomeng,

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,320
I couldn't love her

41
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,800
and take good care of her enough.

42
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,640
Your Highness,

43
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,680
I have some words that

44
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
I've been holding in my mind
for a long time.

45
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,760
I hope they are not something weird.

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,600
What are you thinking?

47
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,080
I want to say that

48
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,720
what the 9th princess said makes sense.

49
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,880
This blood night-blooming cereus can
not only save the crown prince,

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,920
but also cure your cold poison.

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,680
But you never thought of

52
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,320
using it on your own body.

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
My life

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,400
wasn't mine twelve years ago.

55
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,840
I owe it to my brother.

56
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,040
Everything I did was for him.

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,160
I want to give him back

58
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,000
everything that belongs to him.

59
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,440
But the 9th princess changed

60
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
your mind.

61
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,960
When she told me in all sincerity that

62
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,560
she wants to cure me,

63
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,400
and wants me to be happy

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,720
and healthy.

65
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,200
At this moment,

66
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,680
I start to have some selfish desires.

67
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,160
I want to be healthy,

68
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,120
and use my own power
to protect my beloved one.

69
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,480
Your Highness,
you don't have to blame yourself.

70
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,360
Throughout these years,

71
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,960
you have taken on too much alone.

72
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,400
I'm so happy that

73
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Your Highness finally
has the desire to live for yourself.

74
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Chang Kong,

75
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,760
sometimes I really don't know

76
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,000
what I did is right or wrong.

77
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,760
Oh, Your Highness.

78
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,640
This is the birthdate of horoscope
of the 9th princess.

79
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,200
After the 9th princess
ran from the marriage,

80
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,560
I told Tian Ji Pavilion

81
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,000
to secretly intercept it
as you asked me to.

82
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,600
Pure Yang destiny.

83
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,480
What you said is true?

84
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Yes.

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,480
Xuan Yin Parasite died
once it touched her blood.

86
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,760
Jiang Mengmeng.

87
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,640
Are you sure that
no other people's blood mixing in?

88
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,760
The Blood Moon Tactics of Sang Luo

89
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,840
was interrupted before it got started.

90
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,040
There was only her blood on the site.

91
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
So I'm sure.

92
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,640
I've been searching high and low for it,

93
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,920
only to find it when I least expect to.

94
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,760
I spread the rumor
of retaining young looks

95
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,320
only to take advantage of Sang Luo

96
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,240
to collect the blood of maidens

97
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,000
and find the medical supplement
of the blood night-blooming cereus.

98
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,760
But Jiang Mengmeng ruined my plan.

99
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,240
Who knows?

100
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,800
She is the pure Yang destiny
I'm searching for.

101
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,120
I'll go get Jiang Mengmeng.

102
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,680
No hurry.

103
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,600
It now seems that

104
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,040
Murong Chen is not that simple
as I thought.

105
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't do anything rash yet.

106
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
Just follow them secretly

107
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,240
and observe Murong Chen.

108
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,320
You must guarantee the safety
of Jiang Mengmeng.

109
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Got it.

110
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,400
So it means,

111
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,320
the 9th princess is the one who can
enable the blood night-blooming cereus,

112
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,200
which is the medical supplement
to cure the crown prince.

113
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,520
That's great, Your Highness.

114
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,080
As long as we find
the blood night-blooming cereus,

115
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,760
we are done.

116
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,720
You don't seem to be happy?

117
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,600
I'm certainly happy that
we found the medical supplement.

118
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,000
But why her?

119
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,760
Isn't it good?

120
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,240
The 9th princess will accompany us
on the trip to Cang Yun Kingdom,

121
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,360
and she is also the medical supplement
to cure the crown prince.

122
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,800
I think all of these are just like
they were meant to be.

123
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,720
But she does not.

124
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,440
Liking someone is not to

125
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,040
get anything from her,

126
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,120
but to give everything
to her unconditionally.

127
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,160
I have never wanted to exchange
anything with you,

128
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,440
only my true heart.

129
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,760
Your Highness, are you afraid of
being misunderstood by the 9th princess?

130
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,720
Then why don't we

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,600
tell the 9th princess all of these?

132
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,880
The 9th princess is warm-hearted,

133
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,920
and also falls in love with
your identity of Yun Ya.

134
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,600
She will certainly cure
the crown prince.

135
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,600
We can't tell her now.

136
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,400
She won't accept it.

137
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,680
We have to wait,

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,440
and find the right opportunity.

139
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,280
Got it.

140
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,520
Mengmeng, Mengmeng.

141
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,800
Murong Chen,

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,080
where is Mengmeng?

143
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,680
Mengmeng?

144
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,720
Is she at the...

145
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,840
So cold!

146
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,000
I want to go back.

147
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,360
(Qing Luo Town to He Zhao County)

148
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,360
The scenery here is so beautiful.

149
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,080
And it looks more beautiful

150
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,760
with me inside.

151
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,920
It's cool here.

152
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,720
Childe,

153
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,150
(He Zhao County)

154
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,680
it's so bustling here.

155
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,000
This is He Zhao County.

156
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,960
We'll stay here for the night.

157
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,720
Let's go.

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,120
Don't show your money.

159
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,200
Thank you.

160
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,880
- Let's go.
- Follow me.

161
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,480
OK.

162
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,720
So beautiful.

163
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,680
Hey, there is delicatessen.

164
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,080
Xiao Ai, let's go.

165
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,480
Don't you see that

166
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,120
people on the street are wearing masks?

167
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,600
Masks for sale!

168
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,520
Xiao Ai, someone's selling
the masks over there.

169
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,400
Masks! Masks for sale!

170
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,120
Take a look. Masks for sale!

171
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,600
Childe, come and pick one.

172
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,520
Today is the annual Mask Festival of

173
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,600
our He Zhao County.

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,120
The Mask Festival?

175
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,280
Oh, I see.

176
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
Childe, pick one.

177
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,520
You have a good taste.

178
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,040
Childe, this is not for sale.

179
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,200
Keep the change.

180
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,120
Mengmeng!

181
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,360
This is so cute!

182
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
It's rabbit.

183
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,440
I know you would like it.

184
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,520
It's yours now.

185
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,520
For me?

186
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,560
Thank you!

187
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,720
You gave me the mask
and now you are asking me for the money.

188
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,480
Are you serious?

189
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
This looks nice.

190
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,040
As a courtesy, you can buy me this
in return.

191
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,840
I...

192
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,160
Looks good?

193
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,760
Yun Ya?

194
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,480
What?

195
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,560
Good.

196
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,960
It suits you.

197
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,520
I'll buy these three masks.

198
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,840
The strong and powerful big tiger

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,800
is for Song Che.

200
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,720
Big tiger!

201
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,640
Mengmeng, you know me the best!

202
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,040
I'm glad you like it.

203
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,560
The owl in the dark is for

204
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,120
Chang Kong.

205
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

206
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,000
And then, the cute kitten

207
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,880
is for Xiao Ai.

208
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,280
Thank you!

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,280
Oh, I have not paid yet.

210
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,160
One Liang.

211
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,400
Thank you!

212
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Thank you very much!

213
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,280
- Looks nice?
- Yes.

214
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,960
The Mask Festival starts.

215
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,680
It starts!

216
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,040
Murong Chen,

217
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,480
why you dragged me here?

218
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,760
You are not Murong Chen.

219
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,560
Mengmeng,

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,520
thank you for the mask.

221
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,040
I like it very much.

222
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Murong Chen!

223
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,680
Murong Chen!

224
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,040
Murong Chen!

225
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,080
Murong Chen!

226
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,240
Murong Chen!

227
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,200
Xiao Ai!

228
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,440
What happened?

229
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,880
There is an assassin.

230
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,040
Assassin?

231
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,480
Where is the princess?

232
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,200
You find a place to hide now.

233
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,240
I'll go find them.

234
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,000
Murong Chen!

235
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,400
Yun Ya.

236
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
Murong Chen.

237
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,080
Yun Ya.

238
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,640
That's my...

239
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,720
Fine.

240
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,840
It is the fake one.

241
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,840
Murong Chen!

242
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,920
(Yan Lai Tavern)

243
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,280
Murong Chen...

244
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,360
I found the prince down the river.

245
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,680
So, can I...

246
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,040
Can I go inside to see him?

247
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,080
Murong Chen.

248
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,080
Don't play tricks on me.

249
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,120
Mengmeng,

250
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
is that you?

251
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,120
Is that you?

252
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,880
You are not faking?

253
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,080
- Mengmeng.
- Are you really...

254
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,640
Am I going to die?

255
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,760
No, no, no!

256
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,400
You are not!

257
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,240
Don't be ridiculous!

258
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,480
You don't have to lie to me.

259
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,440
I didn't.

260
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,040
You will be fine.

261
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,920
Don't be ridiculous!

262
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,040
Mengmeng,

263
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,600
I have something to tell you.

264
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,640
- Actually, I...
- Don't...

265
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,760
Don't say it.

266
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,560
I...

267
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,080
I think

268
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,520
you can tell me that

269
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,960
after you recover.

270
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,160
If I don't tell you this right now,

271
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,560
I'm afraid that
I won't have time to say.

272
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,360
Alright,

273
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm listening.

274
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,360
I hope

275
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,800
there is room for me in your heart.

276
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,040
I just want you to be happy,

277
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,560
and live happily.

278
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,560
I just want to have a sweet dream

279
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,440
before I die,

280
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,960
even a fake one.

281
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,440
OK.

282
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,240
I can do it.

283
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,400
(Just playacting.)

284
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,120
(Jiang Mengmeng,)

285
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,280
(you can do it.)

286
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,320
Murong Chen,

287
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,400
thank you for always being with me,

288
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,600
going wild with me,

289
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
fooling around with me,

290
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,880
and doing something childish with me.

291
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,000
Although we always quarrel when we meet,

292
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,720
when I run into danger,

293
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,200
you always cover me without hesitation

294
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,280
and protect me with your life.

295
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,880
I know what you are thinking.

296
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,400
I just do not want to admit it.

297
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,280
Murong Chen,

298
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,000
I like you.

299

♪Moonlight flows in the night♪

300
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,210

The doctor said you have to
apply the medicine as soon as possible.

306
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,800
Or the wound would be...

307
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,000
healed.

308
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,320
Murong Chen, I'll kill you!

309
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,360
Calm... Calm down!

310
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,840
It's not what you think it is.

311
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,640
Song Che, calm down.

312
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,560
Murong Chen, I'll kill you.

313
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,400
Song Che.

314
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,560
Calm!

315
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,360
Song Che, calm down!

316
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,040
That's what happened.

317
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,640
His Highness just got some flesh wound.

318
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,200
It's my fault that
I didn't tell her clearly.

319
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,240
So, it is a misunderstanding.

320
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,600
Murong Chen,

321
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,280
you don't know

322
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,880
how serious your wound is?

323
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,320
I...

324
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,560
I have never had such

325
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,560
serious wound in my life.

326
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,360
I really thought that
I was going to die.

327
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,560
Fine.

328
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,760
I see.

329
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,520
I'm leaving now.

330
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,560
Mengmeng.

331
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,320
Just think of it as a dream.

332
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,280
Jiang Mengmeng, what's wrong with you?

333
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,760
You asked him to forget about it.

334
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,840
And you are recollecting it now.

335
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,680
I must be insane.

336
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,040
Right,

337
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,360
have a sleep.

338
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,280
Everything will be fine after sleeping.

339
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,480
Have a sleep.

340
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,120
Song Che,

341
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,920
all has passed.

342
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
Let's pretend that nothing has happened.

343
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
It's all right.

344
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
Mengmeng,

345
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,080
you are too naive.

346
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,760
That's what you think.

347
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,600
But somebody does not.

348
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,280
Don't be sarcastic.

349
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,040
You were talking about me, right?

350
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,880
You foxy man!

351
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,280
How dare you to say I am sarcastic!

352
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,000
Who is the foxy man?

353
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,880
You! You!

354
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,080
It's you!

355
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,920
You have the guts to insult me.

356
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,000
Don't you have the guts to beat me?

357
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,720
I don't fall for your tricks.

358
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,320
You are a wounded man.

359
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,880
Beating you means to bully you.

360
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,920
Didn't you all see that?

361
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,360
He's getting smarter.

362
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,760
It was him to lean on me.

363
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,360
Chang Kong, Xiao Ai.

364
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,440
You all saw this.

365
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,800
It was him to lean on me.

366
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,120
Not my fault.

367
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,080
I had nothing to do with it.

368
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,320
- Childish.
- I did not touch him at all.

369
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,520
Mengmeng, Mengmeng.

370
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,840
Mengmeng.

371
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,520
I did not bully him.

372
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,480
It was this foxy man to bump into me

373
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,040
and want to tempt me.

374
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,680
Do you think I was Mengmeng?

375
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,320
(Jing Yue Sect)

376
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,040
We have confirmed the identity
of that group of masked people.

377
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,640
They aimed at the
blood night-blooming cereus

378
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,800
at the hand of Jiang Mengmeng.

379
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,200
Do we need to take any action?

380
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,800
No.

381
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,240
Let them go.

382
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,880
The bigger disorder they make,

383
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,520
the greater the likelihood that the
blood night-blooming cereus will appear.

384
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,280
Got it.

385
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,440
And one more thing.

386
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,160
Are you sure about what you said?

387
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,520
Yes.

388
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,920
I was at the scene.

389
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,960
I confirmed his wound and position

390
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,560
precisely.

391
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,240
I wondered why Murong Chen is so lucky

392
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,640
that he easily gets
the medical supplement.

393
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,680
So it was all planned.

394
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,800
I thought that Tian Ji Pavilion
has disappeared

395
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,600
and no longer exists.

396
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,480
Murong Chen acts ridiculous
and looks like a foppery,

397
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,760
being indolent.

398
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,080
I didn't expect that
all of these are cover-ups.

399
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,040
During these nine years,

400
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Murong Chen has been planning to
re-establish Tian Ji Pavilion,

401
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,080
and find the
blood night-blooming cereus.

402
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,440
Does he want to
fight against Jing Yue Sect?

403
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,160
Fight against Jing Yue Sect?

404
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,560
Murong Chen,

405
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,280
I wanted to spare your life,

406
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,400
but you ask for death.

407
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,600
Zhe Xiang,

408
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,960
change of plan.

409
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,360
You need to manage to join them.

410
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,920
Got it.

411
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,160
But Murong Chen and Song Che
are not some ordinary people.

412
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,960
It is not easy to

413
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,760
earn their trust.

414
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,200
You don't need to do anything,

415
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,520
neither to know my plan.

416
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,080
You just need to stand
on the same side as Jiang Mengmeng.

417
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,000
Work together with them,

418
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,840
and share life and death with them.

419
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,440
And you will earn their trust gradually.

420
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,760
I see.

421
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,560
Mengmeng,

422
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,280
we have walked such a long way,

423
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,040
and sweated all over.

424
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Why don't we find somewhere
to take a shower?

425
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,000
Come on.

426
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,800
Girls have not said anything about it.

427
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,200
Only you have a precious body?

428
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,840
- Right?
- Then...

429
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,120
It's getting late.

430
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,640
There is a creek ahead.

431
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,960
We can freshen up there

432
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,880
and stay for the night here.

433
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,600
(Yun Xiang House)
What's going on?

434
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,920
What's going on? Where's she?

435
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,480
I told you to watch her, didn't I?

436
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,040
How come she got away?

437
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,000
I watched her tightly,

438
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,120
but I heard someone shouting that
the kitchen was on fire.

439
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,120
We hurried back to put out the fire.

440
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:01,920
When we got back,

441
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,280
she was gone.

442
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
There are only a few days
before Xie Yumian's debut.

443
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,360
Now she was gone.

444
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,200
What am I going to do?

445
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
Em...

446
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,600
Xie Yumian is just a name.

447
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,520
It is the same with someone else.

448
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,720
Who are you?

449
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,160
Your savior.

450
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,360
