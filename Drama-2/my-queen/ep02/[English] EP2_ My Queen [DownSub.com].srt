Mengmeng.

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,680
Is that golden powder on your eyelids?

26
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,320
Sister queen,

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,200
this is girl-group style makeup.

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,160
Using shiny powder

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,240
to make your eyes look bright.

30
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,640
Is that ash on your face?

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,960
This is shading powder.

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,160
Using light and shade

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,640
to modify the face shape.

34
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,640
See. Is my face V shaped?

35
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,720
Such nonsense.

36
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,040
Yes.

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,000
Mengmeng.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
Aren't you cold,

39
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,360
Mengmeng?

40
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,080
Sister queen,

41
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,040
this is the way

42
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,320
I try to be cool.

43
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,920
The marriage competition
is going to start.

44
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,440
Princes, please enter the palace.

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,200
Such vulgar makeup.

46
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
The Wu Ze prince is so good looking.

47
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
He is so handsome.

48
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,920
Exactly.

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,840
(How come there's such a
pretty guy in this world.)

50
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,720
It's you?

51
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,760
You two knew each other?

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,440
No.

53
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,360
(I thought he was just
a non-player character.)

54
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,920
I didn't know that he had
so many parts to play.

55
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,240
(Don't tell me he is the one.)

56
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,240
(Mr. System.)

57
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,840
(Don't make a fool out of me.)

58
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,480
The marriage competition
consists of four rounds

59
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,560
in which you will compete on

60
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,040
beauty, wisdom,

61
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,840
talent, and courage respectively.

62
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,800
The first round

63
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,840
is on beauty.

64
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,160
Each maid can give the flowers

65
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,680
to the top 3 good-looking princes
in their thought.

66
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,880
The more flowers get,

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,440
the higher points scored.

68
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,840
Starting now.

69
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,520
Why?

70
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,120
Give it to him.

71
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,200
That one, that one.

72
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,840
Yes, yes, yes.

73
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,120
To Wu Ze, to Wu Ze.

74
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,520
Give it to him, give it to him.

75
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,640
Give to Wu Ze.

76
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,880
Yes, yes, yes.

77
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,160
I announce that the top 3 winners

78
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,240
in the first round are

79
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,040
the 5th prince of Cang Yun Kingdom,

80
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,680
the 7th prince of Wu Ze Kingdom,

81
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,120
and the 2nd son of Assistant Minister
of the Ministry of Revenue.

82
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,440
Princes with no flower shall leave now.

83
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,200
The second round is on wisdom.

84
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,800
The test is the mechanism
box in front of everyone.

85
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,120
The person who opens it
faster can win higher points.

86
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,080
He can do it. He can do it.

87
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:36,880
This...

88
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,000
(Song Che,)

89
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,440
(the son of the general
of Ruo Shui Kingdom,)

90
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,000
(the fighter's descendant.)

91
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,720
(He has a pure heart
but acts impulsively.)

92
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,200
(He's the typical straight guy
who thinks straightforwardly.)

93
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,640
It's open.

94
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
This is against the rules.

95
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,680
It's the young general Song.

96
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,280
But Your Majesty,

97
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,440
this way of opening...

98
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,520
This setting of sudden spotlight.

99
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,800
Does it mean...

100
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,520
Maidservant Hai,

101
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,480
you only said to open it.

102
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,200
But you didn't say how.

103
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,520
Then...

104
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,160
The winner of the second round
is the young general Song.

105
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,480
Why is it him?

106
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,360
It doesn't make any sense.

107
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,120
Did he do it on purpose?

108
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,160
Xiao Ai,

109
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
who is he?

110
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,400
Song Che, the son of general Song.

111
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,600
He has been the childhood
sweetheart with you

112
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,760
since young.

113
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,960
The, why didn't he show up until now?

114
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,000
Princess,

115
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,200
Song Che has been practicing
martial art since young.

116
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,040
When he was 12,

117
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,040
he went to the wars with general Song.

118
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,080
He went to Nan Cang to settle
down rebellion one year ago.

119
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,800
Maybe,

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,440
he heard that you brought
forward the marriage competition.

121
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,360
So, he hurried back.

122
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,560
I heard that

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,160
it took him 4 horses

124
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,600
to hurry back here.

125
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,520
I knew that

126
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,600
you are very good at digging things out.

127
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,240
But this is very detailed.

128
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,480
It's okay.

129
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,480
This setting

130
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,560
is powerful,

131
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,440
affectionate,

132
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,800
with entrepreneur spirit,

133
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,960
ability to protect me

134
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,760
and decent mindset.

135
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,920
He is also kind of stupid.

136
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,440
My white horse prince.

137
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,040
(It seems that she won't
compete with me now.)

138
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
The third round is on talent.

139
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,200
Please draw two princesses.

140
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,040
Sister,

141
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,240
if you push a little more,

142
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,160
I will be out of the picture.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,480
Aren't you trying to gain attention

144
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,600
by wearing like this today?

145
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,520
I'm trying to gain attention?

146
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,000
If you want,

147
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,080
you can show your legs off.

148
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,080
No, I won't.

149
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,400
Ignorant.

150
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,760
Drawing time is over.

151
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,320
Please show your works.

152
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,600
I...

153
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,600
I didn't do it on purpose.

154
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,720
It's good that
my clothes didn't get dirty.

155
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,400
Such a squeamish person.

156
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,840
What's this?

157
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,320
In this round,

158
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,200
the 5th prince of Cang Yun Kingdom
scores 0 point.

159
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,960
The winner is the 7th
prince of Wu Ze Kingdom.

160
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,840
It shouldn't be.

161
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,160
Xiao Ai,

162
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,640
does it have to be like this?

163
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,800
The rule is like that.

164
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,680
Please bear with it.

165
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,080
But this it too...

166
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,720
Princess,

167
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,160
you think this is too loose, right?

168
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,760
Wait a second, no.

169
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,360
It's ok now, princess.

170
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,080
Please take care.

171
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,080
I will leave for now.

172
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,560
Leave?

173
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,400
Is this actually my close maid?

174
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,230
(Jiang Mengmeng's Route)

175
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,320
Based on the scoring of
the first three rounds,

176
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,800
there are 8 princes in total
who might enter the last round.

177
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,720
This round is on courage,

178
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,120
in which the hero shall save the beauty.

179
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,680
Princes must move

180
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,520
forward from all the traps in the forest

181
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,800
and save the princess before darkness.

182
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
the 4th princess is on your left

183
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,000
and the 9th princess
is on your right.

184
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,960
You can decide on your own
which princess you want to save.

185
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,600
The competition starts now.

186
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,080
Go away.

187
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,040
Quickly, this way.

188
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
This way, that way, this way, that way.

189
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,760
Ride a horse and go to a war.

190
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,640
Where should I go?

191
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,200
Well, I will choose this way.

192
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,160
It's good that I prepared early.

193
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,960
Mengmeng, wait for me.

194
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,880
I'm coming.

195
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
Are you scaring me?

196
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,360
Let me tell you.

197
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,720
Don't blame me for cheating.

198
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,080
What kind of garbage game is this?

199
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,000
So hard to find the hero.

200
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,720
I finally determined
who my true love is.

201
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,040
I won't let him run away.

202
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,320
How come these are all the same?

203
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,160
How is it?

204
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,200
Soon.

205
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,320
Why are my shoes dirty?

206
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,520
My hairstyle is messed up.

207
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,880
It's been five times already.

208
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,880
Five times.

209
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,480
It's still early anyway.

210
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,360
I'm starving.

211
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,200
Time for a snack.

212
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,000
He's been so lucky along the way here.

213
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,520
Such a pity.

214
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
Giving up right before the success.

215
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,800
He has no sense of direction,

216
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,960
and he is so lazy.

217
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,720
(Your highness, how about that
marriage competition?)

218
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,960
(I cannot win that competition.)

219
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,520
(But I must lose with dignity.)

220
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,400
- Let's go.
- Go.

221
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,200
It's so good.

222
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,680
(Jiang Sisi's Route)

223
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,320
Murong Chen.

224
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
It must be Murong Chen.

225
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,560
How come it's you?

226
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,600
Of course it's me.

227
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,200
My beautiful princess.

228
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,480
I'm here to save you.

229
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,480
How come you are still so clean

230
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,080
after going through all those traps?

231
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,120
This is not important.

232
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,280
Don't worry, my princess.

233
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,800
I will save you right now.

234
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,200
Please.

235
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,160
I have been liking you for a while.

236
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,280
Today, I come to Ruo Shui Kingdom

237
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,720
also for you.

238
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,040
I didn't expect that

239
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,800
you are even prettier

240
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,680
than what the hearsay says.

241
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,480
We are really a heaven-made match.

242
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,160
We are meant to be together.

243
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,040
But,

244
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,160
since we are husband and wife now,

245
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,320
there are some things that

246
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
I would like to discuss first.

247
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,920
After we get married,

248
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,680
I hope that during each new year,

249
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,720
you can follow me

250
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,280
to Wu Ze Kingdom on January 1st.

251
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,120
I will then come bake to

252
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,840
Ruo Shui Kingdom with you on the 3rd.

253
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,480
How do you like that?

254
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,280
You can't even talk clearly

255
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,840
and you wish to marry me?

256
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,080
Where is Murong Chen?

257
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,320
How come there's no man?

258
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,080
Am I so unattractive?

259
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,760
Song Che.

260
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,960
Who is it?

261
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,600
I heard someone calling me just now.

262
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,600
It must be Mengmeng.

263
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,800
Mengmeng,

264
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,320
I'm coming.

265
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,000
Mengmeng.

266
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,360
Am I still late after all?

267
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,000
Sisi,

268
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,480
why are you back by yourself?

269
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,720
Where are the princes?

270
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,000
Mr. System,

271
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,600
why do I have to be tortured by the game

272
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,520
without fighting back a little?

273
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,720
Are you trying to kill me

274
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,120
with such a huge pit?

275
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,800
Ah right, Song Che.

276
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,520
Song Che, I'm here

277
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,040
in the pit!

278
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,840
Help!

279
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,680
Help...

280
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,120
Is somebody here?

281
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,800
Anybody here?

282
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,880
Anybody here?

283
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,240
Help.

284
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,560
I'm the 9th princess of
Ruo Shui Kingdom.

285
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,480
I'm in danger.

286
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,640
It's me.

287
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,880
You kept such a low
voice calling for help.

288
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,120
If my hearing is not as clear as it is,

289
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,640
I would've just gone.

290
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,440
Since you are here now,

291
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,800
help me.

292
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,280
Why would I help you?

293
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,960
Never mind then.

294
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,720
When you go out

295
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,480
and see sister queen,

296
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,480
she will ask you that,

297
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,960
the 5th prince,

298
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,000
why are you by yourself?

299
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,280
Where is the 9th princess?

300
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,400
And you will tell her like this.

301
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,200
The 9th princess?

302
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,200
I saw that she was lying

303
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,440
under the pit.

304
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,800
I just ignored her

305
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,000
and came back on my own.

306
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,600
Say that.

307
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,880
Good point.

308
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,760
Try harder.

309
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,040
Up.

310
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,440
What?

311
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,320
You are too heavy.

312
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,280
I can't pull you out.

313
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,440
You didn't try hard.

314
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,000
How about this.

315
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,280
Step on that wall

316
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,760
and climb up hard.

317
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,680
Try to climb up.

318
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
Don't go down.

319
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,560
How come this cirrus was broken?

320
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,200
I'm also wondering.

321
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,640
Is it because you are too heavy?

322
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,560
Am I heavy?

323
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,680
Why are you so bad
at making a conversation?

324
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,520
You didn't even say sorry last time.

325
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,480
Why don't you tell me you're sorry?

326
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,320
I…

327
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,400
You…

328
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,200
Forget it.

329
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,640
I'm not angry. I'm not angry

330
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,760
Think about how to get out.

331
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,920
Come here.

332
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
Do you know lightness skill?

333
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Why didn't you say it earlier?

334
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,600
You didn't ask.

335
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,960
Ok.

336
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,200
We go our separate ways.

337
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,360
What happened to your leg?

338
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,480
Twist in the pit.

339
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,880
Is it funny to you?

340
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,040
Get on my back.

341
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,000
You don't even say sorry.

342
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,880
What are you doing?

343
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,120
- You put me down!
- Mengmeng.

344
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,840
Mengmeng, Mengmeng!

345
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,960
Where's Mengmeng?

346
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,920
Where's Mengmeng?

347
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,320
Isn't Mengmeng saved?

348
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,600
Isn't Mengmeng saved by you?

349
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:12,960
Me?

350
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,080
We've been waiting here.

351
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,680
We didn't see the 9th princess.

352
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,000
Seven noble sons
have made their way out.

353
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,800
Then, in the woods are

354
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,200
- The 9th princess and Murong Chen?
- Mengmeng and Murong Chen?

355
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,920
Sister queen.

356
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,520
You're so heavy.

357
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,440
Put me down.

358
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,760
- Mengmeng.
- What are you doing?

359
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,880
Mengmeng, are you hurt?

360
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,080
Kind of. It's okay.

361
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,720
Congratulations to the 5th
prince for passing the final test

362
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,120
and becoming
the emperor's 9th son-in-law.

363
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,430
(Ling Xi Palace)

364
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,120
Your Highness, Xiao AI has been with you
for seven years.

365
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,600
I didn't expect you
to get married so soon.

366
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,760
I'll take you with me

367
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,560
if I get married.

368
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,240
But if you
marry the 5th prince,

369
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,440
your long-cherished wish to
leave the palace will be dashed.

370
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,680
Leave the palace?

371
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,680
Before,

372
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,920
you always wanted to
live outside the palace.

373
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,560
You also said that one day

374
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,080
you would make a living
wandering from place to place with me.

375
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,320
I didn't expect that

376
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,880
I was a princess with a story.

377
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,280
By the way, Xiao Ai.

378
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,040
Do you know why I yearned
for the outside world so much?

379
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,840
Is it because
something happened to me before?

380
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,680
I don't know.

381
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,760
She even has anti spoiler function.

382
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,800
Mr. System,

383
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,320
you are so clever!

384
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,680
Now there are two love storylines
for me to choose.

385
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,560
One is with Song Che,

386
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,200
my childhood sweetheart.

387
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,360
The other one is with Murong Chen,

388
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,720
whom I may fall in love with
after we get married, I guess.

389
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,160
I can't make a choice

390
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,280
between the two.

391
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,280
I want to list their
strengths and weaknesses,

392
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,280
and make a comparison.

393
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,440
I will go with the
strengths of Song Che first.

394
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,120
You have to tell me his weaknesses.

395
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,360
General Song goes to the wars
quite often.

396
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,320
No wonder there will be few days
for him to be at home in the future.

397
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,760
And general Song is only good at
fighting and practicing martial arts.

398
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,800
He has no other hobbies.

399
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,920
He is old-fashioned and boring,

400
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,000
and lacks a sense of romance.

401
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,240
Straight man.

402
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,040
Murong Chen.

403
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,720
He has many weaknesses.

404
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
I'll go with his weaknesses first.

405
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
About the 5th prince,

406
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,080
I heard that

407
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,080
he seldomly attended school
or practiced martial arts

408
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,560
since he was 13.

409
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,440
So, he knows nothing about
poetry and prose,

410
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,360
and his martial arts are mediocre.

411
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,080
He never cares about the national life

412
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,880
or shares political affairs.

413
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,360
Instead, he is proficient in
eating, drinking and playing.

414
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,280
He lives
a luxurious and dissipated life,

415
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,680
spends money like water,

416
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,640
and does each luxury imaginable.

417
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,600
He is narcissistic

418
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,440
and has got this fixation
with cleanliness.

419
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,720
He focuses on

420
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,840
wear and dress every day.

421
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,760
He has little ability to
take care of himself.

422
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,920
He also has no sense of direction.

423
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,920
If there is no entourage around,

424
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,560
he can't even find his way home.

425
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,920
He always talks in an unpleasant way.

426
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,880
He is so mean that,

427
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,120
from the elderly aged 80

428
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,480
to babies aged 8 months,

429
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,920
anybody can be made cry by him.

430
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,040
That's right.

431
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,240
Does he have any strengths?

432
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,400
Good looking.

433
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,480
Good family background.

434
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,920
Nothing else?

435
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,880
Nothing else.

436
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,560
That's all?

437
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,920
Is he really that bad?

438
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,120
(Murong Yi.)

439
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,920
(Semi-paralysed prince, Murong Yi)
(Prince of Cang Yun Kingdom,)

440
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,480
(Murong Chen's favorite)

441
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,440
(and trusted elder brother)

442
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,080
(who was poisoned by Jing Yue Sect
nine years ago)

443
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,000
and thus became partly paralyzed.

444
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:31,680
(The 3rd prince became the fiance
of the 9th princess, Jiang Mengmeng)

445
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,480
Chen

446
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,120
has become the emperor's 9th son-in-law
of the Ruo Shui Kingdom.

447
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,520
Chen, you disguise yourself as

448
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,560
(Eastern Palace of Cang Yun Kingdom)
an ignorant dandy.

449
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,280
It's all for me

450
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,080
and for this country.

451
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,400
But these responsibilities should
not have been borne by you.

452
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,520
Your natural freedom

453
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,560
should not be bound by responsibility.

454
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,760
Chen.

455
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,840
You promise me.

456
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,280
If there is any chance that

457
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,200
you can find a life you like outside,

458
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,120
just take it

459
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,160
and never come back.

460
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,480
Bro.

461
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,920
You are my world.

462
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,600
All I want is

463
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,200
to make you stand up again.

464
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,160
It has been nine years.

465
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,280
I have no hope for myself.

466
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,080
Bro.

467
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,080
I won't give up.

468
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,680
I won't stay in the Ruo Shui Kingdom.

469
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,760
As soon as I find
the blood night-blooming cereus

470
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and the medical supplement,
I will try my best to come back.

471
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,800
Wait for me.

472
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,400
(Liu Guang Palace)

473
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,320
You found him?

474
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,320
Yes, I did.

475
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,120
He changed his name and identity.

476
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,600
Now, he is named Zhao Qian.

477
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,280
He often mingles in Baiji Tavern
on Jinxiu street.

478
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,240
Keep an eye on him.

479
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,520
Do not act rashly

480
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,960
and alert him.

481
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,000
Your Highness.

482
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,400
About the engagement

483
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,880
what's your plan?

484
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,160
Whether I can find

485
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,560
the blood night-blooming cereus
in Ruo Shui Kingdom or not,

486
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,280
I will definitely find a way to
break off the engagement.

487
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:16,280
(The General's Mansion)

488
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,200
I'm afraid I will be away

489
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,160
for a year or two.

490
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,000
It will be the time

491
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,600
for you to choose a worthy husband then.

492
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,800
Two years later,
I will be eighteen years old.

493
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,880
It is almost the time.

494
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,320
Why don't you choose me
as your husband then?

495
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,000
Haven't you always wanted
to leave the palace

496
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,560
and live a free life?

497
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,280
My mother died early.

498
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,960
My dad spends his life
defending the frontier.

499
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,360
I'm the only child.

500
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,320
And I don't have any relatives.

501
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,080
So, after we get married,

502
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,560
you can do whatever you want.

503
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,600
No one can stop you.

504
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,520
That is true.

505
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,760
- So, is it a deal?
- Yes.

506
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,400
I will for sure come back for
your marriage competition.

507
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,440
Wait for me.

508
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,440
Okay.

509
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,890
(Song Che, young, handsome
and enterprising)

510
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,480
Your Highness,

511
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,920
are you sure to do this?

512
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,040
Now the only person who
can stop this marriage

513
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
is Song Che.

514
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,240
He almost fell out with his dad

515
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,040
in order to catch the marriage
competition for the 9th princess.

516
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,680
He even shortened the 10-day trip

517
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
to 3 days.

518
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,440
He hurried all the way back to
the town without food or drink.

519
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,680
With such affection,

520
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,200
I don't believe that he would
let any other man marry her.

521
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,760
If I tell him the fact that
the 9th princess lost her memory,

522
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,960
it for sure will stimulate him

523
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
to damage this marriage.

524
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,480
Let's go.

525
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,400
(Murong Chen, indifferent to
national life and government affairs)

526
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,200
Since it's decided,

527
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,600
let's not think too much.

528
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,160
Why did she come here?

529
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,840
I don't know.

530
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,200
What's going on?

531
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,960
Didn't she lose all her memory

532
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,600
and forget about everything?

533
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,360
Look at that flirting face.

534
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,080
Her mouth water almost came out.

535
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,840
Your Highness,

536
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,400
this is good.

537
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,440
For what?

538
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,600
Think about it.

539
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,480
Since the 9th princess came on her own,

540
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,960
we don't have to show up.

541
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,800
Dong Kui,

542
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,720
let's go.

543
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,440
Mengmeng,

544
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,440
what's wrong?

545
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,760
Nothing.

546
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,640
Mengmeng,

547
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,040
I'm sorry.

548
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,200
I failed

549
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,120
to keep my promise to you.

550
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,040
What promise?

551
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,480
You don't remember?

552
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,200
I injured my head a while ago

553
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,840
when I sneaked out from the palace.

554
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,680
I forgot everything.

555
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,240
I see.

556
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,360
But I heard from Xiao Ai

557
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,480
that we grew up together,

558
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,040
and that you struggled really hard to

559
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,400
come to the marriage competition for me.

560
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,760
But I broke the promise.

561
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,160
I promised you to

562
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,000
win the marriage competition.

563
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,560
Then, I can take you out of the palace

564
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,440
and live a free life.

565
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,240
It's not your fault.

566
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,480
On the day...

567
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,680
On the day of the marriage competition,

568
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,400
I untied the rope

569
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,320
to look for you…

570
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,560
Seriously? Mengmeng?

571
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,640
You actually went to look for me?

572
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,680
Yes, I did.

573
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
I...

574
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,680
I...

575
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,680
But I fell in a pit.

576
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,080
Don't worry.

577
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,320
I will break off the engagement
for sure.

578
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,520
I'm not going to be with Murong Chen.

579
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,320
Let's go live our free life together.

580
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,160
Xiao Ai.

581
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,240
Tell me.

582
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,640

583
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,920
