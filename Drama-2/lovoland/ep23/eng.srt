(East Gate)

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Whose carriage is that?

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,280
It says privilege.

28
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,200
Sir,

29
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,640
I’m calling for justice.

30
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,200
Lord,

31
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,360
a woman is outside filing a case.

32
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,520
Against whom?

33
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,400
She stopped an official’s carriage.

34
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,280
That’s bold!

35
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,160
With all due respect,

36
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,000
are you Commander-in-chief
of Left Guard,

37
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,520
Lord Qinghai, Fang Jianming?

38
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,480
I am.

39
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,480
I’m suing someone.

40
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,720
Ma’am,

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,920
you should

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,960
go to

43
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,720
your local administrator.

44
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,800
Blocking

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,600
an official’s carriage

46
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,600
is out of the line.

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,560
The person I’m suing

48
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,280
is one of the most powerful figures

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,880
in and outside court.

50
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,360
No one

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,120
is able to bring him down

52
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,520
except for His Majesty.

53
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,280
No matter how powerful

54
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,800
he’s in and outside court,

55
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,640
he can’t go above Grand Justice.

56
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,560
Please rise, ma’am.

57
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,000
I’m suing

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,640
none other

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,160
than Commander-in-chief of Left Guard,

60
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,440
Lord Qinghai, Fang Jianming!

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,480
Lord Qinghai?

62
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,920
I’m charging him with

63
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,240
misleading His Majesty,

64
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,480
murdering his right-handed officials,

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,200
namely former Six Wing Generals, Amolan,

66
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,240
Gu Dacheng and the other two.

67
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,960
Nonsense!

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,680
Six Wing General

69
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,200
Amolan died of illness.

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,240
Gu Dacheng indulged his men in looting

71
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,399
and got killed by vigilantes.

72
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,000
That’s no secret.

73
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,720
How dare you bring false charges

74
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,640
against a respected official?

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
There will be consequences!

76
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,160
Let her finish.

77
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,000
But Lord...

78
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,640
The charges also include

79
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,440
malice,

80
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,120
disloyalty,

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,200
manipulation

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,440
in an attempt to shake the court.

83
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,000
I worked

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,040
for the Gu Family.

85
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,200
The day Mr. Gu died,

86
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,840
I saw you

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,400
and your men in the mansion.

88
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,200
Really?

89
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,080
I’ll take your statement

90
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,000
and hand it over to Grand Justice.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,680
Ma’am,

92
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,880
go home with your grandson

93
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,040
and wait for their reply.

94
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
No, thanks.

95
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,120
My grandson and I

96
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,960
are in Mr. Gu’s debt.

97
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,200
We know challenging you in public

98
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,560
is a risk to life.

99
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,080
That statement has my signature

100
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,800
and fingerprint.

101
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,360
I’m willing to die

102
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,840
to uphold justice

103
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,000
and bring the old case

104
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,040
to public attention

105
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,960
so that injustice will be redressed.

106
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,160
What’s happening?

107
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,880
Grandmother!

108
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,720
Grandmother!

109
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,760
Grandmother!

110
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,760
Can you hear me?

111
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,840
Lord,

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,920
she poisoned herself.

113
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,640
- That boy!
- That boy!

114
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,440
Scarlet tongue. He’s poisoned, too.

115
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,520
Bring him into the carriage.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,720
Head back to Zhaoming Palace.

117
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,320
Go!

118
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,200
Guards!

119
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,760
Yes!

120
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,160
(Dinghe Gate)

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,640
Kid...

122
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,520
The moon leaving Sagittarius

123
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,960
is a message from heaven

124
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,240
to wipe out evil.

125
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,120
Kid!

126
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,160
Kid!

127
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,120
Kid!

128
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,960
Halt.

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,520
Lord...

130
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,400
He was poisoned and used

131
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,000
to assassinate me.

132
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,760
He was innocent.

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,080
Bury him properly.

134
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:28,960
Lord,

135
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,440
Associate Justice Zong Yu
is here with his men.

136
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,200
If you don’t want to see him,

137
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,560
- I’ll drive him away.
- No.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,160
Let him in.

139
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,240
You’re injured...

140
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Keep my stab wound

141
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,560
from others.

142
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,400
I don’t get it.

143
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Their attempt to kill me

144
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,080
with a poisoned child

145
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,720
says more of a test

146
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,680
than assassination.

147
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,960
So far, they’ve had no idea

148
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,880
whether I’m wounded

149
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,200
or not.

150
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,800
This morning’s incident puts me

151
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,320
and Jifeng Pavilion in a tough spot.

152
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,080
If others in the capital

153
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,040
get wind of my injury,

154
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,320
it’ll provoke more rumors.

155
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,600
Understood.

156
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,560
Keep Haishi

157
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,480
and Zhuoying out of the loop, too.

158
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,600
Yes.

159
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,960
When will you set off?

160
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,320
It’s not decided yet,

161
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,040
probably before the end of the month.

162
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,800
After General Tang meets His Majesty,

163
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,120
we’ll set out.

164
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,520
So soon?

165
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,320
Not exactly.

166
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,680
I’ve been back for quite a while.

167
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,000
Given the pressure
Huangquan Pass is under,

168
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,280
it’s too kind of His Majesty

169
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,679
to let us stay for so long.

170
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,360
You know,

171
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,039
Jifeng Pavilion

172
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,280
is swamped with locating

173
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,000
lost imperial clansmen.

174
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,720
I’m needed everywhere

175
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,120
and can’t get a break.

176
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,840
I wish you could stay

177
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,400
and help me

178
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,040
so I could lean on you for advice.

179
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,160
I hate to leave you and Master,

180
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,760
but I’ve signed up

181
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,960
for guarding the border.

182
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,720
I need to fulfill my duty.

183
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,080
Speaking of which,

184
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,760
why is His Majesty

185
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,200
asking you to track down

186
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,920
those lost members out of the blue?

187
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,240
His Majesty is hard to predict.

188
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,520
I don’t have a clue, either.

189
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,720
Oh, Zhuoying,

190
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,560
did you bring

191
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,040
that Dream Catcher to Yu’an Palace

192
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,120
like I said

193
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
before I left for Yuezhou?

194
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,520
When have I ever let you down?

195
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,600
I did, of course.

196
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,440
It’s just that Princess Tilan

197
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,160
is no longer who she was.

198
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,280
Right now,

199
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
she’s the distinguished Consort Shurong.

200
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
You’d better stay away

201
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,520
from members of the harem

202
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,800
for your own sake.

203
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,760
Something happened to Consort Shurong?

204
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,320
It’s no secret.

205
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,680
There’s gossip in the Palace

206
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,560
about the resemblance between
her and the late Empress.

207
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,280
It’s sowing discord

208
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
between His Majesty and her.

209
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,160
Even when she’s sick,

210
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,040
palace physicians can’t treat her

211
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,960
unless His Majesty allows it.

212
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,280
Anyway,

213
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,440
don’t get yourself involved.

214
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,600
Is that Mr. Fang Zhuoying
and Mr. Fang Haishi?

215
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,320
You have good ears, Miss Zheliu.

216
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,880
You can tell it’s us

217
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,040
simply based on our steps.

218
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,600
That’s nothing.

219
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,120
Mr. Fang told me

220
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,600
you returned to Linjie
to visit your mother.

221
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,480
How is she?

222
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,920
Is everything alright at home?

223
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,000
All is well.

224
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,560
Good to know.

225
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,320
Mr. Fang Haishi,

226
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,760
I have something for you.

227
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,200
Please give me a minute.

228
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,960
It’s for me.

229
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,960
Is that...?

230
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,720
Mr. Fang Haishi,

231
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,280
your brother

232
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,440
picked the fabric for me.

233
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,560
All I did

234
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,960
was sewing.

235
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,480
A dress for me...

236
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,600
You can give it

237
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,840
to your future wife.

238
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,120
She might be

239
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,080
about your size,

240
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,080
you know.

241
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,400
This dress is exquisite

242
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,040
without showing any stitches.

243
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,160
It’s silky smooth, too.

244
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,200
Thanks for all your work.

245
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,240
Box it up for Mr. Fang Haishi.

246
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,040
Yes.

247
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,800
Don’t marry someone

248
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,400
bigger than you,

249
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,560
or she will outgrow this dress.

250
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,640
You’re so mean.

251
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,240
I was going to thank you

252
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,320
for doing something nice for once.

253
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,320
My future wife

254
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,240
will squeeze in this dress anyhow.

255
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,320
I’m glad

256
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,680
you like it.

257
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,520
Miss Zheliu,

258
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,920
I prepared

259
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,920
something for you, too.

260
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,280
Fang Zhuoying!

261
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,800
I...

262
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,800
Here’s the thing.

263
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,760
Zhuoying specifically asked me

264
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,000
to bring back

265
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,920
the finest silk thread from Yuezhou

266
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,320
before I left.

267
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:29,920
I...

268
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,160
Uh...

269
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,240
Uh...

270
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,320
- Zhuoying.
- Well…

271
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,120
This is the luminous thread
from Yuezhou.

272
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,240
I want you to have it.

273
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,280
Luminous thread?

274
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,720
It’s the best that can be found.

275
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,080
The thread itself is transparent.

276
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,600
Put it in the moonlight

277
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,600
or sunlight,

278
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,440
and it’ll reflect

279
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,640
various colors.

280
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,240
Luminous thread is a rarity

281
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,160
that can hardly be found.

282
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,080
How did you get it?

283
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,920
I’m from a fishing village.

284
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,680
People there told me about it.

285
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,880
Is it shiny?

286
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,640
Absolutely!

287
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,520
It even outshines

288
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,800
the rainbow.

289
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,200
I’m sure it does

290
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,960
if you say so.

291
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,480
If you like it,

292
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,400
I’ll see if I can get more.

293
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,440
I’m lucky enough

294
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
to have one reel.

295
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,760
I dare not covet more.

296
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,800
Thank you so much, Mr. Fang Haishi.

297
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,400
Miss Zheliu,

298
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,640
you’re important

299
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,960
to Zhuoying.

300
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,800
Hence

301
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,320
you mean the same to me.

302
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,640
We’ll see each other a lot.

303
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,360
No need to be too polite.

304
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,000
Haishi, you...

305
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,000
Miss...

306
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,200
Miss Zheliu,

307
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,600
I admit... that

308
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,160
I fall for you.

309
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,000
I... I...

310
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,680
I admire you,

311
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
but I...

312
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,200
I mean no disrespect.

313
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,640
I’m not saying you do.

314
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,320
Zhuoying.

315
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,320
I mean you like her.

316
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:15,880
What...?

317
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,440
Be a man, will you?

318
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,520
Can’t you speak out how you feel?

319
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,480
- Are you blushing?
- I...

320
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,400
Are you having a fever?

321
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,040
Are you sick?

322
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,840
Miss Zheliu,

323
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,000
it occurred to me

324
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,360
that I should be on duty today.

325
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,280
Please excuse me.

326
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,840
Zhuoying,

327
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,600
are you sure?

328
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,400
(Fabric Office)

329
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,640
Yes! It’s my shift!

330
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,200
Manager, here’s the dress.

331
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Mr. Fang Haishi.

332
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,280
I shall take my leave, too.

333
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,360
Thank you, Miss Zheliu.

334
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,800
Fang Haishi!

335
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,160
You...

336
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,240
What’s wrong with you?

337
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,000
What are you doing, Fang Zhuoying?

338
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
Why are you yelling at me?

339
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,640
Did I do anything wrong?

340
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,800
I simply said the truth.

341
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,920
You do like her, don’t you?

342
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,680
I...

343
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,640
I’ll tell her myself someday.

344
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,120
Someday?

345
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,840
Like when?

346
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,280
I will do it!

347
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,360
I’m sure you will.

348
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,840
I know you all too well.

349
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,000
You’re thin-skinned.

350
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
By the time you plucked up,

351
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,680
she’d turn 80.

352
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,480
Still...

353
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,280
You...

354
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,280
You were being reckless.

355
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,520
What if you scared her away?

356
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,960
I didn’t!

357
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,920
Can’t you see

358
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,040
Miss Zheliu treats you

359
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,960
differently?

360
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,440
Does she?

361
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,480
I meant to tell her slowly.

362
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,560
You’re slow enough.

363
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,400
Look at you!

364
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,640
You keep dragging your feet.

365
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,080
Mutual love

366
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,000
is the hardest to find.

367
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:00,960
His Majesty

368
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,480
has had you
work in the Palace for years.

369
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,440
And he

370
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,640
trusts Miss Zheliu, too.

371
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,080
I suggest

372
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,560
you ask him

373
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,520
to grant a marriage to you.

374
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,560
Like...

375
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,640
a betrothal?

376
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,080
Fine.

377
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,640
I’m thick-skinned. I’ll go.

378
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,680
No, no, no!

379
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,880
Not now.

380
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,600
What if Zheliu thinks it’s too fast?

381
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,320
Do you remember Master’s teaching?

382
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,720
“All good things don’t last long.

383
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,720
Clouds disperse and tiles break.”

384
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,960
A successful relationship

385
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,960
lies in timing and luck.

386
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,560
If you know she’s the one,

387
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,360
why not fight for her?

388
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,040
Fang Zhuoying!

389
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,640
I...

390
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,200
I’m reporting to duty.

391
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Bihong is right.

392
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,320
It’s warm these days.

393
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,000
You could use some walks.

394
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,640
You can’t be in bed

395
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,560
all day long,

396
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,359
or your cold will only get worse.

397
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,400
Alright.

398
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,280
I’m taking a walk now.

399
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,640
Stop nagging me.

400
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,040
If you cared more

401
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,200
about your health,

402
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,359
we wouldn’t nag you at all.

403
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,240
Look at her. I took her advice

404
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,040
and still got blamed.

405
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,520
Once you recover,

406
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,839
I’ll stop talking

407
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,240
and listen to you.

408
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,040
Consort Shurong.

409
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

410
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,040
If there’s nothing else,

411
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,680
you’d better leave.

412
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,120
Why are you avoiding me?

413
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,480
I received

414
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,960
your gift.

415
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,080
I was having a hard time

416
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,720
in the Palace,

417
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,040
and now, it’s worse

418
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,440
after His Majesty detested me.

419
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,080
If you’re seen

420
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,680
talking to me in private,

421
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,440
that’ll be bad for you.

422
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,000
Don’t worry about it.

423
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,960
I’ve always regarded you

424
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
as my friend.

425
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,640
Wherever we end up in the future,

426
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
you’ll forever

427
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,800
be a friend of mine.

428
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,520
I appreciate your kindness

429
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,960
and I’ll forever

430
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,640
remember it.

431
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,920
Then...

432
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,560
can I come

433
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,840
and say goodbye to you before departure?

434
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,240
I’m heading back to Huangquan Pass

435
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,640
with General Tang soon.

436
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,000
I don’t think

437
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,720
you should.

438
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,680
It’s inconvenient.

439
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,520
You’d better leave now.

440
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,680
I see.

441
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,320
Good day, Your Highness.

442
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,480
(Essence of Beauty Reveals Itself)

443
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,080
Associate Justice Zong.

444
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,160
- General Fang.
- General Fang.

445
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,200
If you’ll excuse me,

446
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,720
I’m still needed

447
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,800
back at the office.

448
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,360
Do drop by

449
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,160
whenever you can.

450
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,680
We can sit down

451
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,720
and have a few drinks together.

452
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,200
I’d love to.

453
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,160
Please.

454
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,400
Good day.

455
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,360
Good day.

456
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,960
Lord asked me to

457
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
keep his injury a secret

458
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,000
even from Young Master Zhuoying

459
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,840
and Young Master Haishi.

460
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,800
He said

461
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,720
if the people of Grand Justice
came again,

462
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,120
he’d deal with them.

463
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,040
I see.

464
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,360
I’m aware of

465
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,760
the latest situation in the capital.

466
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,880
You may leave.

467
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,640
I want you to arrange

468
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
for Chu Linlang’s arrival.

469
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

470
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,200
She calls herself Chu Linlang.

471
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,200
Ministry of Rites

472
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,000
has checked her thoroughly

473
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,720
and found nothing suspicious.

474
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,000
His Majesty

475
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,320
expects to meet her soon.

476
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,400
Lord Chang

477
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,640
will be there, too.

478
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,920
If he and His Majesty

479
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,160
both confirm
she’s Consort Nie’s daughter,

480
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
we’ll have a new princess

481
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,280
in the Palace.

482
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,520
Keep an eye

483
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,440
on Haishi.

484
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,360
Tang Qianzi is about to

485
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,560
head back to the north.

486
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,160
Haishi should also report back to duty.

487
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,160
No more extended stay in the capital.

488
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,080
Lord,

489
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,200
must he leave so soon?

490
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,680
Given what happened today,

491
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,960
someone

492
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,720
is determined to

493
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,440
rake up my past

494
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,360
by delivering

495
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,240
a witness in public

496
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,320
to paint me

497
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
as a murderer.

498
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,200
They wouldn’t

499
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,520
go to such great lengths for a breeze.

500
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,880
A storm is coming.

501
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,280
His Majesty trusts you.

502
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,680
Jifeng Pavilion

503
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,880
was only following his order back then.

504
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,360
You had nothing to do with it.

505
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,680
Even if someone

506
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,160
was trying to stab you in the back,

507
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,880
the situation

508
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,640
wouldn’t deteriorate overnight.

509
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,880
Whoever they are, they’re well-prepared.

510
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,360
If they’re going to fabricate charges

511
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,040
against me,

512
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,280
you, Zhuoying and Haishi

513
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,160
will all be accused of complicity.

514
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,560
Haishi will be a lot safer

515
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,160
at the border than here.

516
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,400
Understood.

517
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,320
Go.

518
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,040
Yes.

519
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,560
Who is it?

520
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,280
It’s me.

521
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,520
Coming.

522
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,440
Is everything alright, Master?

523
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,960
When are you going to leave?

524
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,400
After General Tang meets His Majesty.

525
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Set out as soon as possible

526
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,880
just in case.

527
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
You can’t wait for me

528
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,520
to leave?

529
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,120
You know,

530
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,320
we won’t be able to

531
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,600
see each other again anytime soon.

532
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,400
It’s a beautiful dress.

533
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,360
Really?

534
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,440
Don’t wear it too often

535
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
for the sake of your identity.

536
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,000
Sorry.

537
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,320
Master,

538
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,800
what brought

539
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,080
Associate Justice Zong over earlier?

540
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,320
He was here?

541
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,520
I ran into him

542
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,200
when I came back.

543
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,600
And he asked me

544
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,320
to swing by his office some other day.

545
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,560
You’re a general.

546
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,280
Don’t be too close to court officials.

547
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,760
I know.

548
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,360
Master,

549
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,440
did something

550
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,120
happen in court?

551
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,880
You could say that.

552
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,520
Was it bad?

553
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,240
Not so much.

554
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,280
Go pack up.

555
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,480
Shaozi

556
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,440
and Zhuoying are on it.

557
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,200
It’s late.

558
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,480
Get some rest.

559
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,920
Master.

560
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,040
Go back inside.

561
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,440
The luminous thread is a rare treasure.

562
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,000
It’s dazzling enough in the dark.

563
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,400
I can’t imagine

564
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,680
how shiny the fabric

565
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,720
made of it will be in the sunlight.

566
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,160
The problem is

567
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,840
what pattern we should choose

568
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,480
to make on which garment

569
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,720
is worth this valuable thread.

570
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,360
It’s a private gift

571
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,560
from Mr. Fang Haishi

572
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,320
instead of the palace’s stash.

573
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,200
If you ask me,

574
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,280
use it to make something

575
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,120
for someone close.

576
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,360
Can I?

577
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,440
Why not?

578
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,480
Manager, it’s getting windy.

579
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,080
It’ll probably rain later.

580
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
You should go back and rest.

581
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,880
Thank you, Aunt Su.

582
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,560
I mean you like her.

583
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,800
Be a man, will you?

584
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,960
Can’t you speak out how you feel?

585
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,040
Lord was fine this morning.

586
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,640
How come he’s spitting blood now?

587
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,480
Physician,

588
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,400
what to do?

589
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,880
Lord was stabbed in his old wound.

590
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,440
He had a relapse

591
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
and spitted blood more than once

592
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,840
when he returned from Huangquan Pass.

593
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,720
Now, he’s twice injured.

594
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,920
His meridians are damaged.

595
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,440
The rain and cold air

596
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,560
are worsening his condition further.

597
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,200
Good news is it’s better than last time.

598
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,280
He’ll be fine

599
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,320
on medication.

600
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,520
I know

601
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,920
my condition.

602
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,800
Everything

603
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,320
is a scratch to you.

604
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,160
But even so,

605
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,400
too many of them

606
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,760
could still be fatal.

607
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,760
Minister Chen has a point.

608
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,760
You think you’re young and strong enough

609
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,080
to withstand

610
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,560
wounds after wounds,

611
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,760
but at this rate,

612
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,840
I’m afraid...

613
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,880
What do you mean?

614
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,440
I’m afraid longevity would be a problem.

615
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,080
Your life would be greatly shortened.

616
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,000
I’ll go decoct the herbs.

617
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,160
Shaozi.

618
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,520
See the physician out.

619
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,880
Good night, Lord.

620
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,600
Yes.

621
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,640
Fang Jianming,

622
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,440
Haishi is your sweetheart.

623
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,840
None of the Fang Family Leaders

624
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,200
of Liushang ended well

625
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,200
since Dazheng was established.

626
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,520
Fang Jianming,

627
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,000
with so many lives you’ve taken,

628
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,640
you wouldn’t be blessed

629
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,480
with a long life yourself.

630
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,640
Don’t ask for more than you deserve.

631
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,760
It’s good enough to protect her

632
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,280
as long as you can.

633
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
This gentleman is 42.

634
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,560
He’s Grand Princess Chengyang’s nephew

635
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,720
who claimed that he had met you

636
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,280
when you were young,

637
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,680
Your Majesty.

638
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,280
Go, go, go.

639
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,320
Next.

640
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,400
This lady is 31.

641
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,520
She’s Lord Ci’s brother’s granddaughter

642
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,960
who’s been struggling

643
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,000
in Tuhuolu for years

644
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,440
since the Rebellion of Prince Yi.

645
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,920
She’s eager to come home

646
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,400
to rejoin the clan.

647
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,040
Go.

648
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,640
Next.

649
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,440
Your Majesty,

650
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,800
this lady is 23

651
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,240
who’s the half-sister
of Consort Jing to the late emperor.

652
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,800
She was living with her sister

653
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,920
before

654
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,480
- she entered the Palace.
- Your Majesty.

655
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:44,840
Stop.

656
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,720
I’ve seen enough

657
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,640
of those nobodies.

658
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,560
I don’t know those people.

659
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,320
Have the Ministry of Rites
verify their identities.

660
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,400
Yes.

661
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,840
Go.

662
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,400
Jichang,

663
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,760
what about you?

664
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,880
Do you recognize any of them?

665
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,640
Brother,

666
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,920
I left for Zhunian

667
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,160
at a young age.

668
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Come to think of it,

669
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,600
I don’t actually remember them.

670
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,200
Anyway,

671
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,840
it’s my fault

672
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,880
to bring up

673
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,880
such a controversial issue.

674
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,960
I’m sorry for wasting your time.

675
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,160
It’s the right thing to do.

676
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,880
I should’ve looked for them years ago

677
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,240
but I neglected it.

678
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,880
You did nothing wrong.

679
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,640
Your Majesty,

680
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,080
General Tang Qianzi is here.

681
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:35,920
Send him in.

682
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,320
Greetings, Your Majesty,

683
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,920
Lord Chang.

684
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,840
Rise.

685
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

686
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,360
General,

687
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,000
what’s this about?

688
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,640
Your Majesty,

689
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,160
I’ve been back for a while

690
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,360
and I’m concerned about the border.

691
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,800
Please allow me

692
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,240
to go back as soon as possible.

693
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,040
Huangquan Pass is remote.

694
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,160
It’s tough to maintain its stability.

695
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,280
I appreciate all your hard work.

696
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,480
I meant to

697
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,040
have you stay for a few more days.

698
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,000
But

699
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,040
the northwest border

700
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,000
is a top priority.

701
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,720
You should return soon.

702
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,120
I’m entrusting

703
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,400
Huangquan Pass to you.

704
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,040
I won’t let you down, Your Majesty.

705
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,320
That Pass lives and dies with me.

706
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,600
The military affair is one thing.

707
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,080
There’s something else.

708
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,880
Go ahead.

709
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:54,880
Your Majesty,

710
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,960
Zhunian is the weakest
among the tribes in Leizhou.

711
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,520
Their leader is old with a young heir.

712
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,760
They can only depend on Dazheng.

713
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,680
Consort Shurong is fragile

714
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
and struggling alone in the Palace

715
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,280
to survive.

716
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,280
No one cares about

717
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,840
her condition.

718
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,480
Consort... Consort Shurong’s condition

719
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,440
is... is His Majesty’s family business.

720
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,960
It’s not your place to judge.

721
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,720
Qianzi,

722
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,520
you’re overreaching yourself.

723
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,040
So?

724
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,880
What’s your point?

725
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,320
I dare not judge you, Your Majesty.

726
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,840
It’s just that Consort Shurong

727
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,800
helped me a lot when I was in Zhunian.

728
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,840
Hearing that

729
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,640
she’s unwell lately,

730
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,280
I’m concerned about her.

731
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:42,840
Your Majesty,

732
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,160
please

733
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,720
have her treated

734
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,320
before it’s too late.

735
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,280
General Tang,

736
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,360
you...

737
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,640
I heard

738
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,600
she regarded you as her elder brother.

739
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,160
Well,

740
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,160
she’s my woman,

741
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,880
not your concern.

742
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,760
Gather your troops

743
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,040
and head back to the north.

744
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,800
Yes.

745
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,199
Good day, Your Majesty.

746
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:34,920
Mu Deqing.

747
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

748
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,920
Is there an abandoned

749
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,120
hot spring pool inside Qingquan Palace?

750
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,000
I figure

751
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,000
it can help cure

752
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,040
Consort Shurong’s cold.

753
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,199
She can use it

754
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,400
if she wants.

755
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,880
Are you summoning her

756
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,679
tonight to...?

757
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,159
Enough. That’s it. Go ahead.

758
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,840
Yes.

759
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,040
Jichang.

760
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,800
She and you

761
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,320
also go way back.

762
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,320
How come

763
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,280
you’ve never

764
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,720
asked me about her condition?

765
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,720
It’s inappropriate

766
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,880
for me to bring up your woman

767
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,000
and I wouldn’t dare.

768
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,480
Oh!

769
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,880
You’re too timid

770
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,120
and quiet like

771
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,120
a little girl.

772
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,600
Forget about hatching eagle eggs.

773
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,840
Take the trained ones

774
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,800
with you

775
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,720
and go hunting with me next time.

776
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,480
Yes!

777
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,400
Watch your step.

778
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,360
Be careful.

779
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,480
Is there a rainbow for real?

780
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,880
A lake is in front of you.

781
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,640
The view here is extraordinary.

782
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,520
A rainbow is hanging in the air

783
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,880
with its reflection in the water.

784
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,360
Look closely,

785
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,000
and there are more reflections

786
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,880
on the vines by the lake

787
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,240
and dewdrops, too.

788
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,120
Are there puddles

789
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,760
on our way here?

790
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,920
If so, are they also

791
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,360
reflecting the rainbow?

792
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,520
Rainbows are everywhere in the Palace.

793
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,560
I didn’t notice any before

794
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,480
because I was only looking at the sky.

795
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,000
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

796
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,520
I’m willing to help.

797
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,640
You can tell me

798
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,120
what you want to see

799
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,760
or try to remember.

800
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,600
I’ll describe everything to you.

801
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,360
Slanted eyes,

802
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,240
a straight nose,

803
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,200
deep contours of his face,

804
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,560
earnest look.

805
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,200
I wish I could

806
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,040
see him myself.

807
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,240
- Stick, Stick, Stick!
- Stick, Stick, Stick!

808
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,080
- Stick, Stick, Tiger!
- Stick, Stick, Chicken!

809
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,720
Drink up.

810
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,760
- Drink it.
- Yes.

811
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,240
You’re really something, Mr. Fang.

812
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,480
You drink

813
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,920
as well as you serve.

814
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,400
I still remember

815
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,440
how you and Lord

816
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,280
worked together outside the border

817
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,360
to take over Lanzi.

818
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,080
And

819
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,240
you even won over the Jiamanese.

820
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,120
I, for one, greatly admire you!

821
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,560
A hero drinks fine liquor.

822
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,240
Here.

823
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:57,880
Cheers!

824
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
- Drink up!
- Cheers!

825
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,080
Cheers!

826
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:00,920
Cheers!

827
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,960
“A great wind came forth,

828
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,240
the clouds rose on high...”

829
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,280
Let’s hear it!

830
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,040
“Where will I find brave men

831
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,440
to guard the four corners of my land?”

832
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,960
When you go to the front again,

833
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
gentlemen,

834
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,160
I’ll

835
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,080
be your backup.

836
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,760
Then I want to be the vanguard.

837
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,920
Sure!

838
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,480
(Huixian Restaurant)

839
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,880
- Yes!
- Good!

840
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,720
Huixian Restaurant is overcrowded.

841
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,600
I wonder which book

842
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,840
is being told today.

843
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,760
Not bad.

844
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,560
Is that

845
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,600
about Emperor Qiangwei and Wenchun?

846
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,720
I mean, Book of King Yulie.

847
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:43,960
It’s about...

848
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,320
Let’s go.

849
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:48,720
Come on.

850
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,240
Today’s story is

851
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,920
Mrs. Guchen calls for justice
in the street.

852
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,960
Lord Yuan’s true colors are revealed.

853
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,400
The wicked one is exposed.

854
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,400
Lord Yuan faked his own death to recover

855
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,880
from his illness at His Majesty’s order

856
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,320
but he wasn’t ill at all.

857
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,000
He feared

858
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,040
that the public would discover the fact

859
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,000
that he murdered loyal officials

860
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,880
out of jealousy,

861
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,960
so he holed himself up

862
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,600
like a scared rat.

863
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,240
Then

864
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,440
he fawned on His Majesty

865
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,920
while staging his comeback.

866
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,320
Too bad,

867
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,640
man proposes, heaven disposes!

868
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,800
Mrs. Guchen stopped him in public
and accused him of murder

869
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,240
at the cost of her life.

870
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,520
This old case

871
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,680
was finally be brought

872
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,360
to Grand Justice’s attention.

873
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,080
Who is this?

874
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,200
How dare you!

875
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:44,880
Sir,

876
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,080
I’m not the only one saying it.

877
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,520
The whole city is talking about it.

878
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
Why are you blaming me?

879
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,640
You storytellers

880
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,760
have crossed the line!

881
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,040
Incriminating honored officials

882
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,120
is a felony!

883
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,600
Mrs. Guchen exposed injustice in public

884
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,080
and then died with her grandson.

885
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Everyone in the capital knows that.

886
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,360
They have been talking

887
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,280
and spreading it nonstop.

888
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,880
Are you going to

889
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,520
hold them all accountable?

890
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,280
- You...
- Haishi,

891
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,400
your identity is sensitive.

892
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,400
Don’t get yourself in trouble.

893
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,720
Your Majesty, Fang Haishi is here.

894
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,440
Your Majesty.

895
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,240
What’s wrong?

896
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,160
Tracking down imperial clansmen
is still ongoing

897
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,400
amid the mess in the capital.

898
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,800
Jifeng Pavilion is shorthanded
in this joint operation

899
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,040
with the Ministry of Rites.

900
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,200
So I’d like to

901
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,400
work with Imperial Guards for now.

902
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,120
Are you telling me

903
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,480
they are a bunch of

904
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,520
good-for-nothings?

905
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,880
Only you can do the job?

906
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,040
Of course not, Your Majesty.

907
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,920
This game is...

908
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,240
Hold on.

909
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,800
If you make this move,

910
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,640
the black side will lose.

911
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,680
Are you trying to read my mind?

912
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,640
I wouldn’t dare, Your Majesty.

913
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,000
Tell me,

914
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,800
what makes you think

915
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,760
I want the black side to win?

916
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,760
You don’t want it to win.

917
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,440
What you want is balance.

918
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,360
Playing two sides against each other

919
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,480
is only your way to kill time.

920
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,160
If one side

921
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,280
won with no sweat,

922
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,120
that’d be less fun.

923
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,320
Interesting point.

924
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:01,920
Rise.

925
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,720
Thank you for listening, Your Majesty.

926
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,000
I’ll grant your request

927
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,280
for one, you rose from Jifeng Pavilion,

928
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,280
and two,

929
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,200
Jianming is your master.

930
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,520
Right now, he’s...

931
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,160
Anyway,

932
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,360
it’d be great

933
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,040
that you stay and share his burden.

934
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,360
Consort Nie’s daughter

935
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,280
will arrive shortly.

936
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,960
If she’s checked out,
there will be a banquet, too.

937
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,880
Jianming can have you take over

938
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,880
the arrangement and everything.

939
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,840
You could use some practice.

940
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,320
Now that winter is gone,

941
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,840
Hanzhou in the north is getting warmer.

942
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,640
Mount Mingluo and its surroundings

943
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,400
require tighter patrol.

944
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
Any deployment along Qiyue Pass?

945
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,640
Yes, Lord.

946
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,200
3,000 troops are transferred there

947
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,160
to garrison the area.

948
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,160
They’ll be arranged in accordance with

949
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,040
your previous plan.

950
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,600
Have the returned

951
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,960
stay at Left General’s Mansion.

952
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,280
Yes, Lord.

953
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,080
(Silt River)
Step up patrols

954
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,000
along the west tributary
of the Silt River

955
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,040
in case someone streams down.

956
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,120
Yes.

957
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,080
What’s the arrangement at the East Gate

958
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,440
when Linlang arrives that day?

959
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,120
The same as you requested.

960
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,800
Two groups of guards
are with His Majesty.

961
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,000
One stays close to him.

962
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,480
The other is ready to shoot from above.

963
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,480
In addition,

964
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,880
Imperial Guards

965
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,040
are set

966
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,280
every 50 steps

967
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,440
in the crowd

968
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,240
in plain clothes.

969
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,120
Lord.

970
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,840
(Administration Office
of Left General’s Mansion)

971
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:53,680
Lord!

972
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:54,720
I’m fine.

973
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,320
Did you go and ask His Majesty

974
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,640
to transfer you to Imperial Guards?

975
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,400
I heard from Zhuoying

976
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,920
that we needed more hands in the Palace,

977
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,640
so I asked His Majesty to let me stay

978
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,960
and help with security.

979
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,440
Forget about it.

980
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,720
Go back to Huangquan Pass

981
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,960
with Tang Qianzi tomorrow morning.

982
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,600
I won’t.

983
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,880
You have a job there.

984
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,160
You can’t come and go

985
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,680
as you please.

986
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,760
My transfer is only temporary.

987
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,280
Are you disobeying my order?

988
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,040
How long do you expect me

989
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:36,920
to be there?

990
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,360
Let me rephrase it.

991
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,520
How long do you expect me

992
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,920
to hide there?

993
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,720
A year? A decade?

994
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:43,800
Or wait until

995
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,240
Mrs. Guchen’s case blows over?

996
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,720
Do you want me

997
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,120
to be away forever?

998
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,960
That case isn’t your concern.

999
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,080
Whether you’re here

1000
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,080
or at the border

1001
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,680
won’t make any difference.

1002
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,400
In that sense,

1003
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,680
whether I’m with you or not

1004
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,760
is all the same to you?

1005
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,240
Yes.

1006
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,680
But not to me!

1007
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,240
I need to stay

1008
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,480
to prove your innocence.

1009
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,040
I don’t need you to interfere.

1010
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,560
What if I insist?

1011
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,400
Just because

1012
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,800
I tolerate you most of the time

1013
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,600
doesn’t mean you get to push it.

1014
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,800
Tolerate me?

1015
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,160
Is that what our relationship

1016
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,960
is all about?

1017
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,160
Yes.

1018
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,400
You traveled thousands of miles

1019
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,000
day and night to Lanzi to save me.

1020
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,200
When I got wounded,

1021
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,520
you crossed the line

1022
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,440
to feed me medicine.

1023
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,080
I like osmanthus sugar

1024
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,160
and you sent me a box of it

1025
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,600
from the other half of the state.

1026
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,160
When I missed my mother,

1027
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,240
you went back with me to visit her.

1028
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,760
When I fell into the water,

1029
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,080
you jumped in right away.

1030
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,680
- You did all that...
- I did all that

1031
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,880
because you’re my disciple.

1032
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,240
But why did you kiss me?

1033
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,360
You love me.

1034
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,720
Why do you keep pushing me away?

1035
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,720
I want to be by your side.

1036
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,240
I’m sorry.

1037
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,760
I thought

1038
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,800
I was only one step away from you.

1039
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,840
Turns out,

1040
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,480
I made a fool of myself.

1041
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,960
