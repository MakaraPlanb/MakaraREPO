Uncle Earlji.

26
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,679
Duohan!

27
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:44,639
Duohan,

28
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,839
my nephew!

29
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,039
Duohan!

30
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,825
Meet my daughter

31
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,839
and your cousin,

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,750
Tara.

33
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:00,839
Father,

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,039
you’re right.

35
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:03,279
Duohan

36
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,440
is indeed the best-looking man

37
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
on our grassland

38
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,199
and he worked undercover for years

39
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,360
to assassinate the Emperor of Dazheng.

40
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,425
He’s born an eagle of Huku,

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,960
a galloping war-horse,

42
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,119
chasing the never-setting sun!

43
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,679
Duohan,

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,240
you went missing

45
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,160
before turning 10.

46
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,520
I’m so glad

47
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,639
to have you back.

48
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:26,500
Soldiers,

49
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,919
I’m introducing you

50
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,279
to the hero of Huku,

51
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:30,199
Duohan!

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,000
Hooray!

53
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:34,600
Duohan,

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,119
you have

55
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,559
this entire grassland under your feet.

56
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,679
Uncle Earlji,

57
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,919
I’ll follow you

58
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
to restore our tribe!

59
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,640
You’ve been away from Hanzhou for years.

60
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,559
How do you feel

61
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,200
coming back this time

62
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,040
while carrying out your tasks?

63
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:22,640
It’s sad

64
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,320
that Hanzhou

65
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,679
is as war-torn

66
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,640
and broken

67
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,239
as it was years ago.

68
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,839
So was Dazheng

69
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,519
in the past.

70
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,519
But changes

71
00:04:38,225 --> 00:04:39,264
can be made.

72
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,920
Can they?

73
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,760
When the Rebellion of Prince Yi

74
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,320
spread the flames of war
all over Dazheng,

75
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:49,880
I was determined

76
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,920
to restore peace,

77
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,000
stability

78
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:57,559
and prosperity.

79
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,239
I also knew,

80
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,720
to achieve that,

81
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,119
I had to give it my all.

82
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,119
That’s why I chose

83
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,119
to join His Majesty

84
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,399
and fight at the risk of my life,

85
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,760
which got us this far.

86
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,239
If someone

87
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,640
is willing to make every effort

88
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,839
to bring peace to Hanzhou,

89
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,799
it will be

90
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,559
free from war eventually.

91
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,040
Zhuoying,

92
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,454
no one is born

93
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:29,835
to fight on the battlefield

94
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,600
or can get used to

95
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,480
taking lives

96
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,100
day after day.

97
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,519
You might feel sick

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,040
or drained

99
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,200
but someone has to battle evil

100
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,519
for the rest of the world.

101
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,320
Someone has to safeguard

102
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:49,440
the hard-earned peace.

103
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,480
This isn’t the life

104
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,640
I wanted

105
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:56,715
but it’s the one I chose.

106
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,920
Someday,

107
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,160
you’ll have to

108
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,239
make your own choice, too.

109
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,125
Why are you here alone?

110
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,009
Uncle Earlji.

111
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,440
Back then,

112
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:17,160
your other uncles and I

113
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
looked for you for years

114
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,519
while you

115
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,799
ended up in Tianqi City

116
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,720
and worked for Emperor Xu.

117
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,050
I know.

118
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,519
I thought years of separation

119
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:29,679
had alienated us,

120
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,880
but you took me in

121
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,119
without doubt.

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,040
Because I know

123
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,119
blood of Huku

124
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,359
runs in your veins.

125
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,399
This is

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,119
how I knew you were

127
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,000
training yourself hard

128
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,200
all these years

129
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,880
to kill Emperor Xu

130
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
and eager to come home.

131
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:57,959
You haven’t changed a bit,

132
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,399
unlike Duoluo,

133
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,600
who’s ruthless by nature.

134
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:04,119
Ever since he became

135
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,440
the new Lord of Left Pudun,

136
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:07,399
he’s indulged himself in massacres

137
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,320
and annexing other tribes.

138
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,720
Men and women, young and old,

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,519
must all obey him

140
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,600
or they’ll be slaughtered

141
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,839
and dumped in the wild.

142
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:16,799
Bloodshed and chaos

143
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,200
are falling over the grassland again.

144
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:19,920
Duohan,

145
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,359
you’re the chosen one.

146
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,320
The two of us

147
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,600
shall restore order

148
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:28,720
and peace for the sake of our people.

149
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,359
Duohan

150
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,760
pledges allegiance to you

151
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,440
to reunite Huku!

152
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,279
Good!

153
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,239
Come here

154
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,325
and drink with me.

155
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,625
I know

156
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,825
you only let me go

157
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,799
for my safety.

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,239
You mean to protect me.

159
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,359
But in our line of duty,

160
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,159
people could die any minute.

161
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:23,640
Every time we parted,

162
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:25,840
it could be forever.

163
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:27,850
So,

164
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,280
I’m not afraid of death.

165
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,799
I’m afraid

166
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,039
that you push me away

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,400
or let me go.

168
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:43,625
Lord.

169
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,825
Yes?

170
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,750
Since Young Master Zhuoying
returned to Hanbei,

171
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,320
he’s won wide support among the locals

172
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,799
for his identity as their prince

173
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,760
and the assassination attempt.

174
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,520
Earlji trusts him a lot, too.

175
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:55,080
Tons of tribes

176
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,520
have surrendered to them,

177
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,520
leaving Duoluo’s territory shrinking

178
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,850
and morale sinking.

179
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,520
Good.

180
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:03,840
On the other hand,

181
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,679
Young Master Haishi
is still in Chishan City.

182
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,239
I’m concerned...

183
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,325
I know.

184
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,080
You may leave.

185
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,350
Yes.

186
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,150
Good night, Lord.

187
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,900
Make sure

188
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,375
everything is perfect.

189
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,359
No mistake is allowed.

190
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,799
Yes, Your Majesty.

191
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,750
Big brother!

192
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:35,359
Jichang.

193
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,479
I was about to have you come

194
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,039
and here you are.

195
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,760
Greetings, big brother.

196
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,320
Don’t stand on ceremony.

197
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,825
Your birthday is in a few days.

198
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,799
I’m planning

199
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,200
to hold a grand celebration

200
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,239
for you.

201
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,320
I thought you’d be too busy

202
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,440
to remember my birthday.

203
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:54,840
I really appreciate it.

204
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,750
You’re my only brother.

205
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:57,840
So,

206
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,900
how do you want to celebrate it?

207
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,280
That’s actually

208
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,760
what I’m here for.

209
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,799
Directorate of Astronomy

210
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,559
forecasts snow

211
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:07,599
on the 18th,

212
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,039
also my birthday.

213
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,840
So I’m looking for something special.

214
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,760
My well-trained eagles

215
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,440
can do tons of tricks now.

216
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,696
I hope

217
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,280
I can set Dongyu Horse Ranch up

218
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,475
to show you what they’ve got

219
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,799
with your permission.

220
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,640
After the show,

221
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
you can

222
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,760
bring them back.

223
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,760
Have they all been trained?

224
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,475
Yes.

225
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,080
You can see for yourself

226
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,320
on my birthday.

227
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:34,679
Sure.

228
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,119
I’ll allow it.

229
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,159
Thank you, big brother!

230
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,359
I’ll go get ready.

231
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,640
Good day, big brother.

232
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,559
I’ve saved up

233
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,919
the tea

234
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:53,320
left by officials

235
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,640
for now.

236
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:11,039
Mr. Fang,

237
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,900
I need to go back to work.

238
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,960
If you need anything,

239
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,200
just let me know.

240
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:44,520
Your Majesty,

241
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:47,715
those objects

242
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:49,840
for Consort Shurong

243
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
are almost complete

244
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,719
as you requested.

245
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:54,000
I see.

246
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:56,239
Very well.

247
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,159
You may leave.

248
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,640
Yes.

249
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:10,799
Lord Qinghai has arrived.

250
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,881
Greetings, Your Majesty.

251
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,719
I’ve been told

252
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,000
that Fang Zhuoying is doing great.

253
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,400
Now that he’s gained a foothold
in the Right Tribe of Huku,

254
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:26,275
his success can be expected.

255
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:28,880
You asked him

256
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,675
to pretend to kill me

257
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,840
and ordered Fang Haishi to seize him

258
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,100
because you knew

259
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:38,080
Fang Haishi would let him go.

260
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:42,880
You planned out every step

261
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,960
to cover for him.

262
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:47,250
But have you ever considered

263
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,325
Fang Haishi’s feelings?

264
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,300
Even I think

265
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,119
you’re too cruel

266
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,880
to him.

267
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:55,960
No wonder he refuses to come back.

268
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:00,880
Alright. Enough about business.

269
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,479
Come here.

270
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,320
Check this out.

271
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:04,080
What do you think?

272
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:05,840
Is this wedding gown still

273
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,239
not as good as Zheliu’s work?

274
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,599
Are you...?

275
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:14,625
I’m going to

276
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:17,050
make Consort Shurong my new empress.

277
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:21,760
Back then, she came all the way here

278
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:24,400
but I disliked her so much

279
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,320
that I didn’t even give her

280
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,200
a proper wedding.

281
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:29,840
It’s time to fix it.

282
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:32,119
You’re right.

283
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,280
What about you?

284
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,700
When are you going to move on

285
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,880
and start over?

286
00:15:44,925 --> 00:15:46,239
Once everything is settled,

287
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,080
I hope you can grant me a request.

288
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,550
What is it?

289
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,840
When the state is stable,

290
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:58,479
I wish to

291
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,200
stop being your Baixi.

292
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,440
Please allow me to resign

293
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,640
and go back to Liushang.

294
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,159
Finally!

295
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,440
You’ve come around after so long!

296
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:13,600
Like I said,

297
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,275
we shouldn’t

298
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:15,850
have been bounded by Baixi.

299
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,159
Jianming.

300
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,440
Jianming,

301
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,039
I’ve never

302
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:32,799
expected you

303
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,080
to be a loyal official.

304
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,400
All I want is for you to live a carefree

305
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,640
and happy life.

306
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,760
The bad days will finally be over.

307
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,599
Your Majesty,

308
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:46,599
this isn’t the end.

309
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,719
It’s

310
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,900
a new beginning.

311
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,479
Xu,

312
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:56,554
you’re right.

313
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,564
Someone has stolen my heart.

314
00:17:02,425 --> 00:17:03,559
I hope we can

315
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,760
sail off

316
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,359
and grow old together.

317
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,309
I can’t wait to know

318
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,929
who that girl is.

319
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,800
You’ve kept me in the dark long enough.

320
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,401
It’s time to let me know.

321
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,850
There are some issues left between us.

322
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,165
Once they’re resolved

323
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:21,146
and she agrees to be with me,

324
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:22,520
I’ll

325
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:23,700
introduce her to you.

326
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:27,880
What kind of girl

327
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,050
is she

328
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,319
that even you have to be so careful?

329
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:33,800
That makes sense, though.

330
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,959
She must be

331
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:37,575
someone unique and special

332
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,880
or you wouldn’t

333
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,280
have been so affectionate.

334
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,425
Jichang’s birthday is on the 18th.

335
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:46,385
I’ve agreed

336
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,640
to see his well-trained eagles

337
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,479
at Dongyu Horse Ranch.

338
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,599
You can

339
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,879
bring her there

340
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:54,345
if she wants.

341
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
I’d like to meet her.

342
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,400
Sure.

343
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:22,805
Are you sleepy, Your Highness?

344
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,830
Let me make your bed.

345
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,040
I don’t know why but I doze off easily

346
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,440
these days.

347
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,950
Usually, at this hour,

348
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,511
I’d be wide awake

349
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,674
and could read rolls of books.

350
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,170
You look fine, Your Highness,

351
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,191
and you haven’t had any relapse lately.

352
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:44,295
Do you feel unwell?

353
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:45,175
Should I call in

354
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:46,000
the physician?

355
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,050
No!

356
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,850
No physicians

357
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:52,494
or His Majesty will be disturbed again.

358
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:55,079
Right now, you’re

359
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,119
his most beloved one.

360
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,275
If we called in the physicians,

361
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:58,950
he’d rush over here first

362
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,800
before them.

363
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,119
Stop making fun of me.

364
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,955
Ginseng soup, Your Highness.

365
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:08,425
Finish it while it’s hot.

366
00:19:08,425 --> 00:19:09,025
Sure.

367
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,625
Who is it?

368
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,875
Didn’t see anyone.

369
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:28,636
He tossed this in and left.

370
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,040
Your Highness,

371
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,850
isn’t it...?

372
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,319
Suolan’s pendant.

373
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,079
Prince Suolan?

374
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,719
“Kill Emperor Xu

375
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,459
or the owner of the pendant will die.”

376
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,325
That’s... poison!

377
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,195
Who’s behind this?

378
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:11,839
Your Highness,

379
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,439
should we tell His Majesty?

380
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:15,479
We can’t!

381
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,875
Prince Suolan was wearing this pendant

382
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:17,900
all the time.

383
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,959
Most people couldn’t have

384
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:19,959
gotten hold of it.

385
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,079
Your Highness,

386
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,525
if anything happens to him...

387
00:20:23,575 --> 00:20:24,839
I mean, Prince Suolan

388
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,736
is your younger brother.

389
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:27,875
He’s the only prince of Zhunian

390
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,325

392

402
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:02,275

403

415
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:36,565
and the Right Tribe is winning.

416
00:21:36,825 --> 00:21:38,640
They’re too tied up with internal strife

417
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,039
to invade Huangquan Pass.

418
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,400

419
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,800

your disciple Fang Haishi

435
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,680
was sorry that he let Fang Zhuoying go.

436
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,300
He was too ashamed to come back

437
00:22:42,725 --> 00:22:43,950
and offered me

438
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,199
his resignation.

439
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,880
He’s giving himself up

440
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,239
too early.

441
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,280
And his tone

442
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,000
smacks of seclusion

443
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,975
as if he won’t come back again.

444
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,560
It’s like

445
00:22:59,025 --> 00:23:00,346
both of your arms

446
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,375
are cut off within a few days.

447
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,560
That’s not good.

Write to him

449
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,625

00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,760

00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:31,150
and gathering intelligence

582
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,239
and sending out messages

583
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:33,495
for Zhuoying every day.

584
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,119
So all this

585
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,839
was your plan.

586
00:29:38,575 --> 00:29:40,079
Have you met Zhuoying?

587
00:29:43,925 --> 00:29:47,199
He doesn’t know I’m still alive.

588
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,319
It’s probably better that way.

589
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:51,079
Nothing will hold him back

590
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:53,125
or be seen as his soft spot.

591
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,079
Lord Qinghai said

592
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,640
once Zhuoying

593
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,000
becomes strong enough,

594
00:30:03,325 --> 00:30:05,085
we’ll be able to reunite.

595
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:08,550
Right.

596
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,199
Miss Zheliu,

597
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,360
are you here

598
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,379
to gather information?

599
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:19,725
Mr. Fang Haishi,

600
00:30:19,725 --> 00:30:21,050
I’m here for you.

601
00:30:21,325 --> 00:30:22,965
Lord Qinghai has a message for you.

602
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:24,775
He asked me to find you.

603
00:30:26,275 --> 00:30:27,280
What message?

604
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,790
I’ve already told you.

605
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,959
You... You mean...

606
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,325
Yes.

607
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:37,675
Aunt Su and I are fine.

608
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,000
We’re staying in a secret shelter

609
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,079
at Huangquan Pass.

610
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,075
We’re safe.

611
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:43,839
Zhuoying and I
will be able to reunite someday.

612
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,040
Lord Qinghai

613
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,160
asked me to tell you

614
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,239
those words.

615
00:30:48,925 --> 00:30:51,045
He cares a lot about you.

616
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,880
Miss Zheliu,

617
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:06,000
it’s snowing.

618
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,560
The slushy road back to Huangquan pass

619
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
is dangerous.

620
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,439
You can stay and use my room

621
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,239
before the snow stops.

622
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:13,680
What about you?

623
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:15,439
I’m going back

624
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:16,560
to Tianqi.

625
00:31:29,075 --> 00:31:30,650
Mr. Fang, here’s your letter.

626
00:31:37,425 --> 00:31:39,475
(A Perfect Couple)

627
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,575
(A Perfect Couple)

628
00:31:46,575 --> 00:31:50,650
(Fang Jianming and Ye Haishi
live happily ever after.)

629
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:55,319
Who brought this here?

630
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,720
He... He’s waiting at the front hall.

631
00:31:58,225 --> 00:31:58,850
Hey...

632
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,450
Shaozi!

633
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:04,959
Young Master Haishi.

634
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,421
Do you have enough gold with you?

635
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:08,725
Gold?

636
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,719
Yes, I do.

637
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,800
Get yourself another horse.

638
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,320
I’m taking yours.

639
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,700
Mr. Fang...

640
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,600
It’s

641
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,425
going to be a long way.

(Moral and Virtuous)

667

Your Highness,

668
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,641
here’s ginseng soup for His Majesty.

669
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,219
Your Highness,

670
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,240
it’s your call.

671
00:34:28,575 --> 00:34:30,254
His Majesty cherishes you.

672
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,800
And you’re right here

673
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,879
in his palace.

674
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,040
If they find out about the poison,

675
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,681
they’ll kill us

676
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,120
and you.

677
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,719
Bizi,

678
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,250
it must be

679
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,225
someone powerful

680
00:34:41,225 --> 00:34:42,000
who could break in easily

681
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,425
to toss in the poison.

682
00:34:44,275 --> 00:34:45,719
He must be watching us somewhere

683
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,520
as we speak.

684
00:34:46,575 --> 00:34:47,800
If we didn’t do as he said

685
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,080
and put Prince Suolan in danger,

686
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,040
what about Zhunian?

687
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,159
But His Majesty is innocent!

688
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,199
Is Prince Suolan not?

689
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:52,719
Enough!

690
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:56,700
Bizi,

691
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,120
get rid of this.

692
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,319
Your Highness,

693
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,300
if this person could obtain

694
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,719
Prince Suolan’s personal pendant,

695
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,000
he must’ve planted

696
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,239
killers and spies around him.

697
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:06,900
Aren’t you worried

698
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,925
about his safety?

699
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:09,825
His Majesty is so nice to me!

700
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:11,326
I can’t harm him.

701
00:35:17,275 --> 00:35:18,674
Their goal is to kill His Majesty.

702
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:22,035
If they harmed Suolan

703
00:35:22,675 --> 00:35:24,316
because I didn’t poison His Majesty,

704
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,514
I’d no longer be their leverage.

705
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,104
By that logic,

706
00:35:28,725 --> 00:35:30,566
Suolan is safe.

707
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:34,375
When they show up again,

708
00:35:35,075 --> 00:35:36,350
I might be able to figure out

709
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,160
the mastermind

710
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:40,784
and plan the next step accordingly.

711
00:35:41,675 --> 00:35:42,850
Your Highness,

712
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,199
are you sure about this?

713
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,030
Bizi,

714
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:46,600
help me get changed.

715
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,141
Don’t keep His Majesty waiting.

716
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:50,239
Bihong,

717
00:35:50,725 --> 00:35:52,400
throw that thing away.

718
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,399
Yes.

719
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,320
My arrow

720
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,280
missed

721
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
Zhuoying’s heart.

722
00:37:22,225 --> 00:37:23,426
He always

723
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,555
put a small flask for liquor

724
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:28,166
on the left side.

725
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,719
How did you know

726
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,520
that my arrow would hit

727
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,600
the exact spot that you expected?

728
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,260
I just knew.

729
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,239
That was where Zhuoying and I

730
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,278
hoped for.

731
00:37:44,775 --> 00:37:45,654
That wound

732
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,900
did help him take root in Huku.

733
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:51,886
At the end of the day,

734
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,080
I was once again

735
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,350
kept out of the loop.

736
00:37:56,725 --> 00:37:58,166
Let me ask you something.

737
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,139
What if I hit somewhere else?

738
00:38:02,925 --> 00:38:04,080
All these years,

739
00:38:05,225 --> 00:38:06,866
you’ve never stopped practicing.

740
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,701
I knew you could do it.

741
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:10,224
I trust you.

742
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,560
Trust me?

743
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:16,360
I’m so sorry

744
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,840
for all your suffering.

745
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,931
You’re sorry?

746
00:38:26,225 --> 00:38:27,280
So are you

747
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,439
making it up to me

748
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,239
by giving me this

749
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,320
as a handout?

750
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:36,025
(Ye Haishi Date of Birth)

751
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:54,729
Don’t lose our marriage certificate.

752
00:38:56,075 --> 00:38:57,159
It’ll be enshrined

753
00:38:57,925 --> 00:38:59,325
in the ancestral temple someday.

754
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,040
When I

755
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,540
fell head over heels for you,

756
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:13,320
I saw you

757
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,360
as light and hope

758
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,160
that dispelled darkness in my world.

759
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:18,840
I never wished for

760
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
anything in return

761
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,959
because I knew

762
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,439
you were out of my reach.

763
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,314
I didn’t mean to burden you,

764
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:29,464
so I kept all those feelings to myself

765
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,840
without

766
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,120
any complaint.

767
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,840
But here you are,

768
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,610
offering me

769
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:44,360
what I want the most

770
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,439
as a handout.

771
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,635
Am I that cheap?

772
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,250
It’s not a handout.

773
00:39:50,675 --> 00:39:51,840
Then what is it?

774
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,950
You said

775
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:56,080
you only

776
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:58,439
regarded me as your disciple.

777
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,080
Let go of me!

778
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,719
Haishi!

779
00:40:05,975 --> 00:40:06,600
You...

780
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:08,825
You...

781
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:09,600
I’m marrying you.

782
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,239
Why?

783
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,400
- You don’t love me.
- I love you!

784
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,120
I really do.

785
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:18,479
I said

786
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,281
I’d never marry people I don’t love.

787
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:26,085
So,

788
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,025
let’s get married tonight.

789
00:40:39,225 --> 00:40:42,400
His Majesty has arrived.

790
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,360
Good evening, Your Majesty.

791
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,159
Skip that.

792
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,750
I was about to go to Jincheng Palace.

793
00:40:51,025 --> 00:40:52,399
The snow outside is heavy.

794
00:40:52,475 --> 00:40:53,876
You shouldn’t have come.

795
00:40:55,025 --> 00:40:56,425
I’m going to Dongyu Horse Ranch

796
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:58,365
for Jichang’s birthday tomorrow.

797
00:40:59,075 --> 00:41:00,555
I’ll miss you while I’m away

798
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,230
so I came to see you.

799
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,899
Why are your hands still so cold?

800
00:41:12,825 --> 00:41:13,865
You’re getting

801
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,960
worse and worse at your job.

802
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:18,325
Pass my order.

803
00:41:18,525 --> 00:41:19,925
Have Storehouse supply Yu’an Palace

804
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:21,000
with more anthracite,

805
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,879
plus

806
00:41:22,225 --> 00:41:23,600
windproof and warm clothing

807
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,320
and fur coats

808
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,360
as many as possible.

809
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

810
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,679
Go now.

811
00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:29,650
Yes.

812
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:32,954
That’s very sweet of you.

813
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,084
Are you cold?

814
00:41:38,525 --> 00:41:39,475
I’m not.

815
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,959
I made ginseng soup.

816
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,639
You came in snow.

817
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:50,639
Have some

818
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:51,679
to warm you up.

819
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:53,919
I can’t wait

820
00:41:54,675 --> 00:41:56,159
to try your cooking.

821
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,520
What are these?

822
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,250
New desserts I made,

823
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,560
called water chestnut cakes.

824
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,000
They’re a specialty of Zhunian.

825
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,521
I’ve never made them before.

826
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:20,639
I’ve never had any, either.

827
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,575
Mmm.

828
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:26,950
