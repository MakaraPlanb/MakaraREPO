Haishi...

28
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,160
Lord,

29
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,500
you're finally awake.

30
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,709
How's Haishi?

31
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:53,080
Consort Chunrong is fine.

32
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,320
His Majesty has escorted her

33
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,320
back to Fengwu Palace.

34
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,750
Two more groups of guards

35
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,800
are already there to protect her.

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,119
Don't worry.

37
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,440
Lord, you...

38
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,279
What about Nihualuo's Deputy Envoy?

39
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:06,479
He's dead.

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,559
Dead?

41
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:08,520
Yes.

42
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,185
I believe he was poisoned.

43
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,559
Someone

44
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
wants him dead.

45
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:15,775
Bring me my robe.

46
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:16,720
Lord Qinghai...

47
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,119
It's urgent!

48
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:20,119
Lord...

49
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,199
The rosewood box...

50
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,325
Give it to me.

51
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,479
Yes.

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,479
Lord Qinghai...

53
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:24,975
Go!

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,880
You're badly injured...

55
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:26,800
I need to get dressed.

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,320
Yes.

57
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,839
What brings you here

58
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:31,759
despite your fresh wound?

59
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,281
Nihualuo's Deputy Envoy is dead.

60
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:36,750
I know.

61
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,575
In Zhaoming Palace.

62
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:41,244
I said I know.

63
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,950
Is his death kept in a tight circle?

64
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:43,839
Yes,

65
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,080
but it won't be for too long.

66
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,880
Once it gets out,

67
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,199
Nihualuo will use it as a pretext

68
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:51,440
for war.

69
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,240
Agreed.

70
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:55,400
We must be prepared for a war.

71
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:57,679
Your Majesty,

72
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,075
Dazheng can't afford another war.

73
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,550
Please allow me to go to Yuezhou

74
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,869
to look for Lang Huan.

75
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,440
Jianming,

76
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,279
don't be naive.

77
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:18,920
You can't find her

78
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,000
without Fang Haishi.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,839
Besides,

80
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,040
the luminous pearl powder left

81
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:25,600
is far from enough for you

82
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,225
to take a round trip.

83
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:29,440
I've met

84
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,610
Lang Huan once in Yuezhou.

85
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:33,536
Maybe I'll get lucky again.

86
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,679
If I fail to come back,

87
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,000
here are the intelligence
I've collected over the years

88
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,160
to be used against tribes in Leizhou

89
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,440
and key points of the negotiation.

90
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,014
The success rate is only 30 percent

91
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:51,750
but you can send envoys

92
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,760
to smooth things over.

93
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,075
All I'm asking is
to keep Haishi out of it

94
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,225
and don't force her to do anything.

95
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,050
Is it worth it?

96
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,279
In order to protect her,

97
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,320
you'd rather risk

98
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,760
Dazheng, me

99
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,839
and your own life?

100
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,610
I taught her words of sages

101
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:21,505
to shape

102
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,000
her behavior

103
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:25,005
and mind.

104
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,680
But yesterday, she told me,

105
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,720
“With great power

106
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,590
comes with great responsibility.”

107
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:34,799
That's why

108
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,200
she decides to handle

109
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,321
all those tribes alone.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,440
Then I realize

111
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,940
I don't want her

112
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:46,566
to follow in my footsteps

113
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,359
or take my path.

114
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,000
She can't be

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,359
another Fang Jianming

116
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,829
because I know better than anyone

117
00:05:57,575 --> 00:05:59,575
how painful that is.

118
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,990
I don't regret living like this

119
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,871
but I hope the one I love

120
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:08,066
can lead a normal and happy life.

121
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:10,005
I have to be selfish

122
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,525
and look out for her.

123
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,880
What if

124
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,050
I insist on letting her go there?

125
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:25,036
I'll get her out of Dazheng

126
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,350
at all costs.

127
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:36,050
Fine.

128
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,651
You can go

129
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,239
if that's what you want.

130
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

131
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,279
Jianming,

132
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,119
as I've promised,

133
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,959
I'll give Fang Haishi

134
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:50,160
all that you should've deserved

135
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,275
with dignity and honor.

136
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,559
Just promise me

137
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,079
that you won't give up your life

138
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,720
no matter what

139
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,000
and you'll do your best to live

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,399
as long as you can.

141
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
Go back now.

142
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,799
Take Physician Li's medicine.

143
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,480
You're going to need enough energy

144
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,040
and rest before setting off.

145
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,275
Thank you, Your Majesty.

146
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,679
You can come out.

147
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,200
I always thought

148
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,570
I was the abandoned one.

149
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,775
Fang Jianming is such a fool.

150
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,720
He could abandon anything,

151
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:24,050
including his life,

152
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,475
but not you.

153
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,880
He's trying to protect you

154
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:32,425
by putting himself in harm's way

155
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:33,625
despite

156
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,400
your misunderstanding and hatred.

157
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,550
Now that you've known the truth,

158
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,559
what's your plan?

159
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:52,640
Can Dragon Tail

160
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,679
remove his poison?

161
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,119
I'm not sure

162
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,799
but it's worth a shot.

163
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,280
There's no other choice.

164
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:02,605
You know,

165
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,119
after the Rebellion of Prince Yi
over a decade ago,

166
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,925
the recent war in the north

167
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,359
at Huangquan Pass

168
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:12,159
and the drought in the southeast,

169
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,479
Dazheng is fragile and embattled.

170
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,960
If we get into the fight now,

171
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:19,075
the whole world

172
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,900
will turn into hell in a few months.

173
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,880
I...

174
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:24,775
cannot risk

175
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,000
60 million lives.

176
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,609
I share your concern.

177
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,975
Flames of war

178
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,320
and the bloodbath

179
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:34,080
will bury our people.

180
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:37,405
But envoys of those tribes

181
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:39,404
are heading to Dazheng as we speak.

182
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,200
We can't

183
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:44,401
always keep our door open

184
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:46,239
to the greedy.

185
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,840
Right now,

186
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,050
we need to

187
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,400
settle the dispute quickly

188
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,900
and send them back

189
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,039
without going to war.

190
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,960
Or more disasters

191
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:57,745
will befall Dazheng.

192
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,444
No wonder

193
00:10:03,825 --> 00:10:05,304
Jianming chose you.

194
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:08,814
Whether he likes it or not,

195
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,159
you're the same as him

196
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:14,000
who puts the people first.

197
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,919
I assure you, Your Majesty,

198
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,491
that I'll do my best

199
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,840
to bring Lang Huan back,

200
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:22,574
providing

201
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,280
you'll also do your best to protect her

202
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,150
from any harm.

203
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,440
Just go find her in Yuezhou.

204
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,150
I swear

205
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,159
on my throne

206
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,159
that no one

207
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,239
can lay a finger on Lang Huan

208
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,216
on my watch.

209
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:42,440
Time is pressing.

210
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,119
I'll go get ready

211
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,320
and set off

212
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,039
for Yuezhou tomorrow morning.

213
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,599
Transportation and guards are ready

214
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:51,925
to escort Lang Huan back.

215
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:53,919
With my written permission,

216
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,559
all the Secret Force and guards

217
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,119
are under your command.

218
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,239
Make sure

219
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:02,574
Lang Huan arrives safe and sound.

220
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,379
Yes.

221
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,340
Your Majesty,

222
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,440
whoever poisoned

223
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,599
and controlled the Deputy Envoy

224
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,039
is vicious.

225
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,450
He'll

226
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
act again

227
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:17,880
if he finds out I'm safe.

228
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,225
We can have a stand-in

229
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:22,760
mislead him into thinking

230
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,599
I'm at Fengwu Palace the whole time

231
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,491
while I leave to find Lang Huan.

232
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:27,825
No problem.

233
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,239
I'll see to that.

234
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,975
Thank you, Your Majesty.

235
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,000
Fang Haishi,

236
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,889
Physician Li's medicine

237
00:11:42,075 --> 00:11:43,280
will make Jianming sleep

238
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,960
for a few days.

239
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:46,559
Don't worry.

240
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:54,554
Thank you, Your Majesty.

241
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,950
Your Highness.

242
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,100
Lord is asleep

243
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,225
after taking his medicine.

244
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:23,825
That's fine.

245
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,850
I just want to see him.

246
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:26,800
Sure.

247
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:29,529
Please, Your Highness.

248
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,280
You said

249
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,919
you don't want me

250
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,550
to follow in your footsteps

251
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:48,425
or

252
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,450
take your path

253
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:54,159
because you know

254
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,275
how painful that is.

255
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,325
But I know that better than you

256
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:03,525
because I've been watching you.

257
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,150
Over the years,

258
00:14:07,975 --> 00:14:09,296
you've done so much

259
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:10,960
for the people,

260
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,411
for His Majesty

261
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,625
and for Dazheng.

262
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,761
But few people have

263
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,675
truly done anything for you.

264
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,370
This time,

265
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,100
let me do something for you.

266
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,525
It's my turn to protect you.

267
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,500
I won't let you die.

268
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,406
Stop saying

269
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,119
that I can still be happy

270
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:58,000
without you.

271
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,054
My happiness

272
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,200
lies in you.

273
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:33,375
(Tianqi City-Wan City-Jiuyuan)

274
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,050
How's everything?

275
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:46,919
Your Highness,

276
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,359
the death of Nihualuo's Deputy Envoy

277
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:50,359
is blowing up in the city.

278
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,760
Their mission

279
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,039
has sent a messenger back

280
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,560
and threatened dire consequences.

281
00:16:55,925 --> 00:16:57,440
They'll request permission

282
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,960
to resort to force.

283
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:00,916
I bet His Majesty

284
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,425
is in hot water.

285
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:04,685
Good.

286
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,766
What about Fang Haishi?

287
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:09,599
She's at Fengwu Palace

288
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,839
without going anywhere.

289
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,205
Security there has been tightened, too,

290
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,560
due to her injury, I guess.

291
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,040
She can no longer go to Yuezhou.

292
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,380
We and Nihualuo are on the brink of war.

293
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,200
If Fang Haishi fails to

294
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,680
bring Dragon Tail back in time...

295
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,975
In that case,

296
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:26,359
Nihualuo

297
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,079
and other tribes

298
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,839
will gang up on Dazheng.

299
00:17:30,075 --> 00:17:30,775
By the way,

300
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,119
anything from Huangquan Pass?

301
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:35,599
Tang Qianzi ordered Fu Yi

302
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,375
and Zhang Chengqian to come back

303
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,640
to Tianqi with 50,000 troops

304
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,164
upon receiving the edict.

305
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,719
Very well.

306
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,280
With Fu Yi's help,

307
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,000
all those troops will be mine.

308
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,611
Bizi will reprimand me again.

309
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:15,560
What?

310
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,839
The medicine Tilan is taking
for the baby is poisoned?

311
00:18:17,925 --> 00:18:19,199
Yes, Your Majesty.

312
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,520
One of the maids

313
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,239
splashed it onto the plants

314
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,199
by accident

315
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:26,225
and found them all dead.

316
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:29,350
Do we know what went wrong?

317
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,800
I've checked thoroughly.

318
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:34,680
The residue,

319
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,119
physicians, maids

320
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,560
and the delivery

321
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,479
are all clear.

322
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:40,525
Useless!

323
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:50,040
Whoever poisoned Tilan's medicine

324
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,300
must've known

325
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,359
she's pregnant.

326
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,026
Yu'an Palace is no longer safe.

327
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,650
Mu Deqing.

328
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,650
Yes, Your Majesty.

329
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,640
Take her

330
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,040
and Bizi to Jincheng Palace

331
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,680
in secret.

332
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,510
The rest of them

333
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,000
can't leave Yu'an Palace

334
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,650
for further investigation

335
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,290
until we find the poisoner.

336
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,425
Yes, Your Majesty.

337
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,625
How's Jianming?

338
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,830
Your Majesty,

339
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,479
he's been sleeping

340
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:20,400
over the past days

341
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,520
after taking my medicine.

342
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:23,934
His mind is at ease

343
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:25,119
which helps his body

344
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,199
get enough rest.

345
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:28,550
His pulse is getting stronger

346
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,711
than before.

347
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:30,880
Good.

348
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,950
The luminous pearl powder...

349
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:35,719
It's running out.

350
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:40,635
I see. You may leave.

351
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,075
Give us some space.

352
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:45,036
Yes, Your Majesty.

353
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,235
Jianming,

354
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,250
so many things have happened

355
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:09,560
during your sleep.

356
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,880
Nihualuo's navy

357
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,520
has reached the southwest

358
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,825
to attack us anytime.

359
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,025
Envoys

360
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,800
have also arrived in Tianqi

361
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,250
on the rising of chaos.

362
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,970
What's worse...

363
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,920
Someone in the palace is targeting Tilan

364
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:33,636
and our baby.

365
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,675
I thought

366
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,719
after we

367
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,300
crushed the Rebellion of Prince Yi,

368
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,319
leveled Red Plain,

369
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,850
killed Six Wing Generals

370
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:53,680
and did everything we could,

371
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,650
dangers was eliminated

372
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:59,300
and peace was restored,

373
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:02,295
but I was wrong.

374
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:04,575
Right now,

375
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,599
another disturbance is coming.

376
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,280
It's true

377
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:20,479
that as long as I sit on the throne,

378
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,925
dangers will never cease.

379
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,561
But don't worry.

380
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:29,975
I've

381
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,000
managed to

382
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,075
stabilize the situation for now.

383
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,280
Once you wake up

384
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,710
and find out Fang Haishi
has left to find Lang Huan,

385
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:47,225
you'll probably bite my head off again.

386
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:04,749
I'm moving in there tomorrow morning?

387
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,450
It can't wait?

388
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:07,850
Right.

389
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,350
You'll probably feel inconvenient.

390
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,250
Not at all.

391
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,400
It's actually sweet

392
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,050
that you're so thoughtful.

393
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,839
I once

394
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,075
read this poem when I was little.

395
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,040
It says,

396
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:28,350
“All good things don't last long.

397
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,900
Clouds disperse and tiles break.”

398
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,199
Tilan,

399
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,640
throughout my life,

400
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,925
all those good things

401
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,021
and people around me

402
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,625
seem to have left one by one.

403
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,951
I'll be

404
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,445
your cloud that never leaves

405
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:00,450
and tile that never breaks.

406
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,449
Is that a promise?

407
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,319
You can't break it,

408
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,640
you know.

409
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,025
I'll never do that.

In order to protect her,

00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,119
you'd rather risk

447
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,350
Dazheng, me and your own life?

448
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:50,425

00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,660
His Majesty has prepared

479
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:59,160
a log of ebony

480
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,560
which was in the sea for decades,

481
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,239
and had it covered with wood oil

482
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,079
and filled with seawater.

483
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,109
According to the Heluo,

484
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,760
that'll preserve the seawater

485
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,275
for three years.

486
00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:11,350
I understand

487
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:13,160
the risk you're taking

488
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,719
but I swear

489
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,674
I'll protect you with my life.

490
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,800
I'll be fine.

491
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,625
If I leave,

492
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,160
I may no longer be as free

493
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,479
as I am in the water,

494
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
but sometimes,

495
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:30,344
we have to make tough choices.

496
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,166
It's not like

497
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,869
we can run away from them.

498
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:37,719
If my presence

499
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,925
can prevent the war

500
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,431
and help you,

501
00:29:43,925 --> 00:29:45,364
then it's all worth it.

502
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,479
Suolan pays respects to you,
Your Majesty.

503
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,640
Rise.

504
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,079
Thank you, Your Majesty.

505
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:58,325
These are gifts I brought for you

506
00:29:58,325 --> 00:29:59,599
from Zhunian,

507
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,520
including the best sea cucumbers

508
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:03,800
and rare coral and jade ornaments.

509
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,520
I hope you'll enjoy them.

510
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,359
I didn't expect you'd come in person.

511
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,079
It's a pleasure, Prince Suolan.

512
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:30,075
My uncle Puyouma

513
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:31,359
violated your law

514
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,550
as our envoy

515
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,719
and caused you

516
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:34,839
a lot of trouble.

517
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,239
I'm here

518
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,680
to apologize

519
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,520
and show you our stance

520
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,479
on his case.

521
00:30:43,025 --> 00:30:43,850
Oh?

522
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,920
No one is above the law

523
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,975
either in Zhunian

524
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,875
or Dazheng.

525
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,359
Your Majesty,

526
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,959
we need the whole truth.

527
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:55,975
If my uncle is proven guilty,

528
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,479
he shall be punished accordingly.

529
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,375
Zhunian will have no objections.

530
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:02,774
Give him a chair.

531
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:03,640
Yes.

532
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:04,959
The chair.

533
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,239
Thank you, Your Majesty.

534
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,280
The audience with Dragon Tail

535
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,650
is still a few days away.

536
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,750
You traveled thousands of miles

537
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,200
and arrived in Tianqi yesterday

538
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:25,400
as Zhunian's special envoy.

539
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,439
Why aren't you resting

540
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:29,025
but coming in so soon?

541
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:32,119
It's kind of personal.

542
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,040
Tribes in Leizhou

543
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,479
worship Dragon Tail

544
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:37,119
and I'm here

545
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,760
to pay respects to her, of course.

546
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,800
But

547
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,599
I also miss my sister

548
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,079
and I haven't seen her

549
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,520
since she was married to you.

550
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,280
I wonder

551
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,719
if she's all well.

552
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,520
She's fine.

553
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,300
May I see her?

554
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:59,125
You've never been here before.

555
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,680
I'll have an official

556
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,160
tour you around the city.

557
00:32:03,275 --> 00:32:05,375
Once everything is settled,

558
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,170
you and your sister can meet.

559
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

560
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:13,560
I'm looking forward to that day.

561
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,160
Please.

562
00:32:35,975 --> 00:32:37,280
You're big with child.

563
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
Let someone else do it next time.

564
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:42,200
I want to take care of you

565
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,440
myself.

566
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,680
What's on your mind?

567
00:32:52,575 --> 00:32:53,815
The assassination

568
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,520
of Bonen Naji

569
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,160
and the Deputy Envoy's death

570
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,680
by poisoning.

571
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,319
They're highly sensitive

572
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,199
and must be handled swiftly.

573
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,640
Our baby

574
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:12,844
is growing fast.

575
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:15,760
Hey,

576
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,439
your younger brother Suolan

577
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,439
has arrived

578
00:33:22,525 --> 00:33:23,565
as Zhunian's special envoy.

579
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,050
I know.

580
00:33:26,825 --> 00:33:28,359
You've been away from home for so long.

581
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,225
You must be homesick.

582
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,119
Do you want to see him?

583
00:33:37,275 --> 00:33:39,525
You don't? Really?

584
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,950
I'm not sure

585
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,640
if I should.

586
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:46,975
Why?

587
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,599
Children in the imperial family

588
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,199
are different

589
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,525
from others.

590
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,475
Suolan and I

591
00:33:57,475 --> 00:33:59,359
were born in the palace of Zhunian.

592
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,959
We were close at first

593
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:03,839
but distance grew with time.

594
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,119
As the sole heir

595
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,479
to Zhunian,

596
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,879
he's under the heavy burden.

597
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:14,686
Father sets different standards for us.

598
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,360
His is extremely high.

599
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,609
I want to

600
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,040
see him

601
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,080
and have a private talk

602
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:26,604
between a sister and a brother,

603
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,500
but given our current status,

604
00:34:29,075 --> 00:34:30,375
we represent more than

605
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:31,825
just ourselves.

606
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,199
I don't know if he's here as my brother

607
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,679
or Zhunian's envoy.

608
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,000
I'd rather not see him

609
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,560
to not

610
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,560
get disappointed.

611
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,840
I've also recalled things in the past.

612
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,650
Jichang was sent to Zhunian

613
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,840
when he was a child.

614
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,159
A little boy like him wouldn't know

615
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:03,175
why he had to leave home for his state.

616
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,225
If he and I,

617
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,479
you and Suolan

618
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,959
had been civilians,

619
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,479
we wouldn't have suffered so much

620
00:35:15,525 --> 00:35:18,950
or had to endure separation.

621
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,919
All that will be over.

622
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,150
Yes.

623
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,175
I guess.

624
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:51,719
Who are you?

625
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,280
We're here to take Mrs. Ye

626
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,000
to Tianqi to reunite with Madam Pearl

627
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,639
at His Majesty's order.

628
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,070
Lead the way.

629
00:36:06,675 --> 00:36:07,250
Yes.

630
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,120
This way, please.

631
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:08,975
Thanks.

632
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:11,879
Mrs. Ye.

633
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:15,280
Who are they?

634
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:16,639
Why are these two officers

635
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,000
asking to see me?

636
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,760
Mrs. Ye,

637
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,500
they're sent by His Majesty

638
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,320
to find you.

639
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,190
His Majesty's edict for Mrs. Ye.

640
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:28,350
Madam Pearl, Fang Haishi,

641
00:36:28,558 --> 00:36:29,919
lifted Xiping Port out of the disaster

642
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:31,120
and gained wide respect from the public.

643
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,560
Knowing that

644
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,925
she misses her mother,

645
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:34,879
officers are sent

646
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:36,919
to take Mrs. Ye to Tianqi

647
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,175
so that

648
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:39,700
they can reunite.

649
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,639
Thank you, Your Majesty.

650
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,166
Here you are, Mrs. Ye.

651
00:36:47,025 --> 00:36:48,585
Please rise.

652
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,000
Madam Pearl has
distinguished herself many times.

653
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,280
His Majesty trusts her a lot.

654
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,719
Mrs. Ye, please leave with us

655
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,679
right now.

656
00:36:57,439 --> 00:36:59,159
I need time to pack up.

657
00:36:59,159 --> 00:36:59,879
Can I

658
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,025
go with you tomorrow?

659
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,239
Don't worry.

660
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:05,560
There's everything you need in Tianqi.

661
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:07,080
You can buy whatever you want later.

662
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,080
Madam Pearl can't wait to see you.

663
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:11,719
Just bring what you need on the way

664
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,280
and go with us.

665
00:37:17,725 --> 00:37:18,375
Sure.

666
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:18,950
Alright.

667
00:37:37,325 --> 00:37:38,159
Master!

668
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,800
Do you remember

669
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,679
what you said to me

670
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,760
when we first met?

671
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:49,479
You said

672
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,120
if I chose to be a girl by your side,

673
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,239
I'd have nothing but an easy life.

674
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,100
But as a boy,

675
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,760
I'd have everything
except for an easy life.

676
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,360
Then you asked me to choose.

677
00:37:58,925 --> 00:37:59,560
I remember that.

678
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,650
But that was the last time

679
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,520
you let me

680
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,639
make a choice.

681
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,080
Why can't I make my own choice anymore?

682
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,125
If you could choose,

683
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,150
what would you want to do?

684
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:11,875
I want to be your Baixi

685
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,919
to bear all your pain.

686
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,299
Haishi!

687
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,360
Master,

688
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:31,225
I'm willing to die for you

689
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,775
with no regrets.

690
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,439
Haishi!

691
00:38:38,075 --> 00:38:38,835
Lord!

692
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:41,959
Physician Li said you'd soon wake up.

693
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:42,758
He was right.

694
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,650
What time is it?

695
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,439
It's noon.

696
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,125
Noon?

697
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:48,750
Yes.

698
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,025
You've slept for days

699
00:38:50,025 --> 00:38:50,925
because of

700
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,811
Physician Li's medicine.

701
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,120
Where's Haishi?

702
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,520
Consort Chunrong has left
to find Dragon Tail.

703
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:00,840
Lord!

704
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,600
Calm down, Lord.

705
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,439
Lord,

706
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:04,000
she's found Dragon Tail.

707
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,875
Shaozi is going to escort them back.

708
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:06,840
Speaking of him,

709
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,475
he left in haste

710
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,479
and asked me

711
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:10,399
to give this to you

712
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:11,525
once you wake up.

713
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,320
Speed up.

714
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,840
Go back to Tianqi as soon as possible.

715
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,500
Yes.

716
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,120
Lord Qinghai...

717
00:40:00,725 --> 00:40:01,399
Your Majesty.

718
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,540
Are you here to bite my head off?

719
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:17,350
Why did you send Haishi

720
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,471
to find Lang Huan?

721
00:40:26,775 --> 00:40:27,439
You promised me...

722
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:29,399
I promised that I wouldn't force her.

723
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:30,775
And I didn't.

724
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:31,560
She volunteered to go there.

725
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,650
No way!

726
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,040
Did you do anything

727
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,959
that made her go?

728
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,479
Like what?

729
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:38,975
Didn't you send men to get her mother?

730
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:41,120
What?

731
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:44,900
Oh, no!

732
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,120
It wasn't you.

733
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,125
I did what?

734
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:49,550
Fang Jianming! What is it?
