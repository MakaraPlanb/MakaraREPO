Haishi.

26
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,200
Zhuoying.

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,600
What happened to your wrist?

28
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,400
I’m fine.

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,750
Don’t make a fuss.

30
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:39,880
You...

31
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,520
Look at you!

32
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,160
You’re pale!

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,800
How could you be fine?

34
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,080
Consort Shurong was collapsing
last night

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,520
and needed blood as medication,

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,680
so I cut my wrist.

37
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,840
What were you thinking?

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
You’ve barely recovered from the wound

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,840
you got in Lanzi,

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,950
and now, you cut yourself

41
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,000
for someone else.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,280
You can’t wait to die or what?

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,640
I did what I had to

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
under that circumstance,

45
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,400
or she could’ve died.

46
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,400
Besides,

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,680
His Majesty was there, too.

48
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,560
Can we talk some other time?

49
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,760
I’m tired.

50
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:08,850
You...

51
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,840
Lord,

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,640
Princess’s Mansion

53
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,000
is all set.

54
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,650
Princess said nothing,

55
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,800
but she seemed

56
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,240
satisfied with the preparation.

57
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,000
Has any court member visited her yet?

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,960
Not that I know of.

59
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,080
Right now, she’s rising.

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,800
They don’t want to be called

61
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,000
a toady.

62
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,760
Only Lord Chang

63
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,320
and a few officials

64
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,240
have paid her a visit.

65
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,960
Reputation isn’t their concern.

66
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,520
They’re just trying to

67
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,920
read His Majesty’s mind.

68
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,600
Give them a few days.

69
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,120
They’ll throw themselves at her door.

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,600
I guess so.

71
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,760
Oh, and Lord,

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,920
I have good news, too.

73
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,080
What is it?

74
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,640
Consort Shurong was sick last night

75
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,080
which was no secret in the Palace.

76
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
I heard it was Young Master Haishi

77
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,680
who saved her life.

78
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,960
His Majesty

79
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,200
was impressed

80
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,400
by him overnight.

81
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,160
What’s your point?

82
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,000
Lord,

83
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,800
he seems a bit down lately.

84
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,240
It’s true that he shouldn’t have

85
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,840
asked His Majesty for that transfer

86
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,360
behind your back,

87
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,920
but he meant

88
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,280
to help you.

89
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,480
Enough.

90
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,320
Lord.

91
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,440
Are those herbs for Haishi?

92
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:01,040
Yes.

93
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,680
The physician from the Imperial Hospital

94
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,640
came and said he’s weak,

95
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
so he prescribed herbs

96
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,880
to enrich Young Master Haishi’s
blood and energy.

97
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,240
I’ll watch the pot.

98
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,480
You may leave.

99
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,960
No, I can’t, Lord.

100
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,880
Such trifles

101
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,800
aren’t worth your time.

102
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,200
If others find out about this,

103
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,600
I’ll be dead!

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,400
Go ahead. Don’t worry.

105
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,720
Yes.

106
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,000
Your Highness,

107
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,160
here’s your medicine.

108
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Take it now.

109
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,440
Maybe later.

110
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,600
You’re still weak

111
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,720
and need more rest.

112
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,920
Let me read a few more pages.

113
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
How many more

114
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,480
exactly?

115
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,320
No need.

116
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,080
What book

117
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:05,680
makes you give up resting?

118
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,680
Just some light reading.
Ten Notes about Yuanjiang.

119
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,400
All about travels.

120
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,120
Relax.

121
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,760
I dare not.

122
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,400
I...

123
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,800
I’ll never treat you

124
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,440
like before.

125
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,280
If you have time,

126
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,075
take a walk to Shuangping Lake.

127
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,160
I’ve prepared something for you there.

128
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,480
Are they...?

129
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,040
Xieluo Flowers.

130
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,080
How come

131
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,960
there are so many of them here?

132
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,480
Legend has it

133
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,160
that drink one cup

134
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,120
of Three Flower Spirits
with dried Xieluo Flowers

135
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,960
and you’ll have a dream in your sleep.

136
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,480
In that dream,

137
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,280
you’ll be able to

138
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,120
revisit your fleeting happiness

139
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,920
or even

140
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,480
see someone

141
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,880
you’ve lost forever again.

142
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,775
Is it really that magical?

143
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,520
I doubt it.

144
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,600
It’s more like

145
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,159
a wishful thinking.

146
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,440
I’m aware of Xieluo Flowers.

147
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,320
Water lamps we float

148
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,120
are folded

149
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,400
into that shape.

150
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:49,285
Aren’t they only found in Zhunian?

151
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,300
Xieluo Flowers are too rare

152
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,510
to be seen there.

153
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,680
I’m surprised

154
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,480
there are so many of them right here.

155
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:01,175
Tianqi

156
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,240
is indeed a vast land

157
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,600
rich in resources.

158
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,560
Even so,

159
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,000
it wouldn’t be easy

160
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,160
to fill a lake with these flowers.

161
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,200
Is His Majesty...?

162
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:14,720
It’s probably his way to apologize.

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,160
He can’t

164
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,230
say everything out loud.

165
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:30,400
It’s very generous of His Majesty

166
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:31,880
to gather tons of Xieluo Flowers

167
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,560
so quickly.

168
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,880
They’re beautiful.

169
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,480
I’ve never seen them before.

170
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,160
They’re just flowers.

171
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,280
Are they any different

172
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,120
from lotuses?

173
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
They look the same to me.

174
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,560
I feel bad for Zheliu

175
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,330
to be stuck with a bonehead like you.

176
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,320
Excuse me?

177
00:09:50,475 --> 00:09:52,280
You’re a bonehead.

178
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
Bonehead!

179
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,160
Hey!

180
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:55,760
How dare you!

181
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,760
You...

182
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,440
Haishi...

183
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Your Highness.

184
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:01,000
Your Highness.

185
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:19,440
I have a question.

186
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,920
You know,

187
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,320
Princess Yanling

188
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,520
has gone missing for years.

189
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,040
Once His Majesty finds her,

190
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,950
she’ll be given

191
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,120
one of the highest ranks.

192
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,480
Would anyone

193
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,240
be tempted enough to impersonate her?

194
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,080
Even if someone

195
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,000
dared to make such a move,

196
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,440
she’d never pass the scrutiny.

197
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,360
The Ministry of Rites

198
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,600
couldn’t afford to mistake a stranger

199
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
as a member of the imperial family.

200
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:45,120
A full background check

201
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,080
and verification has been done.

202
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,925
On top of that,

203
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,360
Princess Yanling,

204
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,520
His Majesty

205
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,840
and Lord Chang

206
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,240
grew up together.

207
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,080
They couldn’t have made a mistake.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,320
You have a point.

209
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,120
But something about her

210
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,640
just doesn’t seem right.

211
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,360
I learned that

212
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,880
peonies are her favorite all along.

213
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,200
She brought them with her

214
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,520
when she met His Majesty.

215
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,360
That’s why

216
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,200
Lord Chang recognized her right away.

217
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,680
If she does like peonies,

218
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,640
why does she

219
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,280
smell like lotus?

220
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:22,360
Does she?

221
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,720
Yes.

222
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,680
It’s definitely not peony.

223
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,560
How dare you

224
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
talk about

225
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,160
what a princess smells like in public?

226
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,960
That could get you killed!

227
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,360
Let’s go.

228
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,200
Come on.

229
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,920
I apologize

230
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,480
for my abrupt visit.

231
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,640
I should’ve sent you a message first.

232
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,600
Don’t worry about it.

233
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,280
I hardly have any visitors.

234
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,200
You seemed unwell

235
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
during the banquet at Zichen Hall

236
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,000
and then they said you were sick.

237
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,400
A newcomer like you

238
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,880
did need more time

239
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,820
to be acclimatized.

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,600
I had the same issue

241
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,050
about the climate there

242
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,080
when I was stranded in Nihualuo.

243
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,880
I was in poor shape most of the time

244
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,400
before I started to

245
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,880
make and wear my own perfume

246
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,760
by accident.

247
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,320
It helped me feel better.

248
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,240
I handpicked

249
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,160
this sachet.

250
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,440
It might be

251
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,480
useful to you.

252
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,760
You can wear it

253
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,120
and give it a try.

254
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,480
It’s better than nothing.

255
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,680
That’s very kind of you.

256
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:37,680
No problem.

257
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,520
It’s just a little something.

258
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,720
Nothing expensive.

259
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,680
I’ve been away

260
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,000
for too long

261
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
to remember all those rules here.

262
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,520
I hope you can

263
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,480
help me with that.

264
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:50,600
That’d be my honor.

265
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,440
If there’s anything you need,

266
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,920
I’ll see what I can do.

267
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:58,120
Please have some tea, Your Highness.

268
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:09,400
Um.

269
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:11,600
It’s the best Longjing Tea.

270
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:13,720
It is.

271
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,280
It’s this year’s new tea.

272
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:18,920
I could still remember the old taste.

273
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,360
After all these years,

274
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,600
this tea

275
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,575
no longer

276
00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:24,840
tastes the same.

277
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,520
The other thing different

278
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,960
is Zhaoming Palace

279
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,280
which used to

280
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,800
belong to my third brother Shuyun.

281
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,000
Back in the day,

282
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,720
I was there with him a lot.

283
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,360
Now, it’s given to Jifeng Pavilion.

284
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,640
What a change!

285
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,040
Lord Qinghai isn’t family after all.

286
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:55,520
Do you

287
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,360
find him here

288
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,520
uncomfortable?

289
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,760
The Palace

290
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,760
is under His Majesty’s control.

291
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,120
Yu’an Palace and Jifeng Pavilion

292
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,760
have never crossed paths,

293
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,840
so

294
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,600
I don’t know much about him.

295
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,680
Thank you for your time

296
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,720
and tea.

297
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,320
I should take my leave.

298
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,320
Take care.

299
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,850
If you’re craving

300
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,160
food, drinks,

301
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,300
tea, desserts

302
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,480
or knickknacks from the outside,

303
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,240
just let me know.

304
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:34,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

305
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,320
All those years in Nihualuo

306
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,320
didn’t seem to

307
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,600
chip away her pride at all.

308
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,825
This so-called visit

309
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:08,160
was her excuse to fish

310
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,040
for inside information from us.

311
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,760
Perhaps

312
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,960
after all that

313
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,800
she suffered outside,

314
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,480
she just wants to be more cautious.

315
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,170
Now that she’s a princess

316
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,840
approved by His Majesty,

317
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,250
you need to show her respect.

318
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:28,680
Yes.

319
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,880
Other things

320
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:33,165
aren’t our concern.

321
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,640
This sachet

322
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,320
does smell pleasant.

323
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:49,640
Bizi,

324
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,120
put it away.

325
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:52,040
Yes.

326
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,440
Lord,

327
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,760
news from Hanbei says

328
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Su Ming has been promoted

329
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,760
to Lord of Left Pudun’s advisor

330
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,320
and helped him

331
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,200
wipe out a few small tribes.

332
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,000
He’s too busy

333
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,000
pleasing Duoluo

334
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,500
to turn to the south

335
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,540
to attack Huangquan Battalion.

336
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,400
Still, we can’t lower the guard.

337
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,300
Understood.

338
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,040
Master.

339
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,200
There you are.

340
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,280
Master,

341
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,400
something is bothering me.

342
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,800
After consideration,

343
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,280
I think you should know

344
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
just in case.

345
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,160
Go ahead.

346
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,360
I ran into Princess Yanling

347
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,200
when I was on duty earlier today.

348
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:45,240
She was wearing

349
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,760
lotus perfume

350
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,040
instead of peony.

351
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:53,525
What’s your point?

352
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,560
My gut tells me

353
00:16:55,925 --> 00:16:57,300
something about her

354
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,720
doesn’t add up.

355
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,280
We should go to Nihualuo

356
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,200
to look into her

357
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,850
- in case...
- Princess Yanling

358
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,839
is acknowledged by His Majesty

359
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,119
as the late emperor’s daughter

360
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,400
and Lord Chang’s elder sister.

361
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,040
To look into her

362
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,960
is to question

363
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,560
His Majesty’s judgment.

364
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:17,000
I wouldn’t dare.

365
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,400
I heard you used your blood

366
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,680
to help save Consort Shurong’s life.

367
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,280
How are you holding up?

368
00:17:28,325 --> 00:17:29,725
Thanks for asking.

369
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,840
I’m much better.

370
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,380
You’ve been working all day.

371
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,480
Shaozi,

372
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,880
take him back to rest.

373
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,400
Yes.

374
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,120
Please, Young Master Haishi.

375
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,240
Your Majesty.

376
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,500
(Zichen Hall)
Mrs. Guchen accused Lord Qinghai

377
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,680
(Zichen Hall)
of malice,

378
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,920
disloyalty,

379
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,160
getting rid of dissidents,

380
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,960
murdering trusted officials,

381
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,000
namely former Six Wing Generals, Amolan,

382
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,480
Gu Dacheng and the other two.

383
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,120
It’s spiraling out of control

384
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,400
and provoking a storm of protest.

385
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,675
The public

386
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,480
held him accountable for treason

387
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,800
and suggested he worth
the execution of his entire clan.

388
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,160
I understand Lord Qinghai is powerful

389
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,080
in court and the military,

390
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,080
but this case is huge.

391
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,920
Therefore...

392
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,560
Censor Duan,

393
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,625
are a series of reports

394
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,960
you’ve handed in not enough,

395
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:24,320
so now,

396
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,960
you’re trying to talk my ear off?

397
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,600
I’m responsible for supervision.

398
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,800
It’s my duty to battle against

399
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,200
all officials’ misconduct.

400
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,280
I must speak out

401
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,360
even at the risk

402
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,400
of my own life.

403
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,640
Grand Justice is already on this case.

404
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,160
Associate Justice Zong,

405
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:42,160
where are we?

406
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,530
Your Majesty,

407
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,200
given its complicated nature

408
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,350
and the fact that Amolan, Gu Dacheng

409
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,280
and other Six Wing Generals

410
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,840
all died years ago

411
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:56,800
and Mrs. Guchen and her grandson
also died in the street,

412
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,320
it’s hard to find evidence

413
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,760
and the investigation also takes time.

414
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,480
So no evidence.

415
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,880
Censor Duan,

416
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,840
you should know

417
00:19:08,175 --> 00:19:09,735
incriminating a pillar of the state

418
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,560
is also worth the execution
of your entire clan.

419
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
I wouldn’t dare, Your Majesty.

420
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:13,840
I’m not saying

421
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,880
Lord Qinghai is guilty.

422
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
But

423
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,160
he should be suspended from court duties

424
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,440
when the investigation is ongoing.

425
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,000
I implore Your Majesty

426
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,440
to remove him from his post
for the time being

427
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,840
to avoid any conflict of interest.

428
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,700
That way,

429
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,200
the public will be reassured

430
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,360
and the court will be restored.

431
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,840
- We second that.
- We second that.

432
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,200
Your Majesty,

433
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,760
I can vouch for Lord Qinghai...

434
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,440
Your Majesty,

435
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,800
Censor Duan isn’t wrong.

436
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,690
I was inconsiderate.

437
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,640
I’ll leave office

438
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,405
and cooperate with the investigation.

439
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,560
I’m sure

440
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Associate Justice Zong

441
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,120
will do justice to me.

442
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,560
I’ll do my best.

443
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,960
Ridiculous!

444
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,440
They’re using the public as an excuse

445
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,475
to grab your military power!

446
00:20:06,475 --> 00:20:07,200
I know.

447
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:08,520
You know.

448
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:12,840
And you’re still

449
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,880
playing right into their hands?

450
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,440
They’re boiling with rage.

451
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,080
If I didn’t step down,

452
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,680
they’d continue fanning the flame.

453
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,120
And if you took my side,

454
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,840
that’d tarnish your image.

455
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,975
What image?

456
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,450
In their eyes,

457
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,600
I’m nothing

458
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,880
but an ungrateful lunatic!

459
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,040
I have nothing to lose.

460
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:32,715
You’re one of the greatest emperors.

461
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,840
Be patient.

462
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,880
What’s done is done.

463
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,560
Now that you don’t have to work,

464
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,800
come and play chess with me then.

465
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,325
Yes.

466
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:53,400
Good day, Your Majesty.

467
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,120
Lord Qinghai.

468
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,160
Your Majesty,

469
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,800
Princess Yanling asks to see you.

470
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,160
Let her go.

471
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:08,880
Yes.

472
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,400
Have the Xieluo Flowers
in Shuangping Lake

473
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,000
bloomed yet?

474
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,475
Yes, Your Majesty, they have.

475
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,960
They’re in full bloom

476
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,160
and will last for a while.

477
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,960
Good.

478
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,800
Your Highness,

479
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,800
you’ve just come back.

480
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,720
Is His Majesty’s schedule so tight

481
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,560
that he can’t squeeze you in?

482
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,760
That’s fine.

483
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,760
I can visit him some other day.

484
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,960
I’d love to be in the Palace

485
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,200
after being away for so long.

486
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:46,680
Are... are those Xieluo Flowers?

487
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,110
- We don’t know.
- We don’t know.

488
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,840
They’re seldom seen

489
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,360
in the capital.

490
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:00,680
Don’t tell

491
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,600
Haishi and Zhuoying about my suspension.

492
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,360
Yes.

493
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,525
But,

494
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,000
it’s big news.

495
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,480
They’ll find out sooner or later.

496
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,840
Just do your best.

497
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,080
Yes.

498
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,000
His Majesty went to great lengths

499
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,840
to have those Xieluo Flowers
delivered from the south.

500
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,320
But now, he’s staying indoors all day

501
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,360
without seeing anyone.

502
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,320
It’s a shame that he misses the blooms.

503
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,080
Perhaps he isn’t in the mood

504
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,295
for them.

505
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,550
Hey,

506
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,600
go that way!

507
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,760
Flowers there are blooming.

508
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Princess Yanling.

509
00:22:34,075 --> 00:22:34,840
Mr. Fang.

510
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,280
Fang Zhuoying!

511
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:37,745
Be careful, Your Highness.

512
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,000
Princess Yanling is here.

513
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,720
Don’t rock the boat,

514
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,840
or you might fall.

515
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,040
You know,

516
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,920
Xieluo Flowers are most fragile.

517
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,840
The leaves need more water

518
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,160
to support the flowers.

519
00:22:53,775 --> 00:22:54,325
Hey,

520
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,040
don’t get wet. I’ll go.

521
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,280
Master.

522
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,080
Thank you for your help, sir.

523
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,325
- I apologize, Your Highness,
- I apologize, Your Highness,

524
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:37,360
- for the delay.
- for the delay.

525
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,280
Who’s on duty here?

526
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,680
I am.

527
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:43,480
If I hadn’t come,

528
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,640
how would you have reacted?

529
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,200
Save lives first.

530
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,200
You’re too slow to save anyone.

531
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,760
Master,

532
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,440
it’s not

533
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,320
all Zhuoying’s fault.

534
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,640
I failed to train him well

535
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,120
as his commanding officer.

536
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,240
Please punish me.

537
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:01,600
I’m the one to blame.

538
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,400
I insisted on

539
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,600
taking the boat to pick Xieluo Flowers.

540
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,640
Please don’t blame others.

541
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,560
Escort Her Highness back.

542
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,520
Master,

543
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,760
Her Highness’s safety matters the most.

544
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,520
Could you give Zhuoying a chance

545
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,600
to right his wrong

546
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,040
by joining me as escorts?

547
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,680
Fine.

548
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:21,125
Hey,

549
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,080
wait.

550
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,200
You saved my life

551
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,000
but I still don’t know who you are.

552
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,600
I’m Fang Jianming, Your Highness.

553
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,600
I did the least I should do.

554
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,280
You’re Jianming?

555
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,640
I can’t believe you’ve grown so big

556
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,800
from that little boy

557
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,840
who studied with my brother.

558
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,080
I failed to

559
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,680
recognize you.

560
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:41,150
Good day.

561
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:54,320
Gentlemen,

562
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,520
I heard you two

563
00:24:56,525 --> 00:24:57,885
call Lord Qinghai “Master”.

564
00:24:58,175 --> 00:25:00,255
I’m guessing you’re his disciples,

565
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,160
General Fang Haishi

566
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,080
and Commander Fang Zhuoying.

567
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,000
Yes, Your Highness.

568
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:10,040
Your Highness is as intelligent

569
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,040
as they say.

570
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,360
I’m surprised

571
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,600
at how well

572
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,880
you know about Dazheng

573
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,840
right after you came back

574
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,040
from years of exile.

575
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,320
When I was little,

576
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,760
I hung out with Jianming a lot.

577
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,080
More importantly,

578
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,600
however long I was away,

579
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,840
Dazheng is always my home.

580
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,680
People miss their hometowns.

581
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,280
They try to gather as much information

582
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,550
as they can

583
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,840
about them.

584
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,880
I’ve heard a lot about you two.

585
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,120
Your reputation

586
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,520
is well-deserved.

587
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,280
That’s very nice of you to say.

588
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,720
We serve at the pleasure.

589
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,520
Your Highness,

590
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,925
did you pick these flowers

591
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,400
because you like lotuses?

592
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,040
Xieluo belongs to that family

593
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,640
but it’s often known as

594
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,680
Quiet Bloom

595
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,520
as it can only be found in valleys

596
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,520
where it’s used to

597
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,880
negligence and loneliness.

598
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,760
It’s beautiful on its own

599
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,120
with a lingering and pleasant scent.

600
00:26:09,475 --> 00:26:10,600
We know too little

601
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,840
to tell

602
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,520
Xieluo from lotus.

603
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,920
I hope you don’t mind.

604
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,040
Lotus’s leaves are fluffy,

605
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,000
not notched

606
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,200
and growing out of the surface.

607
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,080
While Xieluo’s are smooth,

608
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,080
notched

609
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,960
and floating on the surface.

610
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,840
The two flowers look differently

611
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,400
but smell the same.

612
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,840
It’s easy to confuse them.

613
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,280
You know so much about lotus.

614
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,120
It must be your favorite flower.

615
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,080
As pretty as it is,

616
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,265
it’s outshone by peony.

617
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,960
If I’m to make perfume,

618
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,320
peony will still be

619
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,480
my first pick.

620
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,400
So you like peony

621
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,440
the most.

622
00:26:54,275 --> 00:26:55,960
You’re sharp, Mr. Fang.

623
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,080
No wonder Lord Qinghai

624
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,200
trusts you so much.

625
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,600
I’m flattered, Your Highness.

626
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:15,440
There’s a saying in the capital,

627
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,840
“Fang and Zhou top the list”.

628
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,375
Are you aware of that,

629
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,480
Mr. Fang Haishi?

630
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,760
Not really.

631
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,600
Basically, it means

632
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,400
other than

633
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,600
Marquis Wuxiang’s 14th son,

634
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,240
you two are second to none

635
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,480
among young men in the city.

636
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

637
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:38,560
By the way,

638
00:27:38,975 --> 00:27:40,280
what does

639
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,000
Lord Qinghai like?

640
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,960
I’d like to thank him in person

641
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,560
with gifts for his help.

642
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,725
That’s too kind of you.

643
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,000
But Jifeng Pavilion

644
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,280
is highly stratified.

645
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,440
We never

646
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,320
pry into Master’s personal life.

647
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,000
Sorry,

648
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,600
we can’t tell you anything.

649
00:28:00,575 --> 00:28:01,440
That’s fine.

650
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,200
Master.

651
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,520
Come in.

652
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,160
These flowers are for you.

653
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,175
All of them

654
00:28:27,175 --> 00:28:28,720
were hank-picked.

655
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,240
The buds

656
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,840
are strong enough to bloom.

657
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,200
I appreciate it.

658
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,720
They were picked at the right time.

659
00:28:41,075 --> 00:28:42,400
There’s a big chance

660
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,720
that they’ll bloom

661
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,680
later tonight.

662
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,080
You have too much work to do.

663
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:52,040
Don’t waste time picking flowers again.

664
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,160
I didn’t pick them.

665
00:28:54,975 --> 00:28:56,280
When Zhuoying and I

666
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,440
escorted Princess Yanling

667
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,560
back to her mansion,

668
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,120
she told us

669
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,475
to bring these to you

670
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:02,715
to decorate your study.

671
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,760
Master,

672
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,200
she asked us about you

673
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,200
which seems suspicious.

674
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,040
She’s just ended

675
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,440
her long exile

676
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:22,880
and come back from a foreign land.

677
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,040
Why is she so curious about you?

678
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,580
It’s not your place to judge.

679
00:29:30,175 --> 00:29:31,400
I know, Master.

680
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,520
I’m only

681
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,680
telling this to you and Zhuoying.

682
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,320
Once I’m out of this door,

683
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,480
I’ll be discreet

684
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,840
and cautious.

685
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,000
I’m glad you’ve matured.

686
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,680
Thank you, Master.

687
00:30:05,675 --> 00:30:07,280
You’ve barely finished

688
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,480
Consort Shurong’s dress

689
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,760
before new orders come in

690
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,520
for Princess’s everyday wear.

691
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,480
They know

692
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,440
we’re understaffed

693
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,680
but they’re eager

694
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,000
to please her

695
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,000
with litter consideration for you.

696
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,400
That’s fine. I can manage.

697
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,560
Aunt Su, go back and rest.

698
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Take care of Xiaobai and Xiaoguai.

699
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,160
If I could sew,

700
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
I’d be able to

701
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,440
share your work.

702
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,520
Is that Mr. Fang Haishi?

703
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,760
You’re good, Miss Zheliu.

704
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,760
I tried to be as quiet as I could

705
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,640
but

706
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,400
you still recognized me anyway.

707
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,125
It’s silent at night.

708
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,425
I could hear

709
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:12,440
a pin drop.

710
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,560
Miss Zheliu.

711
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,560
Have a seat, please.

712
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,240
Am I interrupting anything?

713
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,200
Not at all.

714
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,700
I’ve just put finishing touches

715
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,600
on Consort Shurong’s robe.

716
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,720
It’s done.

717
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,680
Your office is so busy

718
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,320
in the day

719
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,440
but empty at night.

720
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,240
I’m used to it.

721
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,700
What brings you here

722
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,760
this late?

723
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,720
I’m here

724
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,520
to consult you

725
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,520
about perfume,

726
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,880
actually.

727
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,480
Since when were you interested

728
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,360
in making perfume?

729
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,680
Do you want to learn it?

730
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,080
The truth is

731
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,040
I’m more interested

732
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,400
in Princess Yanling.

733
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,280
She’s said to be a huge fan

734
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,520
of peony since she was little,

735
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,480
and even obsessed, to be precise.

736
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,560
It’s in her perfume,

737
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
on things she wears

738
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,200
and around the place she stays.

739
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,320
Even her childhood name is Mudan,
meaning peony.

740
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,160
Is it possible

741
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,840
that she uses other perfume?

742
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,280
Why do you want to know?

743
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,960
It’s just that

744
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,320
for a peony aficionado like her,

745
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,120
I ran into her twice

746
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,560
and she was wearing lotus perfume.

747
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,560
Moreover,

748
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,040
she showed special preference

749
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,360
to it

750
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,300
that she almost drowned

751
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,840
to pick those flowers earlier today.

752
00:32:55,425 --> 00:32:56,440
Mr. Fang Haishi,

753
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,920
I’m going to get her measurements

754
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,880
for customization lately.

755
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,760
Maybe...

756
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,400
No need.

757
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,400
I came over

758
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,225
only to ask you

759
00:33:04,225 --> 00:33:06,040
about perfume.

760
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,520
That’s it.

761
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,200
The rest isn’t your concern.

762
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,520
Do not speculate

763
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,480
about it

764
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,040
or act recklessly.

765
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,040
Zheliu,

766
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,920
just tell me what you think.

767
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,480
Sure.

768
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:20,800
Princess wearing another perfume

769
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,400
is nothing out of the ordinary.

770
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,080
It could be two coincidences

771
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,000
that you caught her
wearing lotus perfume.

772
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,160
In order to establish a pattern,

773
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,080
you’ll have to observe her long enough

774
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:31,465
and gather more information.

775
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,040
I see.

776
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,240
Miss Zheliu,

777
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,850
don’t tell others

778
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,040
about why I’m here

779
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,280
tonight.

780
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,720
Zhuoying and I

781
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,280
don’t want you

782
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,840
to take more risks.

783
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,920
I understand.

784
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,560
Good night.

785
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,400
Mr. Fang Haishi,

786
00:33:58,225 --> 00:33:59,450
I was told

787
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,400
Marquis Wuxiang’s 14th son

788
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,800
is one of the best young perfume makers

789
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,680
and a household name in the city.

790
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
If you can

791
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,525
get close to him,

792
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,199
he might be able to help.

793
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,159
Thank you.

794
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:24,400
Hey!

795
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:27,440
Fang Zhuoying!

796
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:28,719
What’s wrong?

797
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,320
You seem totally lost.

798
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,775
Vegetables!

799
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:32,719
Hey,

800
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,400
are you

801
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,639
and Marquis Wuxiang’s 14th son close?

802
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,400
You bet!

803
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,400
We’re tight.

804
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,480
Youdu and I

805
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,880
even shared an ox cart

806
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,450
during the Double Third Festival.

807
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,775
Can you introduce me to him?

808
00:34:43,775 --> 00:34:44,520
Of course.

809
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,520
No problem.

810
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,180
Thanks.

811
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:46,880
Hey,

812
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,120
why are you

813
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,199
asking about him

814
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,760
like those ladies in the city?

815
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,679
They say girls have crushes.

816
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,150
I don’t know about them

817
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,880
but I know I have fists.

818
00:34:56,775 --> 00:34:57,960
Fang Haishi,

819
00:34:58,275 --> 00:34:59,280
I thought

820
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,320
you asked me

821
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,120
to drink with you.

822
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,400
How could you try to hit me?

823
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:02,920
Fang Zhuoying,

824
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,120
be honest with me.

825
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,440
Do you have money with you?

826
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,520
Why ask?

827
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,120
Let’s go somewhere fun.

828
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,600
Come.

829
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:13,650
Hey...

830
00:35:17,975 --> 00:35:19,280
I’m shocked that these things

831
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,200
are priced as high as gold.

832
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,440
A few bags of them

833
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,400
cost me

834
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,600
several months’ pay.

835
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,680
You know,

836
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,200
we don’t

837
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,200
produce those materials.

838
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,280
They come

839
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,320
from Zhunian, Zhenla,

840
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,080
Nihualuo

841
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,480
and Tuhuolu

842
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,600
by boat

843
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,200
or carriage.

844
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,000
The materials for perfume are

845
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,200
already expensive in places of origin.

846
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,050
You can only imagine the raise

847
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,520
when they get here

848
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,920
after traveling half the world.

849
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,080
It’s insane.

850
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,000
No wonder

851
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,450
few are

852
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,360
making perfume

853
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,360
after

854
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,400
the Rebellion of Prince Yi.

855
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
I got it!

856
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,720
You’re doing all this

857
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,600
because of Princess Yanling.

858
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,320
You’re right.

859
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,175
She was just wearing a different scent

860
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:04,350
and picked a few Xieluo Flowers.

861
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,800
Why can’t you let it go?

862
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,560
What if

863
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,560
my instinct is right?

864
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,720
Master said...

865
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,400
“Never rely on your instinct”.

866
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:14,560
Right?

867
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,520
- Yes.
- I know that.

868
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,360
That’s why

869
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,840
I need to meet Zhou Youdu.

870
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,280
An expert like him

871
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,150
can help identify the key

872
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,840
and shine a light on this mystery.

873
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:24,360
As a princess

874
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,640
is involved,

875
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,960
I need solid evidence

876
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,280
and proceed carefully.

877
00:36:29,075 --> 00:36:29,975
You wouldn’t understand.

878
00:36:38,475 --> 00:36:39,480
Consort Shurong,

879
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,275
Nihualuo has a unique prescription

880
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:42,360
for cold.

881
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,800
Take the medicine for six months

882
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,040
and you’ll be cured.

883
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

884
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,280
No need.

885
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,920
We’re family.

886
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,360
We should look after each other.

887
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,840
Agreed.

888
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:20,250
(Dendrobium Brightening Lotion)

889
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,240
Consort Shurong,

890
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,760
these are too valuable.

891
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,080
I didn’t bring

892
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,040
too much with me from Zhunian.

893
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,800
They found this pair of bracelets

894
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,600
when organizing things the other day.

895
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,760
You prefer peonies,

896
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,120
so I thought

897
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,475
these are perfect

898
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,720
for you.

899
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,760
I love them.

900
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,920
Dendrobium

901
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,680
is a rare orchid

902
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,840
from mountains of Zhongzhou.

903
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,080
It’s the best for our skin

904
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,120
and only served to the Palace.

905
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,960
This is so thoughtful of you.

906
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,760
I heard

907
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,200
His Majesty gave it to you as a gift.

908
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,520
Your Highnesses,

909
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,560
Manager Ju
with Fabric Office is outside.

910
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,880
Manager Ju?

911
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,920
Send her in.

912
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:08,880
Yes.

913
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,320
I dropped by

914
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,440
on my way

915
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,560
to pay respects to His Majesty.

916
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,880
You have a visitor now,

917
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,040
so I’ll take my leave.

918
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:22,550
Sure.

919
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,440
Your Highness.

920
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,375
It is lotus perfume.

921
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,840
You’re indeed

922
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,200
a master of making tea and perfume.

923
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,600
But maybe

924
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,480
someone is even better than you.

925
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

926
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,710
Rise, Linlang.

927
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,240
Lord Qinghai.

928
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,280
Your Highness.

929
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,840
Sit with us.

930
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,800
Linlang,

931
00:39:32,175 --> 00:39:33,280
I’m glad you’re here.

932
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,280
You’ve always been a tea expert.

933
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,720
Jianming meets a stronger rival today.

934
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,720
I always lost to him.

935
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,840
Just teach him a lesson for me.

936
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:45,280
Lord Qinghai is said to be the best.

937
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,275
I’d rather

938
00:39:46,275 --> 00:39:48,480
not embarrass myself in front of you.

939
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,760
You don’t want to help me, Linlang?

940
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,450
Your Majesty,

941
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,160
I’d never say no to you.

942
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,240
If you insist,

943
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:00,595
I’ll have a try.

944
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,000
Jianming,

945
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,520
Linlang is in.

946
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,160
Don’t tell me you get cold feet.

947
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:14,925
I only did this for fun as a child.

948
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,180
After all these years,

949
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,210
I’m rusty.

950
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,400
It’s boiling the second time.

951
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,760
Heaven seems to be

952
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:27,360
on Linlang’s side

953
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,440
to make you weep.

954
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,080
Please, Your Highness.

955
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,300
(Jinchen Tea)

956
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,200
Princess’s been coming

957
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,950
to the Palace almost every day

958
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,160
since she got back.

959
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,800
I heard Lord Qinghai saved her earlier.

960
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,200
It’s spreading in the Palace.

961
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,840
Does His Majesty mean to set them up?

962
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,880
Look, Brother.

963
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,760
I knew I’d fail.

964
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,360
I’m sorry

965
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,650
for wasting your finest tea.

966
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:57,440
Those years in exile

967
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,160
have taken away my skills.

968
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,640
Jianming,

969
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,440
you knew she wasn’t really here for tea.

970
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,040
Don’t be too competitive.

971
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,200
Please don’t tease me, Your Majesty.

972
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:14,680
Mudan,

973
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,160
I’m sorry that you suffered so much

974
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,320
over the years.

975
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,080
Now that you’re back,

976
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,840
I’ll make it up to you

977
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,320
as your brother.

978
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

979
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,080
You’ve seen me making tea.

980
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,080
I don’t want to take up

981
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,360
any more of your time.

982
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,440
Jianming,

983
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,360
walk her out for me.

984
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,800
