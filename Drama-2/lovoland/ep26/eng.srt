=Episode 26=

25
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,440
I heard that Lord Qinghai
is good at making tea.

26
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:28,639
You widened my horizon today.

27
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,320
I wonder

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,360
when I’ll have a chance
to learn from you.

29
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:34,320
Your Highness.

30
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,839
When His Majesty took the throne,

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,279
he urged frugality and austerity.

32
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,839
Therefore, drinking tea

33
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:41,440
and making perfume

34
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,039
are not as popular as before.

35
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,880
It was a mere whim of His Majesty today.

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
I think

37
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,160
it doesn’t make much of a difference

38
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,960
to learn it or not.

39
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:52,880
Yes.

40
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:55,119
I’m not thoughtful enough.

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,000
Shaozi.

42
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,119
Lord.

43
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,199
Your Highness.

44
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:02,919
Send Her Highness back

45
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:04,416
to her mansion safely.

46
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,320
Yes, Lord.

47
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,720
I have work to do.

48
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,679
I’ll leave then.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,960
Your Highness.

50
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:17,479
Please.

51
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:30,075
Zhuoying.

52
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:30,600
Um?

53
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,039
I asked you

54
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,750
to arrange a meeting for me
with Zhou Youdu.

55
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,559
Have you asked him?

56
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,199
Of course I have.

57
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,440
A few days ago,

58
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,960
Youdu just got back
from a trip to other countries.

59
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,800
He needs to rest for a few days.

60
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,600
If you want to see him,

61
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:43,479
you need to be patient.

62
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,750
Oh.

63
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,240
What are you thinking now?

64
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,080
Zhuoying.

65
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,479
I have a question.

66
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,525
You know,

67
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,759
one’s skills

68
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,919
will get rusty

69
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,000
over time.

70
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,679
But if that person

71
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:01,919
masters the skills by heart,

72
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,735
is it possible

73
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:05,375
for him to not be able
to do it again at all?

74
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:07,800
Like how?

75
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,279
Well...

76
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:12,039
For example, Zhou Youdu.

77
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,800
Um.

78
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,880
He is good at making perfume,

79
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,679
but for some reason,

80
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,279
he hasn’t done it for years.

81
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,359
Is there any chance

82
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,200
that

83
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,640
he loses this skill at all?

84
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,079
It won’t be like that.

85
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,125
It’s just like

86
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,119
shooting arrows.

87
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,880
No matter how long
you don’t shoot arrows,

88
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,880
at best, you won’t be able
to pull a heavy bow.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,880
There is no way

90
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,279
you will lose accuracy.

91
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,839
You know what,

92
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,839
I heard from the staffs in the palace

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,440
that Princess Yanling’s
skills of making tea

94
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,480
were the best in the palace.

95
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,119
When Master was a reading partner,

96
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,720
he once compared notes with her.

97
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,359
But when she

98
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,839
competed with Master
on making tea last time,

99
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,799
her skills were rusty,

100
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:50,278
and she made a lot of mistakes.

101
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,500
Um.

102
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,920
As for Princess Yanling,

103
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,079
it might be

104
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,480
because she had been
drifting around these years

105
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,000
and she pretty much

106
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,640
lost her taste.

107
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,160
Zhuoying.

108
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,079
I always feel

109
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,959
that Master’s attitude

110
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,325
towards Princess Yanling

111
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,480
is also strange.

112
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,679
Even I’m suspicious of this,

113
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,079
not to mention Master.

114
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,679
And I also feel

115
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,000
that Princess Yanling

116
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,799
is making excuses to approach Master.

117
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,375
Ah?

118
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:24,559
She...

119
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,040
Why would she approach Master?

120
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,359
How would I know?

121
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,160
Anyway,

122
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,000
when Master saved her

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,119
and got her out of the lake,

124
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,359
I saw the way she looked at Master

125
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,239
became different.

126
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:41,600
I...

127
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:58,045
Madam.

128
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,401
You’ve been embroidering all morning.

129
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,700
Have some tea and take a rest.

130
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,200
Put it there.

131
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,920
I have to finish this first.

132
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,239
Mr. Fang.

133
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:12,791
Um.

134
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,359
Please sit down.

135
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:15,119
You don’t need to get up.

136
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,600
I’ve been sitting for a while.

137
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:21,000
My legs are numb.
Sorry about the rude welcome.

138
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,079
Not at all.

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,279
Why are you in such a hurry

140
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,440
to make the informal clothes?

141
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,040
I’m always in a hurry.

142
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,959
This informal dress of Princess Yanling

143
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,825
has been assigned to me for days.

144
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,519
You’re the manager now.

145
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,679
Even if it’s in a hurry,

146
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:36,160
you don’t have to do it yourself.

147
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,480
I got some pastry

148
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,600
from the Food Office.

149
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,160
Try it with Aunt Su.

150
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,559
It won’t take you long

151
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:42,200
to have some pastry first.

152
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:44,239
Mr. Fang is so thoughtful indeed.

153
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,519
Thank you for caring about Miss Ju.

154
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,720
I’ll go to make some tea

155
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,760
and get back soon.

156
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,425
Um.

157
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,359
I bet Princess Yanling

158
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:58,480
has dozens of informal clothes

159
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,720
like this.

160
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,239
Why the rush?

161
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,559
Is there another reason?

162
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:03,959
There’s no other reason.

163
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,399
That’s how we do

164
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,720
all year round.

165
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:09,160
Really?

166
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,725
Really.

167
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,650
Um.

168
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:12,679
That’s good.

169
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:18,600
I have other affairs to attend to.

170
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,040
I came here
just to bring you some snacks.

171
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,119
I’ll leave then.

172
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,440
Don’t overwork yourself.

173
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:24,525
Don’t worry.

174
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,775
Eh?

175
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:38,839
Where is Mr. Fang?

176
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,239
Mr. Fang has work to do.

177
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,200
He has left.

178
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:43,839
I just made the tea. What a pity.

179
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,440
There happens to be some pastries.

180
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,720
A cup of tea for each of us.

181
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,600
That will be

182
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,720
our lunch today.

183
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,559
How is it?

184
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,359
Okay.

185
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,559
I have to thank you for this.

186
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,440
Aunt Su.

187
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,880
Go to find some peonies to make perfume

188
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,679
when you have time.

189
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:22,760
Okay.

190
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:24,920
Princess Yanling’s infant name is Mudan

191
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,600
because she loves peonies.

192
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,920
It’s perfect to use peonies
for Princess Yanling.

193
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,440
Remember,

194
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,880
don’t let anyone see that.

195
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:33,919
Yes.

196
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:39,559
Thank you very much.

197
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,479
Just do

198
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,450
these things

199
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,479
as I told you.

200
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,280
Yes, Lord.

201
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:55,150
Eh?

202
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:56,239
Young Master Haishi.

203
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,039
Shaozi.

204
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,400
Haishi.

205
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,960
Master, anything for me?

206
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:07,559
Nothing.

207
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:09,725
I just want to know
if you are feeling better.

208
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:13,320
Thank you for caring about me.

209
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,039
The wound is almost healed.

210
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
If there is nothing else...

211
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,919
There’s nothing.

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,799
Rest early.

213
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,799
Lord!

214
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:23,440
Lord.

215
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,050
Go ahead.

216
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,039
The person who went to Nihualuo

217
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,640
to investigate Princess Yanling

218
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,280
is back.

219
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,159
How is it?

220
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,239
What he reported

221
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,919
is no different from

222
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:34,159
Princess Yanling’s account.

223
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:36,280
I see.

224
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,320
Rest early, Lord.

225
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,679
I’ll leave.

226
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:41,440
Go back.

227
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,760
What Mr. Fang Haishi said

228
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,325
about Princess Yanling’s perfume

229
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:49,880
seems to be nothing at first,

230
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
but if you get down to it,

231
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,840
it is something

232
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,039
worth attention.

233
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,960
Young Master Haishi.

234
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,400
Shaozi.

235
00:10:58,875 --> 00:10:59,796
Haven’t you gone to rest?

236
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:00,679
Um.

237
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,840
I just had a midnight snack.

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,880
I’m going back to sleep now.

239
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,625
See you tomorrow.

240
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:11,650
Ah?

241
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:18,440
Even you bullied me!

242
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,559
Master?

243
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,559
I’ve long heard about

244
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,119
your charm and elegance.

245
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,159
Now I see you today.

246
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,719
You are graceful indeed.

247
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,239
I’m flattered.

248
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,679
You’re a famous talent in Tianqi.

249
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,479
Everyone knows
that you can master brush and sword.

250
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,479
I should thank Zhuoying

251
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,919
to give me a chance to meet you today.

252
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:04,559
Mr. Fang Haishi.

253
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,320
You’ve been staring at me.

254
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,719
Is there anything

255
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,159
on my face?

256
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:11,479
No.

257
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,159
It’s just

258
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,159
the way you dress

259
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,479
and the look on your face

260
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:19,799
remind me of someone I know.

261
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,960
Do you mean

262
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,559
Lord Qinghai?

263
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,599
Has anyone said that before?

264
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,200
A few years ago,

265
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:31,919
I hadn’t reached 20 at that time

266
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:33,840
and I would occasionally help my father

267
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,960
with some social affairs.

268
00:13:35,575 --> 00:13:36,440
At that time,

269
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,640
there were people in the capital saying

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,679
that I look like

271
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,679
Lord Qinghai, Fang Jianming.

272
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,159
Lord Qinghai wore white armor

273
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,440
and once shocked the world.

274
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,840
I was quite proud

275
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,239
when I heard people say I look like him.

276
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:50,440
Until

277
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,280
His Majesty reappointed Lord Qinghai,

278
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:54,446
I was lucky to see him once
from a distance.

279
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,280
Then I knew

280
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,039
that the dim light of a candle
and the bright light of the moon

281
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,400
are nowhere near the same.

282
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,799
You’re being too modest.

283
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,840
Youdu!

284
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,880
If you are the light of a candle,

285
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,799
most of the girls in the capital

286
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,039
would like to be moths to the flame.

287
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:20,359
We are old friends.

288
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,080
Don’t feel restrained.

289
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,280
Let’s get down to business.

290
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,800
Tell Haishi

291
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,559
about these

292
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,100
nuisances.

293
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,325
I have some impression

294
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:40,159
of the perfume formula

295
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:41,840
that Princess Yanling
used in the palace.

296
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:43,750
It is a mixture of 14 spices,

297
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,039
including dried peony stamens,

298
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,280
Pihan

299
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,400
and Yuezhi.

300
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,080
The lotus perfume you mentioned

301
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,760
is made in a brazier

302
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,400
and then mixed with seven spices,

303
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,320
like Yunxiang and Duyi.

304
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,599
The property and flavor

305
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,119
of Pihan and Duyi are in conflict.

306
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,625
If these two spices are used together,

307
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,919
it will make people have a rash
all over the body.

308
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,039
Like you said,

309
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:12,640
what would happen

310
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,440
if two conflicting perfumes

311
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,799
are used together?

312
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,159
If these two formulas

313
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,159
are used together,

314
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,760
it will give people a rash.

315
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,975
Are you sure

316
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:32,960
about the peony perfume formula
you saw that day?

317
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,080
There will be no mistake.

318
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:35,880
The perfume formula I saw

319
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,479
is recorded in a book about fragrance,

320
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,000
and the one I saw

321
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,359
happened to be

322
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:41,679
a manuscript of Lord Qinghai
with a preface he wrote.

323
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:43,850
You mean

324
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,320
Master can also make perfume?

325
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:46,400
Of course.

326
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:47,640
There is such a true master of perfume

327
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,119
in your mansion.

328
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:50,520
I think you don’t need to ask me

329
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,559
about these questions.

330
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,799
In the early years,

331
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,960
the young men in the capital

332
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:56,760
enjoyed making tea and perfume.

333
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,760
They often held literati gatherings.

334
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,080
Lord Qinghai

335
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,159
often came out on top

336
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,479
and overshadowed

337
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,400
other young men.

338
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,119
That’s also

339
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
where Princess Yanling

340
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,919
got her perfume formulas.

341
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,200
Princess Yanling is strange.

342
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:14,919
I think Master has realized that.

343
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,359
Never mind, he would have his own plan.

344
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,760
There is some Duyi.

345
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,840
You can smell it.

346
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:27,760
Is it strong?

347
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:40,125
Ouch.

348
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,880
Sorry, sorry.

349
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:53,960
Master?

350
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:00,640
Master.

351
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,320
Lord Qinghai.

352
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:06,745
You have a guest?

353
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:09,880
Master.

354
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:10,750
This is

355
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,560
the fourteenth son of
Marquis Wuxiang.

356
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:31,520
Fang Zhuoying.

357
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,075
Ah?

358
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,359
Why are you staring at our guest?

359
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,686
I was told by someone in the capital

360
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,850
that Youdu looks like Master.

361
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,880
I didn’t feel that way before.

362
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,000
Now they are in the same place today.

363
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,000
They look so much like each other!

364
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,400
Really?

365
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,599
Yeah!

366
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:51,680
Well...

367
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:52,760
Well...

368
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,920
They look so much alike.

369
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,359
Right, Haishi?

370
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:55,920
Look!

371
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,040
The features are not very similar,

372
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,280
but their bearing is alike.

373
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:03,959
In conclusion,

374
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,719
they are not so alike.

375
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,040
Really?

376
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,680
Young Master Youdu smiles a lot.
You are gentler.

377
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:20,826
Zhuoying is just joking,

378
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:22,395
but you take it seriously.

379
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:31,280
By the way,

380
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,040
do you have

381
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,160
any sisters?

382
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:41,479
I’m the only child in my family.

383
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,920
I have no other siblings.

384
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:48,760
What’s the matter?

385
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,800
Nothing.

386
00:18:51,425 --> 00:18:53,275
I made perfume with you today.

387
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:54,640
We are friends now.

388
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:56,304
Don’t feel restrained.

389
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,880
Just call me Youdu.

390
00:18:58,475 --> 00:18:59,200
Um.

391
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,520
I’ll call you Haishi.

392
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,920
That would be great!

393
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,839
We are all brothers.

394
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:05,920
Make yourself at home.

395
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,040
Let’s eat.

396
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,599
Thank you for today.

397
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,050
Eat.

398
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,839
Master.

399
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:39,839
He left?

400
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:44,199
Zhuoying asked people
to arrange a carriage for him.

401
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,760
I only sent him to the West Corner Gate.

402
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:48,880
Take it.

403
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,839
This is...?

404
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,000
I was a little harsh on you that day.

405
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
Master.

406
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,959
Fang Jianming!

407
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,119
If you are just my master,

408
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,119
there is nothing wrong with

409
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,479
you scolding me that day,

410
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,959
and I know my fault.

411
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:17,319
Now

412
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:19,400
you gave me a gift as an apology,

413
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,640
I dare not take it

414
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,760
and I cannot afford it.

415
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:24,319
But if...

416
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,520
You are someone I love.

417
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,400
We have to talk about it

418
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,359
one day.

419
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,650
Who am I

420
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,959
in your heart?

421
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:39,959
If you don’t like it,

422
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,640
you can throw it away.

423
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,760
Master.

424
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,560
Master, have some porridge first.

425
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:36,719
It can warm your stomach.

426
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,359
I see.

427
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,359
Zhuoying.

428
00:21:55,425 --> 00:21:55,950
Um?

429
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:01,880
Master.

430
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,950
I’m busy today.

431
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,800
I’ll go to the palace now.

432
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:05,959
You eat first.

433
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,760
Your Highness.

434
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,479
Your Majesty.

435
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:39,239
Mudan?

436
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,079
What brings you here?

437
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,250
I’m worried
that Your Majesty is too busy

438
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,520
to be bothered.

439
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:46,520
It’s okay.

440
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,920
You should come to the palace

441
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,800
more often.

442
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,000
I lost to Lord Qinghai that day

443
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,319
and it struck me

444
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:54,880
that I had been in Nihualuo for too long

445
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,800
and I even neglected the art of tea

446
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,839
which I practiced hard before.

447
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,160
It’s a pity indeed.

448
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,040
So

449
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,599
after I went back,
I worked on it for a few days.

450
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,239
I’m thinking
that if you have time today,

451
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,880
I can make a cup of tea for you.

452
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:06,975
It was just a whim

453
00:23:06,975 --> 00:23:08,640
that day.

454
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:10,959
If you have time

455
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,000
and you want someone

456
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,550
to compare notes on the art of tea with,

457
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,599
you can go to Jianming.

458
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,280
I’ve asked it.

459
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:19,359
Lord Qinghai is not in the palace.

460
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,560
So you came to me

461
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,319
because Jianming

462
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,250
is not available?

463
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,959
Xu.

464
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,640
I take Lord Qinghai as a friend.

465
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:32,839
I should greet him
when I enter the palace,

466
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,199
but the most important thing

467
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,760
is surly to see you.

468
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,239
I remember

469
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:41,040
when Jianming was accompanying me
on my study in the palace,

470
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,700
you gave him the cold shoulder

471
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,079
and you two just didn’t get along.

472
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,839
You hated that he wouldn’t let you win.

473
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:51,115
Now you take him as your friend?

474
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,040
You’ve grown up.

475
00:23:57,175 --> 00:23:58,439
Xu...

476
00:23:58,775 --> 00:23:59,550
Never mind.

477
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:02,000
Jianming is mature now.

478
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,086
The days are long.

479
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:06,000
It’s a good thing

480
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,920
if you want to compare notes with him.

481
00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:10,319
Why do you always say things like that?

482
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,119
Look at you.

483
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,599
Master, you wanted to see me?

484
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:27,440
Come and play Go with me.

485
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,359
I haven’t gotten

486
00:25:06,925 --> 00:25:08,599
any better at Go over these years.

487
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,479
When you played before,

488
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:17,119
even if you lost,

489
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:19,514
it wouldn’t be such a fiasco.

490
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,551
You always wanted to even up the odds.

491
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,199
Right?

492
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,350
Your mind is not here.

493
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,640
You came to me again and again

494
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,800
and looked like
you had something to say.

495
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,479
Just go ahead

496
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,439
and say what you want.

497
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:43,760
Master.

498
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,319
Haishi has grown up now.

499
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:47,439
She can’t stay

500
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:48,479
in the army forever.

501
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:50,599
When she reaches marriageable age,

502
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,640
shouldn’t she

503
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
return to be a girl?

504
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,280
Why did you say that?

505
00:25:56,075 --> 00:25:56,959
Over these years,

506
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,439
I found that Haishi is no longer

507
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,800
as carefree as before.

508
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,199
There seems to be something on her mind.

509
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:03,250
Master.

510
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,719
I grew up with Haishi.

511
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,959
I know her

512
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:07,959
too well.

513
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,800
Once she is in love with someone,

514
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,560
she would never change.

515
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,000
Master.

516
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,840
Even...

517
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,760
Even if you only take her
as your apprentice,

518
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:24,800
I hope you can make an end of it
as soon as possible.

519
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,095
Otherwise, it will hurt
both her and yourself.

520
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:34,250
Do you know what you’re talking about?

521
00:26:35,275 --> 00:26:36,160
- Master...
- Get out!

522
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,199
Get out!

523
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,040
Haishi.

524
00:27:08,075 --> 00:27:08,750
Um?

525
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,040
Today

526
00:27:13,225 --> 00:27:14,719
I’ll cover your shift for two hours.

527
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:16,800
After that, we can take a walk together.

528
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,199
Ever since you got back to the capital,

529
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,599
you haven’t gone out to have fun.

530
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:21,359
Okay.

531
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,040
All right.

532
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,119
I’ll leave then.

533
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,200
Um.

534
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:35,119
Mr. Fang.

535
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:37,000
I’m the maidservant of Princess Yanling.

536
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,839
Does Princess Yanling want to see me?

537
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,199
Mr. Fang.

538
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:41,959
I’m here on behalf of Her Highness

539
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:42,920
to ask Mr. Fang

540
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,319
to send a letter to Lord Qinghai.

541
00:27:45,675 --> 00:27:47,280
Her Highness invited Lord Qinghai

542
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,079
to play the zither by Shuangping Lake

543
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,439
this afternoon.

544
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,239
Please inform Lord Qinghai of it.

545
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:54,800
I see.

546
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:56,160
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

547
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:12,400
Master.

548
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,239
Didn’t you go on duty?

549
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,280
Why are you back?

550
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,160
Zhuoying covered my shift.

551
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,499
I’m here to deliver a message
for Princess Yanling.

552
00:28:23,525 --> 00:28:25,959
Princess Yanling invited Master

553
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,199
to play the zither
by Shuangping Lake this afternoon.

554
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,479
Master, do you have other orders?

555
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:38,479
If not,

556
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,560
Zhuoying asked me to take a walk
in the West Market.

557
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,280
Go ahead.

558
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:02,719
Waiter.

559
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:03,475
Yes.

560
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,239
I’ll pay the bill.

561
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,439
Sir.

562
00:29:05,725 --> 00:29:06,439
Someone has

563
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:07,319
paid for you.

564
00:29:07,575 --> 00:29:08,250
Ah?

565
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,025
Marquis Wuxiang’s Young Master

566
00:29:10,025 --> 00:29:11,520
was meeting friends
in a private room upstairs today.

567
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,479
He’s already paid your bill.

568
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,599
It’s Youdu.

569
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,319
Where is he?

570
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,079
He just left.

571
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,319
Youdu.

572
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,675
Thank you for today.

573
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:28,225
I just wanted to say hi.

574
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:29,880
I didn’t expect to keep you all day.

575
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,400
I didn’t have any plans anyway.

576
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,520
Since we meet,

577
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,520
it’s much funnier to hang out together

578
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,920
than being alone.

579
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:38,200
Haishi?

580
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,680
Haishi?

581
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,200
Um?

582
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,160
Nothing.

583
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:43,700
I just heard from Zhuoying

584
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,160
that you spent most of your days
on guarding Huangquan Pass

585
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,439
and rarely got back.

586
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:48,560
Is there anything
you want to eat or buy?

587
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:50,280
Nothing.

588
00:29:50,325 --> 00:29:52,280
Hand-made flower hairpins.

589
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,119
Come and have a look!

590
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:56,280
Very beautiful flower hairpins.

591
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:58,319
Come and have a look!

592
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:08,680
What a rare flower.

593
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,000
It’s not made of wool,

594
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,479
but so realistic.

595
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,719
What material is this?

596
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,119
These are fake flowers
made of tetrapanax papyriferus,

597
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,359
also called “A Year’s View”,

598
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,560
meaning the flowers don’t wither

599
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,640
throughout the year.

600
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,050
You can have this.

601
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,600
I’ll have one, too.

602
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:51,760
Lord.

603
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,319
The Hairpin Store is ahead.

604
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:54,959
No need.

605
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,160
Let’s go back to Zhaoming Palace.

606
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,319
Yes.

607
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,920
Lord is in his study

608
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,479
talking to Associate Justice Zong.

609
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,439
Your Highness.

610
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,760
Should I report to him?

611
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:09,479
I didn’t expect Youdu

612
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:10,479
to have such a good taste.

613
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,920
It looks good.

614
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,675
Um.

615
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,560
It suits you well.

616
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,800
I think I...

617
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,640
Mr. Fang Haishi and Mr. Fang Zhuoying.

618
00:31:19,725 --> 00:31:20,880
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

619
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,959
Mr. Fang Haishi.

620
00:31:30,575 --> 00:31:31,800
I was hoping I can
learn from Lord Qinghai

621
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,000
about the skills of playing the zither.

622
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,279
Unfortunately, he seems to be busy.

623
00:31:38,475 --> 00:31:39,400
Haishi delivered

624
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,079
the message for Your Highness today.

625
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,025
Well, didn’t Master show up?

626
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,025
I guess

627
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:51,800
Master must have been
really busy lately.

628
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,825
Your Highness, if you want

629
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:54,800
to play the zither with Master,

630
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,520
I’m afraid you have to wait.

631
00:31:57,225 --> 00:31:57,875
Um.

632
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,719
I heard

633
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,760
that Mr. Fang Haishi
learned the Six Arts

634
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,479
from Lord Qinghai.

635
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,520
You must have your own insights.

636
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,719
If you don’t mind,

637
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:09,839
maybe

638
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,599
we can have a talk first.

639
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:16,880
Well,

640
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,920
do you also have important affairs
to attend to?

641
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,400
I have nothing to do today.

642
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,119
If you don’t mind,

643
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,390
you can join me at the pavilion.

644
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,760
Your Highness,
you played it wrong again.

645
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:46,479
It’s a jumping note here.

646
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:47,560
Somehow

647
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,079
I just can’t play it right.

648
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,640
Master taught me

649
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,800
about fingering before.

650
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:54,680
How about

651
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,199
I demonstrate it for you?

652
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,040
That would be great.

653
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,319
Your Highness played it wrong

654
00:33:12,025 --> 00:33:13,319
only because this song

655
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,760
is a famous song of Yingchuan Sect.

656
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,760
The fingering they used

657
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:18,719
is different from

658
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:19,680
the current fingering here.

659
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,800
You shouldn’t touch
the side of your index finger

660
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,359
with the tip of your thumb.

661
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,359
Instead, you should
put your fingers together.

662
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:34,239
You’re insightful indeed.

663
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,950
I’ve asked several people about this

664
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,079
and no one could tell the reason.

665
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,560
Lord Qinghai, thank you
for having a long talk with me.

666
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,079
You’re welcome, Mr. Zong.

667
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,040
Grand Justice
is looking into this matter.

668
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,400
If you are wronged,

669
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,354
the truth will come out.

670
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:10,159
Thank you, Mr. Zong.

671
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
No problem.

672
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,560
I’ll leave then.

673
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,080
Lord.

674
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,919
What’s wrong?

675
00:34:22,275 --> 00:34:23,360
Princess Yanling has arrived.

676
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,800
Young Master Haishi

677
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,360
is playing the zither with her
in the pavilion.

678
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:32,150
This song

679
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,320
is called Heaven Fragrance
and National Beauty.

680
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:37,840
Your Highness is wearing
peony perfume today.

681
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,879
I’ve smelt

682
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,159
a faint fragrance floating around me.

683
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,399
This song is perfect for such a moment.

684
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,199
Mr. Fang Haishi.

685
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,040
Your nose is not very sensitive.

686
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,925
I’m wearing lotus perfume today,

687
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,479
not peony perfume.

688
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,199
I heard

689
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,040
that you have loved peonies
since childhood.

690
00:34:58,399 --> 00:34:59,800
I made a fool of myself.

691
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:03,159
I also wear peony perfume a lot.

692
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,439
It’s just

693
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,199
I’m not wearing it today.

694
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,605
The property and flavor

695
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,280
of Pihan and Duyi are in conflict.

696
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:12,719
If these two spices

697
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,560
are used together,

698
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:16,080
it will make people have a rash
all over the body.

699
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:21,199
Thanks for your tolerance.

700
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:22,199
Don’t say that.

701
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,239
Mr. Fang Haishi is brilliant.

702
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:25,159
I even

703
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,360
forgot about the time.

704
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:28,360
By the way,

705
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,239
I happen to bring some perfume boxes
I made recently.

706
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,439
I can give you one.

707
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,879
The perfume box is made of gold.

708
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,959
It is filled with

709
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:44,080
balls made of spices.

710
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,360
If you wear it,

711
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,399
the smell will spread when you move

712
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:49,280
and last through days.

713
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

714
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:55,025
Haishi.

715
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,199
Lord Qinghai.

716
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,679
Master, you came just right.

717
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,639
Her Highness is waiting for you.

718
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,479
Haishi doesn’t know the rules.

719
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:10,719
I didn’t teach him well.

720
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,239
Please forgive me.

721
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,959
Not at all.

722
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,919
Mr. Fang Haishi is talented

723
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:16,959
and he has good manners.

724
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,760
You taught him well.

725
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,800
I’m flattered, Your Highness.

726
00:36:21,425 --> 00:36:23,030
I have some affairs to attend to.

727
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,919
I’ll apologize to you another day.

728
00:36:25,525 --> 00:36:26,959
Lord Qinghai, please go ahead.

729
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:28,080
Don’t worry about me.

730
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,320
Shaozi.

731
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:30,360
Lord.

732
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:31,760
Send Her Highness back to her place.

733
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:33,719
Yes.

734
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:34,560
Come with me.

735
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,479
Your Highness, please.

736
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,879
How could you be so bold?

737
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,550
You are a commoner.

738
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,520
How dare you

739
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,760
take something from Princess Yanling?

740
00:36:57,475 --> 00:36:58,560
I overstepped the bounds.

741
00:36:59,075 --> 00:37:00,080
You did more than that.

742
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:01,760
From now on,

743
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,840
you can’t be associated with her.

744
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,159
Even if she comes to you,

745
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,199
you have to turn her down
in a polite way.

746
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,120
Why did you say that?

747
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,560
Do you also think

748
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,719
there is something wrong
with Princess Yanling?

749
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,719
I told you

750
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:13,600
to stay out of it.

751
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:14,919
You never told me

752
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:15,520
what you are thinking

753
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,040
and what you are going to do!

754
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
Am I so untrustworthy

755
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,320
and useless

756
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,479
in your eyes?

757
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,040
I was being rude.

758
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,560
Go back and rest.

759
00:38:01,575 --> 00:38:02,399
Madam.

760
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,719
Take a break.

761
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,159
Just a while.

762
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,919
Fetch the silk brocade box.

763
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,439
When Secretary Shi comes,

764
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:13,239
wrap it up

765
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,520
and let him take it.

766
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,320
Yes.

767
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,199
Miss Ju!

768
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:19,439
Miss Ju!

769
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,199
Miss Ju.

770
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,000
I’m here to bother you again.

771
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:25,639
Uncle Shi.

772
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,679
Don’t be offended, Miss Ju.

773
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:29,439
I’m always in a hurry.

774
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,679
Those who don’t know it

775
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:32,320
must think that Princess Yanling

776
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,800
just returned to Tianqi

777
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,520
and she has no clothes to wear.

778
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:43,040
What a wonderful piece of work!

779
00:38:43,575 --> 00:38:44,800
The stitch,

780
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:46,080
the embroidery,

781
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,639
and the color.

782
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:50,560
Miss Ju is

783
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,320
the Weaver Girl from heaven indeed.

784
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,280
Otherwise,

785
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,919
how could someone on earth

786
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:57,239
embroider such glamorous dress?

787
00:38:58,975 --> 00:39:00,719
I’m flattered, Uncle Shi.

788
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,360
Madam, here is the brocade box.

789
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:05,760
It’s still early.

790
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,399
Uncle Shi, why don’t you take a seat

791
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:08,159
and have some tea?

792
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,199
No need for tea.

793
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,969
I’m in a hurry

794
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,239
to send such glamorous dress

795
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:15,100
to Princess Yanling
and ask her for a reward.

796
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:16,719
Hurry, hurry.

797
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,800
Wrap it up!

798
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,760
You will suffer

799
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,280
if I see a wrinkle!

800
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,000
Miss Ju.

801
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,679
The Imperial Manufactories

802
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:33,879
sent some good material again.

803
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:35,399
I saved it all for you.

804
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:36,639
I’ll bring it

805
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,439
to you in person another day.

806
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,639
I’ll leave.

807
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,560
I’ll come here for tea later.

808
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:43,239
Uncle Shi, take care.

809
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:50,439
Secretary Shi

810
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:52,035
is smooth and slick indeed.

811
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,679
Your Highness,
you’ve been brooding on something

812
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:05,040
since you came back from the palace.

813
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,399
Did anything happen?

814
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,080
Lord Qinghai

815
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,520
is always unpredictable.

816
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,840
Your Highness.

817
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,120
Secretary of the Imperial Manufactories
presented himself.

818
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,320
What’s the matter?

819
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:29,040
He said he came
to send the informal clothes.

820
00:40:30,025 --> 00:40:30,719
Let him in.

821
00:40:31,025 --> 00:40:31,650
Um.

822
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,560
Your Highness!

823
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,000
Your Highness!

824
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,239
Greetings to Your Highness

825
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,439
and Commander.

826
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,600
Rise.

827
00:40:42,975 --> 00:40:45,239
Your Highness,
the informal clothes are finished.

828
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:47,479
I brought it for you in person.

829
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,230
Please take a look.

830
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,360
I’ve heard

831
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,320
that the embroidery
of the Fabric Office is excellent.

832
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:10,159
Now I see it in person.

833
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:11,520
It’s marvelous indeed.

834
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,239
It’s my favorite peony.

835
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,760
The embroidery

836
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,439
is so realistic.

837
00:41:21,575 --> 00:41:23,520
This is made by

838
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,919
Miss Ju from the Fabric Office.

839
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,360
The material

840
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,360
was chosen by Your Highness.

841
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,879
I think

842
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,040
this dress

843
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,159
is a perfect

844
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:35,560
and marvelous piece of work!

845
00:41:38,919 --> 00:41:41,159
You know me well.

846
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:41,959
Reward him!

847
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:45,639
Thank you, Your Highness!

848
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,280
Secretary Shi, please.

849
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,450
Um.

850
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:58,550
The blind embroidery of Miss Ju

851
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,879
is amazing indeed.

852
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,120
But Shi Lin is such a sycophant.

853
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,879
He always

854
00:42:07,879 --> 00:42:09,399
fawns on people every time!

855
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,040
I’m so sick of it!

856
00:42:14,575 --> 00:42:16,120
I was out of line.

857
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:26,040
Princess Yanling loves

858
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,120
the informal clothes you made.

859
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,100
Yeah?

860
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,760
Lord Qinghai.

861
00:42:32,879 --> 00:42:34,239
Greetings to Lord Qinghai.

862
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,719
How are you doing recently, Miss Ju?

863
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
Just as usual.

864
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:41,520
I heard you’ve been

865
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,879
making Princess Yanling’s
informal clothes in a hurry.

866
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,000
You’ve been working hard.

867
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,239
That’s what I should do.

868
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:47,879
I heard

869
00:42:47,879 --> 00:42:48,600
Her Highness

870
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,159
really likes that dress,

871
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:52,080
so I’m working on another one.

872
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,560
After I finish it,

873
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,800
I will go to visit Her Highness

874
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,719
and see if she needs anything else

875
00:42:56,959 --> 00:42:58,080
so I can make for her.

876
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,600
His Majesty really cares about

877
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
the things Princess Yanling
uses and wears.

878
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:03,120
Please be more attentive.

879
00:43:04,879 --> 00:43:05,675
Yes.

880
00:43:06,919 --> 00:43:07,840
You asked me

881
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,320
to find peonies last time.

882
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:10,600
The perfume was made

883
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,700
and I took it back.

884
00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:17,040
The dealer said

885
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,879
they made it
according to the perfume formula

886
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:20,800
leaked from the palace.

887
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,560
Every spice of it was used

888
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,910
and they charged us a lot more for that.

889
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,320
Madam, smell it.

890
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,719
Does it smell right?

891
00:43:42,925 --> 00:43:44,800
I asked someone
to look into the perfume book.

892
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,679
The peony perfume in the palace

893
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:48,399
is a mixture of 14 spices,

894
00:43:48,575 --> 00:43:50,320
including dried peony stamens,

895
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,080
Pihan and Yuezhi.

896
00:43:52,399 --> 00:43:53,879
The perfume you bought

897
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:55,399
has different layers of flavors.

898
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,675
It does smell like

899
00:43:57,675 --> 00:43:59,080
it was made according to that formula.

900
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:00,425
But the informal clothes

901
00:44:00,439 --> 00:44:02,199
have been sent
to Princess Yanling’s mansion.

902
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:03,399
No hurry.

903
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,479
We can use it

904
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:06,560
after we finish the next one.

905
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:12,520
It’s Mr. Fang.

906
00:44:14,425 --> 00:44:15,120
Mr. Fang.

907
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,679
Madam.

908
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:16,399
Please.

909
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:20,199
I’ll go to prepare dinner

910
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,320
and get back soon.

911
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,040
Mr. Fang, you came at this time.

912
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,320
Have you just changed your shift?

913
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:34,995
Um.

914
00:44:34,995 --> 00:44:36,280
I just changed my shift.

915
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,080
By the way,

916
00:44:38,919 --> 00:44:40,560
there is a guard who just got back
from a visit to his family

917
00:44:40,925 --> 00:44:42,479
and brought some dates
from his hometown.

918
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:43,159
Let’s try some together

919
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,120
and see if it’s sweet or not.

920
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:45,840
It must be sweet.

921
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
You haven’t tasted it yet,

922
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:50,040
how do you know it’s sweet?

923
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:50,929
I...

924
00:44:52,879 --> 00:44:54,320
I just know it.

925
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:57,800
Come on, try it.

926
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:10,450
Um.

927
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,879
It’s really sweet.

928
00:45:13,775 --> 00:45:14,760
Go ahead and eat.

929
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,840
Have another one later.

930
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:17,679
Mr. Fang, you should eat, too.

931
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:18,300
