=Episode 32=

25
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,759
Lord,

26
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,900
something’s been bothering me.

27
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:32,250
The Wind Waker’s tactic is a puzzle.

28
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,775
He’s even faster than wind

29
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,709
and sharper than blades.

30
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:39,016
But how did he fail in the attack

31
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:41,275
on Emperor Xu at Diequan Valley?

32
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,759
Because he ran into someone

33
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,000
he shouldn’t have.

34
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,900
I don’t understand.

35
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,900
I had a brother,

36
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:49,775
called Duohan,

37
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:53,825
who went missing
at Red Plain Battlefield.

38
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,850
He resembled me a lot in appearance.

39
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,559
We were like twins.

40
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:04,794
Everyone in Huku has heard about it.

41
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,900
But what does this have to do
with the Wind Waker?

42
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,870
Is he...?

43
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:13,956
Duohan is in Dazheng?

44
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:16,800
He’s now Fang Zhuoying,
the chief apprentice

45
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,600
of Fang Jianming.

46
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:22,175
When Su Ming came to seek asylum,

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,075
Fang Zhuoying came after him to Hanzhou.

48
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:28,950
I knew when I saw him

49
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,036
that he is Duohan.

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,600
And the Wind Waker

51
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,199
once swore

52
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,000
that he’d be loyal to my mother,

53
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,026
Princess Hongyao.

54
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:45,884
No wonder he failed.

55
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:47,925
Well, if Duohan

56
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:49,960
is determined to guard Emperor Xu,

57
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:51,880
how will the Wind Waker succeed?

58
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,875
Do you know

59
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,125
that in ancient books,

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,750
there’s a more magical skill,

61
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,300
known as Heluo Alchemy.

62
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:01,880
The practicers

63
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,725
are like wearing an impregnable armor

64
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,175
that’s invulnerable to any swords.

65
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:09,786
Lord, are you referring to

66
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,189
the Alchemist?

67
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,775
If the Alchemist and the Wind Waker

68
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,580
attack Emperor Xu

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,040
and Fang Jianming on the first day

70
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,239
of next month together,

71
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,319
there’s no way they can escape.

72
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,079
Who is it?

73
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,075
Secretary, are you up?

74
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:48,100
Come in.

75
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,331
Secretary,

76
00:04:56,331 --> 00:04:58,090
shall we bring in the breakfast?

77
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,839
Burn these scraps.

78
00:05:04,975 --> 00:05:05,920
Be careful.

79
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:06,900
Yes.

80
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,725
Secretary, Miss Ju is here.

81
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:15,204
She’s picking cloth in the hall.

82
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,359
I see.

83
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:17,816
Yes.

84
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,125
This one.

85
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,150
Write it down.

86
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:23,225
Yes.

87
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:27,015
Miss Ju.

88
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,575
Excuse me, this one feels...

89
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:40,500
Thank you, Miss Ju.

90
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,625
You foolish lad!

91
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,480
How clumsy you are!

92
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,501
If Miss Ju is offended,

93
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,075
you’ll have a good flogging!

94
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:50,925
Get out!

95
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:52,075
Yes.

96
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:54,094
Uncle Shi.

97
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,470
Miss Ju,

98
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,129
you have no idea.

99
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,250
A mole was found
in the Imperial Manufactories.

100
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,600
Although

101
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,640
His Majesty punished me
with only 20 beatings

102
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,375
and a penalty of a year’s salaries

103
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,974
in view of my years’ hard work,

104
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:09,119
all other servants in the palace

105
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,158
despise me.

106
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:12,959
I have to be more careful,

107
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,079
otherwise, I would be

108
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,250
too ashamed to stay.

109
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,440
Uncle Shi, don’t worry.

110
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000
Even His Majesty has ruled

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,600
that it was just negligence.

112
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:22,875
Don’t mind the rumors.

113
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:25,650
You’re right.

114
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,930
Miss Ju, you’re quite right.

115
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,040
Which kind of fabrics

116
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,519
would you like to choose today?

117
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,399
It’s already autumn.

118
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,600
I should start to make winter clothes

119
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,200
for His Majesty and Consort Shurong.

120
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,839
So I’m here to pick

121
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,440
materials for winter clothes.

122
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,239
Miss Ju, you’re so thoughtful.

123
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:43,750
It’s good to plan ahead.

124
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,971
But you don’t have to

125
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:47,434
come personally.

126
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,359
All you need is to send a maid

127
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:50,125
and pass the word.

128
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,975
Then I’ll deliver the fabrics to you.

129
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,500
You have a lot of work.

130
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,750
I can’t give you more.

131
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,799
Come on.

132
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,050
It’s nothing.

133
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,849
Pick whatever you want.

134
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:04,399
Before you came,

135
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,150
I had selected four or five bolts.

136
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,799
Those are all I need for the time being.

137
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,591
This gentleman has taken a note.

138
00:07:10,175 --> 00:07:11,175
Good.

139
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,650
I’ll arrange for them to be delivered.

140
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:16,175
Thank you, Uncle Shi.

141
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:18,405
You’re welcome.

142
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,559
See Miss Ju out.

143
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,640
Yes.

144
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,075
Miss Ju.

145
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,089
Please.

146
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,020
Madam, you’re going to be very busy.

147
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,515
I don’t mind.

148
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:49,720
I need to do something

149
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,600
in case I bore myself to sleep.

150
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,399
Miss Ju!

151
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:54,675
Miss Ju!

152
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:55,476
Wait a moment.

153
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:56,715
Miss Ju!

154
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,999
Miss Ju!

155
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,450
Hold on.

156
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:01,825
Uncle Shi.

157
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,325
I’m glad I caught up with you.

158
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,800
I almost forgot.

159
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:09,825
Days ago, Lord Chang came to me

160
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,370
to invite you to his mansion.

161
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,950
Lord Chang?

162
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:16,575
The thing is,

163
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,279
the late Consort Nie
left some embroideries

164
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,559
for Lord Chang.

165
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,375
A while ago

166
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,640
when the servants checked them,

167
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,640
they found some laddered.

168
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,519
The embroiders of his mansion

169
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,359
are not skillful enough

170
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,640
to mend them.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,081
Lord Chang intended to invite me.

172
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,669
But as you know, Miss Ju,

173
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:35,395
I don’t know anything about embroidery.

174
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,159
So I recommended you

175
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,575
to His Highness,

176
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:41,135
who then decided

177
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,919
to invite you to his mansion

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,721
to sew

179
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,991
and mend them.

180
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,159
Since it’s Lord Chang’s invitation,

181
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,640
I cannot refuse.

182
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,039
But to mend the embroideries,

183
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,950
they have to be delivered to my office.

184
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,740
My darling, Miss Ju.

185
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:58,486
Lord Chang’s mansion has all you need.

186
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,809
You can go without anything.

187
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:02,200
Look,

188
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,640
I’ll take you there

189
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,320
as

190
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,960
my report on the completion

191
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,840
of my duty.

192
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,520
What do you think?

193
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,225
That’ll be great.

194
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,200
Thank you, Uncle Shi.

195
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,239
Miss Ju,

196
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:18,564
this way, please.

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,775
(Lord Chang’s Mansion)

198
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,479
Good day, Your Highness.

199
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:52,925
As you ordered

200
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,799
to mend Consort Nie’s embroideries,

201
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,400
I’m here

202
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,679
to send Miss Ju to your mansion.

203
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,150
So now, my work is done.

204
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:03,205
Good day, Your Highness.

205
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,599
Rise, please.

206
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:08,640
Miss Ju.

207
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,355
Thank you.

208
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,640
You’re welcome, Your Highness.

209
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,919
It’s my duty to do so.

210
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,359
Now, escort Miss Ju to
the embroidery workshop.

211
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:18,320
Make her at home

212
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,175
and show our hospitality.

213
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:21,760
Yes.

214
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,150
This way, Miss Ju.

215
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,679
Secretary Shi.

216
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,425
Come with me.

217
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,150
Mr. Fang.

218
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,550
Mhm.

219
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:12,535
- Mr. Fang.
- Mr. Fang.

220
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,675
Is Miss Ju in?

221
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:14,850
Madam is not here.

222
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,479
She went to the Imperial Manufactories
in the morning

223
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:17,500
and hasn’t come back yet.

224
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,520
Yes.

225
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,159
She should have been back

226
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,840
from the Imperial Manufactories.

227
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,575
We’ve been worried.

228
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,430
Mr. Fang.

229
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:30,275
What’s wrong with Mr. Fang?

230
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,239
Tell me.

231
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,500
How should I punish you?

232
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,450
Why should I be punished?

233
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,139
It is true that

234
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:40,910
my late mother’s embroideries ladder.

235
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,050
But I never asked or allowed you

236
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,080
to take Miss Ju

237
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,799
to my mansion to mend them.

238
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:47,700
You faked my order.

239
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,615
Shouldn’t you be punished?

240
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,211
Has Your Highness heard the saying?

241
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:55,725
By saving others, you save yourself.

242
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:57,225
I never intended

243
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:58,525
to save you.

244
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,840
What is your purpose?

245
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,830
Be frank with it.

246
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,840
I brought Miss Ju

247
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,559
to Your Highness’s mansion

248
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,725
for the first day of next month.

249
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,225
What?

250
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:20,055
The first day of next month?

251
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,479
Miss Ju ran into me

252
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,584
destroying a message.

253
00:12:27,175 --> 00:12:28,960
I couldn’t tell

254
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,760
if Miss Ju

255
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,875
had sensed anything fishy

256
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,635
or not.

257
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,099
I gave it a thought

258
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,719
and had to make an excuse

259
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:38,239
that Your Highness needed

260
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:40,160
her service at your mansion.

261
00:12:40,775 --> 00:12:42,239
Only by keeping her here

262
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,838
until the first day of next month

263
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:48,100
can we all be safe.

264
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:55,080
If Your Highness
still doesn’t understand,

265
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,119
I can give you a reminder.

266
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,559
Who did you

267
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,450
make a deal with back then?

268
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,900
You’re Duoluo’s man.

269
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:15,159
Duoluo’s man?

270
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,125
I must be a shallow man

271
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,685
to Your Highness.

272
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,960
My identity

273
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,479
is not Your Highness’s concern.

274
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,000
All Your Highness needs to know

275
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,880
is that I’m here to help.

276
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,799
You have a lot of nerve

277
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:30,000
to bring her to my mansion

278
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,400
and refuse to share your identity.

279
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:34,355
The fact that you didn’t expose me

280
00:13:34,475 --> 00:13:35,640
convinced me that you know

281
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,999
it’s good for everyone

282
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,080
to continue the show.

283
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,400
Besides,

284
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,479
the throne of Dazheng

285
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:46,175
will be yours sooner or later.

286
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:49,825
And I

287
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,650
will also be your servant by then.

288
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,119
Are you trying

289
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
to drag me down with you?

290
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,559
I wouldn’t dare.

291
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,400
Either it succeeds or not,

292
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,520
I’ll be the only one involved.

293
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,400
Your Highness has nothing to do with it.

294
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,080
However,

295
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:08,919
I won’t allow

296
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,479
the blind girl

297
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,440
to ruin the big plan.

298
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:15,280
Miss Ju,

299
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,719
this Egret in Winter River

300
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:17,679
is the late Consort Nie’s

301
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,038
favorite piece of embroidery.

302
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:20,719
Due to the chaos of war,

303
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,950
it ladders

304
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,400
in several places.

305
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,559
We’d like your instruction

306
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,225
in mending it.

307
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:32,479
Do you have the needle and thread?

308
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,800
Yes.

309
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,919
Let’s do it.

310
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,750
Yes.

311
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,400
Mr. Fang.

312
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:02,880
Have you found her?

313
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,159
According to sentries

314
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,225
outside the Imperial Manufactories,

315
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,450
Miss Ju was on her way

316
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,599
back to Fabric Office.

317
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:08,559
But for some reason,

318
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,100
Miss Ju left

319
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,059
with Secretary Shi.

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,840
Secretary Shi?

321
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,000
Mr. Fang,

322
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,200
guards at the gate of the palace saw

323
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,159
Miss Ju and Secretary Shi

324
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,239
leave the palace together.

325
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,039
They heard them

326
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,250
talking about going to

327
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,300
Lord Chang’s Mansion.

328
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,500
Lord,

329
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
the books you ordered

330
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,559
to be shifted
from your mansion’s library

331
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,650
at Liushang

332
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,159
have been delivered here.

333
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,360
Take them to my study

334
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,136
in Zhaoming Palace.

335
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:35,559
Yes, Lord.

336
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,525
Master.

337
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,479
I patrolled around the palace.

338
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:53,425
There’s nothing unusual.

339
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,650
Master,

340
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,440
the palace security is a heavy task.

341
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,990
And you’re working so hard.

342
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
But I saw you

343
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,119
bring piles of books back.

344
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,960
Are you sure
your wound will be all right?

345
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,200
It’s almost healed.

346
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:09,119
Since you coughed blood last time,

347
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:10,900
I’ve been worried.

348
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,919
I realized something was wrong

349
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:14,679
when I heard the boom that day.

350
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,599
Great anxiety disrupted me

351
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,919
and tore the old wound open.

352
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:20,320
Are you sure?

353
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,719
I’m standing

354
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:22,719
in front of you, aren’t I?

355
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,880
Do I look ill?

356
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,559
I’m being paranoid.

357
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,950
Walk with me.

358
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,700
I’m going back to Zhaoming Palace.

359
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,679
You need to continue the patrol.

360
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,450
Yes.

361
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,575
Master.

362
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,559
I talked to Zhuoying yesterday.

363
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,960
He seemed preoccupied.

364
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,799
I’ve never

365
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,960
seen him so in the past.

366
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,400
Zhuoying.

367
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:45,200
Where are you going?

368
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,525
Master,

369
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:49,125
Zheliu was taken
to Lord Chang’s Mansion.

370
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:50,039
I’m going there.

371
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Let’s go back to Zhaoming Palace.

372
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,520
Master!

373
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,479
We’ll talk later.

374
00:16:59,239 --> 00:16:59,840
Master.

375
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,100
Zhuoying,

376
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,559
let’s talk about it.

377
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,040
You’re not alone.

378
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,100
Talk?

379
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,119
Do you know

380
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,680
the assassin Wind Waker

381
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,520
visited Lord Chang’s Mansion once?

382
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
Now the enemy is undercover,

383
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,560
but Zheliu is not.

384
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
She cannot defend herself.

385
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:13,040
If Lord Chang is planning something...

386
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,400
Move!

387
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,000
I have to...

388
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,650
Zhuoying!

389
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,350
You...

390
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,400
I forbid it!

391
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,199
Master.

392
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,920
Do you know the current situation

393
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
and your identity?

394
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,439
If you don’t care
about alerting the enemy

395
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:26,600
by your reckless move

396
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,119
that could endanger Zheliu,

397
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,959
go ahead.

398
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,119
- But...
- Alright, Zhuoying.

399
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,319
Master has made a good point.

400
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,719
Even if Lord Chang is rebellious,

401
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,239
he won’t hurt Zheliu

402
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,479
in his own mansion.

403
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,319
But your presence, on the contrary,

404
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,839
would put Zheliu in danger.

405
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,825
Master,

406
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,425
what do you say

407
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,839
we should do then?

408
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,880
It’s quite unexpected.

409
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,400
Let’s find out what Lord Chang is up to.

410
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,119
Zhuoying,

411
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,040
I have a plan

412
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,239
which won’t make Lord Chang suspicious

413
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,359
and will take Zheliu back

414
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,760
safe and sound.

415
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,719
Don’t worry.

416
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:00,760
I’ve never broken

417
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,800
a promise to you.

418
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,719
But I need some time.

419
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:05,680
No reckless moves before that.

420
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,975
Wait for my news.

421
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,325
Shaozi.

422
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,400
Young Master Haishi.

423
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:26,900
Well,

424
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,280
is something wrong?

425
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:30,239
No, not at all.

426
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,000
Shaozi,

427
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,199
I’m here to see His Majesty.

428
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,400
To see His Majesty?

429
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:35,175
Oh.

430
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,160
Mr. Fang Haishi!

431
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,040
Mr. Fang Haishi!

432
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,600
Oh...

433
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:02,000
Good evening, Your Majesty.

434
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,475
Your Majesty.

435
00:19:13,225 --> 00:19:13,920
I...

436
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,719
can smell the pastries.

437
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,750
Fang Jianming has a lot of nerve.

438
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,400
Master never told me anything.

439
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,959
I happened to see Your Majesty’s hint

440
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,560
to Master

441
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,719
on the day you were attacked.

442
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,079
So I guess

443
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:51,719
maybe Your Majesty and Master

444
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,680
have a plan.

445
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,000
And Your Majesty

446
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,920
isn’t heavily wounded

447
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,479
and unconscious as we see.

448
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:01,350
You may rise.

449
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

450
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,300
Fang Haishi.

451
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,479
Are you a mouse?

452
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,140
Nothing misses your eyes.

453
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:17,725
Tell me.

454
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:20,126
What are you asking for this time?

455
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,425
I wouldn’t dare.

456
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:22,800
- I’m just...
- You wouldn’t dare?

457
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,079
I know how bold you are.

458
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,479
You’re fearless.

459
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:28,100
You came

460
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,460
every time with requests, didn’t you?

461
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And it’s weird

462
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,310
that I granted all of them.

463
00:20:36,459 --> 00:20:38,000
Have I been possessed?

464
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,800
Your Majesty

465
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,319
has a big heart

466
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,575
for every one of your subjects.

467
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,719
Not for a second have I

468
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:46,250
forgotten Your Majesty’s grace.

469
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,079
But this time,

470
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,839
I do have a request to make.

471
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,640
But it’s not for myself.

472
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:56,750
I would like to ask Your Majesty

473
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,800
to grant Zhuoying

474
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,119
and Miss Ju’s marriage.

475
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,680
Miss Ju?

476
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,139
Fang Zhuoying and Miss Ju are in love?

477
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,100
My Imperial Corps Commander

478
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,680
and the manager of Fabric Office

479
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,719
are having an affair.

480
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,700
What a disgrace!

481
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,200
Zhuoying and Miss Ju

482
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,239
love each other,

483
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,760
but they’ve never done anything

484
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,599
unethical.

485
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,479
Please forgive them.

486
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,760
If they love each other,

487
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,040
why did you come instead

488
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:26,079
to disturb your emperor at late night

489
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,199
who is supposed to be heavily wounded?

490
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:30,839
I can’t

491
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,000
tell you why.

492
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:37,775
Fine.

493
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:40,839
It’s time for me to come out

494
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,000
of my coma.

495
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:43,736
I’ll give the edict now

496
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,980
to grant their marriage.

497
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

498
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,439
Your Highness,

499
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,000
messengers from the palace are here,

500
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,750
saying that His Majesty gave an edict

501
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,119
to the Fabric Office

502
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,800
and required Miss Ju to accept it.

503
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:13,875
Oh?

504
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,839
So early?

505
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,640
According to the messengers,

506
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,680
the edict was delivered last night.

507
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,160
So they came to pick her up

508
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,920
early in the morning.

509
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,800
Has there been anything unusual

510
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:28,275
since last night?

511
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,800
I had someone watching secretly.

512
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:34,079
Miss Ju has been
mending the embroideries

513
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,359
calmly

514
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,719
and never showed the slightest

515
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:37,800
panic or mistake.

516
00:22:43,675 --> 00:22:44,525
Your Highness,

517
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,640
the embroideries are mended.

518
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,119
There’s an edict.

519
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,275
If we continue to keep her here,

520
00:22:51,275 --> 00:22:52,875
people will feel suspicious.

521
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,959
That’s true.

522
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,680
It’s not my business anyway.

523
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:04,439
Why should I take the risk?

524
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:31,050
Miss Ju, take care.

525
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,439
Thank you.

526
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,901
Master.

527
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,509
Master.

528
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,239
Haishi is standing guard
at Jincheng Palace.

529
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,239
Calm down.

530
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,900
Lord,

531
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:21,656
Miss Ju has left Lord Chang’s Mansion.

532
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,920
She’s on her way back to the palace.

533
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,000
If everything goes well,

534
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,040
she can arrive at Fabric Office

535
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,319
in an hour.

536
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,920
Alright. You may leave.

537
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,800
Thank you, Master,

538
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:33,599
for allowing Haishi
to go to His Majesty.

539
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,239
Master,

540
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,520
may I be excused?

541
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,319
Where are you going?

542
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:37,920
I...

543
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:39,439
I have a job for you.

544
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,880
Go to Huixian Restaurant
in the west of the city

545
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,640
and buy a jar of Three Flowers Spirits

546
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,599
made from lychees.

547
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,760
Master.

548
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,625
Yes.

549
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,275
Zhuoying,

550
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:57,550
make no delay.

551
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,079
Alright.

552
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,359
Then you might have a chance

553
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:09,520
to see her one last time.

554
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:35,055
Why is no one here?

555
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,119
You were only gone for one day

556
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,250
and the girls

557
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,479
have deserted their job

558
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:40,400
for fun.

559
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,341
It’s Lord Qinghai.

560
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,025
Lord Qinghai.

561
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,800
In a few days, the pomegranate tree

562
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:02,520
will begin to bear fruits, right?

563
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,760
This is an ornamental tree.

564
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,839
It produces profuse blossoms

565
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,150
but no fruits.

566
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:10,825
Even if it does,

567
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,871
there won’t be any seeds in the fruits.

568
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,319
What a shame that those flaming blossoms

569
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,880
spend their summer in vain!

570
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,275
Zhuoying’s life is in danger

571
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,625
as we’re speaking.

572
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:35,680
He’s the youngest son

573
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,925
of the King of Huku
and Princess Hongyao.

574
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:41,280
The spitting image

575
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,439
of the Lord of Left Pudun alone

576
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,199
makes him an eligible successor
to the throne.

577
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,400
But there are people in the court

578
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,880
who collude with his brother,

579
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,719
Lord of Left Pudun.

580
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,319
They intend to reveal his identity

581
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,400
so that His Majesty
will get rid of him for them.

582
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,150
I tried to persuade Zhuoying

583
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,280
to go back to Hanzhou

584
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,599
and seek his uncle’s support.

585
00:27:09,675 --> 00:27:11,700
But he’s an affectionate man.

586
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,319
He told me

587
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:17,695
he wouldn’t go

588
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:19,775
without you.

589
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:25,975
But the journey is going to be perilous.

590
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,599
Even though he’s an excellent fighter,

591
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,389
he can barely protect himself.

592
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,000
He has concerns.

593
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,280
I’m afraid he won’t survive it.

594
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,450
Concerns?

595
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,680
If something or someone is
holding him back,

596
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:53,079
he will waver.

597
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,800
Lord Qinghai,

598
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,160
I know what to do.

599
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,825
Do you really?

600
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,229
Please send my word to him.

601
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:29,050
If he doesn’t try his best
to stay alive,

602
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,891
my death

603
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,850
will be meaningless.

604
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,500
This potion works fast,

605
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,071
but it won’t cause any pain.

606
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:07,760
It’ll be like having a dream.

607
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,575
Aunt Su.

608
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,959
You heard it, didn’t you?

609
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,450
Don’t worry.

610
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,760
I won’t get you involved.

611
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,359
There’s no one around now.

612
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,479
You should go.

613
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,520
Madam,

614
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,875
your eyes can’t see.

615
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:03,800
And I’m all alone.

616
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,425
Where else can I go?

617
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:08,599
I’d rather go with you

618
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,560
and be your eyes.

619
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,825
(Huixian Restaurant)

620
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,650
Sir, your change.

621
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:45,520
- Alright.
- Thanks for coming.

622
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,199
Sure.

623
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:47,439
You’re always welcome.

624
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:47,880
Alright.

625
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,375
Waiter.

626
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:48,920
Yes?

627
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,599
I want a jar

628
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,560
of Three Flowers Spirits
made from lychees.

629
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,625
Sorry, sir,

630
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,079
all the spirits we made

631
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,040
are sold out today.

632
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,040
How about something else?

633
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:58,040
I have a jar

634
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,550
of Three Flowers Spirits
made from lychees.

635
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,400
Would you like

636
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,199
to try it, sir?

637
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:18,225
Miss,

638
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:19,880
can you give this...?

639
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,959
Take a seat, please.

640
00:31:29,475 --> 00:31:30,719
Duohanersa.

641
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,000
Are you a Duoluo’s follower?

642
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,359
The Lord of Left Pudun wishes you

643
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,239
dead.

644
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,599
Why would he have someone
search for you?

645
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,040
The Lord of Right Pudun ordered us

646
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,425
to pick you up here.

647
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:53,079
Uncle Earlji?

648
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,239
Sealed in the mud of this jar

649
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:58,366
is a map of our sanctuaries

650
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,479
where you can change horses.

651
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,079
Make sure

652
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:02,160
you come to Mohe Pass

653
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,400
by mid-September.

654
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,839
You’ll meet an escort outside the pass.

655
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:08,479
Go back to Huku via Jiaman main roads.

656
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,599
It’s such a pleasure to meet you, sir.

657
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:15,000
Please take this jar of spirits.

658
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,400
Thank you for your kindness.

659
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,520
But I insist on paying for it.

660
00:32:22,225 --> 00:32:22,750
(Three Flowers Spirits)

661
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,640
It’s worth it.

662
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:02,875
Forgive us, Madam.

663
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,680
May you rest in peace.

664
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,119
It’s almost time.

665
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:36,479
Drop the spirits and I can go
to see Zheliu.

666
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,675
(Three Flowers Spirits)

667
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:48,119
Zhuoying,

668
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,050
you’re back.

669
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,450
Haishi,

670
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,160
I’ll thank you when I get back.

671
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,479
Are you going to the Fabric Office?

672
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:54,800
There’s

673
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,439
a pleasant surprise waiting for you.

674
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,239
You’re going to be exuberant.

675
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,479
Fang Zhuoying, slow down.

676
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,880
Why is the gate locked?

677
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,900
Where’s Miss Zheliu?

678
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:31,600
It is a great virtue
to bridge a marriage.

679
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:34,840
Imperial Corps Commander, Fang Zhuoying,

680
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,719
is a young man of great strength

681
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,080
and unmarried.

682
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,840
The Manager of Fabric Office, Ju Zheliu,

683
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,800
is a respectful and virtuous lady.

684
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,399
They’re a good match.

685
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,360
I hereby grant a wedding

686
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,199
for the happy couple.

687
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:54,719
All rituals follow
those of level 3 officials’

688
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:57,120
and shall be performed on a jubilant day

689
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,600
to my delight.

May I

696
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,239
be your friend?

697
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,360
Mr. Fang, you are

698
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,239
certainly my friend.

699
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,836
Why did you say so?

700
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
In the past, I was a friend

701
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,105
who didn’t associate a lot with you.

702
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:42,050
But from this day on,

703
00:36:42,725 --> 00:36:44,165
I want to be your friend

704
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,199
who will often associate with you.

705
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,399
Then, on ordinary days,

706
00:36:49,078 --> 00:36:50,439
if you need some help,

707
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,840
I can help you.

708
00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:54,159
However small or complicated it is,

709
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,490
I won’t find it troublesome.

710
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,959
This is

711
00:36:58,075 --> 00:36:59,555
luminous thread from Yuezhou.

712
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:01,239
Is it beautiful?

713
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,000
Yes.

714
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,360
It’s as crystal

715
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,520
as the rainbow in the sky.

716
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,445
I’m sure

717
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:10,439
it’s as beautiful as you describe.

718
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:12,335
A man from Imperial Corps
back from his vacation

719
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,280
brought jujubes from home.

720
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,840
Try it and see if it’s sweet.

721
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,399
It must be sweet.

722
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,919
How could you know

723
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,800
before you even eat one?

724
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,625
I…

725
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,679
just know it is.

726
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:27,520
Here, try it.

727
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,159
So sweet.

728
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:41,639
The rainbow is hanging in the sky.

729
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,100
There’s its reflection on the lake.

730
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,639
If you concentrate,

731
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,440
you can see its reflections

732
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,275
on each dew

733
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:52,520
on the vines by the lake.

734
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,040
Well,

735
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,475
there must be a lot of puddles

736
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:56,995
on our way here.

737
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,439
Can you see the rainbow

738
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:00,520
on each of them?

739
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:01,925
Mm-hmm.

740
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,280
There are rainbows everywhere
in the palace.

741
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,159
Sadly I never paid attention to them.

742
00:38:08,775 --> 00:38:10,374
I always looked up.

743
00:38:12,575 --> 00:38:13,514

744
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,639
Mr. Fang.

If you don’t mind,

746
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,199
I’m willing to describe

767
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,879
Zhuoying.

768
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,540
It’s the 7:00 PM bell.

769
00:41:27,575 --> 00:41:28,655
I have to take my shift.

770
00:41:29,919 --> 00:41:31,050
Stay with Zheliu for me.

771
00:41:46,825 --> 00:41:48,464
It’s the first day of another month.

772
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:50,635
Yes, Your Majesty.

773
00:41:52,325 --> 00:41:53,800
During the Rebellion of Prince Yi,

774
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,199
people said that

775
00:41:55,825 --> 00:41:57,865
I was the incarnation
of the late Emperor Chu Jing.

776
00:41:58,875 --> 00:41:59,900
But my reply was,

777
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:02,125
“If anyone could

778
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:03,575
ask Emperor Chu Jing,

779
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:05,300
he would find

780
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,840
the emperor didn’t want to have
another life.

781
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,679
There’s nothing new

782
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:12,479
about all the fun.

783
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,830
It’s just like a snow cave.”

784
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,080
The country is stable

785
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
thanks to Your Majesty’s ruling.

786
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:20,040
This is what we expect

787
00:42:20,275 --> 00:42:21,235
from the Chosen Ruler.

788
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,325
The Chosen Ruler.

789
00:42:25,025 --> 00:42:25,866
In my opinion,

790
00:42:26,439 --> 00:42:28,199
it’s like an exquisite golden cage.

791
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,769
They want to contain me

792
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,679
like a caged oriole,

793
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,080
and even wish

794
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:37,300
I could please them with my songs.

795
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,000
Zhuoying,

796
00:42:40,919 --> 00:42:41,679
what do you think?

797
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,199
Some people wish me

798
00:42:49,325 --> 00:42:50,886
longevity.

799
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,175
Others hope

800
00:42:53,175 --> 00:42:54,650
I’d drop down dead right now.

801
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,691
The latter will never stop,

802
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:03,400
and their attempts will never cease.
