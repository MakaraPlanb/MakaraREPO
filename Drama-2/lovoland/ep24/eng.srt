(Tianqi)

26
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,360
Greetings, Lord Qinghai.

27
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,120
Knowing that General Tang is setting out
to Huangquan Pass today,

28
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,160
His Majesty ordered me

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,640
to see you off on his behalf.

30
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,320
(Tianqi)
Thanks for His Majesty’s favor.

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,880
It’s a long way there.

32
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
A frontier stronghold
means heavy responsibilities

33
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,360
and tough work ahead.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,960
All of you must take care.

35
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
General Tang.

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,040
Brothers.

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,240
Take care.

38
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,760
We will.

39
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,280
- We will.
- We will.

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,800
Mr. Fang,

41
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,680
do fulfil your duty scrupulously
in the Palace

42
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,600
and live up to

43
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,360
His Majesty’s sincerity.

44
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,120
I surely will.

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,880
As soon as the secondment is over,

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,320
I’ll be right back to Huangquan Pass.

47
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,680
We’ll meet again there.

48
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,280
Lord Qinghai.

49
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,680
Thanks a lot for seeing us off,

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,000
but I guess it’s time to farewell.

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,800
Farewell.

52
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,760
Farewell.

53
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,040
Let’s go.

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,720
Lord Qinghai.

55
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
My job is done.

56
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,240
Excuse me.

57
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,160
Shaozi.

58
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,560
He insists on staying in the capital.

59
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,520
Make sure nothing goes wrong
on his side.

60
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,200
Understood.

61
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,320
Peony!

62
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Seven,

63
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,000
after so many years,

64
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,920
you have grown so tall.

65
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,080
Sister,

66
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,520
I am a grown-up now.

67
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,480
Peony.

68
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,640
I remember back then

69
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,280
when we played chess,

70
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,800
I lost a hairpin to you.

71
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,960
So many years have passed,

72
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,240
considering interest upon interest,

73
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,240
I guess

74
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,000
I owe you a room of hairpins now.

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,760
Now that you are back,

76
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,240
I’m going to repay you well.

77
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

78
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

79
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,080
Announcing an imperial edict.

80
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,760
Considering Linlang, daughter of
the late emperor and Consort Nie,

81
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,320
who is visiting the emperor,

82
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,640
is still beautiful

83
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,840
and charming as she used to be,

84
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,520
I entitle Chu Linlang

85
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,560
Princess Yanling,

86
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,640
and grant her a mansion

87
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,200
inside Tianqi City,

88
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,720
about one million hectoliters of grain,

89
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,720
five hundred servants

90
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,320
and a collection of jewelry and jades.

91
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,320
Respect this.

92
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,320
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.

93
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,640
Long live Your Majesty.

94
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
Long live!

95
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,760
His Majesty made the decision

96
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,760
a little too hastily.

97
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,320
That’s right.

98
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,400
It’s been so many years.

99
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,920
His Majesty
may not remember exactly.

100
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,000
Brother,

101
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,120
back then at Zichen Hall,

102
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,280
I noticed

103
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,600
how the officials looked.

104
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,520
Just as we had expected,

105
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,520
they looked worried.

106
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,200
So, what do you say

107
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,160
about

108
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,760
whether she’s really Peony?

109
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,480
My sister has been away for so long.

110
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,880
To be frank,

111
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
my memories of her

112
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,680
have become a little hazy.

113
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,520
But there’s one little thing

114
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,440
I often recall.

115
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,160
My sister loves peonies the most.

116
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,880
When we were little, she often asked me

117
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,400
to pick peonies to decorate
Father’s study with her.

118
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,880
The way she looked

119
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,600
when she walked to me with a basket

120
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,600
was just like before.

121
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,600
I have no reason to doubt her.

122
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,680
Now that you have your answer,

123
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,440
why would you still care about
what others think?

124
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,040
Jichang,

125
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,160
you’ve got another place to go.

126
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,640
Are you happy with that?

127
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,240
Of course!

128
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,840
Even happier than

129
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,720
getting a rare treasure!

130
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,760
Remember this.

131
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,120
You

132
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,080
are my only brother.

133
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,680
Whatever you want,

134
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,960
I will get it for you.

135
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:05,240
(Princess’s Mansion)

136
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,760
Your Highness,

137
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,800
we have arrived.

138
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,120
Be careful.

139
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

140
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,440
(Princess’s Mansion)

141
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,200
(Magnificent and Glittering)

142
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,440
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

143
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,080
Greetings, Your Highness.

144
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,840
You may leave.

145
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,040
Yes.

146
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,880
Lord Chang seeks a meeting.

147
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,680
Lord Chang seeks a meeting.

148
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,560
Invite him in.

149
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,440
Seven.

150
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
- What brings you here?
- Peony.

151
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,560
- Be quick!
- Greetings, Lord Chang.

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,920
No need to stand on ceremony!

153
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,320
Peony.

154
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,600
It’s your first day to move here.

155
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,120
How can I not pay you a visit?

156
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,000
I’m here to congratulate you.

157
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,800
You’re so considerate,

158
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,320
but I’m not short of these.

159
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,480
Keep them yourself.

160
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,080
Well,

161
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,440
how can a person

162
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,200
take back his gifts?

163
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,680
I know that

164
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,320
these vulgar things

165
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,240
have no attraction for you.

166
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,880
You only love peonies.

167
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,840
In fact, I’m working on

168
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,280
finding the best peonies in the world

169
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,160
for you.

170
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
I’m glad that

171
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,240
you still remember my likes.

172
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,240
Come. Sit.

173
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,320
Peony,

174
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,600
when we parted,

175
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,320
I thought we would never meet again.

176
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,600
Now we have met again.

177
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,080
I feel

178
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,960
really happy
from the bottom of my heart.

179
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,000
Seven,

180
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
I know very well

181
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,600
that you care for me.

182
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,640
But you’re a grown-up now.

183
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,240
You can’t just indulge in playing.

184
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,160
You should focus more on reading

185
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,320
and be a good assistant to our brother.

186
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,320
But I’ve always been hating

187
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,680
the so-called official career.

188
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,560
Reading once in a while will do.

189
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,440
So, tell me,

190
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,240
among all the peonies across the world,

191
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,040
which breed is your favorite?

192
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,360
I will get it for you.

193
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,240
You and Lord are apprentice and master,

194
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,520
just like flesh and blood.

195
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,840
Even if you got into a temper,

196
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,120
you should apologize

197
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,760
and say something nice.

198
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,720
Young Master Haishi,

199
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,720
if I were you,

200
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,800
before I went to work in the Palace
for the first day,

201
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,280
I would definitely greet Lord.

202
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,960
In fact, he...

203
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,520
I’ve said too much.

204
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,160
Young Master Haishi,

205
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,400
the procedures of your secondment

206
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,440
have been completed.

207
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,240
This is your pass.

208
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,440
(Imperial Guard)

209
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,200
Thanks, Shaozi.

210
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,240
Go greet Lord, will you?

211
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,400
What is it?

212
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,080
Apology.

213
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,080
No need.

214
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,240
It was indeed my fault

215
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,400
for asking the secondment
from His Majesty in private.

216
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,120
Since His Majesty has agreed,

217
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,520
you will show up

218
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,840
in the Palace more often.

219
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,040
As for what to do

220
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,320
and what not to do,

221
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,720
you should be cautious.

222
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,120
I will.

223
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Anything else?

224
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,760
No.

225
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,360
Excuse me, Lord.

226
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,360
What?

227
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,280
Since when did you

228
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,120
no longer call me Master?

229
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Excuse me, Master.

230
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,640
Do you have anything to add, Master?

231
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Tonight, His Majesty

232
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,480
will give a banquet
for Princess Yanling.

233
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,920
I won’t make it.

234
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,480
You and Zhuoying must be extra careful

235
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,320
in front of the emperor.

236
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,080
Yes.

237
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,960
Your Majesty,

238
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,200
Dazheng and Zhunian
are only a water area away.

239
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,320
In Leizhou, there is Tuhuolu,

240
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,880
Nihualuo and other states.

241
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,640
The channel is wide.

242
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,120
Please be cautious

243
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,080
about having trade relations.

244
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
Your Majesty,

245
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,960
non-governmental trade relations
may be mature.

246
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
However, the only time of the year

247
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,000
when there are ships

248
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,520
is when it’s calm.

249
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,120
If the trade relations
are between states,

250
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,400
treaties will have to be made.

251
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,800
All parties will be responsible
for the ships.

252
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,040
As for the fluxes
and refluxes of the tides

253
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
and the damages caused by storms,

254
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,160
more negotiations will be needed.

255
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,000
Jichang,

256
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,160
what do you say?

257
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,080
Answer me,

258
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,040
what were you thinking?

259
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,120
Your Majesty,

260
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,840
I...

261
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,600
I was thinking

262
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,800
about tonight’s banquet.

263
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,880
The banquet is specially prepared

264
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,640
for Peony by Your Majesty.

265
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,080
Maybe for the first eight cold dishes,

266
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,840
we can use peonies carved from radish

267
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,880
to decorate them.

268
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,880
Since the princess was back,

269
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,360
she has paid

270
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,840
almost every visit

271
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,600
that’s needed.

272
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,160
Except for Yu’an Palace,

273
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,160
given that Consort Shurong is ill,

274
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,920
the princess hasn’t visited her.

275
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,640
She hasn’t been summoned for a while.

276
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,880
I wonder

277
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,120
how she is now.

278
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,320
Thanks to Your Majesty,

279
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,800
Consort Shurong can

280
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,080
go to Qingquan Palace

281
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,720
to use the bathing pool there every day.

282
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,440
Physician Li told me

283
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,440
her condition got better.

284
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,400
Her illness is quite severe.

285
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,440
If I’m not mistaken,

286
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,720
she’s been ill for quite a while.

287
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,000
But she’s still not cured.

288
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,320
Is her illness so hard to cure?

289
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,080
Perhaps

290
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,080
it’s not an ordinary illness.

291
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,160
She’s too stubborn.

292
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,560
Even when she was taking cold medicine

293
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,640
and being badly ill,

294
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,400
she still kept silent.

295
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,640
She’s too stubborn!

296
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,920
She deserves the sufferings!

297
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,000
Invite her to the dinner.

298
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,360
Otherwise, others may

299
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,800
think I’m mean to her.

300
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

301
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,760
Good news, Your Highness.

302
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,560
On my way to the Storehouse,

303
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,720
I heard

304
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
really good news.

305
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,480
What is it?

306
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,760
Mr. Fang Haishi has been
transferred temporarily

307
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,560
to the Imperial Guards
from Huangquan Battalion.

308
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,599
He is now awe-inspiring.

309
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,040
Due to the banquet His Majesty

310
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,200
prepared for the princess,

311
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,280
now all the imperial guards

312
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,920
are under his command.

313
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,880
Good for him.

314
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,720
Now that Mr. Fang Haishi
is in the Palace,

315
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,560
sooner or later,

316
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,720
Your Highness and he

317
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,400
will have a chance to see each other.

318
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,280
Rather than look forward to seeing him,

319
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,320
it would be better

320
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,480
to look forward to not seeing him.

321
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,360
Mr. Fang Haishi is a decent man.

322
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,000
He regards me as a friend.

323
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,760
I don’t want

324
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,680
his reputation to be ruined

325
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,080
because of me.

326
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
What’s worse,

327
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,000
he could be punished by His Majesty.

328
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,240
Consort Shurong

329
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,560
at Yu’an Palace,
here’s the imperial edict.

330
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,920
As His Majesty decreed,

331
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,520
given that Consort Shurong
conducts herself sedately

332
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,120
and is of an outstanding beauty,

333
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,440
she’s granted

334
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,280
a coat with valuable feathers and gold,

335
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,840
a gold crown,

336
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,920
a hairpin made of agate and gold,

337
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,480
a pair of earrings made of
colored glaze and gold

338
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,800
and a box of imperial dendrobium.

339
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,920
What’s more,

340
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,280
tonight at 7:00 PM,

341
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,040
(Imperial Edict)
attend the banquet at Zichen Hall.

342
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,920
Respect this.

343
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,200
Consort Shurong,

344
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,760
what are you waiting for?

345
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

346
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,160
(Dendrobium)
This box of dendrobium

347
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,000
is rare even in the Palace.

348
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,040
How are you doing

349
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
with your new job?

350
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,640
Master isn’t here?

351
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:09,960
He’s occupied.

352
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,480
Zhuoying,

353
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,080
I’ll guard near the emperor.

354
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,320
You go check the periphery.

355
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,440
If anything goes wrong,

356
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,040
just come to find me.

357
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,440
Rest assured.

358
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,400
Your Majesty.

359
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,560
The emperor has arrived.

360
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,640
Long Live Your Majesty.

361
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,080
Rise.

362
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,240
The song is interesting, isn’t it?

372
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,920
Yes.

373
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,640
I hate people echo me.

374
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,240
No, I didn’t.

375
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,880
Then tell me,

376
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,880
how interesting is the song exactly?

377
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,040
In this song, Crested Ibis,

378
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,520
the man who wanted to

379
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,040
offer advice to the emperor

380
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
was likened to a crested ibis
which feeds on fish.

381
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,440
When a crested ibis eats a fish,

382
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,880
it eats it but then spits it out.

383
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,280
So, for the one who wants to talk,

384
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,040
would he

385
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,840
tell the emperor the truth

386
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,360
or keep the truth

387
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,880
within himself?

388
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,760
So, did you tell me

389
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,520
the truth

390
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,160
or the lie?

391
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,200
I dare not lie to Your Majesty.

392
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,240
I only speak truth.

393
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,200
At least for now,
you dare not lie to me.

394
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,400
But when you disguised as your sister

395
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,360
and addressed me by my name,

396
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,240
why didn’t you have

397
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,600
such awareness?

398
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,960
I dare not.

399
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,200
Don’t be scared.

400
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,280
I never expect

401
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,920
much from you.

402
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,720
So, you don’t need to disguise

403
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,720
as a dignified person.

404
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,080
The show is over.

405
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,200
I suggest

406
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,400
to celebrate for the princess
coming back safe and sound.

407
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,840
Let’s have a toast.

408
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,960
- Come on, cheers.
- Cheers.

409
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,000
Brother, thanks to your mercy

410
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,840
and concern for your sister,

411
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,400
I can still be standing here.

412
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,760
So, my toast.

413
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,640
Wish Dazheng a long life

414
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,680
and you constant happiness.

415
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,800
Liquor keeps out the cold.

416
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,080
You should drink more.

417
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,480
Yes.

418
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,520
Now I envy Consort Shurong.

419
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,360
Though with others all around,

420
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,720
His Majesty only has you

421
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,000
in his eyes.

422
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,720
He really loves you dearly.

423
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,920
I’m flattered, Your Highness.

424
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,720
I do love her dearly.

425
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,320
Otherwise, I would fail to live up

426
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,280
to her true love for me.

427
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,600
Am I right?

428
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,360
Yes.

429
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,440
Peony,

430
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,320
I’ve prepared you a gift.

431
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,560
See if you like it.

432
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,080
Another gift?

433
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,560
Peony of jade color

434
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,280
is one of the rarest peonies.

435
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,240
Seven, I didn’t expect

436
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,320
you could carve jade into a peony,

437
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,920
which is so vivid and lifelike.

438
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,880
I’m glad you like it.

439
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,000
Your Majesty,

440
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,760
I want to get changed.

441
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,040
Excuse me.

442
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,680
Go ahead.

443
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,040
Come back right after you get changed.

444
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
Yes.

445
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,360
Drink.

446
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,080
Your Highness,

447
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,200
are you all right?

448
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,080
Mr. Fang Haishi.

449
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,800
Consort Shurong,

450
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,600
is this the place where you get changed?

451
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,040
Your...

452
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,720
Mr. Fang Haishi,

453
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,000
you can’t go any further.

454
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,720
Just wait here.

455
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,120
His Majesty seems to be drunk.

456
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,720
You’d better go take a look.

457
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,240
Well,

458
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,840
that’s not your concern.

459
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,240
Just be at ease

460
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,440
and stand by here.

461
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,040
If we went in now,

462
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,560
even if we had a dozen of heads,

463
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,400
it would not be enough
to be chopped off.

464
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,960
That makes sense.

465
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,840
There are thick clouds

466
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,080
in the sky.

467
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,760
There may be rain.

468
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,200
Maybe.

469
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,000
The weather

470
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,040
is changeable.

471
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,080
- Your Majesty...
- Be quiet.

472
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,160
There are people out there in the yard,

473
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,640
and Fang Haishi is just nearby.

474
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
Inside here,

475
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,040
any sound we make

476
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,040
will be heard.

477
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,600
You can’t do this, Your Majesty.

478
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,840
You can’t do this!

479
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,600
Zizan is watching.

480
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,320
What did you say?

481
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,280
I said, you can’t do this.

482
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
Zizan is watching from heaven.

483
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,880
This is not the first time

484
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
you use her as an excuse!

485
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,320
Do you really think

486
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,760
I won’t kill you

487
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,360
just because you’re her family?

488
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,120
I dare not use her as an excuse.

489
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,880
I just feel sorry for myself.

490
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,240
Losing the one you love forever
is unfortunate.

491
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,640
But Your Majesty, what you’re doing

492
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,360
is unfair to me!

493
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,080
Why are you so cruel to me?

494
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,360
Unfair?

495
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,160
What a perfect excuse!

496
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,560
Losing the one I love forever...

497
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,640
I do not doubt that

498
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,520
I never did any cruel thing to others!

499
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,760
But why me?

500
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,920
Why me?

501
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,760
It’s fate.

502
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,440
Fate...

503
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,000
Flowers in a mirror
or the moon in the water.

504
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,240
They’re all illusions in the end.

505
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,480
The best things
are always the most fragile.

506
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,760
You mean

507
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,640
it’s my fate?

508
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,600
Since I was born,

509
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,920
I’ve been like duckweed,

510
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,240
being buffeted by wind and rain.

511
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,800
Whenever I felt desperate,

512
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,480
I just thought

513
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,280
it was just fate.

514
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,720
Then I endured the pain,

515
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,480
and life went on.

516
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,040
Don’t be hard on yourself.

517
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,440
Don’t cry.

518
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,760
They’re all in the past.

519
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,560
Mr. Fang Haishi.

520
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,760
See?

521
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,200
What did I say?

522
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,440
The weather is changeable.

523
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,640
Mu Deqing!

524
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,240
Your Majesty!

525
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,040
It’s an emergency!

526
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,880
Summon the physician!

527
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,920
It’s uterine bleeding!

528
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,200
Take her to the Imperial Hospital!

529
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,160
Well...

530
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,160
Your Majesty!

531
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,320
Be careful, Your Majesty!

532
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,440
Your Majesty!

533
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,880
What to do now?

534
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,280
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

535
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,600
Can she be cured or not?

536
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,239
Just

537
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,920
tell me the truth!

538
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,360
Your Majesty.

539
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,639
Consort Shurong suffers from
endogenous cold

540
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,960
and stasis
of both vital energy and blood.

541
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,880
If she had taken the medicine

542
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,080
which I prescribed for her earlier,

543
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,040
she should’ve gradually recovered.

544
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,760
But judging by her pulse condition,

545
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,320
it seemed

546
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,679
that she didn’t take any medicine,

547
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,639
Your Majesty!

548
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,280
Why did you do that?

549
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,080
I understand

550
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,199
that I remind you of your loss.

551
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,520
This is

552
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,040
better.

553
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,000
Listen,

554
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,040
if you can’t save her,

555
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,920
I’ll make all of you grave goods!

556
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,920
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

557
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,840
Please calm down!

558
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,800
Your Majesty.

559
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,680
To cure uterine bleeding,

560
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,400
I know a folk prescription,

561
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,440
but...

562
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,160
the efficacy-enhancer is a thorny issue.

563
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,160
Go on!

564
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,920
Whether it’s bear heart
or leopard gall bladder,

565
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,200
you must get it!

566
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,320
I request Your Majesty

567
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,920
to find me

568
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,880
a clean dagger

569
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,960
and a bowl.

570
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,320
Go!

571
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,040
Go get

572
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,360
the things Mr. Fang needs!

573
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,720
Go!

574
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,560
What are you waiting for?

575
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,160
Yes.

576
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

577
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,400
Hurry! Go!

578
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,280
- Hurry up.
- Let’s go.

579
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,480
Since the rebellion of Prince Yi,

580
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,800
I haven’t

581
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,920
got the chance to dine with you

582
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,720
and Zhongxu for so long.

583
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,520
The dinner is good.

584
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,720
It’s just that

585
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,720
His Majesty left too early.

586
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,920
Or it would be more lively.

587
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,360
His Majesty left

588
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,520
together with Consort Shurong.

589
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,280
On this romantic night,

590
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,960
we are doing them a favor.

591
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,560
You are right, Peony.

592
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,520
If there are more kids in the Palace,

593
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,680
it would be more lively.

594
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,960
And I

595
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,920
have been waiting to be an uncle.

596
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,640
However, Consort Shurong

597
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,960
seems to be in a bad condition.

598
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,840
At the banquet,

599
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,320
she looked unwell.

600
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,040
Is there anything wrong with her?

601
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,640
I have no idea.

602
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,840
And that’s not what I’m concerned about.

603
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,480
Now I’m only concerned about

604
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,280
how to hatch the best hawk

605
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,760
and how I can find

606
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,000
the best flower seed and plant for you.

607
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,400
Silly boy.

608
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,440
(Fabric Office)

609
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,640
Mr. Fang.

610
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,720
I’m almost done.

611
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,600
Just a minute.

612
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
It’s late.

613
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,800
If you are not in a rush,

614
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,520
why don’t you call it a day?

615
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,800
I am blind now.

616
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,160
Whether it’s daytime or nighttime

617
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,920
makes no difference to me.

618
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,480
I heard that

619
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,080
His Majesty gave a banquet
at Zichen Hall.

620
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,320
You were on duty. You must be tired.

621
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,480
Do you like it?

622
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,640
Yes.

623
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,880

624
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,080
I’ll present it to you.

625
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,160
To me?

626
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,240
Yes.

627
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,680
You embroidered the handkerchief
this late

628
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,520
just to present it to me?

629
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,240
It’s just that I didn’t come up with

630
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,600
the pattern until sunset.

631
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,920
Mr. Fang, if you like it,

632
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,520
just take it.

granted me these cakes

except for Lord Qinghai,

What?

696
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,920
When no one else dares to talk to me

697
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,440
for fearing to irritate me,

698
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,600
do you dare?

699
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,280
I’m being honest and sincere.

700
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,000
So, there’s nothing for me to fear.

701
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,480
It’s strange.

702
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,280
Most of the time, you and Jianming

703
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,480
are totally different.

704
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,480
But at some certain moments,

705
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,120
you are just like him.

706
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,320
Master is loyal.

707
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,400
So am I.

708
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,760
Loyal?

709
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,120
Being loyal means
being obedient as well.

710
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,440
But Jianming was intractable back then.

711
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,160
Most of the time, I was the one

712
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,840
who compromised,

713
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,880
instead of him.

714
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,560
Gradually,

715
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,760
he changed.

716
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,120
Was Master

717
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,560
such a willful person?

718
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,920
Not “willful”.

719
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,480
He was carefree.

720
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,160
Back then, he and I

721
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,360
were both carefree.

722
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,880
We were not the loyal subject

723
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,320
or the monarch.

724
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,400
We were just two

725
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,040
best friends

726
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,640
who played together

727
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,440
and studied together.

728
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,040
About the past,

729
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,840
Master seldom mentioned.

730
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,640
Your master is not here at this moment.

731
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,080
Fang Haishi,

732
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,480
answer me

733
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,560
a question for him.

734
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,400
I will answer it truly.

735
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,280
Imagine there’s a woman

736
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,480
who is really a nice person,

737
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,320
but whenever she shows up,

738
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,240
it reminds you

739
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,160
of your cruelest memories,

740
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,600
your irreparable loss,

741
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,200
and that

742
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,960
you are no more than a walking corpse.

743
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,160
Sometimes, you want to treat her well

744
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,160
and see her happy,

745
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,320
while sometimes,

746
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,000
you can’t help hurting her

747
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,200
and making her painful as you are.

748
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:12,680
Just because of that,

749
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,040
you may never fall in love with her

750
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,480
for the rest of your life.

751
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,720
If it were you,

752
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,960
what would you do?

753
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,560
Your Majesty,

754
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,560
if it were me,

755
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,280
I would treat her well,

756
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,720
be generous to her,

757
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,160
spend every day with her,

758
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,760
treat her with courtesy

759
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,400
and sincere respect,

760
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:40,960
just like

761
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,440
what I had done to my deceased lover.

762
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,640
Why?

763
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,360
Losing my love

764
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,360
is the most unfortunate thing.

765
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,560
But fortunately, fate

766
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,080
gave me another

767
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,280
good person.

768
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,880
I would also want to treat her well,

769
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,400
see her happy,

770
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,480
or hurt her

771
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,160
and see her in pain.

772
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,680
All that indicates your heart

773
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,880
has beaten again

774
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,120
because of that person.

775
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,400
Then...

776
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,240
