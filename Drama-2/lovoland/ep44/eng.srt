Yeah, fill it up.

Alright.

Fill it up.

Drink!

Sure.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,625
Drink it up.

36
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,175
One more.

37
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,950
Alright, try this one.

38
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:52,175
It's delicious.

39
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:53,950

Here.

41
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:56,720
Keep pouring. Fill it up.

42
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:03,774
Let me fill it up for you.

43
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,975

Let's drink.

Alright, one more cup!

47
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:11,275
Why don't you drink?

48
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,475
Let's... Alright.

49
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:14,022
Finger guess. Come on.

50
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,155
Dig in.

You lost.

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,300
The loser drinks.

Drink it up.

58
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,903
Drink.

59
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:45,050
- Leopard. Tiger.
- Leopard. Tiger.

60
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,119
- Leopard. Leopard. Tiger.
- Leopard. Leopard. Tiger.

61
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:47,679
Mrs. Ye.

62
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:48,475
- It's me.
- Leopard. Leopard.

63
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:49,375
- Guo?
- Kiss him!

64
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,800
What are you doing here?

65
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,119
- Mrs. Ye, come with me.
- Come on.

66
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,559
These people aren't sent by His Majesty.

67
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,000
They might harm you.

68
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,500
Fill it up. Fill it up.

69
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:57,300
Come on.

70
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,320
Alright.

71
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:00,559
No time for it, Mrs. Ye.

72
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,250
There they are!

73
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,250
Come on!

74
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,399
Hurry up!

75
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,320
Come on. Stop!

76
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,479
Over there.

77
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,550
- Come on!
- Stop!

78
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,119
Hurry up!

79
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,759
Keep up! Stop running!

80
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,640
Stop!

81
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:18,959
Mrs. Ye!

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Mrs. Ye,

83
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,640
we're here to take you

84
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,799
to see Consort Chunrong.

85
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,450
Why are you running away?

86
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,799
You

87
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,805
are not sent by His Majesty.

88
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,675
Guo!

89
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,040
Guo!

90
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,959
Mrs. Ye,

91
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:56,119
please.

92
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:57,440
Go!

93
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,559
- Come on.
- Go!

94
00:04:58,559 --> 00:04:59,250
Go!

95
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:00,000
Hurry.

96
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,000
Madam,

97
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,539
we're in Mount Leiyan.

98
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,900
There is a fork not far ahead,

99
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,119
which divides the road into two paths.

100
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,880
One is the relatively flat state route.

101
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,279
But the distance to Shangyang Pass

102
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,079
is farther.

103
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:21,880
The other path is narrow,

104
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:24,079
and goes along a cliff.

105
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,000
But we can arrive two hours earlier.

106
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,640
We take the state route.

107
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,320
Yes.

108
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:52,425
Take the other path.

109
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,439
Mother!

110
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:47,839
Don't hurt my mother!

111
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:49,320
Don't worry, Madam.

112
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:50,559
On our way here,

113
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:51,279
Mrs. Ye has been taken care of

114
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,600
with due respect.

115
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:55,174
We didn't let any harm go close to her.

116
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,100
As long as you hand over Dragon Tail,

117
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,200
I will return Mrs. Ye

118
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,640
to you.

119
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,575
You tied my mother's hands and feet,

120
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,661
and plugged her mouth.

121
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,950
How is that respectful?

122
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:15,646
Haishi,

123
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,079
you would risk your life

124
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,695
for the sake of the people.

125
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,200
So,

126
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,399
I cannot be a coward,

127
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,000
and a burden to you.

128
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,275
Mother!

129
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,799
Stop her!

130
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,650
Stop!

131
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,440
Master!

132
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,280
I will protect you.

133
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,150
Prepare to jump!

134
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,640
Mercy, Your Highness.

135
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,359
Mercy!

136
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:07,039
I ordered you

137
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,960
to kill Fang Haishi

138
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,280
and take Dragon Tail back.

139
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,280
But you pushed Fang Haishi,

140
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,880
Fang Jianming and Dragon Tail

141
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,080
off a cliff?

142
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,000
It was an accident.

143
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,239
There's no way

144
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,000
we could stop the horse.

145
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,039
But,

146
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,320
I'm sure

147
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,719
however tough Fang Jianming

148
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,200
and Fang Haishi are,

149
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
they cannot survive

150
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,559
the fall from that height.

151
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,120
It is the most devilish sin

152
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,190
to hurt Dragon Tail.

153
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,479
Consider yourselves lucky

154
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:33,799
that you got rid of the two
with one blow.

155
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,719
Or you could forget about
coming back alive.

156
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,550
Get lost!

157
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,159
Yes.

158
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,039
Forgive me, Dragon Tail.

159
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,479
Bless me.

160
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,200
Don't panic, Your Highness.

161
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:51,320
Emperor Xu plans to see Dragon Tail

162
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,679
along with the envoys tomorrow.

163
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,840
However, such an accident

164
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,599
led to Dragon Tail's death,

165
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,799
which proves that

166
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,280
Emperor Xu has been a tyrant

167
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,479
and has lost Heaven's blessing.

168
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,760
You're quite right, Mr. Shi.

169
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:08,760
Mr. Shi.

170
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,440
Mr. Fu.

171
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,919
Greetings, Your Highness.

172
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,039
Mr. Fu,

173
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,980
you finally made it back.

174
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,559
From Winter Solstice to summer,

175
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,679
every border report I received

176
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,200
says peace.

177
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:23,159
In recent days,

178
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,400
Duoluo

179
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,080
doesn't even send replies.

180
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,119
What the heck is going on there?

181
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,679
The two tribes of Huku

182
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,479
are still struggling in a stalemate.

183
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:32,679
I'm afraid Duoluo

184
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,479
is unable to feign an attack
on Huangquan Pass.

185
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,700
If Duoluo

186
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,799
can't control Huangquan Pass,

187
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,599
I'll lose a great help.

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,921
What's worse, you come back

189
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:41,760
with Zhang Chengqian.

190
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,679
He's close to Fang Haishi.

191
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:46,000
With him around,

192
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,479
is it convenient for you to make a move?

193
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,479
The border nearby is peaceful.

194
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:50,479
If we get rid of Zhang Chengqian

195
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,760
quietly,

196
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:53,280
it'll arouse suspicion

197
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:55,374
because he's a commander.

198
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,880
But no need to worry, Your Highness.

199
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,359
Zhang Chengqian

200
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,400
is already one of us now.

201
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:07,239
Mr. Zhang,

202
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,760
this is the evidence of your collusion

203
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,775
with Huku.

204
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,239
What else can you say?

205
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:22,799
No.

206
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,300
I didn't do that.

207
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,960
There are now two options

208
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,600
for you, Mr. Zhang.

209
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,320
Guards.

210
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,039
You removed an obstacle

211
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,479
with merely 1,000 taels of gold.

212
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,119
That's a good deal

213
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:46,599
you've made.

214
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,075
However,

215
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,039
we can't trust this man totally, can we?

216
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,200
Rest assured, Your Highness.

217
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,000
Zhang Chengqian is being watched

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,119
by my followers.

219
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,359
If he tries to do anything harmful,

220
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:01,025
he'll be killed immediately.

221
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:01,650
Mm-hmm.

222
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,039
Mr. Fu,

223
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,440
what are the odds

224
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,719
of us winning the victory

225
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,719
with the men we have?

226
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,719
Most of Zhang Chengqian's followers

227
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:13,200
stay at Huangquan Pass.

228
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,000
The 50,000 men

229
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,200
we took from Huangquan Pass

230
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:17,880
are mostly the followers

231
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,719
of me and General Tang Qianzi.

232
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,919
And there are 20,000 men in Beifu Army

233
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,150
at my command.

234
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
With the right strategy, it's enough.

235
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:30,280
Great.

236
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:32,919
Those fishermen

237
00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:35,215
always sail with the wind

238
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,825
and go with the flow.

239
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,850
But they're devout believers

240
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,971
in Dragon Tail.

241
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:41,840
As long as His Majesty

242
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,080
cannot present Dragon Tail,

243
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:47,550
they'll all turn to me.

244
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:48,950
Um.

245
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:50,885
It's not hard

246
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:53,235
for us to control the palace

247
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:55,159
and take Tianqi City down now.

248
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,575
There's a grand banquet tonight.

249
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,400
What are you doing?

250
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,760
Sorry for the offense,

251
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,400
Commander Chen.

252
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,320
I know you.

253
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,440
You're Fu Yi's deputy, right?

254
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,320
We got the news that

255
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,320
Jifeng Pavilion

256
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,760
has colluded with envoys

257
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:29,200
from tribes in Leizhou,

258
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:30,840
and is planning a coup.

259
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,679
To eliminate traitors,

260
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,175
we have no choice

261
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:35,760
but to take the initiative.

262
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,799
Where are Fu Yi and Zhang Chengqian?

263
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Tell them to come.

264
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,100
I won't speak to you.

265
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,679
Stop struggling, Commander Chen.

266
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:49,000
Take a look

267
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,640
at the men behind me.

268
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,919
Aren't they Zhang Chengqian's henchmen?

269
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:56,440
Commander Zhang is as loyal

270
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:58,675
to the state and His Majesty

271
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:00,679
as we are.

272
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:03,746
He won't meet you.

273
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,025
My advice to you,

274
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,679
the rebels

275
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,520
come to no good end.

276
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:24,919
Commander.

277
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,080
What's the current situation?

278
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,840
There's a banquet in the palace.

279
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:29,239
Commander Chen of Imperial Guards

280
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:30,400
who's in charge of palace security

281
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,640
is in our control.

282
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,200
With His Highness and your order,

283
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,425
we can break into the palace.

284
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,800
Your Majesty,

285
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:34,799
all envoys present today

286
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,175
are here to see

287
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:37,700
the Dragon Tail.

288
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,640
It's been a while
since the banquet started.

289
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,725
Where is Dragon Tail?

290
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:45,320
May I ask

291
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,960
when Your Majesty will show us
Dragon Tail?

292
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:49,725
Or are you just teasing us?

293
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:53,719
Teasing you?

294
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:56,599
I, Tuangsa,

295
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,000
mean no offense to Your Majesty.

296
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,610
But not long ago,

297
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,100
two envoys from my tribe

298
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,784
ran into danger in Tianqi City.

299
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,760
And Your Majesty hasn't

300
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,175
given us an explanation.

301
00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:12,936
If tonight

302
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,350
we cannot see Dragon Tail,

303
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,319
there will be a war

304
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,439
between Nihualuo and Dazheng!

305
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:29,204
Deputy Envoy Tuangsa,

306
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,675
we're guests tonight.

307
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,640
So let's accept the host's arrangement.

308
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,675
Prince Suolan,

309
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:42,199
Zhunian and Dazheng are in-laws.

310
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,625
Surely you're on Dazheng's side.

311
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:48,079
But you've been used to being a stooge.

312
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,439
I beg your pardon!

313
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:40,839
Commander,

314
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,750
it's Zhang Chengqian's flare.

315
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,079
Move out!

316
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,075
Your Majesty…

317
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,280
Dragon Tail

318
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,199
is a sign of Heaven's divine power.

319
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,160
So, its presence at Dazheng

320
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:18,665
is a sign of Your Majesty's good grace.

321
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:28,365
I'd like to take this opportunity

322
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,521
to propose a toast to Your Majesty.

323
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,319
Good grace?

324
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,479
Dragon Tail is not here.

325
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,199
If Dragon Tail does not show up tonight,

326
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,520
it'll be considered blasphemy,

327
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,239
and fatuity of the emperor,

328
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:47,275
who should be condemned.

329
00:19:48,425 --> 00:19:49,160
Is more waiting

330
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,560
really necessary?

331
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:51,880
No more waiting.

332
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,400
Right.

333
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,599
No, we shouldn't wait any longer.

334
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,199
If Dragon Tail is here,

335
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,479
it would have appeared,

336
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
instead of keeping us waiting.

337
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,920
Is Dragon Tail coming or not?

338
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,760
We need an answer, Your Majesty.

339
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,800
Deputy Envoy Tuangsa made a good point.

340
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:08,719
We came all the way to Dazheng

341
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:11,040
to behold the glory of Dragon Tail.

342
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,239
If it's true

343
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:13,400
that Your Majesty is just teasing us,

344
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,160
tribes in Leizhou will not
swallow the insult.

345
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,250
Gods bless monarchs of virtue.

346
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,561
If you're a virtuous emperor,

347
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:38,600
Dragon Tail will grant us
its appearance.

348
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,280
Your Majesty,

349
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,439
invite Dragon Tail out, please.

350
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,280
Don't keep the envoys waiting

351
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,289
anxiously.

352
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,680
Jichang,

353
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,400
are you also so anxious

354
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,650
to see Dragon Tail?

355
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,030
I grew up in Zhunian,

356
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:15,119
so I'm a pious believer

357
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,760
in Dragon Tail.

358
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,640
Your Majesty,

359
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:25,800
please invite Dragon Tail out!

360
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,439
- Please invite Dragon Tail out!
- Please invite Dragon Tail out!

361
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:36,325
- Please invite Dragon Tail out!
- Please invite Dragon Tail out!

362
00:21:52,175 --> 00:21:53,336
Are you sure

363
00:21:54,675 --> 00:21:56,514
you want to see Dragon Tail right now?

364
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:01,880
Sure.

365
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,000
Alright then.

366
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,420
Please come with me.

367
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:50,079
- Commander Fu.
- Commander Fu.

368
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:50,875
Um.

369
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:38,224
Your Majesty,

370
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,881
show us Dragon Tail.

371
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,719
All tribes in Leizhou

372
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:52,479
rely heavily on sea trade,

373
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:54,199
so we worship Dragon Tail.

374
00:23:54,675 --> 00:23:55,880
Since Dragon Tail

375
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,560
is in Dazheng now,

376
00:23:57,719 --> 00:23:58,680
we beg

377
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,400
to behold Dragon Tail's glory,

378
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,150
and pray for the safety
of our merchants.

379
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,725
Please grant us the honor, Your Majesty.

380
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,950
Please grant us the honor, Your Majesty.

381
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:09,000
How dare you!

382
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,450
As envoys of Leizhou,

383
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,560
how dare you offend

384
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,520
His Majesty so!

385
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,319
If His Majesty is disrespectful to gods,

386
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,400
why shouldn't we?

387
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,225
What?

388
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,200
Where is Lord Qinghai?

389
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,861
I'm here.

390
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:43,479
Your Majesty.

391
00:24:46,825 --> 00:24:48,000
Your Highness,

392
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,401
how do you do?

393
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:53,175
Dazheng is a great power.

394
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:55,200
And its emperor is a man of his word.

395
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,399
Do you think I would break my promise?

396
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,361
Lord Qinghai,

397
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,160
is Madam Pearl

398
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,439
ready to usher Dragon Tail in?

399
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,475
Your Majesty,

400
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,839
everything is ready.

401
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:09,400
Then summon Madam Pearl.

402
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,534
Madam Pearl is summoned.

403
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:16,075
Madam Pearl is summoned.

404
00:25:20,425 --> 00:25:21,575
Jichang,

405
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
stop waiting.

406
00:25:28,275 --> 00:25:29,954
No one else is coming

407
00:25:30,975 --> 00:25:33,016
except for Dragon Tail.

408
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,361
Zhang Chengqian!

409
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,319
You tricked me with your surrender?

410
00:26:22,275 --> 00:26:23,239
That's impossible.

411
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:25,750
You're under my watch.

412
00:26:26,175 --> 00:26:26,959
Mr. Fu,

413
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,720
your informers are not capable.

414
00:26:30,675 --> 00:26:32,315
They have failed you.

415
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,300
The gold

416
00:26:45,575 --> 00:26:47,334
is too much for me to accept.

417
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:50,450
I'd like to return it to you.

418
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,820
Take it to your grave.

419
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,800
Zhang Chengqian!

420
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,439
You despicable man!

421
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,799
Fall back!

422
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,599
It's too late, Fu Yi.

423
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:19,706
You took a path

424
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,599
that has no going back.

425
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:24,199
Imperial Guards, on my command!

426
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:25,950
Take the rebels down!

427
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,650
His Majesty will reward us!

428
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,425
Charge!

429
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,175
- Charge!
- Charge!

430
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,610
Greetings, Your Majesty.

431
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,750
Isn't this Madam Pearl?

432
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,839
Even though you're

433
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,995
Dragon Tail's messenger,

434
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,560
where is

435
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,375
Dragon Tail?

436
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:30,760
Right.

437
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,400
Yes.

438
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,479
- Where is Dragon Tail?
- Right.

439
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:33,119
Where?

440
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:35,160
It's just another juggling trick.

441
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,359
What are you laughing at?

442
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,839
I'm laughing at you

443
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,079
and your lip service of your piety.

444
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,640
The Goddess is right here with us
in the hall.

445
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:46,920
But you turn a blind eye to her.

446
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,079
- Where is the Goddess?
- Right.

447
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,599
She's not here.

448
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,119
No.

449
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,400
- Right. Where is she?
- Right. She's clearly not here.

450
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,199
Where is she?

451
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:05,700
Oh!

452
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,479
- Is it...?
- It's...

453
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:09,680
Is this

454
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:11,839
Dragon Tail?

455
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,680
Hail Dragon Tail!

456
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,239
- We sincerely pray
- We sincerely pray

457
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,719
- for your blessing!
- for your blessing!

458
00:30:18,075 --> 00:30:19,876
- Goddess, bless us!
- Goddess, bless us!

459
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,439
- Goddess, bless us!
- Goddess, bless us!

460
00:30:23,275 --> 00:30:25,300
- We sincerely pray
- We sincerely pray

461
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,959
- for your blessing!
- for your blessing!

462
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,625
- We sincerely pray
- We sincerely pray

463
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,325
- for your blessing!
- for your blessing!

464
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,160
Dragon Tail has been used

465
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:40,319
to the vastness of the sea.

466
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:43,475
But to come to Dazheng,

467
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,199
she traveled in the crystal tank,

468
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,839
which is agony.

469
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,650
I've readied a pool

470
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,969
filled with seawater

471
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,450
for Dragon Tail.

472
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,050
Take her to rest.

473
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,725
Thank you, Your Majesty.

474
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,080
Gentlemen,

475
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,575
you've met Dragon Tail.

476
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,359
So let's quit standing here,

477
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,160
and go back to our banquet

478
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:09,040
in Zichen Hall.

479
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,839
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

480
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:37,640
It is a great honor that Dragon Tail

481
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,975
visits Dazheng.

482
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,119
I'm planning to build a palace

483
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,950
for Dragon Tail to stay longer.

484
00:31:45,575 --> 00:31:47,550
What do you think?

485
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,760
Your Majesty.

486
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:52,640
Your Majesty

487
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,719
is so kind and generous.

488
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,520
Please send Dragon Tail

489
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,700
back to the sea.

490
00:31:58,439 --> 00:31:59,920
Without Dragon Tail,

491
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,439
sharks will attack

492
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:02,560
and there'll be destructive waves.

493
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:06,075
The people of Leizhou will suffer.

494
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:07,439
Your Majesty,

495
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,599
most of my people make a living
from the sea.

496
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,439
Without Dragon Tail's protection,

497
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:15,040
the consequence is unimaginable.

498
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,150
For the sake

499
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,509
of our bond by marriage,

500
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,959
please permit it.

501
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:23,280
- Your Majesty is so kind and merciful.
- Your Majesty is so kind and merciful.

502
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,160
- We beg to differ.
- We beg to differ.

503
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,520
Then, let's forge an alliance

504
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,040
right here

505
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,359
and make a vow
in the name of Dragon Tail

506
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,079
that as long as Yingge Sea

507
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,280
and Jiangnan Sea aren't dry,

508
00:32:35,725 --> 00:32:36,520
you

509
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,479
and the future generations

510
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,775
will never invade Dazheng.

511
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,640
The vow breakers

512
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,479
will lose
Dragon Tail's blessings forever.

513
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:49,560
Your Majesty is a man of your words.

514
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,850
Zhunian would like to form an alliance
with Dazheng.

515
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,439
Tuhuolu

516
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,450
is willing to join the alliance.

517
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,450
Nanpi is also willing
to join the alliance.

518
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,375
Xifu is willing to join the alliance.

519
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,800
Yangjita is willing
to join the alliance.

520
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,000
Nihualuo

521
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,000
is willing to join the alliance.

522
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,719
Your Majesty,

523
00:33:24,325 --> 00:33:25,686
we've met Dragon Tail.

524
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,640
I don't feel well.

525
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:30,880
Excuse me.

526
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,140
Lord Chang.

527
00:33:46,975 --> 00:33:48,335
No rush to leave.

528
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:50,895
You're the hero today.

529
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,280
Kneel.

530
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:26,159
- Greetings, Your Majesty!
- Greetings, Your Majesty!

531
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,159
We're ordered to secure the palace.

532
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:31,760
Lord Chang's accomplice, Fu Yi,

533
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,150
and over 1,200 soldiers at his commander
have been taken down.

534
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,475
What a surprise!

535
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,760
Jichang,

536
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:42,120
if you had stopped

537
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,719
before Fu Yi led the troops
in the palace

538
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,879
tonight,

539
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,080
I would consider sparing you.

540
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:52,360
Your Majesty,

541
00:34:52,575 --> 00:34:54,199
no, Brother!

542
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,199
Brother,

543
00:34:55,479 --> 00:34:56,760
I was so blind.

544
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:58,360
I overestimated myself!

545
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,479
Brother, forgive me!

546
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:00,425
Spare my life!

547
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:01,679
Lord Chang.

548
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:04,760
You ordered the two

549
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,479
Nihualuo envoys' assassinations,

550
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:09,055
the attack on Dragon Tail,

551
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:11,439
the fake edict

552
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:12,719
to abduct my mother,

553
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,150
and the military coup.

554
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,975
We have both witnesses to

555
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,400
and evidence of your crimes.

556
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:23,975
The royals and commoners
are equal under the law.

557
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,025
His Majesty is wise and just.

558
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,520
Though it breaks his heart,

559
00:35:28,479 --> 00:35:30,025
he will not spare you.

560
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,329
Madam Pearl,

561
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,825
are you saying that

562
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:39,425
Lord Chang set the envoys
from my tribe up?

563
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,800
Lord Chang,

564
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,879
together with Puyouma,

565
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,959
lured Mr. Bonen Naji

566
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:45,879
to Huixian Restaurant

567
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:47,439
and sent assassins in.

568
00:35:47,825 --> 00:35:49,225
That's why Mr. Bonen Naji

569
00:35:49,225 --> 00:35:50,650
is still unconscious.

570
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,650
What he did to Deputy Envoy Tacron

571
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,850
is even crueler.

572
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,675
He controlled Tacron with drugs

573
00:35:56,675 --> 00:35:58,275
and ordered him to attack me.

574
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,280
In the end, the drugs caused

575
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,719
the Deputy Envoy's tragic death.

576
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,080
Lord Chang's purpose

577
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,639
is to turn Nihualuo

578
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,000
against Dazheng,

579
00:36:08,225 --> 00:36:09,824
and to take advantage of the dispute.

580
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:13,280
That's...

581
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,840
That's nonsense!

582
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,399
Yuran.

583
00:36:20,575 --> 00:36:22,700
(Confession Edict)

584
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,475
Take a good look at these.

585
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:26,300
We have

586
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,479
a note you wrote to Puyouma,

587
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,000
the fake edict,

588
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,600
a badge from the man

589
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,000
who abducted my mother,

590
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,639
and the confession of the suicide squad

591
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:38,560
who attacked Dragon Tail and others.

592
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,275
Right here with us

593
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:42,320
are Fu Yi and other accomplices.

594
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,450
What more evidence do you want?

595
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,700
I can find it for you.

596
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,600
No way.

597
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:51,800
How could you get these?

598
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:52,950
I don't believe it.

599
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,879
As long as there's a clue,

600
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:57,879
Jifeng Pavilion will track it down.

601
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,375
Lord Chang,

602
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:03,080
it's time you pay the price

603
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,725
for what you did.

604
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,120
Your Majesty!

605
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,225
Please punish Lord Chang

606
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:12,280
and bring justice to Nihualuo.

607
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:13,400
Your Majesty,

608
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:14,575
what Puyouma did

609
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:15,815
is personal.

610
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:17,000
It has nothing to do with Zhunian.

611
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:18,550
Whatever your punishment is,

612
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,390
Zhunian will have no objection to it.

613
00:37:25,725 --> 00:37:26,760
No way!

614
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,030
No... No way!

615
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,550
No way. I don't believe it.

616
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,600
Guards.

617
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,360
Take Lord Chang away.

618
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,520
Put him in the Imperial Prison.

619
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,840
His accomplices will face trials
by the Tri-ministry of Justice.

620
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,075
- Yes.
- Yes.

621
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,125
Brother,

622
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,080
it's not me.

623
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,800
I... I didn't do it.

624
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,320
Brother!

625
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,280
Brother, it's not me!

626
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,840
Brother!

627
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,560
Brother!

628
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:18,760
Once we arrived in Tianqi

629
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,600
before you could rest,

630
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,975
you were put in the crystal tank

631
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,525
and waited for hours

632
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,520
to meet the envoys.

633
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:28,439
I'm so sorry for that.

634
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,239
Haishi,

635
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:31,760
do you want me to detoxify someone?

636
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:35,120
The Dawn Flower.

637
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:38,284
Can you?

638
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,320
Yes.

639
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,840
Master,

640
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,450
Lang Huan can detoxify you.

641
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:46,399
Thank you, Lang Huan,

642
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:48,280
for keeping Haishi's concern in mind.

643
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,730
It's an arduous trip

644
00:38:50,879 --> 00:38:51,919
from Yuezhou to Zhongzhou.

645
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,639
And it's been an exhausting day.

646
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,280
You must be tired and weak.

647
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,159
Please take a good rest.

648
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:58,479
Regain your strength.

649
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,399
We'll discuss detoxification later.

650
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,025
With the pearls,

651
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:05,760
I'll be fine in a while.

652
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:10,959
Lang Huan,

653
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,250
I...

654
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:14,000
No.

655
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:16,199
Please,

656
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,080
allow me to express my gratitude.

657
00:39:30,175 --> 00:39:30,950
Thank you

658
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,280
for coming to Dazheng for the people.

659
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,959
Rest assured.

660
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:36,375
I won't let any harm

661
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:37,719
come to you anymore.

662
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,665
Please have a good rest.

663
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:48,080
You must be tired.

664
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,439
Have some rest.

665
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:50,315
Um.

666
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:51,450
Good night.

667
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,919
What are you...?

668
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:13,760
She hasn't slept or eaten anything

669
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,421
since we went down Mount Leiyan.

670
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,120
If she didn't have a good sleep,

671
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:21,525
she would probably die before I do.

672
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,520
What happened

673
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,520
at Mount Leiyan?

674
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,471
I think

675
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:31,320
you're different from before.

676
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:36,000
I was a fool

677
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,560
to have lost so much.

678
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:39,744
I should take her to her palace first.

679
00:40:40,475 --> 00:40:41,439
Good night.

680
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,320
