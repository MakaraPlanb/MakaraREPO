26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,110
Eunuch, please tell His Majesty

27
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,070
that I ask to see him.

28
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,860
Please wait, Your Highness.

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,720
Your Highness.

30
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,390
There you are, Your Highness.

31
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,320
Please come with me.

32
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,780
Greetings, Your Majesty.

33
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,190
You may rise.

34
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,460
Yes.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,440
What did you come for?

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,110
I heard you’ve been busy lately.

37
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,880
I’ve made some desserts for you.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,750
You’ve also learned

39
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,550
to beat about the bush.

40
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,860
I praised you only once
for your cooking skills.

41
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,110
You have a good memory, though.

42
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,830
You came to intercede for Zhunian?

43
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,900
You can beg me directly.

44
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,480
Maybe I’ll approve.

45
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,870
Your Majesty.

46
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,550
Lotus cake.

47
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,670
Consort Shurong,

48
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,570
it’s considerate of you.

49
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:42,970
Unfortunately,

50
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,770
I hate people most for estimating me.

51
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,820
Get out of here.

52
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,100
Go transmit my order.

53
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,000
Ask Puyouma to leave Tianqi immediately

54
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,420
without the need for bidding farewell.

55
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,550
I said,

56
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,200
I’ll see no one unless he’s summoned.

57
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,320
His Majesty, Lord Qinghai
asked to see you.

58
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,670
Why did he come?

59
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,110
He just wants to annoy me.

60
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,480
Your Majesty.

61
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,810
Shoot!

62
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,920
Envoy Puyouma from Zhunian...

63
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,600
You want to upset me, too?

64
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,550
I don’t dare to.

65
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,720
Hope you didn’t come

66
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,600
to intercede for Zhunian.

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,950
I can see you’re angry.

68
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,350
I don’t have poor eyesight yet.

69
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,230
Puyouma is quite importunate

70
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,350
and extremely annoying.

71
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,260
But he’s the envoy from Zhunian, anyway.

72
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,670
When you ask him to leave the capital,

73
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,040
he should submit a memorial

74
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,080
and bid farewell to Consort Shurong.

75
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,160
I don’t care.

76
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
Handle it if you want.

77
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

78
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,070
This part

79
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,230
is still a bit messy.

80
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,550
Be more careful next time.

81
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,230
Yes.

82
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,070
Miss Ju.

83
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:20,950
All right.

84
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,970
Miss Ju.

85
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,920
I’ll fix that.

86
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,670
Miss Ju.

87
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,640
Uncle Shi.

88
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,040
Don’t. Don’t.

89
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,480
You’re the manager of the Fabric Office.

90
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,620
And you’re the only blind embroiderer

91
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,790
in the Palace.

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,670
I’m a mere director
of Imperial Manufactories.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,070
We’re of the same level.

94
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,030
The same level.

95
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,900
You flatter me, Uncle Shi.

96
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,050
In the past few years,

97
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,040
you’ve helped me a lot.

98
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,180
I must be polite to you.

99
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,880
You’re welcome.

100
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,350
If the former manager knows in heaven

101
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,600
that you’re so considerate,

102
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,480
she’ll be happy, too.

103
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,700
Forget it.

104
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,270
What’s gone is gone.

105
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,110
By the way,

106
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,880
I’ve brought you the cloth for spring.

107
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,170
You have to pick some

108
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,600
before I do the purchase.

109
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,150
This one.

110
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,160
This one.

111
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,670
And this one.

112
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,780
I picked three kinds of cloth.

113
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,470
All right.

114
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,650
I’ve kept them in mind.

115
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,070
You have good taste, Miss Ju.

116
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,460
The Fabric Office

117
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,350
is finally back to

118
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,830
what it used to be like.

119
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,480
If we want it to be as lively

120
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,510
as it was when Madam was alive,

121
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,890
it’ll still take a few more years.

122
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,390
That’s right.

123
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,270
You’ve got a lot of work to do.

124
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,160
Take good care of yourself.

125
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,790
When the purchase of cloth is done,

126
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,480
I’ll bring the cloth to you personally.

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,350
Thank you, Uncle Shi.

128
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,320
You’re being too polite.

129
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,200
If you don’t mind,

130
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,040
I’ll leave you alone.

131
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,000
Zheliu is living

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,680
quite a hard life.

133
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,530
All of you, listen carefully.

134
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,320
If the Fabric Office

135
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,640
needs anything

136
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,990
or the new manager wants anything,

137
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,230
handle that carefully

138
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,550
and help as much as you can.

139
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,090
If you dare to neglect her,

140
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,620
I’ll punish you!

141
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,550
- Yes, Director.
- Yes, Director.

142
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,960
Xiaobai. Xiaobai.

143
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,750
Why are you so naughty?

144
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,820
Why did you sneak out?

145
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,250
Look what I’ve brought you.

146
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,520
Miss Ju.

147
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,050
Mr. Fang.

148
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,870
It’s a sunny day today.

149
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,850
Aunt Su,

150
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,550
I’ll just sit in the yard.

151
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,840
Go check on the girls.

152
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,110
If they have any problem,

153
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,280
take care of them.

154
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,910
Yes.

155
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,640
Mr. Fang,

156
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,000
what did you come for?

157
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,420
I happened to pick up some radishes

158
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,540
by the roadside.

159
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,540
I think Xiaobai likes radishes.

160
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,180
So, I brought them here.

161
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,960
Mr. Fang,

162
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,770
you didn’t often come here.

163
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,010
How did you know the rabbit’s name?

164
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,200
I...

165
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,580
Mr. Fang?

166
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,440
I lied to you.

167
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,230
Long ago, I knew

168
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,790
its name was Xiaobai.

169
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,030
In case it’s not convenient

170
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,030
for people of the Fabric Office
to get out of the Palace,

171
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,640
I got out early this morning

172
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,790
and bought the radishes

173
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,230
in the West Market.

174
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,440
In case there was dew on them,

175
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,750
I dried them again.

176
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,270
Mr. Fang, you’re always busy.

177
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,370
You don’t need to
take a lot of trouble for Xiaobai.

178
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,120
For fear that you might say so,

179
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,710
I lied just now.

180
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,030
Miss Zheliu.

181
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,530
May I

182
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,660
be your friend?

183
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,350
Mr. Fang, you are

184
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,320
certainly my friend.

185
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,710
Why did you say so?

186
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,950
In the past,

187
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,080
I was a friend

188
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,950
who didn’t associate a lot with you.

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,050
But from this day on,

190
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,120
I want to be your friend

191
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,470
who will often associate with you.

192
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,630
Then, on ordinary days,

193
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,670
if you need some help,

194
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,290
I can help you.

195
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,970
However small or complicated it is,

196
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,430
I won’t find it troublesome.

197
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,440
I’m clumsy and rash.

198
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,030
Sorry to have been offensive.

199
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,610
You weren’t offensive.

200
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,870
You’re a warm-hearted man.

201
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,130
Being warm-hearted is different

202
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,930
from being offensive.

203
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,330
I’ll take that as a yes.

204
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,700
Mm.

205
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,520
May I often come here

206
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,790
to see...?

207
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,430
Xiaobai?

208
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,280
Sure.

209
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,670
May I

210
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,750
often come

211
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,710
to have a chat

212
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,760
with you?

213
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,760
Of course.

214
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,710
What strange weather this year!

215
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,280
There’s vapor in the wind.

216
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,440
There isn’t.

217
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,230
It’s nothing,

218
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,320
but the ordinary foehn.

219
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,350
This year,

220
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,230
the weather is much drier, I’m afraid.

221
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,550
The wind isn’t cool.

222
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,960
But there’s indeed vapor.

223
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,910
It feels good
when the wind blows on my face.

224
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,960
We came from Huangquan Pass.

225
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,650
No matter what foehn there is
in the east,

226
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,220
we’ll find it damp and cool.

227
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,150
Mr. Fang, you were born
in the capital, weren’t you?

228
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,270
That’d be better.

229
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,550
When soldiers from coastal counties

230
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,320
first come to the pass,

231
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,440
they have a nosebleed

232
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
or chapped skin.

233
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,150
It usually takes a year or so
before they get better.

234
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,350
My ancestral home
is the seashore of Linjie.

235
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,400
But I grew up in the capital.

236
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,320
Oh, I see.

237
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,450
You’ve been away from home for years.

238
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,760
After we’re back in the capital
to report to His Majesty,

239
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,470
you can visit your hometown
if time permits.

240
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,520
Yes.

241
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,440
Zhuoying.

242
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,030
Zhuoying.

243
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,640
Zhuoying.

244
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,590
Haishi.

245
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,960
Oh, no.

246
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,080
It’s quite windy outside the pass.

247
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,590
But your face

248
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,440
is still tender.

249
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,750
(Imperial Corps Commander)
You’re really something, Fang Zhuoying.

250
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,590
Since when were you
no longer Bowmen Commandant

251
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,550
but Imperial Corps Commander?

252
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,320
It’s the fourth rank.
With two ranks up,

253
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,520
you’ll be at the same level
as my commander-in-chief.

254
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,910
Don’t be impatient.
You’ve made unusual merits

255
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,910
in the sneak attack to Lanzi.

256
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,000
Before you go back to the capital,

257
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,400
local people have already
heard about you.

258
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,440
I guess

259
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,670
you have no problem

260
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,400
being promoted to the fourth rank.

261
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,670
Are you sure? The fourth rank?

262
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,400
Mm.

263
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,920
I can also be a general?

264
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Don’t deceive me.

265
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,200
If I make it, I’ll buy you a drink.

266
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:58,820
Here.

267
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,500
Ten-year-old Three Flower Spirits.

268
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,030
Mr. Fang.

269
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,760
General Tang. Commander Fu.

270
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,000
I came to have a chat with my brother.

271
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,760
The team to welcome you
is waiting ahead.

272
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,080
Let’s go.

273
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,080
Commander-in-chief
of Huangquan Battalion

274
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,320
is asked to report to the emperor
tomorrow morning.

275
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,380
Besides,

276
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,670
Staff Officer Fang Haishi
of Huangquan Battalion

277
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,280
made merits by shooting
Huku’s old Lord of Left Pudun

278
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,470
and allying with Jiaman.

279
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,110
He shall go to the court, too.
Respect this.

280
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,750
- We will go, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

281
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,700
Please stand up, General.

282
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,590
You had a long trip.

283
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,230
Please go to bed early.

284
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,080
Tomorrow morning you’ll meet His Majesty
with commanders-in-chief

285
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,760
of Chengcheng Battalion
and Wuwei Battalion.

286
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,950
You will certainly look energetic

287
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,340
and display our national prestige.

288
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,000
Fang Haishi shall come in.

289
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,550
I am

290
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,640
Staff Officer Fang Haishi
of Huangquan Battalion.

291
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

292
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,940
After going through hardship
for six months,

293
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,040
you’re indeed much steadier.

294
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,150
Award him.

295
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,440
Yes.

296
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,900
Here’s a decree of His Majesty.

297
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,280
Staff Officer Fang Haishi
from Huangquan Battalion

298
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,380
shot Huku’s old Lord of Left Pudun,

299
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,190
allied with Jiaman,

300
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,100
and recaptured Lanzi.

301
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,820
He has established
unusual merits repeatedly.

302
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,640
He’s created General of Cloud-like Flags
of the sub-third rank.

303
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,710
He’ll be awarded
with a hundred taels of gold,

304
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,880
a best-quality bow,

305
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,400
and a hundred arrows
made of gyrfalcon feathers.

306
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,550
Respect this.

307
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,470
Sub-third rank?

308
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,560
What a quick promotion!

309
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,100
So it is.

310
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,800
Yeah.

311
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,880
He made unusual merits
by attacking Lanzi surprisingly.

312
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,230
But he’s nearly as greatly awarded

313
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,680
as Lord Qinghai.

314
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,770
We all know that

315
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,230
Officer Fang is
Lord Qinghai’s brilliant disciple.

316
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,650
Awarding him

317
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,470
means praising Lord Qinghai.

318
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,950
Yeah.

319
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,630
General,

320
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,900
accept the decree and say thank you.

321
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,520
Your Majesty,

322
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,350
I didn’t defeat the Left Tribe of Huku,

323
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,670
or ally with Jiaman

324
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,760
to kick the Right Tribe out of Lanzi

325
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,700
all by myself.

326
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,470
Soldiers of Huangquan Battalion

327
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,310
fought a bloody battle

328
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,950
all together.

329
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,430
The sub-third rank

330
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,600
is too much for me.

331
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,540
I don’t dare to accept it.

332
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,880
Good.

333
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,680
When you’re promoted,

334
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,170
you can still be self-restrained,

335
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,450
instead of being arrogant.

336
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,140
You’re just like your master.

337
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,310
Your Majesty,

338
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,520
Fang Haishi is very young.

339
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,040
Such a promotion is too much for him.

340
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,010
A young man has advantages.

341
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,520
He’s just like

342
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,920
the first sharpened sword.

343
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,280
He’s sharp and irresistible.

344
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,160
Fang Haishi,

345
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,380
I know you’re wise and brave.

346
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
I want to give you a chance

347
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,170
to make great contributions.

348
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,970
Are you going to shrink back?

349
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

350
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,170
Huangquan Pass is in the border area.

351
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,520
It’s hard to guard there for years.

352
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,370
Tomorrow, I’ll hold a banquet

353
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,760
in the Palace for General Tang

354
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,160
and other generals

355
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,170
in honor of your return.

356
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,420
What?

357
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,680
Tang Qianzi?

358
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,480
He’s...

359
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,990
Master.

360
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,910
What did I teach you?

361
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,880
We can’t be anxious
to achieve quick success.

362
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,820
We can get nothing if we’re greedy.

363
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,760
What else?

364
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,920
When we know where to stop,
we have stability.

365
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,560
When we have stability,
we can be tranquil.

366
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,880
When we are tranquil,
we can be at ease.

367
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,650
When we are at ease,
we can be deliberate.

368
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,230
And?

369
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,910
We should remain calm
in case of anything

370
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,770
and have a careful plan for it.

371
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,000
Master, stop beating my palm.

372
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,900
Or my skin will be torn.

373
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,800
His Majesty will
hold a banquet tomorrow.

374
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,350
If my palm is wounded,

375
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,710
how can I explain?

376
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,850
A sub-third rank general is
an important official.

377
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,350
With two ranks up,

378
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,680
you’ll be qualified to be a lord.

379
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,950
But you’re a girl, after all.

380
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,400
A quick promotion

381
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,430
will put you in immense danger.

382
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,520
In the court,

383
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,190
a lot of people will keep an eye on you.

384
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,280
Master,

385
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,070
His Majesty promoted me.

386
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,470
I didn’t ask for it.

387
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,500
Besides, now that I get paid
from His Majesty,

388
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,230
I have to serve him.

389
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,160
Moreover, I don’t want to get promoted

390
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,680
because I’m greedy,

391
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,070
but because this is the only way

392
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,800
to stand with you side by side

393
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,230
as early as possible.

394
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,070
I’ve been waiting for this day

395
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,310
for quite a long time.

396
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,990
If I can’t make it,

397
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,470
even if you ask me

398
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,800
to copy the rules of Jifeng Pavilion

399
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,700
for a hundred or a thousand times,

400
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,400
I can’t calm down.

401
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,950
Master,

402
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,190
you asked me

403
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,420
to keep an eye on Tang Qianzi.

404
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,040
I’ve been doing that.

405
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,400
Today in the court,

406
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,800
I kind of saw him

407
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,110
gesture to someone.

408
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,310
I know that.

409
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,350
Master.

410
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,230
Also,

411
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,470
Su Ming defected

412
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,950
and went to the Left Tribe of Huku.

413
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,680
During the fight in Lanzi,

414
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,520
Lord of Right Pudun

415
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,710
kept receiving messages.

416
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,470
I suspect that

417
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,800
Tang Qianzi is the informer

418
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,220
Su Ming planted in Huangquan Pass.

419
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,950
There’s another thing, Master.

420
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,570
During the battle in Huangquan Pass,

421
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,200
I saw Duoluo twice

422
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,400
who was

423
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,640
the new Lord of Left Pudun.

424
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,520
And?

425
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,880
Duoluo looks

426
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
nearly the same as Zhuoying,

427
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,230
except for the color

428
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,710
of hair and eyes.

429
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,220
After the battle on the Red Plain,

430
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,800
Dazheng and Huku

431
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,250
haven’t had a war for years.

432
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,050
But the new Lord of Left Pudun, Duoluo,

433
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,680
led his army personally.

434
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,310
Don’t you worry that

435
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,160
other people in Huangquan Battalion

436
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,800
may have also seen his face?

437
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,280
Su Ming defected.

438
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,000
He was Zhuoying’s old acquaintance.

439
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,560
Now he serves the new master.

440
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,230
Zhuoying’s very likely
to be talked about as well.

441
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,310
Master,

442
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,520
I worry that

443
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,950
someone may make a fuss about it.

444
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,160
Master.

445
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,560
Don’t get so close.

446
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,580
I can hear you.

447
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,180
I asked you to experience yourself
in Huangquan Battalion

448
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,300
because I wanted you

449
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,350
to be steadier.

450
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,110
Unexpectedly,

451
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,230
you became fearless

452
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,190
and unrestrained.

453
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,160
If your identity is exposed,

454
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,590
have you thought about the consequences?

455
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,380
I wasn’t unrestrained.

456
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,830
I came all the way back,

457
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,950
because I was eager to see someone.

458
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,590
Master.

459
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,850
Master.

460
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,000
Master.

461
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,820
Master.

462
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,940
Zhuoying.

463
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,430
Are you all right?

464
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,800
I’m fine.

465
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,760
Go.

466
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,280
Take me to my new room.

467
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,040
Let’s go.

468
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,590
You have no idea.

469
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,600
Master detained a jar
of Three Flower Spirits.

470
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,560
Before you came back,

471
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,470
he wouldn’t uncork it.

472
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,190
Now we can enjoy it.

473
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,230
Shortly after you left,

474
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,760
Master transplanted the Jifeng Tree

475
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,830
to this new mansion.

476
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,950
I had thought it would be affected.

477
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,230
Unexpectedly, it’s growing better.

478
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,470
I guess it’s also expecting

479
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,160
your return.

480
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,350
It looks so beautiful.

481
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,430
The Jifeng Tree isn’t the only one

482
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,710
who expects your return.

483
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,350
Knowing you were coming,

484
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,870
Master asked me

485
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,680
to arrange a room for you.

486
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,350
Your room is even

487
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,850
better decorated than his.

488
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,500
He did?

489
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:25,650
Mm.

490
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,590
Why are you flushing?

491
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,300
Ah?

492
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,760
I am?

493
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,160
Maybe I’m not used to the weather

494
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,970
after being away for a long time.

495
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,350
Then get to your room for a rest.

496
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,650
Go and check your room.

497
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,230
I asked you to experience yourself
in Huangquan Battalion

498
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,710
because I wanted you

499
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,760
to be steadier.

500
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,670
Unexpectedly,

501
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,800
you became fearless

502
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,270
and unrestrained.

503
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,520
I wasn’t unrestrained.

504
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,040
I came all the way back,

505
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,100
because I was eager to see someone.

506
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,750
You just came to the Palace

507
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,880
and you may not be familiar.

508
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,970
Let me tell you.

509
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,280
The one on the left is Fengnian Hall.

510
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,280
Zichen Hall is right ahead.

511
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,710
Today, His Majesty
is holding the banquet

512
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,070
in Zichen Hall.

513
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,520
(Wangchun Gate)
After passing Ningtai Gate,

514
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,800
(Wangchun Gate)
we’ll go west past Yu’an and Renze Palaces

515
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,110
and arrive where embroiderers
of the Fabric Office

516
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,950
usually go...

517
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,770
The North Garden.

518
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,900
What’s wrong?

519
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
When you see Zheliu,

520
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,220
you’ll know.

521
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,800
Miss Zheliu.

522
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,000
There you are, Mr. Fang.

523
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,620
Yeah.

524
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,280
Haishi and I came.

525
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,880
He just came back from the north

526
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,880
and has brought you some presents.

527
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,880
Mr. Fang Haishi has also come?

528
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,280
Congratulations, Mr. Fang Haishi.

529
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,950
You’ll have a new robe.

530
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,070
Don’t stand on ceremony, Miss Zheliu.

531
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,760
Call me Haishi.

532
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,070
I came back to report to His Majesty

533
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,270
and I’ve brought you some presents.

534
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,940
They’re not valuable.

535
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,400
Huangquan Pass is far away from here.

536
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,520
You came all the way back

537
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,070
and even brought me presents.

538
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,670
I’m quite grateful.

539
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,100
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

540
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,070
It’s me.

541
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,640
Sorry.

542
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,300
Mr. Fang Haishi,

543
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,710
could you tell me

544
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,710
which one is blue

545
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,320
and which one is purple?

546
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,250
This one is blue

547
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,000
and this is purple.

548
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,920
Then the last one

549
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,250
must be light jade green.

550
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,050
(Yulan magnolia)

551
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,470
Thank you, Mr. Fang Haishi.

552
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,710
Luckily, you and Mr. Fang

553
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,800
happened to be here.

554
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,200
Or I couldn’t distinguish them

555
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,430
and it would be doomed.

556
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,180
Where’s Aunt Su?

557
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,870
It’s sunny today.

558
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,110
I then stayed to do some embroidery

559
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,550
and asked Aunt Su

560
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,400
to walk Xiaobai.

561
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,160
Miss Zheliu,

562
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,430
you must be bored

563
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,710
to be sitting here every day.

564
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,350
Shall I take you

565
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,430
to go fishing

566
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,710
when I’m not on duty?

567
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,280
Fishing?

568
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,110
Sounds interesting.

569
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,000
But I don’t know how to fish.

570
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,110
It doesn’t matter.

571
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,230
I’m good at fishing.

572
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,210
Wait for me, Miss Zheliu.

573
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,470
I’ll come and get you.

574
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,520
All right.

575
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,250
I’ll wait, then.

576
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,000
You’re busy, Mr. Fang.

577
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,800
Don’t forget

578
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,070
what you promised me.

579
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,070
I won’t.

580
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,760
Zheliu

581
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,800
became blind

582
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,480
when the Fabric Office was poisoned.

583
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,320
No one in the Fabric Office

584
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,520
managed to survive,

585
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,430
but Zheliu.

586
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,540
Luckily,

587
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
she can do the embroidery.

588
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,550
When she has work to do,

589
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,270
she can ease out her anxiety.

590
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,790
If only we were in the Palace that day!

591
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,160
What a shock!

592
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,830
Yeah.

593
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,680
Even so,

594
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,200
I still feel lucky.

595
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,470
Do you think

596
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,550
someone killed them
to get rid of witnesses?

597
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,560
Right.

598
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,200
One day,

599
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,000
I’ll find the murderers

600
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,310
and kill them.

601
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,190
We’ll certainly avenge Zheliu.

602
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,710
But the murderers

603
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,070
are deeply concealing themselves.

604
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,760
Haishi?

605
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,040
Nothing.

606
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,590
I’m just thinking

607
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,880
as long as you and I are here,

608
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,350
we’ll certainly find out the murderers

609
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,310
and avenge the girls

610
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,720
of the Fabric Office.

611
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,590
All right.

612
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,350
Let’s not talk about it.

613
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,370
Aren’t you going to see Consort Shurong?

614
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,800
It’s not convenient for me
to go with you.

615
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,070
This is where we leave each other.

616
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,190
Fine. I’m going to see her.

617
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,400
Haishi.

618
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,280
Don’t worry.

619
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,160
I am inferior to Consort Shurong.

620
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,190
I know how far to go.

621
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,670
I’m leaving.

622
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,220
Mm.

623
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,900
Your Highness,

624
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,520
you’ve been sitting here

625
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,570
in the thin dress
for the whole afternoon.

626
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,350
Don’t catch a cold.

627
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,700
What time is it?

628
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,020
It’s 3:00 PM.

629
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,970
I don’t know how many guests

630
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,650
there are at the banquet in Zichen Hall.

631
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,040
They must be very boisterous.

632
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,370
Bizi,

633
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,220
look at the dress.

634
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,070
Isn’t the waistline too big?

635
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,350
Your Highness,

636
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,800
this dress is the style

637
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,070
that Empress Zizan usually wore.

638
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,100
But it’s made

639
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,160
according to your size.

640
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,070
It’s not big.

641
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,310
But you’re getting thinner lately.

642
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,680
Your Highness,

643
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,560
please think twice

644
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,230
before you disguise as Empress Zizan.

645
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,900
She’s the nerve of His Majesty.

646
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,450
You mustn’t touch it.

647
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,100
If you annoy His Majesty...

648
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,040
Your Highness,

649
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,520
Mr. Fang Haishi asked to see you.

650
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,050
He has even

651
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,220
brought something.

652
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,600
It’s so considerate of him.

653
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,040
As soon as he came back,

654
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,630
he came to visit us.

655
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,200
Mr. Fang Haishi

656
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,800
works for General Tang now.

657
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,630
Lately, he’s been promoted.

658
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,300
If he meets me,

659
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,000
he’ll get hurt.

660
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,800
What shall I say to him, Your Highness?

661
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,720
Tell him I don’t feel well

662
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,080
and I can’t see him.

663
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,390
Yes.

664
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,390
Her Highness doesn’t feel well?

665
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:12,700
How long has she been sick?

666
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,020
Have you sent for a physician?

667
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,820
Yes.

668
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,150
She isn’t badly sick.

669
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,600
She’s possibly weak

670
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,160
during the change of seasons.

671
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,120
Her Highness doesn’t want

672
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,150
to infect you,

673
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,920
and she won’t get you in for a talk.

674
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,710
I brought this back

675
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,470
from the north.

676
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,190
In it is the snow lotus.

677
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,360
When made into food,

678
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,120
it’s very restorative.

679
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,700
It’s a small gift,

680
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:34,870
but it’s the thought that counts.

681
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,470
Miss Bihong,

682
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,600
please tell Her Highness

683
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
that everything is fine with me

684
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,800
and I always care for her.

685
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
I want her

686
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,450
to take good care of herself.

687
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,120
All right, Mr. Fang Haishi.

688
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,500
I’ll leave, then.

689
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,570
See you.

690
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,080
General Tang.

691
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,020
Mm.

692
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,150
Cheers.

693
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,230
Cheers.

694
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,600
Mr. Fang Haishi.

695
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,250
Why haven’t you tasted

696
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,420
any of the dishes?

697
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,750
Do you not like them?

698
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,270
Fill my cup.

699
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,500
The girls are beautiful enough
to feast the eyes.

700
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,230
I’m full already.

701
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,350
You’re right.

702
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,910
Bands and dancing girls in the Palace

703
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,630
are the best.

704
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,120
Cheers.

705
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,110
All right.

706
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,560
Cheers.

707
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,170
All right.

708
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,170
Cheers.

709
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:28,750
Yeah.

710
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,050
Everybody.

711
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,350
I think you feel restrained

712
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,190
when I’m here.

713
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,840
I’ll leave you alone, then.

714
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,070
Enjoy yourselves.

715
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,280
Jianming,

716
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,900
don’t follow me.

717
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,870
It’s a rare chance today.

718
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,360
Have a good time with them.

719
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:19,970
Here.

720
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,050
I see.

721
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,550
Let’s enjoy ourselves.

722
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,420
Lord Qinghai,

723
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,900
this is from General Fang.

724
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,530
Come on. Cheers.

725
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,140
Cheers.

726
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,320
You can enjoy the crab,

727
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,680
but don’t stare at the dancing girls.

728
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,170
Fill my cup.

729
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,570
Your Majesty.

730
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,800
We’re arriving soon.

731
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,680
Be steady. Be steady.

732
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:19,770
All right. All right.

733
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,520
Stop.

734
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,150
Land.

735
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,520
Here we are, Your Majesty.

736
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,320
Be careful, Your Majesty.

737
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,670
Be careful.

738
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,150
(Jincheng Palace)
Quickly. Quickly.

739
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,800
(Jincheng Palace)
Come on.

740
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,150
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

741
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,150
Hold His Majesty up.

742
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,120
Mind the steps. Be careful.

743
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,620
Your Majesty, be careful.

744
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,080
Yes, yes.

745
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,870
Your Majesty, it’s getting late.

746
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,520
Go to bed early.

747
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,050
Be careful with the stairs.

748
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:46,700
Fine.

749
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:47,970
All right.

750
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

751
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,250
Steady on.

752
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,910
All right.

753
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,760
Be careful with the stairs.

754
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,910
- Threshold.
- Be careful.

755
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,230
All right.

756
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,800
Be very careful.

757
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,100
Your Majesty.

758
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,670
Your Majesty, she...

759
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,170
Get out.

760
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:45,870
Zizan?

761
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
Xu.

762
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,470
Who allowed you to pretend to be Zizan?

763
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,600
Xu.

764
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,720
Do you really think
I’m too muddleheaded

765
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,150
to distinguish you

766
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,710
from Zizan?

767
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,000
You know what?

768
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,560
It’s just your luck

769
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,430
to have the same face

770
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,600
as her.

771
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,120
But you two are greatly different

772
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,760
in temperament and behavior.

773
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:28,910
You want to profit

774
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,150
from pretending to be Zizan, right?

775
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,770
Fine. I’ll satisfy you.

776
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,150
Don’t call me by my name.

777
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,990
Xu.

778
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,320
Xu, Xu, Xu.

779
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,600
Zizan, why did you bite me?

780
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,240
I can’t fall asleep.

781
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,300
Your feet get cold again?

782
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:06,810
Put them in my arms.

783
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:07,440
When I warm them,

784
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,560
you can fall asleep soon.

785
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,390
I’m not cold.

786
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:12,990
I’m angry, instead.

787
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,440
You’re quite narrow-minded.

788
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,240
You’re always angry.

789
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,000
Today, Zhunian sent some people again.

790
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,520
Luckily, you were not home today.

791
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:26,070
I drove them away

792
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,240
without hesitation.

793
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,140
Oh?

794
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,310
Stop helping them

795
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,830
in private.

796
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,740
My father is a very greedy man.

797
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,280
They keep coming to you

798
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,290
over and over

799
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,280
just because they think

800
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,340
you’re softhearted.

801
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:43,870
Xu,

802
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,390
I don’t allow anyone to deceive you

803
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,350
or bully you.

804
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,730
Then,

805
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,350
you should live longer than me.

806
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,910
I’m so softhearted

807
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,800
that everybody can bully me.

808
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,870
I’ll live longer than you.

809
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,950
Because,

810
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,310
if I die early,

811
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,240
