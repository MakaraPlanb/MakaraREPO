25
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,479
What are you thinking about?

26
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,240
Nothing.

27
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:49,839
The air is fresh here.

28
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,399
The moon is lovely, too.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,880
Master, look.

30
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,839
The moon is full.

31
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:57,880
Isn’t it the same

32
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,759
as the one we saw the other day?

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,479
I didn’t lie to you, did I?

34
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:02,360
The moon

35
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,279
hasn’t changed over thousands of years.

36
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,720
Life has been endless
from generation to generation.

37
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:09,039
The moon just looks similar
from year to year.

38
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,479
It must be telling us

39
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,000
there’s something in the world

40
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,119
that’s eternal.

41
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,119
Nothing is eternal.

42
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,520
Time brings great changes to the world.

43
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,839
The full moon

44
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,000
does wane in the end.

45
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:28,399
The so-called eternity

46
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,759
may

47
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,919
only exist in people’s minds.

48
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,759
As long as it exists.

49
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,440
The quilt is new.

50
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,320
I’ve aired it in the day.

51
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,679
I live alone.

52
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,080
Stay here for a couple of days
if you don’t mind.

53
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:08,639
Thank you.

54
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,800
It’s good enough.

55
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:12,600
The place is small.

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,000
Haishi,

57
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,239
we can share a bed.

58
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,600
Sure.

59
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:34,920
He’s stupid.

60
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,720
Someone presented a secret memorial

61
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,640
telling on him for adopting a Huku spy

62
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,799
and claimed the evidence was conclusive.

63
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,040
He still left the capital

64
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,559
with Fang Haishi
in such a critical moment

65
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,959
to tour the scenic spots.

66
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,480
Su Ming defected

67
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,239
to the Left Tribe of Huku.

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,279
Lord Qinghai had expected that early.

69
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,279
After the battle of Red Plain,

70
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:57,440
he insisted on bringing him back

71
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,519
regardless of objection.

72
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,320
The secret memorial was

73
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,920
directed against Jifeng Pavilion.

74
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,239
If I hadn’t suppressed

75
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,119
the news

76
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,359
and the words got out,

77
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,399
had he ever thought
about the consequences?

78
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,239
He is not that kind of person

79
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,279
who is afraid of rumors.

80
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,720
He surely won’t take it to heart.

81
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,119
I’m the one who is in a dilemma!

82
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:17,359
Enough.

83
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,720
You may leave now.

84
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

85
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,279
I’m leaving.

86
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:35,320
Mu Deqing.

87
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,040
Mu Deqing!

88
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,200
I’m here!

89
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,160
I’m here.

90
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,720
Well, what happened?

91
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,239
Your Majesty.

92
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,799
What can I do for you?

93
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,079
Change the candle.

94
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:02,200
Well...

95
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,640
Your Majesty.

96
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,480
The candle is new.

97
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,160
Change it again.

98
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,399
Or I’ll condense you into a candle.

99
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,359
Yes, yes.

100
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,239
I’ll change it now.

101
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,399
I’ll change it now.

102
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,410
(Flowered forehead is from last night.)
(Behind the window she smiles brightly.)

103
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:33,400
(We first met when peonies bloomed.
Yet we had to part too soon.)

104
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,679
Your Highness.

105
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,559
It’s past 1:00 AM now.

106
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,399
Why don’t you go to bed?

107
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,359
Mr. Fang Haishi is considerate.

108
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,640
Bizi,

109
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,279
do you think the Dream Catcher

110
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,760
could really drive away

111
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,239
my nightmares?

112
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,279
How is

113
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,559
Xiaoguai doing in Fabric Office?

114
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,200
Zheliu’s Xiaobai

115
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,200
likes it very much.

116
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,640
They live together

117
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,959
in the cotton nest
you made for it before.

118
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,160
That’s good.

119
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,720
That’s good.

120
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,279
You woke up.

121
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,160
Mother.

122
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,920
These are...?

123
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,399
New clothes I made for you.

124
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,279
Although you may not wear it,

125
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,160
I still make you a new suit every year.

126
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,720
Look.

127
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,959
You came back as soon as it was done.

128
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:21,600
Try it on.

129
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:22,920
Let me see if it fits well.

130
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,559
Thank you, Mother.

131
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,559
Where’s Jianming?

132
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,880
He got up early.

133
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,279
I was going to
gather seafood on the beach.

134
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,320
But he went instead.

135
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,840
He asked me to stay home with you.

136
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,479
Gather seafood?

137
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,840
Look!

138
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,359
Why is he still here?

139
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,000
You’re stupid.

140
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,159
Why didn’t you catch one?

141
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:06,400
Look at ours.

142
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:07,440
Look.

143
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,560
- Yes!
- Sure!

144
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,159
Why didn’t you even

145
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,479
catch one?

146
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:11,719
You didn’t catch one.

147
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,760
It’s time to eat!

148
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,559
Let’s go!

149
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:14,119
Time to eat!

150
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,479
Time to eat!

151
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,799
Why do you monkey about

152
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,799
as my mother does?

153
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,039
After leaving the capital,

154
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,400
I find that I’ve been
working hard these years.

155
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,760
I barely relaxed.

156
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,000
Give me more time.

157
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,400
I’ve dug for a while,

158
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,640
but I didn’t find any crabs.

159
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,440
You can’t find crabs here.

160
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,200
Can’t I?

161
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,119
The kids told me

162
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,919
I could dig them here.

163
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,080
Follow me.

164
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,280
They said I was stupid.

165
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,320
When you were young,

166
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,760
did you often catch crabs?

167
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,599
Sure.

168
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,679
I grew up in a fishing village

169
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,719
with my parents.

170
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,919
Of course, I did.

171
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,400
What about you?

172
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,520
What did you do when you were young?

173
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,799
I was sent to the Palace

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,400
to be a study companion for the princes.

175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,159
But I usually sneaked out
of the Palace with His Majesty.

176
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,919
Do you know what we did?

177
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,320
What did you do?

178
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,640
Made sightseeing tours.

179
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,960
Hung out in street.

180
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,440
You were actually unruly.

181
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,919
Look! Have a look!

182
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,840
This is fresh.

183
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,080
We’re empty-handed today.

184
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,520
We have to buy some seafood

185
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,479
and give it to Mother

186
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,559
when we go back home.

187
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,200
Have some fresh fish and shrimps!

188
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,559
Let’s take a look over there.

189
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,400
I want some kelp.

190
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:13,159
Okay.

191
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,760
Come. Have a look.

192
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,200
All the fish and shrimps

193
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,599
were caught this morning.

194
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,840
How about buying some?

195
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,719
I want 0.5kg of razor clams.

196
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,000
1kg of crabs,

197
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,440
half big and half small.

198
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,159
Mix them after you weigh them.

199
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:30,479
I’ll also take 0.25kg of sea snails

200
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,440
and 1kg of clams.

201
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,039
OK.

202
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,320
How much are they?

203
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:35,359
1,000 copper coins.

204
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,080
1,000 copper coins?

205
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,559
Yes.

206
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,080
They’re worth

207
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,359
500 coins at most.

208
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,239
500 coins?

209
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,840
No, it’s...

210
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:47,960
Forget it.

211
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:49,400
Let’s go over there and have a look.

212
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,039
Come.

213
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,760
Wait a minute.

214
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:52,479
I’ll take 500 coins.

215
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,159
So,

216
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,719
in the future,

217
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,119
please come often to support me.

218
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,359
- What do you think?
- Thank you, sir.

219
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,679
I’ll steam the big crabs

220
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:04,239
and husk the small ones

221
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,280
to cook porridge for you.

222
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,159
For those we can’t eat,

223
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,280
I’ll keep them in water.

224
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,599
They’ll live longer.

225
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,400
Razor clams and clams

226
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,960
can be stir-fried.

227
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,039
Tell you what,

228
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,440
I’m a good cook.

229
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
I’ll cook them for you when we get back.

230
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,880
Let’s go.

231
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,640
See you next time.

232
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,880
Your mother hasn’t come yet.

233
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:33,840
Here.

234
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:35,320
Dinner is served.

235
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,880
Jianming, you’re great.

236
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,960
You gathered so much seafood
the first time.

237
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,760
Here.

238
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,960
Have some more.

239
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,159
Tomorrow, go to sea with me.

240
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,200
He is an imperial court official.

241
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:50,200
Why should he go to sea?

242
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,760
Is there any fisherman
who doesn’t go to sea?

243
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,679
If there is, he must be a joke.

244
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,640
Have more soup.

245
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,520
Except for fish,

246
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,080
I also added dried oysters in the soup.

247
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,799
It is good for men.

248
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,479
Mother!

249
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,320
I wasn’t wrong, was I?

250
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:08,080
Why are you so anxious?

251
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:14,000
How about the soup?

252
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,559
It’s delicious.

253
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,960
Tomorrow, let’s

254
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,640
take Jianming to cast nets.

255
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,599
He must learn how to cast a net,

256
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,320
otherwise, you’ll have no fish to eat.

257
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,919
Mother,

258
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,520
if you keep nagging like this, I...

259
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,239
I can’t stay any longer.

260
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,440
Look,

261
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:34,960
you’re talking nonsense again.

262
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,159
The wind is in the north these two days
and the tide is going to fall.

263
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
In a couple of days,

264
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,960
take Jianming to the beach
to pick up seafood.

265
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,200
I won’t go.

266
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:45,719
Jianming.

267
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,080
You’re from inland.

268
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,640
You haven’t seen beach comb, have you?

269
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,599
It’s fun.

270
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,039
I’ll take you there.

271
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,840
If it’s as fun as you said,

272
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,880
I’ll definitely go.

273
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,599
I always think Jianming is considerate.

274
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,320
He appreciates my kindness.

275
00:13:59,479 --> 00:13:59,960
Here.

276
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,400
Have some more, Jianming.

277
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:03,799
Thanks.

278
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,440
Jianming.

279
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,119
Aunt.

280
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:18,679
Sit down.

281
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:19,799
Yes.

282
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:30,760
I’ve always wanted to talk with you.

283
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,119
Haishi is a poor child.

284
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,200
She didn’t have a happy childhood.

285
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,599
When she was very young,

286
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,039
her father died.

287
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,880
I couldn’t accompany her, either.

288
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,919
She’s been away from home

289
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,799
since she was young.

290
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,880
As her mother...

291
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,080
Aunt, don’t worry.

292
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,719
Haishi has been doing well

293
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,719
in the capital these years.

294
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,200
Her colleagues care about her.

295
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:01,799
Everyone likes her.

296
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,000
What about you?

297
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,159
Do you like her, too?

298
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,280
Jianming,

299
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,599
could you promise me one thing?

300
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:15,919
Sure.

301
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,080
I can’t accompany Haishi

302
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,359
all the time.

303
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,159
When you return to the capital,

304
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,239
please take good care of her.

305
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,000
Don’t leave her hungry or cold.

306
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,840
Don’t let her be wronged

307
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,080
or unhappy.

308
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:34,799
All right.

309
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,400
I promise you.

310
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,080
Let me help you.

311
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,280
Mother, where’s Jianming?

312
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,320
When he got up in the morning,

313
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,960
he found the roof leaking.

314
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,640
So he went to buy some things

315
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,919
to fix it.

316
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:04,039
Aunt Ye.

317
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:09,799
Can I help you?

318
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,760
The wind is rising.

319
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,559
My husband is still out at sea.

320
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
If it rains,

321
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,320
the seafood I’ve dried

322
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:16,400
will go moldy.

323
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,799
Would you do me a favor?

324
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,760
All right.

325
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,400
Haishi.

326
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,880
I’m going out for a while.

327
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,039
I’ll be back soon.

328
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,080
Mother?

329
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,239
Let go of me.

330
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,799
Take your swords away.

331
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,840
My family is far away in the capital.

332
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,160
I’m alone.

333
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,000
No one will come to save me.

334
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,839
- Drop the nonsense!
- Leave my mother alone.

335
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:17,839
Sweetie.

336
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,719
Didn’t you bring anyone?

337
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,880
You can’t hurt me with so few men.

338
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,079
Fang Haishi!

339
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,359
You’re so arrogant!

340
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,680
We can kill you

341
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,839
in a second.

342
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,160
Have a try, then.

343
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:46,079
However,

344
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,199
we don’t want to kill you.

345
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,719
Instead,

346
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,160
we want to make friends with you.

347
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,560
As long as you write a confession,

348
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,239
admitting that Fang Zhu
has adopted a Huku spy,

349
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:58,199
we’ll give you
ten thousand taels of gold.

350
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:00,400
Your target is my master?

351
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,319
Are you Su Ming’s men?

352
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,000
It doesn’t matter who hired us.

353
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:07,040
What matters is

354
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,640
between ten thousand taels of gold

355
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:11,760
and your mother’s death,

356
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,119
what would you choose?

357
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,640
Bring me the brush and ink.

358
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:04,560
Catch them!

359
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:05,719
Master.

360
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:10,520
Master?

361
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:12,520
Mother.

362
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,479
I’ll explain to you later.

363
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,560
Lord Qinghai is well informed
as we expected.

364
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,640
You came so fast.

365
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,079
Or what do you think?

366
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,680
Do you think by buying off a villager

367
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,319
and eradicating all the sentries

368
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,560
deployed near Ye’s house

369
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:27,040
by Jifeng Pavilion,

370
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,640
you can block my eyes and ears

371
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,160
and let me be butchered at your will?

372
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,280
Kill them!

373
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,239
Haishi, be careful!

374
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:56,400
Hold on to me!

375
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,640
Haishi!

376
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,040
We achieved nothing today.

377
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:01,959
But having Lord Qinghai’s

378
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:02,560
favorite disciple die with me

379
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,239
is worth it!

380
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:05,520
Master!

381
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,640
Haishi!

382
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:10,880
Lord!

383
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,560
Leave them alive.

384
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,160
Fang Jianming.

385
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,359
Haishi is your sweetheart.

386
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,319
It’s better this way.

387
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:20,239
Take her ashore.

388
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,040
Are you awake?

389
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,560
Master.

390
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,400
Who permitted you to
risk your life for me?

391
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,760
As long as you’re all right,

392
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,520
it’s worth it.

393
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,359
Didn’t you promise me in Lanzi

394
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,239
that you wouldn’t play heroes again?

395
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,439
Master.

396
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,040
Don’t blame me again.

397
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,359
I feel dizzy.

398
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,000
You might’ve got hit in the head.

399
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,920
Get some more sleep

400
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,839
and you’ll feel better.

401
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,560
Lord.

402
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:40,760
What about Young Master?

403
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:41,319
He’s fine.

404
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,479
Is anyone alive?

405
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,319
Only one.

406
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,479
We’ve held him in a shop

407
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,560
of Jifeng Pavilion,

408
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,359
waiting for your instructions.

409
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,199
Take him back to Tianqi City.

410
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,119
Yes.

411
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,760
Fortunately, His Majesty

412
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,400
got the secret memorial under control.

413
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:02,239
Lord,

414
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,560
Su Ming is vicious.

415
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,599
Secret Force

416
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:05,640
should take precautions early.

417
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,119
It needs a long-term plan.

418
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:09,599
Nobody in the capital has seen Duoluo,

419
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,439
the new Lord of Left Pudun of Huku.

420
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,560
The world is full of people
who look similar.

421
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,199
There’s no evidence to prove

422
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,520
the relationship between
Zhuoying and Duoluo.

423
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:18,319
That’s right.

424
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Even if someone has met Duoluo

425
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,160
at Huangquan Battalion,

426
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,760
I don’t think he has the courage

427
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,199
to come out and identify him.

428
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,160
It’s a double-edged sword.

429
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,640
Tell Zhuoying

430
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
to be extremely careful.

431
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,319
Yes.

432
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,760
You finally came back.

433
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,160
It’s been days since

434
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,640
the prisoner was sent to Tianqi City

435
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,920
to be on trial,

436
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,599
yet you wouldn’t come back.

437
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,280
So,

438
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,680
was it because of the unique
coastal scenery of Linjie County?

439
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,319
I ran some personal errands.

440
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:52,839
Where’s Fang Haishi?

441
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,920
He just came back.

442
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:56,479
I just promoted him.

443
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,479
As a vassal,

444
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,479
is this his way of showing loyalty?

445
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,359
What’s wrong with

446
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:05,319
all the people of Jifeng Pavilion?

447
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,479
It has nothing to do with him.

448
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,439
I stayed in Yuezhou

449
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:12,239
because I supposed

450
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,040
if I wasn’t in the capital,

451
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:15,880
those who hid in dark

452
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,920
would give themselves away.

453
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,880
But I didn’t expect that

454
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:21,280
they would follow me to Yuezhou.

455
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,439
They were caught because of

456
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,079
trying to coerce Haishi.

457
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,640
We scored a lucky hit.

458
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,959
All the excuses.

459
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,479
Get up.

460
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,239
Thank you, Your Majesty.

461
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,920
Keep an eye on

462
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:38,359
the interrogation.

463
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,079
I’ll give you three days

464
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,959
to find the truth.

465
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,160
If you fail,

466
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,719
Fang Haishi will be punished for you.

467
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:46,680
Yes.

468
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,120
(Jingcheng Hall)

469
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,680
Lord.

470
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,680
Lord.

471
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:57,760
We’ve made progress.

472
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,719
The killer can’t take it anymore.

473
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,400
He’s willing to say

474
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,599
who hired him.

475
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,800
But...

476
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,479
But what?

477
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:05,560
But he said

478
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,199
he must tell you in person.

479
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,960
(Jingcheng Hall)

480
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:12,839
Wake up!

481
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:13,760
Wake up!

482
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,800
How dare you sleep!

483
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:17,800
Raise your head!

484
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,079
Raise your head!

485
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:20,800
- Lord.
- Lord.

486
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,479
Let me go.

487
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:26,640
- Lord.
- Lord.

488
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:30,560
Do you want to see me?

489
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,520
Lord Qinghai,

490
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,800
please let them free me.

491
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,400
Lord Qinghai.

492
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,040
Please...

493
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:40,839
Please let them free me.

494
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,400
If they let me go,

495
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,199
I...

496
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,560
I’ll tell you who is behind it.

497
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:53,199
If you tell me the truth,

498
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,439
they’ll send you to a place

499
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,880
where no one can find you.

500
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,359
You’ll live

501
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,599
the rest of your life comfortably.

502
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,800
You promise?

503
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,119
I promise.

504
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,199
Okay.

505
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,680
I’ll tell you.

506
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,920
The one who hired us

507
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,079
is Lord Chang.

508
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,920
Lord Chang?

509
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:20,839
Ridiculous!

510
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,400
It’s been less than a year

511
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,119
since Jichang returned to the court.

512
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:24,280
Even if it’s been years,

513
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,199
he’d rather find spiritual sustenance

514
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,839
in flowers and birds
instead of state affairs.

515
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:29,439
How could he do such things?

516
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:30,599
In my opinion,

517
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:31,959
the killer is

518
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,040
obviously directed

519
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:34,040
to plant the crime on Jichang.

520
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,359
You don’t really believe

521
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,839
what he said, do you?

522
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,800
Who do you think
is the mastermind, then?

523
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,119
I think

524
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,800
the killer

525
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,439
is one of Su Ming’s men.

526
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,920
Under Su’s direction,

527
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,640
he called white black

528
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,839
and distorted truth.

529
00:27:59,239 --> 00:27:59,959
You’d better

530
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,520
kill such a scumbag who deliberately

531
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,680
muddies the waters.

532
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,359
What if...?

533
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,800
I mean

534
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,199
what if Su Ming

535
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,640
isn’t the only one in the court

536
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:12,680
who is capable of doing this?

537
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,319
He’s in Huku.

538
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,239
He can’t come in person
to clear himself.

539
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,719
Don’t you

540
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,079
want to know more about it?

541
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,800
You want to use it as bait.

542
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,040
Your Majesty,

543
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,839
please call Lord Chang to the Palace.

544
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,359
No.

545
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,640
Jichang is my only brother.

546
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:55,160
If he is going to scheme against me...

547
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,680
Because he is

548
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,199
your only brother,

549
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:03,000
he has to come to the Palace.

550
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,079
You need to prove his innocence.

551
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,800
And he must prove himself, too.

552
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,520
Miss Ju comes.

553
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,079
She is the only one who becomes

554
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,479
Manager of Clothing
at such a young age

555
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,599
in Dazheng.

556
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,479
Yes.

557
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,599
What a shame!

558
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,640
She becomes blind at such an age.

559
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,920
What are you looking at?

560
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:31,719
Shouldn’t you be on duty now?

561
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,199
Young Master.

562
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,719
(Essence of Beauty Reveals Itself)
It’s not time

563
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,439
for our shift.

564
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,400
What did I tell you before?

565
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,040
It’s better to get ready

566
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,880
a quarter earlier than a minute later.

567
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:41,839
Go ahead.

568
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:42,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

569
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,000
Zheliu.

570
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,160
Mr. Fang.

571
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,800
People said Lord Qinghai
returned to the Palace today.

572
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,800
I come to deliver

573
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,000
this year’s spring clothes.

574
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:04,880
Please inform him.

575
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,839
Master is in there.

576
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:08,040
Please follow me.

577
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,800
Lord.

578
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,079
As you instructed,

579
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,640
we recorded all the statements

580
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,040
made by the killer,

581
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:27,359
and had him signed up

582
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:28,560
for future use.

583
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,640
Don’t file the material yet.

584
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,400
Wait until I acquire
His Majesty’s instructions.

585
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:35,239
Yes.

586
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:36,959
Master.

587
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,000
Miss Ju comes.

588
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,800
Invite her in.

589
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,319
Lord.

590
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,880
I’m leaving, then.

591
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:50,520
Greetings, Lord Qinghai.

592
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,000
Rise.

593
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:54,280
Lord Qinghai.

594
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,239
These are this year’s spring clothes.

595
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,000
I made them myself.

596
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,680
Because I’m in mourning,

597
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,319
it’s a little later.

598
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,400
Please forgive me.

599
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,959
Thank you, Miss Ju.

600
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,479
Zhuoying, give us a minute.

601
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,400
Yes, Master.

602
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,640
You have something to say?

603
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:35,000
Lord Qinghai.

604
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:36,599
I found

605
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,719
these strips of cloth

606
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,880
in the late manager’s room.

607
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,400
I examined them.

608
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,319
At first glance,

609
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,560
these are indeed messages

610
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,680
sent to her

611
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,920
by the informants of Jifeng Pavilion
in Hanzhou.

612
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:50,479
But Miss Ju used to tell me

613
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,319
to burn the important messages

614
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,560
after reading.

615
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:54,839
Besides,

616
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:56,680
if you feel them carefully,

617
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,640
you’ll find the subtle difference

618
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:01,119
between the embroidery technique
of them and that of Miss Ju’s.

619
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:03,880
She hid them in her room.

620
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:04,959
I wonder if they have

621
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:07,119
anything to do with her death…

622
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,800
Miss Ju has passed away.

623
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,439
It’s unnecessary to

624
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,479
get her involved

625
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,479
and bring disgrace on her.

626
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,359
I’ll investigate it.

627
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,479
You needn’t bother about it.

628
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,479
Yes. I understand.

629
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
No matter serving before the emperor

630
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:24,400
or dedicating among the people,

631
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:26,199
you just can’t

632
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,319
escape from in-fighting.

633
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:30,280
The capital appears calm on the surface,

634
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,239
but underneath it are rapid streams.

635
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,239
It has never been calm and tranquil.

636
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:38,079
Protect yourself.

637
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,079
The future may not be peaceful.

638
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:18,959
Master.

639
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:20,800
When did Zheliu

640
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,079
join us?

641
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:22,880
I’ve never heard you

642
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,839
mention it.

643
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,719
We need someone to take over

644
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,280
Miss Ju’s position.

645
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,479
Zheliu is willing to

646
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,119
inherit her aunt’s unfulfilled wish.

647
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:32,439
Unfulfilled wish?

648
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Miss Ju

649
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:35,959
was so thoughtful,

650
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:37,199
yet she was murdered.

651
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,040
Now Zheliu is blind.

652
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:41,800
I don’t think she can

653
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,839
inherit the unfulfilled wish.

654
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:46,959
If I hadn’t

655
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,800
left the Palace to

656
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:48,560
carry out a task,

657
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,239
Zheliu

658
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:51,160
wouldn’t have been blind.

659
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,560
You were far away in Huku.

660
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,359
How can you be blamed

661
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:57,199
for what happened in the capital?

662
00:33:58,239 --> 00:33:59,160
I swear

663
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,640
I must protect her

664
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:03,199
and never let her

665
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:04,880
get any hurt again.

666
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,560
(Gentle and Warm Breeze)

667
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,600
The dragon flies in the sky.

668
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:19,520
Well...

669
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,000
Here’s a decree of His Majesty!

670
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,600
(Wind Rises and the Moon Emerges)

671
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:33,600
Eunuch Mu.

672
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:34,919
Your Highness.

673
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,159
Here’s a decree of His Majesty.

674
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,479
Get ready to receive it.

675
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:39,080
I’m ready to receive the edict.

676
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,120
Here’s a decree of His Majesty.

677
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,479
(Imperial Edict)
I’m too busy with state affairs

678
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,719
to spare time recently.

679
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:50,959
Longing to see my brother,

680
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,159
I invite Jichang over
to the Palace today

681
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,560
at 3:00 PM for reunion.

682
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,320
(Imperial Edict)
Respect this.

683
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,560
I will do as His Majesty wishes.

684
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,439
Your Highness,

685
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,520
now that the edict was delivered,

686
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,239
I won’t disturb you any longer.

687
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:20,719
Eunuch Mu.

688
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:22,719
Well...

689
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,560
Everything in my mansion
is bestowed by my elder brother.

690
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:28,239
I have no valuable things.

691
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,840
I may as well give you

692
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,520
a little falcon

693
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:34,479
after the eggs are hatched.

694
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,719
No, thanks.

695
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,719
I’m a servant in the Palace.

696
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:42,000
How dare I keep a falcon?

697
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,360
I appreciate your kindness.

698
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,159
See you soon.

699
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:47,679
Walk Eunuch Mu out.

700
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,560
Go.

701
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,960
(Wind Rises and the Moon Emerges)

702
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,479
Come.

703
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,719
Wake up.

704
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,760
Leave me alone.

705
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:31,879
What are you doing?

706
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,919
Let go of me!

707
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,239
Where are you going to take me?

708
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:37,560
Let go!

709
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:38,479
Let go!

710
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,639
I want to see Lord Qinghai!

711
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,159
I want to see Lord Qinghai!

712
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,840
Listen carefully!

713
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:45,080
This is Lord Qinghai’s order.

714
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,280
If you resist again,

715
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:49,280
you’ll be dead.

716
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:56,399
Behave.

717
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:58,520
Take him away.

718
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:14,120
Both of you,

719
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,120
if any accidents happen in the Palace,

720
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:18,479
you’ll be dead.

721
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,520
- Yes.
- Yes.

722
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,399
- Go.
- Go.

723
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,199
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

724
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,000
I came by the imperial decree.

725
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,760
Please inform His Majesty.

726
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,520
His Majesty has some
urgent business to attend to.

727
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,360
He’ll come soon.

728
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:37,360
Your Highness,

729
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,000
please wait in Jingcheng Hall
for a moment.

730
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:39,560
Sure.

731
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:40,439
Thanks.

732
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:52,919
Your Highness!

733
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
Your Highness!

734
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,560
Help, Your Highness!

735
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:56,439
Your Highness!

736
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,760
They caught me!

737
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,520
Your Highness!

738
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:00,520
- Your Highness!
- What are you talking about?

739
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,679
I’ve never seen you before.

740
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:03,000
Cut the nonsense.

741
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,159
Your Highness.

742
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,000
You gave us orders.

743
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,399
Now you pretend you know nothing.

744
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,840
Are you going to kick down the ladder?

745
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,840
I’ve never seen you before.

746
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,479
Don’t sling mud at me!

747
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,280
Yes.

748
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,399
You said Lord Chang gave you orders.

749
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,760
Do you have any evidence?

750
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:20,520
Big brother.

751
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:21,560
Big brother, help me!

752
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,159
Big brother.

753
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,479
I don’t know this traitor.

754
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,280
I don’t know him at all!

755
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:26,959
Big brother!

756
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,719
Don’t come over!

757
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:29,719
How stupid you are!

758
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:31,280
You dare do violence here!

759
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:33,280
If you dare touch him,

760
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:35,360
I’ll make you suffer 100 times
as much as he does!

761
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Why don’t you make

762
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,959
a full confession to His Majesty?

763
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:40,879
He may spare your life.

764
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:43,399
Do you think His Majesty will fool you?

765
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:46,760
Tell the truth now.

766
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:53,000
Big brother!

767
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:53,800
Jichang.

768
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,120
Big brother.

769
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:03,080
Big brother, help me.

770
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:14,959
Big brother.

771
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,080
Servant!

772
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:27,199
Take Lord Chang
to the side hall to rest.

773
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,479
How is he?

774
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,879
Your Majesty,

775
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,040
His Highness was so frightened

776
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,239
that he wet himself.

777
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:48,360
There was no serious harm.

778
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,800
I’ll write some prescriptions

779
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:52,280
to soothe his nerves.

780
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:53,760
Go ahead.

781
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,639
I’m leaving.

782
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
Jichang,

783
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,159
did you hear that?

784
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,159
Have a good rest.

785
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:14,239
Big brother.

786
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,000
Since the Rebellion of Prince Yi,

787
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:20,360
our clan has been on the wane.

788
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,199
Of our siblings,

789
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,239
only

790
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,800
you and I

791
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,040
keep each other company now.

792
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,679
Every day, I only think about

793
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:35,959
rendering service to you

794
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,399
and pleasing you.

795
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:40,239
How…?

796
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:41,679
How dare I

797
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,439
let you down?

798
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,919
Please make a judicious judgment.

799
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,080
I would rather die

800
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,159
to prove my innocence.

801
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:00,159
Don’t be afraid.

802
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,520
Yes.

803
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,000
Now there’re only you and me.

804
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:11,800
In due course,

805
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,879
I’ll announce to the world

806
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,399
and ask people
to find our clan relatives

807
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,520
that have scattered around the country

808
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:20,560
in the Rebellion.

809
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:24,199
Maybe we’ll find some survivors.

810
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:43,560
Your Majesty, please retract the order!

811
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,520
During the Rebellion of Prince Yi,

812
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,040
the princes,

813
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,080
consorts,

814
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:49,959
infantes

815
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:50,679
and princesses

816
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,280
either died or scattered.

817
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:53,959
Except for Lord Chang,

818
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,040
who stayed in Zhunian as a hostage,

819
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,879
there was no one left.

820
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,159
If the decree is issued,

821
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,399
in case

822
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,399
anyone claims

823
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,959
to be your lost brother,

824
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:06,040
how can we determine?

825
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,120
Yes.

826
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,479
The purity of royal blood

827
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,840
mustn’t be compromised.

828
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,399
Please be prudent with it.

829
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,280
Your Majesty, please retract the order!

830
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,239
Lord Qinghai,

831
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,560
why didn’t you say anything?

832
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:26,800
Your Majesty,

833
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:28,320
I think

834
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,919
it’s a family matter.

835
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,239
We shouldn’t meddle with it.

836
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:38,040
Lord Qinghai is right.

837
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:40,439
I’ve made up my mind.

838
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:41,800
No further discussion.

839
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,320
(Imperial Edict)
Here’s a decree of His Majesty.

840
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,199
Of all members of the royal clan

841
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,719
(Imperial Announcement)
dispersed in the Rebellion…

842
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:53,879
Those who can prove their identities

843
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,040
or have those proved by other people…

844
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,639
Either at home or abroad,

845
00:42:58,879 --> 00:43:00,399
can restore their titles

846
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,879
and manor estates.

847
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:03,280
Respect this.

848
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:04,320
Respect this.

849
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,880
(Imperial Edict)

850
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,520
Surname.

851
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,159
Chu.

852
00:43:09,399 --> 00:43:10,280
First name, Danchen.

853
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,239
According to the clan hierarchy,

854
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,879
I rank as His Majesty’s uncle.

855
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,919
Uncle.

856
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,639
Lying is a felony
of deceiving the emperor.

857
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:18,600
Will you kill people just because
they mistake their relatives?

858
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,080
Do you register or not?

859
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:20,840
Yes.

860
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:22,959
I rank as His Majesty’s uncle.

861
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:25,320
Surname, Chu.

862
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,679
First name, Danchen.

863
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:29,000
Rank as His Majesty’s uncle.

864
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,600
Age, 56.

865
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:35,879
Spare my life!

866
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,280
Please spare my life!

867
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:39,399
I dare not pretend to be
an official relative again!

868
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,399
Official relative?

869
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:41,919
It’s royal relative.

870
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,639
Take him away!

871
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,239
- Yes!
- Yes!

872
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,040
Please show mercy!

873
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,520
Go!

874
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,199
Spare my life!

875
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,840
Please spare my life!

876
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:48,840
Did you see that?

877
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,439
Pretending to be a royal relative

878
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,239
is a capital crime!

879
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,199
Next.

880
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,320
Lord.

881
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,840
There’re many people
who claim to be royal relatives.

882
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,919
The Ministry of Rites
also appointed officials

883
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:01,840
to identify them one by one

884
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:02,840
at another location.

885
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,679
The fake relatives
will be punished on the spot.

886
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:07,199
Those who can’t be confirmed

887
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,199
will wait till the clues

888
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,199
are sorted out.

889
00:44:12,439 --> 00:44:12,919
Lord,

890
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,919
I still don’t understand

891
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,600
why His Majesty

892
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,959
issued such a decree on a whim.

893
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,280
In my opinion,

894
00:44:19,439 --> 00:44:21,360
even if he finds the real relatives,

895
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,159
it may bring nothing but harm.

896
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,520
Perhaps His Majesty

897
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,080
feels lonely.

898
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:29,760
That sounds fair.

899
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:31,719
Lord Chang

900
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,879
was ridiculous.

901
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,639
You took the killer to the Palace

902
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,560
to confront him.

903
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,399
It was just a test.

904
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,040
Unexpectedly, he was so frightened

905
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,760
that he wet himself.

906
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:46,679
Lord.

907
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:48,760
There was an unexpected guest
to the Ministry of Rites last night.

908
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,959
The official who was in charge said

909
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:52,919
she looked very like
Consort Nie’s daughter,

910
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,520
Lord Chang’s big sister.

911
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,080
She went straight
to the Ministry of Rites?

912
00:44:58,399 --> 00:45:00,120
Yes, she did.

913
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:01,840
They also said

914
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:03,320
she put on quite a show.

915
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,760
It’s the easiest thing
to put on a show.

916
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:06,840
No rush.

917
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,439
Wait till I come back
from Left General’s Mansion.

918
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:09,439
