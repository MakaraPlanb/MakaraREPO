Your Majesty.

26
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:48,759
Mudan.

27
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:49,995
Take a seat.

28
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,199
Lord Qinghai.

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,520
Your Highness.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,880
Mudan,

31
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,205
you’re just in time.

32
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,000
I just made tea.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,559
Try it and give me your comments.

34
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:28,880
Please, Your Highness.

35
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:39,720
How is it?

36
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,639
It smells refreshing

37
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,199
and tastes good.

38
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:45,175
It’s really the best tea.

39
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:49,725
What about Jianming’s

40
00:03:49,725 --> 00:03:50,679
zither playing?

41
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:53,039
In terms of zither,

42
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,080
no one is a better player

43
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,919
in Dazheng than Lord Qinghai.

44
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,639
Thank you for the compliment.

45
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:00,520
Mudan,

46
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,119
I remember

47
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,510
you played the zither well
when you were a child.

48
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,919
If you didn’t spend the vagrant years

49
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,559
in Nihualuo,

50
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:09,839
he wouldn’t have a chance

51
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:11,406
to make a name.

52
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,160
Well, I’m back now.

53
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,839
I’d like to ask for Lord Qinghai’s
instruction.

54
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,125
Sure.

55
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,700
Mudan is finally home.

56
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:24,036
Jianming,

57
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,799
I order you

58
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,040
to teach Mudan to make tea

59
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,279
and play the zither.

60
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:30,799
Spare no efforts.

61
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,919
Or I’ll make you sorry.

62
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,319
Yes, Your Majesty.

63
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,040
Mudan,

64
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,450
I didn’t summon you

65
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,035
for a particular reason.

66
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,825
But I want you to meet someone.

67
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,640
Is she...

68
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:07,216
my nanny,

69
00:05:07,216 --> 00:05:08,440
Nanny Liu?

70
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,150
It’s been a long time.

71
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,839
You have a good eye, Mudan.

72
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,760
Brother,

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,480
how did you find Nanny Liu?

74
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,600
After we were separated,

75
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:17,760
I thought I’d never meet

76
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,440
our mother’s

77
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,799
servants again.

78
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,149
Greetings, Your Majesty.

79
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,940
Rise.

80
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,650
Thank you, Your Majesty.

81
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,425
Nanny Liu.

82
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,950
Look who this lady is.

84
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,254
Your Highness!

85
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,839
Your Highness!

86
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,440
Nanny!

87
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,025
It’s Your Highness.

88
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:11,640
I...

89
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,640
haven’t seen you

90
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,760
for more than a decade.

91
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,160
God bless me.

92
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,920
God bless me

93
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,475
that I see Your Highness again.

94
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,279
I can have peace even if I die now.

95
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,119
Nanny.

96
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,880
Your Highness.

97
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:31,040
I’m grateful

98
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,760
that you distracted the troops
back then.

99
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:34,554
Or I wouldn’t have escaped,

100
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,329
not to mention survived.

101
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,559
I...

102
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,725
Your Highness, let’s drop it.

103
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,720
That’s good.

104
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:50,239
Now Nanny Liu is with you.

105
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:52,094
You can have a peaceful mind.

106
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,225
Thank you, Brother.

107
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:58,000
It seems true

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,839
that Princess Yanling is
the Fifth Princess.

109
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,760
She recognized her nanny

110
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,119
at first sight.

111
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Maybe

112
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:07,075
I was being paranoid earlier.

113
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,040
Haishi,

114
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,239
you have an agile mind

115
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:11,679
and can see the problems

116
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,154
in things earlier than I do.

117
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:14,760
It won’t be a problem

118
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,399
that you’re wrong this time.

119
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,040
It surely is a merry thing

120
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,350
that the princess’s identity is real.

121
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,040
I’m happy

122
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,525
you came around.

123
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:28,850
But I’m worried about the tension

124
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,900
between you and Master.

125
00:07:31,675 --> 00:07:32,525
There’s no such thing.

126
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,975
You really came around?

127
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,000
Zhuoying,

128
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:37,119
answer me a question.

129
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:38,760
In the years we’ve been

130
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
with Master,

131
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,160
what do you think

132
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,450
is the most amazing quality of him?

133
00:07:43,518 --> 00:07:45,075
The most amazing quality of Master

134
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:46,519
is that he never shows his emotions.

135
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,640
Nobody can tell what’s on his mind.

136
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:50,500
In the presence of others,

137
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,160
he’s always calm

138
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:53,720
so that no one can tell

139
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,000
his next moves and plans

140
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,715
from his facial expressions.

141
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,774
Sometimes if we take a step back,

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,125
it does give us a better view

143
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,399
of what’s happening.

144
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:05,559
I didn’t know that before.

145
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,440
But now I do.

146
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,239
Master resigned

147
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,480
at this particular juncture.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,359
I also need to stay calm

149
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:13,825
and plan future moves.

150
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,320
Well, well,

151
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,880
the kid has grown up.

152
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:31,279
Your Highness.

153
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,599
I’m old

154
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,200
but I’m in good health.

155
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,350
If Your Highness doesn’t mind,

156
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,960
I’d like to do some labor work

157
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,159
in the mansion.

158
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,280
It’s way better

159
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,320
than the vagrant life out there.

160
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,275
Mm-hmm.

161
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:45,405
Your Highness.

162
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:54,100
Listen up, everyone.

163
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,679
This is Nanny Liu,

164
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,299
who took care of me when I was little.

165
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,841
From now on,

166
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,000
she listens to nobody but me.

167
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,119
Anyone disrespecting her

168
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:07,955
will be disrespecting me.

169
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,599
Yes.

170
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,875
Princess.

171
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,440
Your Highness.

172
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,280
This is too much

173
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,825
an honor for me.

174
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,549
Nanny,

175
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,679
you raised me

176
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,039
and saved my life.

177
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,399
You deserve this honor.

178
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,520
You can live in this mansion

179
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,919
as long as you wish.

180
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,450
Whatever you need,

181
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,875
just tell the servants.

182
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:32,575
Yes.

183
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,440
Butler.

184
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:34,960
Yes.

185
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,799
Take Nanny Liu to her chamber.

186
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,359
Yes.

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,559
Thank you, Your Highness.

188
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,159
Thank you, Your Highness.

189
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:44,850
Madam,

190
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,239
this way, please.

191
00:09:46,975 --> 00:09:48,225
Thank you.

192
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:09,464
How is she?

193
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,200
Is Consort Shurong

194
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,225
better now?

195
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,919
Your Majesty,

196
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,325
Her Highness’s body is cold in nature

197
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,239
and she took too much
contraceptive decoction.

198
00:10:21,475 --> 00:10:24,595
The excessive menstruation last time

199
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,185
took a toll on Her Highness’s health.

200
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:28,475
A toll?

201
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,651
How severe is it?

202
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,125
If there’s no better remedy

203
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:36,816
for this situation,

204
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,680
I’m afraid...

205
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,000
Be frank with it.

206
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,120
What are you afraid of?

207
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,080
Your Majesty, please don’t be angry.

208
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,599
Your Majesty,

209
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,520
may the servants

210
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,960
and I be excused?

211
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:01,206
Go ahead.

212
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,419
Your Majesty.

213
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:06,834
I’m afraid that Her Highness

214
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,130
will not have children.

215
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,636
Is there no chance at all?

216
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:21,905
I’ve done my best.

217
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,880
The Imperial Hospital

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,080
has gathered all possible prescriptions.

219
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,400
But

220
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:29,676
they haven’t done much good.

221
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,410
But I’ll keep doing my best

222
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,080
in the search for a cure.

223
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,400
Thank you, Physician Li.

224
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,195
I should take my leave.

225
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:13,925
Your Majesty.

226
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,830
Didn’t you agree

227
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,119
to get me a horse

228
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,440
a few days ago?

229
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,200
Have you gotten one yet?

230
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:28,745
Yes, I have.

231
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,360
I have.

232
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,239
I... found a mare

233
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,479
which is one and a half years old.

234
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:36,736
She’s gentle.

235
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,280
Quite a good horse.

236
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,960
When she runs,

237
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,840
she sweats red under the mane.

238
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,970
Your hands are so cold.

239
00:12:52,825 --> 00:12:54,125
It’s been

240
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,206
a constant problem since I was little.

241
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,039
Don’t worry about it.

242
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,679
You might not

243
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,400
have children anymore.

244
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,950
Do you hate me?

245
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,679
In Zhunian,

246
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:09,479
my father

247
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,320
has more than 20 consorts.

248
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,960
Many don’t

249
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,320
have a title,

250
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,280
or any children.

251
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,320
If I couldn’t

252
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,430
give you any children,

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,119
it means

254
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:28,025
it’s my fate.

255
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,096
I don’t hate anyone.

256
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:31,719
Don’t listen to the physicians.

257
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:32,960
Nobody knows better than me

258
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,450
that the physicians

259
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:35,900
always make

260
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,919
a fuss about ailments

261
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
and severe diseases alike.

262
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,799
They’re making excuses

263
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,500
to protect their reputation

264
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,899
and their lives.

265
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,525
Don’t take it seriously.

266
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:51,640
I will cure you.

267
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,200
I will cure you.

268
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:05,679
Your Highness.

269
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,679
Seven, what brings you here?

270
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,440
I’m worried about you, Sister.

271
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,080
Have you summoned a physician

272
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,760
to check on you

273
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,621
since you fell off the horse
on the racecourse?

274
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:16,025
I’m fine.

275
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Princess Yanling

276
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,559
is not well lately.

277
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:21,850
Yingnian.

278
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:24,846
Summon a physician.

279
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,960
I’m afraid the physician

280
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
can’t do anything about it.

281
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,080
It’s been

282
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,279
quite a few days.

283
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,799
Since Lord Qinghai saved

284
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,039
Princess Yanling at the Shuangping Lake,

285
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,599
Her Highness has lost her appetite

286
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,799
and seldom eaten anything.

287
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,290
Yingnian, stop.

288
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:41,075
Oh.

289
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,164
What you’re suffering

290
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,840
is lovesickness, isn’t it?

291
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,119
Seven.

292
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,359
Don’t mock me

293
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:50,479
as they did.

294
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:51,559
I know.

295
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,840
I knew your affection

296
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
for Lord Qinghai

297
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:55,440
at the very beginning.

298
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,370
I’m sure our brother knows too.

299
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,640
But...

300
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,625
What?

301
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,000
What’s wrong?

302
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,159
But given Lord Qinghai’s

303
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,000
situation in court,

304
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:09,520
though your affection

305
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,650
for Lord Qinghai is true,

306
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:13,425
you can’t marry him.

307
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:17,055
Why?

308
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:18,525
Because the Six Wing Generals’

309
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,250
suspicion isn’t clear yet.

310
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:23,334
So many years have passed.

311
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,325
The evidence is hard to find.

312
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,080
It’ll take the Grand Justice a few years

313
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,039
to close the case.

314
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,400
Lately, the censors have been

315
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,520
impeaching Lord Qinghai

316
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,679
for staying in the capital

317
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:39,495
as a lord who has no official post

318
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,220
and is in suspicion.

319
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,960
They want him to return to Liushang.

320
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,050
It was tense in the morning assembly.

321
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,600
Is it true?

322
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,475
I don’t understand

323
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:51,960
the power struggle among the officials,

324
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,000
but I do know

325
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,520
they’re pressuring our brother

326
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,000
to depose Lord Qinghai.

327
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,520
If Lord Qinghai

328
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,320
is kicked out of the capital,

329
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,505
it’ll be hard for him

330
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:03,159
to come back.

331
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:08,000
What did our brother say?

332
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,075
Our brother and Lord Qinghai

333
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:10,239
are close.

334
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,200
He left the court

335
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,400
without saying anything.

336
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:13,875
Oh.

337
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,280
But I don’t think the censors

338
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,919
will give up.

339
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,525
I heard there are

340
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:22,425
nasty rumors about it in the public.

341
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:25,599
They say Lord Qinghai is a rebel.

342
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:28,200
And our brother is a foolish emperor

343
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:29,524
to defend a rebel.

344
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,950
Anyway, Sister,

345
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,599
however much you like Lord Qinghai,

346
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,479
you cannot...

347
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,239
Seven,

348
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:37,520
I need to go to the Palace.

349
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,525
Go home.

350
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,840
I’ll ask you over for tea
on another day.

351
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,475
Sister.

352
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:42,640
You’re going to the Palace?

353
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:43,494
Sister.

354
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:44,413
Your Highness!

355
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,975
How dare they!

356
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:51,936
Outrageous!

357
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,679
They are trying to

358
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,825
chop off one of my arms.

359
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,840
They think Jianming is gone,

360
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,799
and they can begin to contain me?

361
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:09,239
What is it?

362
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:10,436
Your Majesty.

363
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,880
Princess Yanling is here.

364
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,346
Let her go.

365
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,760
Her Highness said
it’s about Lord Qinghai.

366
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,439
Send her in.

367
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,199
Yes.

368
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,979
Good day, Your Majesty.

369
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,450
Mudan,

370
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,280
you don’t have to kneel.

371
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:42,455
Get up.

372
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,019
I have a request to make.

373
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:49,806
Go ahead.

374
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,210
I would like Your Majesty’s edict

375
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:56,474
to marry me to Lord Qinghai.

376
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:00,959
Do you know what you’re talking about?

377
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,959
I do,

378
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,075
Brother.

379
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,079
Seven said

380
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,319
they’re driving Lord Qinghai

381
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,359
out of the capital.

382
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,025
So there’s no time to worry about

383
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:10,359
the etiquette.

384
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:12,876
I have long been in love
with Lord Qinghai,

385
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:14,079
so I don’t want him to go.

386
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,640
Please order him to marry me

387
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,719
so he can stay

388
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:19,719
as your brother-in-law

389
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,025
and live with me.

390
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,479
Mudan,

391
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,200
you’re the apple
of our late father’s eye

392
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,150
and my only sister.

393
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,446
Due to my fault,

394
00:18:37,775 --> 00:18:38,839
you suffered

395
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,800
from the vagrant life for years.

396
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,850
Now,

397
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:48,195
I should make it up to you.

398
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:50,125
If it’s your wish,

399
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,325
I will give the order.

400
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,375
Thank you, Brother.

401
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,560
However,

402
00:18:57,975 --> 00:19:00,336
I wonder if Lord Qinghai wants me.

403
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:01,889
You’re an intelligent girl

404
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,156
and the prestigious Princess Yanling.

405
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,959
You offer to marry him

406
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,439
in this critical time.

407
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,439
I’m sure he’ll accept you.

408
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,359
Don’t worry.

409
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:12,475
I’ll take care of this.

410
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,520
Go back to your mansion

411
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:16,234
and wait for my edict.

412
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,959
I’ve made a vow

413
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,270
that I will not marry.

414
00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:23,550
Those words again.

415
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:25,955
Fang Jianming,

416
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,400
do you know

417
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,839
your current situation?

418
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,000
Do you know

419
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,719
how many people are pressuring me

420
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:36,079
to kick you back to Liushang?

421
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:40,765
Right now only the marriage with Mudan

422
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,239
can give you a proper reason

423
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:44,560
to stay in Tianqi City.

424
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,999
Besides,

425
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,881
Mudan is my sister.

426
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,600
And she’s madly in love with you.

427
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,571
I don’t understand.

428
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,239
As a bore yourself,

429
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,599
what is it
that you don’t like about her?

430
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:00,640
Her Highness is perfect.

431
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,750
But I can’t marry her.

432
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:04,920
If that is all, Your Majesty,

433
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,560
I should go.

434
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,875
Fang Jianming,

435
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,599
I will issue an edict.

436
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,800
You must not disobey my words.

437
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:17,839
His Majesty’s edict.

438
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,000
It is a great virtue
to bridge a marriage.

439
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:25,200
Lord Qinghai, Fang Jianming,

440
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,920
is a virtuous man

441
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,560
and unmarried.

442
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,719
Princess Yanling, Chu Linlang,

443
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,625
is gentle and tender.

444
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,719
They’re a good match.

445
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,319
I hereby order a grand wedding

446
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,239
on a jubilant day for the happy couple

447
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,239
to my delight.

448
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:44,359
Respect this.

449
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,359
This is a great honor.

450
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,160
Lord Qinghai,

451
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,325
congratulations!

452
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,479
Shaozi,

453
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,280
show Eunuch Mu out.

454
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,800
Yes, Lord.

455
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,839
Good day.

456
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,000
Please, Eunuch Mu.

457
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,575
Mm-hmm.

458
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,560
Congratulations, Master.

459
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,100
- Congratulations, Lord, on the wedding!
- Congratulations, Lord, on the wedding!

460
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:21,975
Lord,

461
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,959
we’re going to have

462
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,375
a mistress.

463
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:25,319
Lord and Her Highness

464
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,680
are a perfect match.

465
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:30,319
Congratulations, Lord, on the wedding.

466
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,439
Congratulations on the wedding.

467
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:36,560
Congratulations on the wedding.

468
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,160
(Essence of Beauty Reveals Itself)

469
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,925
Haishi.

470
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:46,560
I’m on duty today.

471
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,400
It’s almost time.

472
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,400
You...

473
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:53,800
What’s wrong, Zhuoying?

474
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,700
Are you...?

475
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:03,946
Nothing.

476
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,479
Alright then.

477
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:07,475
I have to go.

478
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:08,025
Mm-hmm.

479
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,439
Congratulations, Master.

480
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,520
Congratulations, Your Highness,

481
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,560
on such a wonderful marriage.

482
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:51,160
All of these

483
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,479
are the snacks you liked

484
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:53,920
when you were a child.

485
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,800
I’m very happy today.

486
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,839
You know me well, nanny.

487
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,600
Hmm.

488
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:09,280
Yummy.

489
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,130
It tastes as good as before.

490
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:13,800
I noticed

491
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,050
Your Highness barely ate at dinner.

492
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,359
I thought

493
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,400
you’re still the little girl

494
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,640
who wanted cakes at night.

495
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,880
So I took the liberty

496
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,119
of making the pastries.

497
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,959
Please forgive me for not

498
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,199
asking your permission.

499
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:32,280
These are

500
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,550
all made of peony petals.

501
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,160
Try them all.

502
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,475
They’re great.

503
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,000
I love them.

504
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,750
It’s like

505
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,225
I’m the little girl I was again.

506
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,325
Glad to know. Glad to know.

507
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,275
Nanny, you have a long day.

508
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,800
Go back and have some rest.

509
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:55,965
You’re so kind, Your Highness.

510
00:23:56,225 --> 00:23:58,185
Good night.

511
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,750
Do you have to be so nice

512
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,900
to an old maid?

513
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,760
You know nothing.

514
00:24:18,175 --> 00:24:20,175
Is it asthma again?

515
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:21,575
I’ll go make the decoction.

516
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:20,839
Master.

517
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,800
You’re back from the shift?

518
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,475
I know you’re in a good mood,

519
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,409
but don’t get drunk.

520
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,800
Is that what you think?

521
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,290
His Majesty loves Princess Yanling
very much.

522
00:25:54,825 --> 00:25:55,790
In my opinion,

523
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:58,925
Princess Yanling has special feelings
for you.

524
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,825
The vagrant years in Nihualuo

525
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:04,275
and the suffering

526
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,425
make her different from most

527
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:07,640
pampered noble ladies.

528
00:26:08,425 --> 00:26:09,625
To you, Master,

529
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,680
she’ll be a good wife.

530
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,760
I know this Fang Jianming.

531
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,825
He’s...

532
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,400
Who is he?

533
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,400
I…

534
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:26,416
I used to have a crush on him.

535
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,839
You must be tired.

536
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,599
Go have some rest.

537
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,000
Good night, Master.

538
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Better early than late.

539
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,300
On the wedding day

540
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,025
of Princess Yanling and Lord Qinghai,

541
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:25,839
as the humble Imperial Guards,

542
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,760
we wouldn’t have a chance

543
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,520
to send our regards.

544
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,119
I have an idea.

545
00:27:28,275 --> 00:27:29,439
Let’s put a month’s salary

546
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,040
together

547
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:30,920
and buy an auspicious gift

548
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,319
that we can afford.

549
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:33,599
Like a painting of a flourishing family?

550
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,700
Mr. Fang Haishi.

551
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,239
Congratulations, Mr. Fang Haishi!

552
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,680
Thank you.

553
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,291
Mr. Fang Haishi.

554
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,700
- Lord Chang.
- Lord Chang.

555
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,875
Alright.

556
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:45,599
Give us some privacy.

557
00:27:45,725 --> 00:27:46,725
- Yes.
- Yes.

558
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:48,719
Mr. Fang Haishi,

559
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,520
I’m on my way to Zhaoming Palace
to see you.

560
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,680
And here you are.

561
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:54,160
Are you looking for me, Your Highness?

562
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:55,125
Look,

563
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,825
my sister Mudan and Lord Qinghai

564
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:58,199
are getting married.

565
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:59,525
His Majesty is happy

566
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,025
and ordered the Minister of Rites
to select an auspicious day.

567
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,439
But the only

568
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,959
jubilant day of this month

569
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,560
is the 18th.

570
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,560
In that case,

571
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,079
it’s only ten days left

572
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,079
for preparation.

573
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:11,760
You know what?

574
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,239
His Majesty gave

575
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:14,040
such an important task

576
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
to me.

577
00:28:15,175 --> 00:28:16,374
I know Mudan well

578
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,169
to arrange a grand wedding.

579
00:28:19,775 --> 00:28:21,160
But I know nothing about

580
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,400
Lord Qinghai’s preferences.

581
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,900
I wanted to ask him.

582
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,300
But he has turned down all visitors.

583
00:28:26,425 --> 00:28:28,375
I guess he’s busy with something.

584
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:31,119
So I’d like your help

585
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,879
in preparing for the wedding.

586
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:39,625
I’ve never been to a wedding before

587
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,479
or had any experience to arrange one.

588
00:28:41,775 --> 00:28:42,839
Don’t worry.

589
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:45,640
We arrange the wedding

590
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,700
to Lord Qinghai’s liking.

591
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,280
What?

592
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:54,560
Don’t you want to give your master

593
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,075
a grand wedding?

594
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:58,680
Look,

595
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,050
I owe

596
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,650
you a favor.

597
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,439
Deal?

598
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,680
I’m mortified.

599
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:07,560
Whatever you need, Your Highness.

600
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,119
I knew

601
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,375
you would help.

602
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,280
Let’s go.

603
00:29:28,675 --> 00:29:29,359
Your Highness.

604
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:30,950
These are all the best fabrics

605
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,109
for wedding gowns.

606
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,960
This is luminous satin from Yuezhou.

607
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,740
This is vermilion satin from Leizhou.

608
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,650
Both are thin and smooth.

609
00:29:41,825 --> 00:29:43,040
Perfect material

610
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,239
for wedding drapes.

611
00:29:46,425 --> 00:29:48,300
This is pure silk from Wanzhou.

612
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:49,880
It’s light and thin,

613
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,280
perfect material

614
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,760
for skirts.

615
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,900
This is satin from Zhongzhou.

616
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,150
And these.

617
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:02,199
They’re all beautiful fabrics

618
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,439
that are hard to find

619
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:04,400
in the whole country.

620
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,560
If Your Highness likes them,

621
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,160
I’ll send them

622
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,319
to the Fabric Office

623
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,199
and with Manager Ju’s
excellent embroidery

624
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:13,319
and the best threads,

625
00:30:13,475 --> 00:30:15,199
Your Highness will have

626
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,439
the most beautiful wedding gown

627
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,839
of all times.

628
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,625
Manager Ju’s embroidery

629
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:21,719
is exceptional.

630
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,200
Mm-hmm.

631
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,839
But there are so many different
kinds of fabrics.

632
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,400
Lord Chang is here!

633
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,239
Mudan!

634
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,050
Please.

635
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:30,560
Mudan.

636
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,160
Seven, you’re just in time.

637
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,800
Mr. Fang Haishi.

638
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

639
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,640
Secretary Shi.

640
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:39,239
Sister.

641
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:41,439
Lord Qinghai is far too busy.

642
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,825
However, I invited

643
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:44,050
Mr. Fang Haishi over

644
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,959
to choose the fabrics

645
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:48,400
for your wedding gowns.

646
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,680
Please forgive me.

647
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,550
I thought I’d be choosing

648
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,199
fabrics for daily wear and decorations.

649
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,000
My master should do this.

650
00:30:56,525 --> 00:30:57,446
Mr. Fang Haishi,

651
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:58,500
you’re Lord Qinghai’s

652
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,680
favorite disciple.

653
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,239
You must know his preferences.

654
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,479
I believe you can choose the right one.

655
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,880
Her Highness is right.

656
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,000
Mr. Fang Haishi

657
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,680
has been with Lord Qinghai
since he was a child.

658
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,400
I’m sure Lord Qinghai

659
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,760
will be pleased with his choices.

660
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,520
We’re talking about the wedding gown.

661
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:15,725
I...

662
00:31:15,725 --> 00:31:17,005
Mr. Fang Haishi,

663
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,920
after Her Highness and Lord Qinghai
get married,

664
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,075
Her Highness will be

665
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:22,575
the mistress of the Jifeng Pavilion.

666
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,400
You and your master are like families.

667
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Soon,

668
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,920
Her Highness will join the family.

669
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,959
As a wise man, Mr. Fang Haishi,

670
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,359
you should try to

671
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,550
keep on good terms with
Her Highness’s mansion.

672
00:31:37,425 --> 00:31:39,560
If Your Highness insists.

673
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,920
Please.

674
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,160
Mr. Fang Haishi,

675
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:58,239
what do you think?

676
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,199
My master doesn’t like

677
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:02,625
cloth of bright colors.

678
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:05,160
All his robes are white or light blue.

679
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:08,400
But the wedding is a jubilant event.

680
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,395
The dominant color should be red.

681
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,479
I think

682
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:15,520
this fabric is soft and smooth.

683
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,920
It’s red

684
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
but not gaudy.

685
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,359
With proper decoration, it’ll be great.

686
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,959
What do you think, Your Highness?

687
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,520
Mr. Fang Haishi, you have a good eye.

688
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
This is the finest satin

689
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,479
from Zhongzhou,

690
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:30,650
where Lord Qinghai’s home

691
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,599
Liushang belongs.

692
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,880
That’s good.

693
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,560
I believe Mr. Fang Haishi

694
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,575
has made the best choice,

695
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,839
and it’s produced
in Lord Qinghai’s hometown.

696
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,590
We’ll choose this one.

697
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,119
Sure, Your Highness.

698
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,280
I’ll send the satin

699
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,479
to the Fabric Office right away.

700
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:49,750
Please excuse us.

701
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,050
Good day.

702
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:58,880
Mr. Fang Haishi,

703
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,239
thank you for your help.

704
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,150
Bring the best tea for me.

705
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:04,485
No, thanks.

706
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,900
Mudan,

707
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,040
we can’t stay for tea.

708
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,520
We have to pick

709
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,439
the jade, bamboo, and wooden wares.

710
00:33:12,275 --> 00:33:13,880
So much work awaits us.

711
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,560
I need Mr. Fang Haishi.

712
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:17,000
Sister,

713
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,439
you and Lord Qinghai are
a perfect couple.

714
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,625
We’ll make sure everything

715
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,866
is the best for you.

716
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,719
You can count on us.

717
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,880
Thank you for

718
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,599
preparing the wedding for me.

719
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,650
Haishi,

720
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,560
when this is over,

721
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,920
your master and I

722
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,520
will return this favor.

723
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,900
You’re welcome, Your Highness.

724
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,239
- Young Master Haishi.
- Young Master Haishi.

725
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,760
Be smart, everyone.

726
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,800
Lord’s wedding

727
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,280
is in a dozen days.

728
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,920
Make necessary replacements

729
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,880
and give them a jubilant wedding.

730
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,640
Young Master Haishi.

731
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,300
Young Master Haishi.

732
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,600
Lord is meditating

733
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,400
in his chamber all day.

734
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,800
He said he wouldn’t have dinner.

735
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,920
Would you like to eat in the main hall

736
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,160
or in your chamber?

737
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,160
No, thanks.

738
00:34:05,275 --> 00:34:06,479
I’ve eaten.

739
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,199
Make some ginseng soup

740
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,320
and snacks.

741
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,040
Bring them to Master later.

742
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:12,120
Yes.

743
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,725
Haishi.

744
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,760
You’re back.

745
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,239
I heard that

746
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,600
you’ve been making purchases
all day long

747
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,399
with Lord Chang

748
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,719
for Master’s wedding
with Princess Yanling.

749
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,760
Lord Chang said

750
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,000
Master turned down all visitors

751
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,560
and thought he was too busy

752
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,320
to arrange the wedding.

753
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,520
Obviously,

754
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,600
I’ve been with Master
since I was a child

755
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,800
and know Master’s preferences,

756
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,360
so I went with him.

757
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,439
But I never thought

758
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:44,239
organizing a wedding can be more tiring
than practicing.

759
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,400
No wonder

760
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,775
he asked His Majesty for your leave.

761
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:50,295
A leave?

762
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,320
Now I know why he gave me

763
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,639
this list of things we need to buy.

764
00:34:58,025 --> 00:34:58,986
Haishi,

765
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:00,399
if you’re unhappy,

766
00:35:00,675 --> 00:35:02,399
I can ask Lord Chang

767
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:03,439
to relieve you

768
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,560
from the wedding preparation.

769
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,959
Forget it.

770
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,719
It is tiring to prepare for the wedding,

771
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,959
but I’ll learn from the experience.

772
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
In the future,

773
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,399
when you get married,

774
00:35:15,475 --> 00:35:16,836
I’ll organize the wedding for you.

775
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,075
Where’s Madam Su?

776
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,600
In case I’ll be hungry,

777
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,239
Madam Su left to make some snacks.

778
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,479
Did you drink, Mr. Fang?

779
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,600
I asked Haishi out for a drink,

780
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:08,959
but he bailed on me.

781
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,120
So I had a few cups myself.

782
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,280
When Madam Su

783
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,760
comes back with snacks,

784
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,719
you can have some with us,

785
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,959
in case you feel sick at night.

786
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,719
Are the wedding gowns

787
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,199
so pressing?

788
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:31,560
I can’t trust anyone else to make

789
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,600
the wedding gowns for Lord Qinghai
and Princess Yanling.

790
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:35,120
We don’t have much time.

791
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:36,760
So I have to work extra hours.

792
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,280
Right.

793
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:53,450
Is something bothering you?

794
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,760
I’ve been with Jifeng Pavilion
for years.

795
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:58,919
I can’t believe

796
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,120
my master who’s always alone

797
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,320
will marry

798
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,719
Princess Yanling soon.

799
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:08,000
Everything in the world

800
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
takes a certain course.

801
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,760
Take things as they come.

802
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,719
The same is true
of Lord Qinghai’s marriage.

803
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,600
Why don’t you focus on the security

804
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,399
of the capital and the Jifeng Pavilion?

805
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:21,879
As for the others,

806
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,760
let them take their courses.

807
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:32,840
Why don’t you

808
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,000
ask Mr. Fang Haishi

809
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,959
for a drink again

810
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:36,080
in a few days?

811
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,439
I’ll make some dishes

812
00:37:37,439 --> 00:37:38,679
to go with the drink.

813
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:42,159
Maybe he’s just tired.

814
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,320
When the wedding is over

815
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,919
and everything is settled,

816
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,000
he’ll be fine.

817
00:37:49,525 --> 00:37:50,100
Mm-hmm.

818
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:52,815
I hope so.

819
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:13,159
Young Master Haishi.

820
00:38:19,975 --> 00:38:21,294
Isn’t this Mr. Fang?

821
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:22,760
Please come in.

822
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,000
What a great honor it is

823
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,199
for you to come to my store again.

824
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,280
Are you coming

825
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,639
for a wedding gift

826
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:37,280
to Lord Qinghai?

827
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,560
Do you have any

828
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,600
recommendations?

829
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,479
Well, since it’s a wedding gift,

830
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:46,199
the gift must carry
a message of harmony,

831
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,159
or flourishing family.

832
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,175
Mr. Fang.

833
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:49,040
This way, please.

834
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,639
Display it.

835
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:50,520
Sure.

836
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,800
Mr. Fang, please take a look.

837
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,021
Do you like the painting
of lotus seeds and bats?

838
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,760
It has a good message

839
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,600
of flourishing family and happiness.

840
00:39:04,225 --> 00:39:05,320
How can you recommend such a poor thing

841
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,520
to Mr. Fang?

842
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:08,800
Greetings, Master.

843
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,159
You’re the owner, Marquis?

844
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,075
My grandfather left it to me.

845
00:39:13,439 --> 00:39:14,439
I rarely come.

846
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,479
I can’t believe I meet you

847
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,679
here in my store.

848
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,959
Are you here to buy a gift
for Lord Qinghai?

849
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,040
Yes.

850
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:25,600
I’m here to make wedding purchases.

851
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,719
So I want to

852
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:28,080
pick a gift first.

853
00:39:28,439 --> 00:39:29,639
But I don’t know

854
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,879
which to choose.

855
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,719
Go.

856
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,080
Take the chest out.

857
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,040
Yes.

858
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,559
Take a look.

859
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,239
Hold on.

860
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:53,080
It’s not a common lock.

861
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,879
Take a look.

862
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,650
Do you like anything?

863
00:40:16,025 --> 00:40:17,000
(Happiness)
The candles

864
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:19,126
are your gifts for me?

865
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:19,851
Mm-hmm.

866
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,360
You’ve been reading

867
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,360
and writing all day long.

868
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:27,719
It’s dim in the house.

869
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,199
An extra pair of candles

870
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:30,966
is good for your eyes.

871
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:36,879
Do you know that red candles

872
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:37,975
are used for a particular occasion?

873
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,600
What...?

874
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,600
You have a good eye, Haishi.

875
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:48,175
This candlestick is a rare treasure.

876
00:40:49,225 --> 00:40:50,386
But it’s the only thing

877
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,475
not for sale in this chest.

878
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,840
Why?

879
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,959
This candlestick

880
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:57,199
is made by a Heluo artisan.

881
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:58,520
It’s priceless.

882
00:40:58,675 --> 00:41:00,320
It took my master

883
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,399
great efforts to obtain it.

884
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:02,560
He wants to keep it

885
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,919
for his own wedding.

886
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:05,000
Well, he hasn’t

887
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,525
gotten a chance to bring it home.

888
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,200
Right.

889
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,525
I’ll pick another one.

890
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,240
I’m not being a niggard.

891
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,180
If one day you’re getting married,

892
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,600
I’ll be delighted to give it to you.

893
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,439
However,

894
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,479
this upcoming wedding

895
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,760
doesn’t make you

896
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,959
truly happy at all.

897
00:41:26,575 --> 00:41:27,639
A wedding that

898
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:28,800
upsets you

899
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,520
doesn’t deserve anything
better than gold or jade.

900
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,840
How do you like the jade Ruyi?

901
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,000
The jade is of good quality
and beautifully crafted.

902
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,225
That will do.

903
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:43,399
How much is it?

904
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:45,550
Wrap it up for Mr. Fang Haishi.

905
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,050
Sure.

906
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,760
It’s free

907
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:51,399
if you come with me

908
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:52,040
to a place.

909
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,479
I have a list of things

910
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,679
to buy.

911
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,560
Don’t worry.

912
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,360
I’ll help you.

913
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,760
Leave it here.

914
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,679
Purchase all the stuff
and have them delivered to Mr. Fang.

915
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,719
Let’s go.

916
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,000
Good day, Master.

917
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,675
(Jinzhu Tea)

918
00:42:26,675 --> 00:42:27,840
Take care, Master.

919
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,000
The vermilion satins from Zhunian

920
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,625
and cross embroideries from Nihualuo

921
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,439
are all of the finest.

922
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:37,719
Wrap them up.

923
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:38,760
I’ll send someone to pick them up.

924
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,225
Yes, Master.

925
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:40,850
Hey,

926
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,225
how many stores do you inherit

927
00:42:42,225 --> 00:42:43,840
from your grandfather?

928
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:51,300
(The Duan’s Sandalwood)

929
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:55,600
Now we’ve bought everything.

930
00:42:55,919 --> 00:42:57,320
They’ll be delivered to the West Gate
of the Palace.

931
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,600
Tell Zhuoying to collect them.

932
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:01,245
And you’re going with me.

933
00:43:03,921 --> 00:43:05,120
Bravo!

934
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,040
Excuse us.

935
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,040
Wonderful show!

936
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,679
Come.

937
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,280
Bravo!

938
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,639
Amazing!

939
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:11,919
One more.

940
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,719
Bravo!

941
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,919
Fantastic!

942
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:20,719
Amazing!

943
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:22,760
Bravo!

944
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,360
Bravo!

945
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,159
One more.

946
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:26,840
Fantastic!

947
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,520
One more.

948
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:31,600
Wow!

949
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,120
It’s so beautiful.

950
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,400
