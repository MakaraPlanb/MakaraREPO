25
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,440
Is your definition of happiness

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,440
to be with a dying man

27
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,039
who might leave her any second?

28
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,320
If he’s the only one

29
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,240
to make her happy,

30
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:32,679
then yes.

31
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,919
Have you ever considered

32
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,639
what she truly wants?

33
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,080
You push her away

34
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,800
because you might not live long,

35
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,759
but to her,

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,360
even if she could be with you

37
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:48,800
for only one day,

38
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:50,479
that’d be enough.

39
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,875
Master.

40
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,839
Here’s your medicine, Master.

41
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,639
Not again!

42
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:05,520
I’m following

43
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,679
the physician’s instruction

44
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,639
for the sake of your health.

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,320
No objection.

46
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,080
Take this, Master.

47
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:30,440
I’m off.

48
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:31,479
Haishi,

49
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,479
read this.

50
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,399
It appears to be Zhang Chengqian

51
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:48,240
writing back and saying all is well.

52
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,960
That’s it.

53
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,199
He’s telling us

54
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,759
everything is fine at Huangquan Pass.

55
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:58,200
After you asked me to keep an eye

56
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,360
on Tang Qianzi,

57
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,039
I did catch him gesturing

58
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,399
to someone secretly,

59
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,520
but I’ve yet to discover

60
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,639
his contact.

61
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,839
He’s been with Lord Chang for years

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,880
as his right-handed man.

63
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Lord Chang

64
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,839
has been indulging himself in pleasure

65
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,675
ever since he recovered.

66
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,530
He’s mysterious.

67
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,600
You’re well aware of the situation.

68
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:23,880
And since

69
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,519
Zhang Chengqian says

70
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,959
Huangquan Battalion is safe,

71
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:29,000
you won’t be needed back there.

72
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,200
You mean I can stay in the capital?

73
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,119
You don’t want to?

74
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,160
I’d love to!

75
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,799
Do you still want me to keep this?

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Thank you, Master.

77
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,160
I know

78
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,519
you only let me go

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,640
for my safety.

80
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,119
You mean to protect me.

81
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,775
But

82
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,250
in our line of duty,

83
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,200
people could die any minute.

84
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:09,559
Every time we parted,

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,720
it could be forever.

86
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,720
So,

87
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,000
I’m not afraid of death.

88
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,720
I’m afraid

89
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,040
that you push me away

90
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,440
or let me go.

91
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:44,040
Haishi,

92
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,359
I promise

93
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,716
I won’t let you go again.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Um.

95
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:02,519
Your Majesty,

96
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,000
with autumn coming on,

97
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,079
defense around the capital
and Mount Mingluo

98
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,040
has been reorganized

99
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,179
according to the plan.

100
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,440
Especially Mount Mingluo in the north.

101
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,399
The garrison there has been increased.

102
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,760
I’ve read the report.

103
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,279
Good work.

104
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,440
Is there anything else?

105
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:25,959
Your Majesty,

106
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:29,235
Lord Chang has skipped morning court

107
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,440
for days ever since he was poisoned.

108
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,399
Meanwhile, magicians

109
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,239
and foreign eagle egg sellers

110
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,320
are flocking into his mansion.

111
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,075
They’re partying every night.

112
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,760
I don’t think...

113
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,839
Jichang was wounded and poisoned

114
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,239
in order to save me.

115
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,279
End of discussion.

116
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

117
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,880
That’s all for today. Court adjourned.

118
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,880
Court adjourned.

119
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:58,959
- Good day, Your Majesty.
- Good day, Your Majesty.

120
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:01,119
Look.

121
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,880
Isn’t it nice?

122
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,000
It’s a real treasure,

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,640
am I right?

124
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,399
Of course.

125
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,799
It’s beautiful!

126
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,239
Lord Chang is quite generous.

127
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,839
Please.

128
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:30,650
(Lord Chang’s Mansion)

129
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,399
You have a visitor, Lord Chang.

130
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,040
You may leave.

131
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:15,475
- Yes.
- Yes.

132
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,239
Let me see it.

133
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,719
Glossy hair.

134
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,479
Is this eagle the best of the best?

135
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,159
If not,

136
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,200
I won’t

137
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,039
pay a dime.

138
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,200
Not bad.

139
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,080
Nice hair.

140
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,039
Sharp claws.

141
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,400
If it catches the prey,

142
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,880
I’ll cash in

143
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,479
on the agreement

144
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,479
Lord of Left Pudun and I made.

145
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:41,159
Dazheng won’t get in your tribe’s way

146
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:43,479
of conquering Jiaman.

147
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,400
Your Highness,

148
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,719
help me! Please!

149
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:56,400
Your Highness!

150
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:58,725
Your...

151
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,640
Your Highness!

152
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:39,050
Don’t!

153
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,119
Your Highness!

154
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:42,719
I’m here, Your Highness!

155
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,400
Your Highness,

156
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:45,919
did you have another bad dream?

157
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,880
Your Highness!

158
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
I saw assassins

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,919
attacking His Majesty again.

160
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,880
The assassination is over.

161
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:03,559
All those spies and killers

162
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,479
have been seized.

163
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,960
His Majesty is safe.

164
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,400
Your Highness,

165
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,675
I can go to Jincheng Palace

166
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:09,559
to ask His Majesty over.

167
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,159
His Majesty’s tied up with work lately.

168
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,400
Do not disturb him.

169
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,359
I’m fine.

170
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:19,640
I can handle

171
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,239
a little night terror.

172
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,520
His Majesty has arrived.

173
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,359
Don’t move.

174
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,359
You’re safe. I’m here.

175
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,039
I’m with you.

176
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,119
Evil spirits can’t hurt you.

177
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,559
Did you have a nightmare again?

178
00:11:42,438 --> 00:11:43,479
It’s happening

179
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,000
because you’re too weak.

180
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,359
I’ve called the physician.

181
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,440
Your Majesty,

182
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:52,479
I’m used to it.

183
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,239
It’s nothing serious.

184
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:53,880
It is serious

185
00:11:54,325 --> 00:11:55,159
and should be treated

186
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,400
as soon as possible.

187
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,239
Look at you

188
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,359
with pale lips and cold hands.

189
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,640
Are you taking the medicine

190
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,825
they prescribed?

191
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:04,364
And you!

192
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,520
Can’t you see

193
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,359
how sick she is?

194
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,575
Why didn’t you report to me?

195
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:09,750
If anything happens to her,

196
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,640
can you take the consequences?

197
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,679
She’s been like this

198
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:14,520
for days.

199
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,440
I meant to ask you to come over

200
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,960
but she said no.

201
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,440
I stopped them.

202
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,679
You’re too busy with work

203
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,119
to be distracted.

204
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,559
Besides, I’m totally fine.

205
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,400
You should’ve let me know.

206
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,239
Come here.

207
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,039
Greetings, Your Majesty.

208
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:41,760
Have you looked closely

209
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,975
at Consort Shurong’s symptoms?

210
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:44,475
What’s wrong with her?

211
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,039
Your Majesty,

212
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,479
Consort Shurong is worried
about your safety

213
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:51,039
due to the assassination
at Princess’s Mansion,

214
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,080
causing the night terror and sweat

215
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,559
and the deterioration of her disease.

216
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,599
I’m safe and sound.

217
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,599
What’s more

218
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,559
to worry?

219
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:05,325
Physician Li,

220
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,919
she’s been

221
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,725
taking medicine

222
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:10,599
that you prescribed.

223
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,679
Why are her hands and feet still cold?

224
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,000
Why is she still so weak?

225
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,359
Well...

226
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,559
Her cold

227
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,359
and blood stasis

228
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,200
are...

229
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,960
are hard to be cured.

230
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,760
“Hard to be cured”?

231
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,960
That again?

232
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,159
Useless!

233
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,960
Cure her

234
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,599
or you’ll be dead!

235
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:29,960
Do it!

236
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,960
I... I’m sorry, Your Majesty.

237
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,375
(Tianqi)
Did Lord Qinghai

238
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,850
(Tianqi)
say anything when you got back that day?

239
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,400
Master?

240
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,159
Nothing really.

241
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:46,640
I can stay in the capital, though.

242
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,850
I’m happy for you.

243
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,400
Since when

244
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,520
did you two become so close?

245
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,080
That’s our secret.

246
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,200
Anyway,

247
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,475
why are you

248
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,799
rushing to Shangzhou?

249
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,960
They say that place is

250
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,799
even more desolate than Hanzhou

251
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,599
and covered with snow.

252
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,280
Why don’t you wait

253
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,919
until next spring?

254
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,559
Rumor has it

255
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,159
that a mysterious saber manual

256
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:17,000
of long-lost skills is in Xueshan.

257
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,719
I’m from a family of saber,

258
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,840
so I’d like to see for myself.

259
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,799
When will you be back?

260
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,640
I’m not sure.

261
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,320
By the way,

262
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,119
when I said

263
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,500
I was going back to Huangquan Pass,

264
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,640
you told me

265
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,599
you wished you’d have more time

266
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:35,850
to get something done.

267
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,919
What was that?

268
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,960
If you still have

269
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,320
unfinished business here,

270
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,479
just leave that to me.

271
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,799
Why do you want to help?

272
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,239
We’re friends.

273
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,599
Right, friends.

274
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,599
I have nothing else to do.

275
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,479
It’s no trouble at all.

276
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,159
Don’t get me wrong.

277
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,799
I didn’t realize until recently

278
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,239
that it was already too late

279
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,440
for that matter.

280
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:06,880
Young Master Zhou,

281
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,640
we’re ready to set off.

282
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:09,800
Let’s go.

283
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,225
See you.

284
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,159
See you.

285
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,359
Be careful. Slowly.

286
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:31,975
Don’t break anything.

287
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:33,479
- Yes.
- All this is for His Majesty

288
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:34,320
and Consort Shurong.

289
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,840
(Jincheng Palace)
Don’t drop it

290
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,559
(Jincheng Palace)
for your own sake.

291
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,640
Be careful.

292
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,700
- Eunuch Mu.
- Yes.

293
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,599
Mr. Fang Haishi.

294
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,225
Push.

295
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:43,925
What’s this?

296
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:46,840
His Majesty and Consort Shurong

297
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,359
are going to the resort palace
at Diequan Valley

298
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,550
for convalescence.

299
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,350
We’re packing up.

300
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,000
His Majesty is going out?

301
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,280
Yes, that’s right.

302
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:57,159
Consort Shurong’s cold is lasting.

303
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Physicians say

304
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,159
the hot spring at Diequan Valley

305
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,325
has a significant effect on it,

306
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:04,280
but it’s a lot less effective

307
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,919
being carried all the way

308
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,919
to the city.

309
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,200
That’s why His Majesty has decided

310
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,880
to go there tomorrow

311
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,640
for the sake of

312
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,320
Consort Shurong.

313
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,200
Um.

314
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:19,359
I won’t take up any more of your time.

315
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,500
Good day.

316
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,000
Sure.

317
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,599
Good day.

318
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,159
(Jincheng Palace)
Nice and easy.

319
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,450
Be careful.

320
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,039
Do not...

321
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,359
Do not drop it!

322
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,479
Master.

323
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,400
Come in.

324
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,320
Master,

325
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:45,280
I saw Eunuch Mu and his staff

326
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,080
packing things up

327
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
earlier today.

328
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
He says His Majesty

329
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,919
is taking Consort Shurong

330
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,760
to Diequan Valley tomorrow
for her health.

331
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,719
What do you think about that?

332
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,479
With the fake princess
and her accomplices gone,

333
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,900
the capital seems peaceful again

334
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,119
but danger might lurk under the water.

335
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,799
I meant to talk His Majesty out of it,

336
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,280
but it’s not my place to say so.

337
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,640
Are you going to talk to him, Master?

338
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,425
I guess not.

339
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,425
You know him more than anyone.

340
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,230
He wouldn’t listen anyway.

341
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:20,079
Then let me

342
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,359
protect him

343
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,319
and Consort Shurong.

344
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,680
You’d better stay and rest, Master.

345
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,400
Lord.

346
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,250
Master.

347
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,760
Come in.

348
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,430
Do you have the map of Diequan Valley?

349
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:36,800
Yes.

350
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:38,585
Let’s take a look.

351
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,625
Diequan Valley has a rough terrain,

352
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,160
but by taking over the peak,

353
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,025
every post

354
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:45,640
can be alerted timely

355
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,600
to ensure safety of the resort palace.

356
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,575
I’ve had troops placed on garrison

357
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:49,955
right after His Majesty’s edict.

358
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,880
They should be in position

359
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,439
by now.

360
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:53,920
Shaozi,

361
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,359
what about Secret Force

362
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:58,160
along the way

363
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,479
and around the Valley?

364
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:01,400
They’ve scouted out the area

365
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,640
and had men on patrol this whole time.

366
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,925
We have guards outside the Valley, too.

367
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,275
If anything happens inside,

368
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,000
they’ll seal the Valley right away.

369
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,199
One squad to rescue. One to search.

370
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,400
Haishi,

371
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,280
you and Zhuoying

372
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:17,280
will leave with His Majesty tomorrow.

373
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,400
He and Consort Shurong’s safety

374
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,640
is a top priority.

375
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,319
Yes, Master.

376
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,640
Go get prepared.

377
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:40,425
Get into it.

378
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,059
I’ll wait for you here.

379
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,760
Your Majesty,

380
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,300
we failed

381
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,560
to get everything ready

382
00:18:49,325 --> 00:18:51,359
in one day before the trip.

383
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,400
Right now,

384
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,280
Master is checking the hall.

385
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,199
It’s heavily guarded there.

386
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:57,199
I suggest

387
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,719
you and Her Highness rest inside first

388
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,025
for your safety.

389
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,060
I understand your concern,

390
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:06,795
but Consort Shurong is too weak

391
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:08,200
to wait any longer.

392
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,280
Aren’t you here

393
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,275
to protect us?

394
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:55,504
Mr. Fang Haishi.

395
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:57,359
Yes, Your Majesty.

396
00:19:57,725 --> 00:19:59,839
You’re an excellent archer

397
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,741
who can hit the target from afar

398
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:03,021
and shoot

399
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:04,900
flying birds on the move.

400
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,199
You even

401
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:07,475
killed the former Lord of Left Pudun

402
00:20:07,475 --> 00:20:08,719
with an arrow,

403
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,079
which is unprecedented.

404
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:12,475
I can’t take the credit for that.

405
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:15,336
You can only see far

406
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:17,900
to shoot far, I assume.

407
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,450
Here comes your help.

408
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,079
Your Majesty.

409
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,170
Mr. Fang Haishi.

410
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,079
Lord Qinghai,

411
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,599
His Majesty asks you to sit.

412
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:11,200
Here’s your seat.

413
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,011
Sure.

414
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,970
Thank you, Eunuch Mu.

415
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,839
You’re welcome.

416
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,719
I serve at the pleasure.

417
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,629
Does Mr. Fang Haishi need...?

418
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,139
He’s fine.

419
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,640
Lord Qinghai,

420
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,560
do you need any snacks, drinks

421
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,250
or other things?

422
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,680
Just let me know.

423
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,520
I’ll bring them to you.

424
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,130
His Majesty asks me to oversee

425
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,359
the punishment. I should focus.

426
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,560
Master...

427
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,600
Don’t move.

428
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,275
Lord Qinghai,

429
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,119
Mr. Fang Haishi,

430
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:52,800
it just occurred to me

431
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,680
that I hadn’t got all fruits

432
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,875
and snacks ready out there.

433
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,359
I need to go check.

434
00:21:57,475 --> 00:21:59,435
Please make yourselves at home.

435
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,064
Good day, gentlemen.

436
00:22:09,975 --> 00:22:11,680
I’m kneeling

437
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,920
while you’re sitting comfortably.

438
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:14,450
My knees hurt.

439
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,730
You’re lucky enough

440
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:17,786
not to be flogged.

441
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:19,520
Your knees

442
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,275
are taking the blame for your eyes.

443
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:29,880
Master,

444
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:31,640
I meant to have you stay

445
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,479
and rest at Zhaoming Palace

446
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:34,925
instead of coming with me,

447
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,191
but

448
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:37,906
being with you

449
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,229
here alone

450
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,900
isn’t half bad.

451
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,250
Be quiet and reflect on your mistake.

452
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,280
Master,

453
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:04,025
this place is the most vulnerable
to attack,

454
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,400
but His Majesty

455
00:23:06,675 --> 00:23:07,950
insists on staying here.

456
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:14,354
Eunuch Mu has left.

457
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,241
There’s just the two of us.

458
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:19,040
Master, we can look around

459
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,160
in case there are loopholes.

460
00:23:24,775 --> 00:23:25,814
Master.

461
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,119
Your Majesty!

462
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:06,760
Protect His Majesty!

463
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:16,806
Duohanersa!

464
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,401
Your Majesty!

465
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,640
Haishi!

466
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,010
Protect His Majesty!

467
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,939
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

468
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,000
Your Majesty!

469
00:25:42,425 --> 00:25:43,400
Your Majesty!

470
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,680
Escort His Majesty back!

471
00:26:03,975 --> 00:26:05,215
Put His Majesty on the bed.

472
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,719
Your Majesty!

473
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,559
Your Majesty!

474
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,200
Your Highness,

475
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,959
His Majesty

476
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,040
must be treated immediately.

477
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,441
Please leave the room.

478
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,719
- Lord Qinghai...
- Your Majesty.

479
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:34,800
Rest assured.

480
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:35,725
I will

481
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:37,125
keep you updated.

482
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:39,959
Shaozi,

483
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:40,925
step up security

484
00:26:40,925 --> 00:26:42,100
and escort Her Highness back.

485
00:26:42,425 --> 00:26:43,665
Yes, Lord.

486
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,079
You saw that assassin’s face.

487
00:26:56,225 --> 00:26:57,239
Make sketches

488
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,319
and seize him quickly.

489
00:26:58,875 --> 00:26:59,600
Yes.

490
00:27:01,825 --> 00:27:02,760
Go back with Shaozi

491
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,000
to beef up security

492
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,311
of the palace.

493
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:06,846
But your wound, Master...

494
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,761
I’m fine.

495
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:27,475
Focus!

496
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:30,239
Check everyone in and out carefully!

497
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,875
No slacking!

498
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,400
Any negligence

499
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:34,800
will lead to dire consequences!

500
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,239
Double the guards.

501
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,561
No slacking!

502
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:39,154
Any negligence

503
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,641
will lead to dire consequences!

504
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:56,550
Lanterns on.

505
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,550
Master.

506
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:49,704
What do you think?

507
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,540
Jincheng Palace is as bright as day.

508
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:56,964
Whoever tries to break in

509
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,280
won’t be able to

510
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,525
hide their trace.

511
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,470
Master...

512
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,749
Go back to Zhaoming Palace first.

513
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,239
Master.

514
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,319
Wind Waker...

515
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,560
is said

516
00:29:25,575 --> 00:29:27,119
to be extinct,

517
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:27,760
but somehow,

518
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,840
Huku still has such a wizard.

519
00:29:29,075 --> 00:29:30,435
He recognized me

520
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,879
and called me “Duohanersa”.

521
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,225
I guess

522
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:35,000
you can no longer keep my identity

523
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:36,905
a secret after all these years.

524
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,640
I assumed Secret Force

525
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,199
watching Lord Chang’s Mansion

526
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,160
wouldn’t find

527
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,319
anything suspicious,

528
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:43,895
but just now, one of them reported...

529
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,920
Young Master Zhuoying,

530
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,800
I was searching for the suspect

531
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,839
according to your sketch

532
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:49,520
and found a match

533
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,359
who got in and out

534
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,439
of Lord Chang’s Mansion

535
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,560
quickly the other day.

536
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:54,706
And there’s more than that.

537
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,719
What else?

538
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,880
It’s confirmed

539
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,350
that some magician

540
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:00,119
also went to

541
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,680
Lord Chang’s Mansion.

542
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,920
Someone must’ve

543
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:04,815
paid him first

544
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,719
before that poisoned boy

545
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:07,359
showed up

546
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,250
who tried to kill you.

547
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:13,439
Master,

548
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,079
we’re talking about a suspect

549
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,825
who’s His Majesty’s only brother.

550
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,450
He also took the hit

551
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,319
for His Majesty

552
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,400
when that fake princess attacked him.

553
00:30:21,725 --> 00:30:22,959
We can’t go after him

554
00:30:22,975 --> 00:30:24,654
without solid evidence.

555
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,719
Besides,

556
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,059
if he’s behind the assassination,

557
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,975
he must be up to something even bigger.

558
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,959
Have you considered

559
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:36,239
going back to Hanzhou over the years?

560
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:37,394
Going back there?

561
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,800
Yes.

562
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,119
Master,

563
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:46,359
the day you saved me

564
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,225
is the day I put Hanzhou behind.

565
00:30:48,675 --> 00:30:50,000
We people of Huku

566
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,040
are grateful

567
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,080
and loyal.

568
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,625
You were shaved

569
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,239
when I first found you

570
00:31:02,975 --> 00:31:04,255
at Red Plain.

571
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:08,965
It’s probably your local custom

572
00:31:09,225 --> 00:31:11,586
to remove children’s fetal hair

573
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,200
on their birthdays

574
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,175
as a sign of being old enough for war.

575
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,620
I don’t remember too much

576
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,800
about my birthday.

577
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,359
Back then,

578
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,234
I asked you about your name

579
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:26,875
and you said

580
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,839
some strange words

581
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:30,005
in an ancient dialect of Huku, I guess.

582
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,825
An ancient dialect of Huku?

583
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,300
I have no memory of that at all.

584
00:31:35,725 --> 00:31:36,605
It was long.

585
00:31:38,575 --> 00:31:40,000
Something starting with

586
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,650
“Zhuoying”.

587
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,520
That’s why

588
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,175
you were named after that.

589
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,740
Why are you bringing all this up?

590
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,079
If I returned to Hanzhou,

591
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,040
all that effort and time you spent on me

592
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
would be in vain.

593
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:59,680
Don’t you hate

594
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,450
futile effort the most?

595
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:04,520
Legend has it

596
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,920
that thousands of years ago
on the northern grassland,

597
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,481
there was a man named Sijiu

598
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,400
who spent 12 years

599
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,725
taming a Dragon-horse

600
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,750
until his body turned stiff

601
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,880
and hair thin.

602
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,560
When he finally had a chance

603
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,440
to mount it,

604
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:24,640
that Dragon-horse neighed

605
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,119
and galloped between heaven and earth

606
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,481
for 12 years.

607
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,160
And just like that,

608
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,199
Sijiu was on its back

609
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,119
the entire time.

610
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,240
In the end, it was tamed

611
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,040
and turned into a girl

612
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,371
who then had four children with Sijiu.

613
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,160
The four of them

614
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,949
were the founders
of the four tribes of Huku

615
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,775
and the chosen ones.

616
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,350
The first day I saw you,

617
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,130
I instantly knew

618
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,460
you were a war-horse.

619
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,600
A war-horse

620
00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:07,224
doesn’t belong to a pigsty

621
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,429
by nature.

622
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,401
I’ve been teaching you combat skills

623
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,510
and strategies for so long

624
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,359
so that you can go out there

625
00:33:17,675 --> 00:33:19,500
and make a difference someday.

626
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Lift Hanzhou out of war.

627
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:27,015
Stop further bloodshed.

628
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,511
But right now, you’re still in danger.

629
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,475
Lord Chang could be the mastermind

630
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,775
and national security is at risk.

631
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:36,160
I need to stay

632
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,200
to share your burden.

633
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,199
I want to keep you here

634
00:33:39,325 --> 00:33:40,485
in the capital,

635
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:42,560
but you have

636
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,160
your own mission.

637
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,680
Haishi is suspicious of your identity

638
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,019
after seeing your elder brother.

639
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:51,400
And Wind Waker

640
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,000
called you by your real name.

641
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,920
You can no longer

642
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,959
stay here.

643
00:33:56,525 --> 00:33:57,719
But if you go back to Hanzhou,

644
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,725
your tribesmen won’t trust you.

645
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:01,350
That leaves you

646
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:03,390
with only one option.

647
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:07,200
It’s all my fault. My bad.

648
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,719
I made a mistake.

649
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,959
I should’ve stopped His Majesty

650
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:11,600
from going to Diequan Valley.

651
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,675
Calm down, Your Highness.

652
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,919
Bizi will bring back

653
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,199
information quickly.

654
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,259
What do you know?

655
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:23,399
Guards at Yu’an Palace, Jincheng Palace

656
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,479
and the main gate

657
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,919
are all doubled.

658
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:26,625
Long drum lanterns

659
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,120
have lit up the entire Jincheng Palace

660
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,559
as if it’s in the daytime.

661
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:30,775
I also saw

662
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,719
Mr. Fang Haishi on patrol

663
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,700
with the others

664
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:33,725
during the whole time.

665
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:35,399
How’s His Majesty?

666
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,800
Physician Li is with him

667
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,760
at Jincheng Palace.

668
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,919
I didn’t see others go in or out.

669
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,239
His Majesty should be fine.

670
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,879
That’s right, Your Highness.

671
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,625
If not,

672
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,479
Imperial Hospital

673
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:46,700
would’ve made a fuss.

674
00:34:51,575 --> 00:34:52,696
Dragon Tail,

675
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,100
please bless His Majesty.

676
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,679
Dragon Tail,

677
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,599
please bless His Majesty.

678
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,850
Please bless His Majesty.

679
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,721
Dragon Tail,

680
00:35:03,825 --> 00:35:05,719
please bless His Majesty.

681
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,879
Your Highness,

682
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:08,119
Eunuch Mu is here.

683
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,785
- Good evening, Your Highness.
- Skip that.

684
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,679
Is His Majesty all right?

685
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,439
He says

686
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:18,000
don’t worry.

687
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,199
So he’s fine, right?

688
00:35:21,525 --> 00:35:24,045
Just don’t worry.

689
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,375
He...

690
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,520
Please excuse me.

691
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:29,095
Thank you.

692
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,501
I’m glad he’s fine.

693
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,719
Dragon Tail, please bless His Majesty.

694
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,125
Please protect him from any harm.

695
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:57,719
Master,

696
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:00,100
are you sure

697
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,000
it’s the right thing to do?

698
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:05,250
Master, it’s me.

699
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,520
How is it going?

700
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,639
Everything at Jincheng Palace

701
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,000
is all set

702
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,959
as you requested.

703
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:13,400
I’m here to report back to you.

704
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,960
I see.

705
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:18,719
Do you need to see a physician?

706
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:20,159
I’m good.

707
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:22,320
Go back on patrol

708
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,719
in case assassins break in again.

709
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,300
Are you sure you’re fine?

710
00:36:28,225 --> 00:36:29,785
I just need some rest.

711
00:36:30,425 --> 00:36:32,325
Jincheng Palace’s safety is all on you.

712
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:35,054
Yes.

713
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,239
Master,

714
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,360
if we keep this from Haishi,

715
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,275
what if...?

716
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:50,679
This mission is putting your life

717
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:51,999
and career at risk.

718
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,225
No one else should know.

719
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,840
Your return to Hanzhou

720
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:00,639
provides the best opportunity.

721
00:37:01,225 --> 00:37:02,900
Do not waste it.

722
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,025
Your elder brother and uncle
are against each other.

723
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:07,300
You can use that

724
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:09,214
to your advantage.

725
00:37:10,025 --> 00:37:11,850
I’ll have our men help you, too.

726
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,679
Yes.

727
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,639
Don’t worry about Zheliu.

728
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,199
I’ll keep an eye on her.

729
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:20,425
She’ll be fine.

730
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:26,040
I won’t let you down.

731
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,799
You’re doing it for yourself, too.

732
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,810
Wind Waker will make a comeback

733
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,425
after today’s failure.

734
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,159
Wizards like him

735
00:37:37,439 --> 00:37:38,959
are the strongest

736
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,500
on the first day of every month

737
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,550
with energy from heaven and earth.

738
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,320
They’ll definitely

739
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,479
make the most of it.

740
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,790
So you and I will guard Jincheng Palace

741
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,850
on the first day of next month.

742
00:37:58,425 --> 00:37:59,304
Master,

743
00:38:00,975 --> 00:38:01,895
Haishi

744
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,049
trusts you.

745
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,529
If you keep him in the dark,

746
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:08,439
something unexpected

747
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,400
might happen

748
00:38:11,425 --> 00:38:12,624
and he’ll feel betrayed.

749
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,124
That’s not your concern

750
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,075
for the time being.

751
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,125
You two should spend more time together

752
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,399
before you leave.

753
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,719
It won’t be easy

754
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,959
to see each other again.

755
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,450
Wait.

756
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,000
Hey!

757
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,600
I knew you’d be here.

758
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,579
Look,

759
00:39:49,075 --> 00:39:50,175
the night view of Tianqi

760
00:39:50,175 --> 00:39:51,575
is splendid.

761
00:39:52,425 --> 00:39:54,304
The 2,000-year-old capital
on the East Land

762
00:39:55,675 --> 00:39:57,514
has witnessed dynasties rise and fall

763
00:39:57,925 --> 00:39:59,405
to get hold of this scenery.

764
00:40:02,925 --> 00:40:04,399
What’s gotten into you?

765
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:05,679
Is that some kind of lament?

766
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:06,879
Nothing.

767
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,141
Just the aftereffect

768
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,235
of the pressure from work

769
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,575
and the assassination.

770
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:13,840
With all those things

771
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,040
going on in the capital,

772
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:18,159
and Master’s slow recovery,

773
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,600
we can’t take any break.

774
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,450
I wonder if Master

775
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,959
is going to make a full recovery.

776
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,439
He spitted blood again

777
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,875
at Diequan Valley.

778
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,540
Really?

779
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,080
Yes. You didn’t know?

780
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:34,199
It happened

781
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,600
when His Majesty was attacked.

782
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,700
He didn’t say a word about it to me.

783
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,689
I’m deeply worried about his condition.

784
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,075
Actually, I’m anxious these days.

785
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,239
Aren’t we all

786
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,399
as members of Jifeng Pavilion?

787
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:50,075
Master gets wounded

788
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,959
again and again.

789
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,439
He’s working long hours

790
00:40:56,775 --> 00:40:58,576
without eating and sleeping properly.

791
00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:00,360
His body might’ve reached the limit

792
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,775
at Diequan Valley.

793
00:41:04,225 --> 00:41:05,106
Haishi.

794
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,225
Yes?

795
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,700
Take good care of him.

796
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,630
What’s going on?

797
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,500
That doesn’t

798
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,825
sound like you.

799
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:22,719
I got it!

800
00:41:23,225 --> 00:41:25,100
You’re hiding something from me.

801
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,320
Are you going

802
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,950
to go on an extremely dangerous mission?

803
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:34,355
No!

804
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,360
Don’t forget

805
00:41:37,675 --> 00:41:40,040
I’m the most skilled

806
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,201
in Jifeng Pavilion.

807
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,360
I’ll let you in on another secret.

808
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,510
I can

809
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,600
outlive

810
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,719
the oldest

811
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:49,845
living tortoise.

812
00:41:50,225 --> 00:41:51,745
Alright. Enough about me.

813
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:57,919
Just be careful, Fang Zhuoying.

814
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,000
I’m waiting

815
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,900
to attend you and Zheliu’s wedding.

816
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:15,000
Morning court should’ve begun.

817
00:42:16,475 --> 00:42:17,819
Where’s His Majesty?

818
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,302
Is everything all right?

819
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,750
He’s here.

820
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,875
His Majesty is unwell.

821
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,020
Morning court is canceled.

822
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,479
Adjourned.

823
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:30,575
- What?
- What’s happening?

824
00:42:30,575 --> 00:42:31,400
Wait...

825
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:34,850
What’s wrong?

826
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,410
Let’s go.

827
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:38,150
How come?

828
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,479
His Majesty is always in good shape.

829
00:42:43,725 --> 00:42:45,175
How did he...?

830
00:42:45,175 --> 00:42:45,935
Keep it down.

831
00:42:45,935 --> 00:42:46,879
Can’t you see

832
00:42:46,879 --> 00:42:48,320
all those Imperial Guards outside?

833
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,479
- Let’s go.
- Come on.

834
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
- Let’s get out of here.
- Just go.

835
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,560
Let’s go.

836
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,520
Lord Qinghai.

837
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,120
Your Highness.

838
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,520
Lord Qinghai,

839
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:08,700
how did His Majesty

840
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,725
fall ill all of a sudden?

841
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,320
I didn’t know until today

842
00:43:11,525 --> 00:43:13,360
that His Majesty caught a cold
by accident

843
00:43:13,475 --> 00:43:14,925
after bathing in the hot spring
at Diequan Valley.

844
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:15,950
Oh.

845
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,399
Then

846
00:43:18,475 --> 00:43:20,159
may I go to Jincheng Palace

847
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,239
to check on him?

848
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:23,600
You’re His Majesty’s brother.

849
00:43:23,919 --> 00:43:24,825
Of course you can.

850
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,120
But cold is contagious

851
00:43:28,475 --> 00:43:30,040
as far as I know.

852
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,159
You’ve just

853
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,000
recovered from your wound.

854
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:36,985
Thank you for your concern.

855
00:43:37,325 --> 00:43:39,775
I’ll go some other day.

856
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:40,750
