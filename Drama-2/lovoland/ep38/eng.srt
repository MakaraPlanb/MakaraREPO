=Episode 38=

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Your Majesty.

26
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:20,550
The southwest suffered a severe drought
at the beginning of the year

27
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,630
which caused crop failures.

28
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,639
The refugees fled all the way east

29
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,320
and people died of starvation
along the way.

30
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,520
The new Prefect of Xiping Port,
Liu Changping,

31
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,800
wrote a memorial and asked for support.

32
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,479
I remember you said

33
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,160
the harvest reduced by less than 30%

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,679
and there was enough food in stock

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,559
in each prefecture, right?

36
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,829
Your Majesty.

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,875
The original plan was

38
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,119
that each prefecture
opens its storehouse for relief.

39
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:40,875
As long as we got through

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,039
this time of short supply

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,080
and when the autumn harvest came,

42
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,440
the disaster would be solved naturally.

43
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:47,000
But it was also poor

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,800
and the grain seedlings
were thin and weak.

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,925
In winter,

46
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:51,000
the refugees are displaced

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,360
throughout the land.

48
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
What’s more hateful

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,439
is that the tribes in the southwest

50
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,425
have seen the serious disaster
in Xiping Port

51
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:57,826
and they get more eager

52
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,375
to swoop in

53
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,520
and invade Dazheng.

54
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,100
At Your Majesty’s discretion.

55
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:03,375
Present the details

56
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,325
and I’ll think about it.

57
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,639
Your Majesty.

58
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,795
Your Majesty.

59
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:23,675
Now even the garrison in Xiping Port

60
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:25,800
(Crop failure makes people dead)
is running short of supplies,

61
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,700
(The tribes there try to invade Dazheng)
which has affected our soldiers’ spirit.

62
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,775
Now there are people saying everywhere

63
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,559
that the consecutive droughts

64
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:33,080
and crop failures

65
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,960
are the punishment from Dragon Tail

66
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,639
because he is offended.

67
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,800
That’s absurd!

68
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,080
Your Majesty.

69
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,240
The people in the southwest
have been worshiping Dragon Tail

70
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,360
for a long time.

71
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:48,000
There are also people saying

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,360
that only if the messenger
of Dragon Tail

73
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,880
in Tianqi City

74
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,600
goes to Xiping Port
and holds a sacrifice ceremony

75
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,275
can the disaster be relieved.

76
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:58,839
Your Majesty.

77
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
I’ve also heard such words.

78
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,960
Now those tribes are primed for action.

79
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,559
I’ve heard that Consort Chunrong

80
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,279
once met Dragon Tail in her childhood.

81
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:12,240
From then on,
the coast of Yuezhou has been peaceful

82
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,479
and fertile.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,799
If Consort Chunrong
goes to relieve the people in disaster,

84
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,839
I’m sure she will appease the people.

85
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,640
Your Majesty.

86
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,519
Xiping Port is thousands of miles away.

87
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:24,600
If we want

88
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,880
to alleviate disaster,

89
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,079
we should send grain
from the neighboring place, Yuezhou.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,359
Consort Chunrong is a harem.

91
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,300
I’m afraid she can’t solve

92
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,475
the plight of the southwest.

93
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,880
Lord Qinghai.

94
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,269
It’s for sure that
we will transfer grain from Yuezhou,

95
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,160
but right now,
there’s famine in the southwest.

96
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,519
People are in panic.

97
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,839
Since Consort Chunrong

98
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,920
is the messenger of Dragon Tail,

99
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:45,160
she is the perfect person
to go to Xiping Port

100
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,720
on behalf of the imperial court

101
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:47,799
for disaster relief

102
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,200
and to appease the people.

103
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,359
Consort Chunrong

104
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,959
is a harem of His Majesty.

105
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,600
She is not an official.

106
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,850
How can she show her face in public

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,440
and go to the southwest
for disaster relief?

108
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,775
With the help of a miracle, things
will be done with half the effort.

109
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,959
Why not?

110
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,079
Your Majesty.

111
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,480
Lord Qinghai is right.

112
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,300
How can we send a harem
for disaster relief?

113
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,850
Your Majesty.

114
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,625
We should let the Ministry of Revenue

115
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,425
send people to transfer grain
as soon as possible.

116
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,040
Your Majesty, I’m willing...

117
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,679
All right.

118
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,959
I’ll handle this matter

119
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,791
prudently.

120
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,375
If there is nothing else...

121
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,920
Court adjourned.

122
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,175
Your Highness, there was

123
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,500
a person called Xiaoliu

124
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,100
who sent a letter to you.

125
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,279
I just made some fish porridge.

126
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,640
Have it while it’s hot.

127
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,000
Fish porridge?

128
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,279
Who asked you to make it?

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,550
Lord Qinghai sent people

130
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,375
to bring us a pamphlet

131
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,040
of your eating habits and preferences.

132
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:57,359
I’m not hungry.

133
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,640
Take it away.

134
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,880
Yes.

135
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,519
Yuran.

136
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,320
Yes.

137
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,079
I need you to find some cypress wood

138
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,675
or objects made of cypress wood.

139
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,519
Your Majesty.

140
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,000
The southwest is suffering from famine.

141
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,959
Those tribes in Leizhou never give up

142
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,040
trying to annex the southwest sea.

143
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,559
It must be dealt with.

144
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,519
The spring harvest was poor

145
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,079
and the autumn harvest also failed.

146
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:37,040
The granaries of the prefectures
are not bottomless.

147
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,000
Even if we empty them,

148
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,920
it can only last for a while.

149
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,425
I know what to do.
You don’t need to worry.

150
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,559
Just have some good rest.

151
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:55,050
Your Majesty.

152
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,350
Treasurer Wu has arrived by order.

153
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:05,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

154
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,760
Greetings, Lord Qinghai.

155
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:07,799
You may rise.

156
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,025
Thank you, Your Majesty.

157
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,840
You wrote a memorial to me
three months ago

158
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,720
that the Treasury
has no place to store gold

159
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,480
and the warehouse needs to be expanded.

160
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,950
I guess that’s why you came today.

161
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,140
Your Majesty.

162
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,519
Zhongzhou is rich in gold mines

163
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,400
and skillful in smelting gold.

164
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,640
Seven or eight in ten of the gold
in the world

165
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,440
comes from Zhongzhou.

166
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:34,040
Copper is circulating mostly
in the market,

167
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,399
so most of the gold
goes into the Treasury.

168
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:37,399
In recent years,

169
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,475
the local governments also paid
a lot of coppers into the Treasury.

170
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,440
There is no place to store them anymore.

171
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,000
Your Majesty once ordered
to exchange the coppers

172
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,239
for gold with the tribes
in the southwest.

173
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:48,624
But now the gold price is soaring.

174
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,279
Even if the tribes in the southwest

175
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,399
set up lots of checkpoints,

176
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:53,640
the gold is still flowing uncontrollably

177
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,760
into Tianqi.

178
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,079
This summer,

179
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,200
there is no room for gold

180
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,559
in the Treasury.

181
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,600
Therefore,

182
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,679
I wrote a memorial again
three months ago

183
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,920
to make a request
for warehouse expansion.

184
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,600
In this case, pass down my order.

185
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,000
For the next ten years,

186
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:12,320
only collect 30% of the taxes
from the Dazheng people

187
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,239
and the rest will be replaced by corvée.

188
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:15,000
In addition,

189
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,320
use half of the money and goods

190
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,399
in the Treasury

191
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,160
to build canals,

192
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,040
dams and granaries everywhere.

193
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:21,720
Well...

194
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:23,525
Half of it?

195
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,279
Half of it.

196
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,079
Of which, two out of ten

197
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,320
needs to be sent to the southwest,

198
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,519
mainly to Xiping Port,

199
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,040
to build canals
and granaries along the coastline

200
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,239
and to prepare armaments.

201
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,440
Your Majesty.

202
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,520
That’s a lot of gold.

203
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,230
You just spent it like that?

204
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:43,584
So petty.

205
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:47,025
Only a miser collects money
and never spends it.

206
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,700
Putting the Treasury
to use at this point

207
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,060
will bring the gold price

208
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,745
back to normal,

209
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,719
but not for long,

210
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,679
the gold price will plummet.

211
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,000
At that time,

212
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,760
it will suppress every tribe

213
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,921
in the southwest.

214
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:11,050
Since the Rebellion of Prince Yi,

215
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,039
you and I don’t want
to launch a war again.

216
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,320
Now there is famine in the southwest,

217
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:19,375
and those tribes in Leizhou
want to take advantage of the situation.

218
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:21,684
If this can stop them,

219
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,679
our strategy
of collecting gold in silence

220
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,559
in the past three years

221
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,280
will not be wasted.

222
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,960
Even so,

223
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,960
the southwest is still volatile.

224
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,119
I sincerely want to govern Xiping Port

225
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,039
for Your Majesty

226
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,479
and fix the sore point for good.

227
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:38,119
Jianming.

228
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,799
It’s a long trip.

229
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,159
You can’t take it.

230
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:44,159
If this is

231
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,559
the last thing I can do for you,

232
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,159
I will do it for the sake of

233
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,159
the time we’ve spent together for years.

234
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:51,960
To stay alive
is what you should do for me!

235
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,400
Don’t say anything else.

236
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,790
I will never let you go.

237
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,799
Your Majesty!

238
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,590
Please go to see Consort Chunrong!

239
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,520
His Majesty has arrived.

240
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,400
Greetings, Your Majesty.

241
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,679
Lord Qinghai.

242
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:21,640
Consort Chunrong.

243
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,359
Do you know self-harm is a felony?

244
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,719
I’m not hurting myself.

245
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,000
Never mind.

246
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,359
Jianming.

247
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,479
Send Consort Chunrong
back to Fengwu Palace.

248
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,225
Yes.

249
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,719
I dare not trouble Lord Qinghai.

250
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:43,320
I’ll leave.

251
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,225
What’s wrong with her?

252
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:55,280
Mercy, Your Majesty.

253
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,599
Consort Chunrong

254
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:57,440
barely ate anything these days.

255
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
She’s been preoccupied,

256
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,440
and now she lost much blood.

257
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,239
I guess she is too weak now.

258
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:13,420
Where is the physician?

259
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:14,799
He is on the way here.

260
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,359
It will take a while.

261
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,440
Bring me the hemostatic powder now.

262
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,559
Yes.

263
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,400
His Majesty only asked you

264
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,239
to send me back.

265
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:29,760
Now that your job is done,

266
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,200
please go back.

267
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,239
The injury on Your Highness

268
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:34,760
needs to be treated in time,

269
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,000
and then I can

270
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,799
report to His Majesty.

271
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,200
Give it to me.

272
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:14,840
Please forgive me

273
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,975
if I offend you in any way.

274
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,080
Thank you.

275
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,115
Stop looking for

276
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:50,034
the way to undo Baixi.

277
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,640
What does it

278
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:53,644
have anything to do with you?

279
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,719
You only see the surface,
but you don’t know the whole story.

280
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,479
Let me tell you right now.

281
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,320
The most important thing

282
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,559
about Baixi is nothing else

283
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,679
but blood.

284
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:07,725
Only those who have the blood
of the Fang Clan running in them

285
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,810
can undo Baixi.

286
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,440
- Lord.
- Lord.

287
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,625
Fang Jianming.

288
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,359
Looks like there isn’t much time

289
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,239
left for you.

290
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,039
This medical book has been lost

291
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,119
(Realgar, croton, musk for poison...)
for a long time in Zhunian.

292
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,359
Your Majesty only took a few days

293
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:13,400
to find the remains in Lanzhou.

294
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,880
You are lucky.

295
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,919
There is no luck.

296
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,825
I’ve used everyone I can.

297
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,880
Even so,

298
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,889
I only found half of it.

299
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,679
Your Majesty, don’t worry.

300
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,175
Maybe there is the information you want

301
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,960
in this half.

302
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,919
I hope so.

303
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,479
It’s getting late.

304
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
Don’t get too tired.

305
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,000
Go to rest first.

306
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:39,645
What about Your Majesty?

307
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,799
I’ll go to sleep after I finish this.

308
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,119
Your Majesty!

309
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,840
Lord Qinghai is dying.

310
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,799
What?!

311
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,919
Your Majesty...

312
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:54,919
Go to rest first.

313
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,800
I’ll rest in Jincheng Palace.

314
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:07,595
What’s wrong with His Majesty?

315
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,980
It’s unusual for His Majesty
to be so flustered.

316
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,239
When did it happen?

317
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,359
Why are you just telling me now?

318
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:17,000
I heard he has been in a coma

319
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,799
for hours.

320
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,679
Now Physician Li

321
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,799
is trying his best to save him.

322
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,559
He said Lord Qinghai
is in a bad situation

323
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,239
and probably he is not gonna
make it through the night.

324
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,159
Your Majesty!

325
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:26,880
It’s cold.

326
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,450
Put on some clothes.

327
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:39,275
How is he?

328
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:40,440
Greetings, Your Majesty.

329
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,200
How is he?

330
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:43,239
Lord Qinghai has strong willpower.

331
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,799
It’s not easy for him

332
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,960
to hang in there for so many days.

333
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,119
It’s just...

334
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:49,150
The poison of Dawn Flower
in Lord Qinghai

335
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,479
has penetrated the skin into the marrow.

336
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,640
I’m afraid...

337
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,640
It will happen these days.

338
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,520
Your Majesty.

339
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:10,559
Take care of yourself.

340
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,525
I don’t care.

341
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,679
I’ll go against the heaven
to change his fate

342
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,039
as long as I can keep him alive!

343
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,931
There is really nothing I can do.

344
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,239
There...

345
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,080
There must be a way.

346
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,719
There must be a way.

347
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,280
The Storehouse!

348
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:25,599
Isn’t there a piece of

349
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,880
Dragon Horn in the Storehouse?

350
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,840
Go get it.

351
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,960
You can’t do this, Your Majesty.

352
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,799
That’s for Your Majesty to use

353
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,875
in case of an emergency...

354
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:34,719
Go now!

355
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,679
Your Majesty...

356
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:37,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

357
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,039
Yes, Your Majesty.

358
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,320
Jianming.

359
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
When Prince Yi rebelled,

360
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,239
you were the one who wouldn’t let me go.

361
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:59,519
Now are you going to leave first?

362
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,000
How am I

363
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,479
going to live with myself?

364
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,400
How am I going
to face all of this on my own?

365
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:32,920
Master!

366
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,250
He swallowed it.

367
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,525
He swallowed it.

368
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:44,650
Your Majesty.

369
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,520
Jianming!

370
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,319
Jianming!

371
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,319
How did this happen?

372
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,875
Jianming.

373
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,000
How is he?

374
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,550
How is he?!

375
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,239
Congratulations to Your Majesty.

376
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,599
Although he didn’t
drink down all the medicine,

377
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:07,125
his pulse has stabilized.

378
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,025
Then this is...

379
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:12,359
Dragon Horn is an elixir
to extend one’s life.

380
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,119
Lord Qinghai should be fine

381
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,199
in a short time.

382
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:18,400
It’s just that the Dawn Flower poison
inside Lord Qinghai

383
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,239
hasn’t been removed.

384
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:21,900
I’m afraid

385
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,479
we need to find

386
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,000
something rarer than Dragon Horn

387
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,599
to save Lord Qinghai.

388
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,275
Your Highness still has a bad appetite?

389
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,839
Is the porridge too thick

390
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:40,959
or too dilute?

391
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,880
Are the snacks

392
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,319
not palatable?

393
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,675
It’s just that I have no appetite.

394
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,239
By the way,

395
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,479
I need you to go to the library

396
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,760
and find these books on this

397
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,800
for me.

398
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,100
(Family Biography of the Fang Clan
in Liushang)

399
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,760
Do you want to see

400
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,640
the records of noble families
in the past dynasties?

401
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,160
Anything that concerns the Fang Clan

402
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,959
in Liushang.

403
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:13,119
If there is anything missing
on this paper,

404
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,839
please also find it for me.

405
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:16,975
You can leave.

406
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:17,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

407
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,560
No one else knows

408
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,959
that Jianming passed out
last night, right?

409
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,475
Your Majesty, don’t worry.

410
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:30,239
It was handled in a secret way.

411
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:32,950
Tell those

412
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,700
who went to search for the cure
in every prefecture

413
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,199
not to stop.

414
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:37,599
If necessary,

415
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,959
send more people.

416
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,199
Yes, Your Majesty.

417
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,425
I’ll tell them to be more careful

418
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:44,439
and not to leak the news.

419
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
(No one died of natural causes)
There are 14 counties in Dazheng

420
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,680
(Sudden deaths in various strange ways)
and nine counties rose in rebellion.

421
00:20:04,175 --> 00:20:06,406
Of which, three counties
share a border with Liushang,

422
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:08,359
so the latter is almost encircled.

423
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,239
Lord Chu Fengyi used coercion.

424
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,079
Fang Zhiyi pretended to surrender.

425
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:16,839
On July 2nd in the 27th year of Lintai,

426
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,400
Emperor Xiu had a serious fever

427
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,170
and passed away.

428
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:22,119
I was right.

429
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,920
The late emperor died

430
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,959
before the last Lord Qinghai.

431
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,239
But the book doesn’t say

432
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:30,825
whether he undid Baixi or not.

433
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:32,599
(The emperor wouldn’t die...
Lord Qinghai had the honor to...)

434
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,239
If they didn’t undo Baixi,

435
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,800
there was no way that the late emperor

436
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,675
died before the last Lord Qinghai.

437
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,160
The 48th Lord Qinghai

438
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,719
also died later than the emperor.

439
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,520
Your Highness.

440
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:50,119
I prepared some refreshments for you.

441
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,959
You didn’t have much at lunch.

442
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,959
Have some tea and pastry.

443
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,350
Have a rest.

444
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,719
Since Dazheng was founded,

445
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,760
in addition to Master,

446
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:14,479
there are 52 Lords Qinghai in total.

447
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,400
Among them,

448
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,719
plus the last Lord Qinghai, Fang Zhiyi,

449
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:22,199
there are 17 Lords Qinghai

450
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,839
who died later than the emperors.

451
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:26,425
(The title of Lord Qinghai
has been passed down to this day)

452
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,140
I know

453
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:31,959
that the last Lord Qinghai

454
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,400
outlived Emperor Xiu by a few years.

455
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,640
I also know

456
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,719
that you take Lord Qinghai
as a close friend.

457
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,000
Probably you also
thought about setting him free.

458
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,479
There are occasional precedents

459
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,260
like you said.

460
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,079
His Majesty is right.

461
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,325
There is a way to undo Baixi.

462
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,520
But in all these books,

463
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,275
there is no mention of Baixi.

464
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,599
There is no way to know

465
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,050
how to undo Baixi.

466
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,599
Is it true that only themselves

467
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,280
can undo it?

468
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:08,695
Is he getting better?

469
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,239
Your Majesty.

470
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,119
I have inserted needles

471
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,160
to keep vitals stable,
inhibit the poison,

472
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,319
and close the important joints.

473
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,959
If nothing goes wrong,

474
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:18,839
he may be awake three days later.

475
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,439
Good.

476
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,350
I won’t come to Zhaoming Palace

477
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,599
in the next few days

478
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,289
lest some should notice it

479
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,040
and expose this matter.

480
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,000
Take good care of Lord Qinghai.

481
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,350
I’ll come after you

482
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,640
if anything happens to him.

483
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,550
Yes, Your Majesty.

484
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,100
Good day, Your Majesty.

485
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,275
Your Highness.

486
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,479
It’s morning now.

487
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,750
It’s easy to catch cold
sleeping like this.

488
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:19,035
Yuran.

489
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,199
Go and find

490
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,075
more books like these for me.

491
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,280
Never mind.

492
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,520
I’ll find them myself.

493
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,880
Please!

494
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,950
- Is there anyone crying outside?
- Let me meet her.

495
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:36,359
Maybe it’s a maid who gets punished

496
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,680
for doing something wrong.

497
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,359
I didn’t look closely when I came in.

498
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,439
Let me meet her!

499
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:42,319
Don’t worry about it, Your Highness.

500
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,959
It happens all the time in the palace.

501
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,400
Let’s check it out.

502
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,079
(Fengwu Palace)
Please!

503
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,050
Go back.

504
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,520
Your Highness!

505
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,079
Your Highness.

506
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:53,920
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness.

507
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,599
I’m begging you.

508
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,079
Please

509
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,920
save my mother and my sister.

510
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:02,199
Only you can save them now.

511
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,675
Get up first.

512
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

513
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,319
What happened?

514
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,560
Tell me.

515
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,675
I’ll help you if I can.

516
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:13,600
I’m a servant

517
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,920
of Jincheng Palace.

518
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:18,160
My family lives in Xiping Port.

519
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,959
In recent days,

520
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:22,760
there is famine everywhere
in Xiping Port.

521
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,319
Yesterday,

522
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:26,560
my mother wrote me a letter

523
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,719
that my father and my brother

524
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,160
died of starvation.

525
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,599
My sister

526
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,359
also got separated from my mother.

527
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:38,004
I don’t know what to do.

528
00:24:38,004 --> 00:24:39,359
I can only ask for your help.

529
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:40,900
Please save them.

530
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,575
I’m begging you.

531
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:44,839
Famine?

532
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,560
We need the Ministry of Revenue
to allocate food

533
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,800
and the prefectures
to open the storehouses for relief.

534
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,479
I’m in the capital.

535
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:52,119
How can I help your family?

536
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,839
People out there are saying

537
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,119
that Your Highness

538
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,760
met Dragon Tail when you were a child.

539
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,400
You are the messenger of Dragon Tail.

540
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,040
And the famine

541
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,800
is a punishment from Dragon Tail

542
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,100
because building dykes
and reclaiming land

543
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:07,079
enraged him.

544
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,880
That’s why he gave us a drought.

545
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:11,280
People died of starvation

546
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:13,280
everywhere in the southwest.

547
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:15,920
People inside and outside the palace
are saying

548
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,800
that if you can go to Xiping Port

549
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,319
and pray to Dragon Tail,

550
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,359
the victims will be saved.

551
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,439
Please!

552
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,100
Please save my family!

553
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,439
Please!

554
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,775
Please!

555
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,079
They know it’s nonsense,

556
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,439
but they keep writing memorials to me!

557
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I think it’s obvious

558
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,760
that someone took the lead

559
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,319
and united them to force me!

560
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,959
I will rip out

561
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:39,900
these remonstrants’

562
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,359
tongues one day!

563
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,075
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

564
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:45,920
Fang Haishi

565
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,160
is only a harem.

566
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,160
They unanimously want her
to relieve disaster.

567
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,100
- What can she do?
- Your Highness.

568
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,160
- Yes.
- She was an officer and she is young.

569
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,280
If she goes
to coordinate the prefectures,

570
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:57,175
before she gets there
and starts to work,

571
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,520
she will lose a layer of skin first.

572
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:02,160
Your Majesty,
Consort Chunrong presents herself.

573
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,199
You senseless thing.

574
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,975
Get out!

575
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:07,800
Your Majesty.

576
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,560
I’m here to assist Your Majesty

577
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,000
to deal with
the tricky political affairs.

578
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:16,239
Greetings, Your Majesty.

579
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,000
Rise.

580
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,750
The harem shall not
interfere in state affairs.

581
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,119
Just leave if there is nothing else

582
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,160
lest others should talk about it.

583
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:23,560
I can’t decline
to shoulder a responsibility

584
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,000
to relieve the people in disaster
in Xiping Port.

585
00:26:27,325 --> 00:26:29,205
Do you want to go to Xiping Port?

586
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,750
Since the officials and the people
have presented a petition,

587
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,160
I beg for Your Majesty’s permission.

588
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,800
I’ll go to the southwest

589
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,079
to coordinate the prefectures

590
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,319
for disaster relief.

591
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,175
Ridiculous!

592
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,040
Do you know

593
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,700
how dangerous the southwest is?

594
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,680
I know.

595
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,400
The victims are everywhere
in the southwest.

596
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,040
If we don’t appease the people,

597
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,640
there may be a rebellion.

598
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,479
Once there is civil unrest,

599
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,359
I will bear the brunt

600
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,119
and become the target.

601
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,359
At that time,

602
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,000
I’ll get killed anyway.

603
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:58,450
It’s more than that.

604
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,079
Yes.

605
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:02,079
Xiping Port has been engaged in

606
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,319
maritime trade for years.

607
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,719
Although it’s no better than Nanhuai
in Wanzhou,

608
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:08,199
there are still rich
and powerful businessmen everywhere.

609
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,959
The prefectures were established
by the imperial court,

610
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,199
and the officials were also dispatched
from the capital,

611
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,575
but these people had long been

612
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:16,599
associated with the local gentry.

613
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:19,839
They may not be of one mind.

614
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:22,000
Now the disaster is severe.

615
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,479
I think most of the prefectures
have problems.

616
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:25,839
Perhaps

617
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
even the amount of grain

618
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,160
stored in their warehouses

619
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,079
that they report every year

620
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,560
is wrong.

621
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,400
You know how complicated
the situation is,

622
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,640
but you volunteer to go.

623
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,950
Are you so confident?

624
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:39,239
I am not totally confident.

625
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,959
Only 30%.

626
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,771
30%?

627
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,160
I think

628
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,640
as long as

629
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:47,275
you are 30% confident about something,

630
00:27:47,275 --> 00:27:48,359
you can give it a try.

631
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,680
Besides,

632
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,479
I’m confident
that I can rise to the occasion.

633
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,119
After I get to Xiping Port

634
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,520
and check the situation myself,

635
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,319
I’ll be 50% confident.

636
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:59,079
And other officials

637
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,119
would be 50% confident at best.

638
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,560
You may not fully trust them,

639
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,119
but you can fully trust me.

640
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:07,200
No.

641
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,625
I won’t put you at risk.

642
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,359
Your Majesty, I know you cherish me.

643
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,199
But being a loyal subordinate

644
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,040
is to devote oneself

645
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,520
to the country.

646
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,319
As long as I can save the people
from suffering

647
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,599
and solve the problems of Dazheng,

648
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,119
I’m willing to take the risk.

649
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,520
This is the value of my existence.

650
00:28:24,975 --> 00:28:25,839
Your Majesty,

651
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,400
please don’t make me hide in the capital

652
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,920
like a bird in a cage,

653
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,800
wearing down my spirit.

654
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,599
I beg for Your Majesty’s permission

655
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,800
to let me go to Xiping Port.

656
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Mu Deqing.

657
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,630
Yes.

658
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,375
Bring me

659
00:28:50,775 --> 00:28:51,560
the Seal of Inspection.

660
00:28:51,975 --> 00:28:52,959
Yes, Your Majesty.

661
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:02,625
Have you

662
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,425
been to Zhaoming Palace these days?

663
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,359
Your Majesty.

664
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,680
I don’t like going out.

665
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:11,839
I’ve been staying at Fengwu Palace

666
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:13,040
and reading as a pastime.

667
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:24,040
Your Majesty.

668
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,700
Receive the imperial edict, Fang Haishi.

669
00:29:35,725 --> 00:29:37,040
With this Seal of Inspection,

670
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:39,119
you can act on my behalf.

671
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,479
Wherever you go,

672
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,160
the governors and magistrates

673
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,599
will be all at your disposal.

674
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,160
I order you
to leave for Xiping Port immediately

675
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,199
to relieve people in disaster

676
00:29:47,475 --> 00:29:48,719
without fail.

677
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

678
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,640
Your Majesty.

679
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,800
I have a favor to ask you.

680
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,175
Young Master Haishi.

681
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,119
Do I still look like

682
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,019
a young master?

683
00:30:19,675 --> 00:30:20,635
Consort Chunrong.

684
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:26,750
Lord is not here.

685
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,400
Shaozi.

686
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,175
Um.

687
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,959
Today

688
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:39,119
I will leave for Xiping Port
for disaster relief

689
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,040
under His Majesty’s order.

690
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,025
I need you to send some men to help me.

691
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,400
I’ll dispatch soldiers
for you immediately.

692
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,239
Thank you.

693
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,359
There’s no need
to tell that person I came.

694
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:02,400
I’ll leave.

695
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,675
Good day, Your Highness.

696
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,920
It’s easy

697
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,520
to go to the southwest,

698
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,760
but difficult

699
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:26,959
to leave.

700
00:31:28,425 --> 00:31:31,760
Your Highness is a strategic genius.

701
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,280
Without a stir,

702
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,839
you put Fang Haishi

703
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
on a road of no return.

704
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,920
She used the story
of meeting an immortal

705
00:31:39,975 --> 00:31:41,239
to fish for fame and credit.

706
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,160
She offended Dragon Tail.

707
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:45,500
It’s a capital crime.

708
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,359
Now there are victims everywhere
in the southwest.

709
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:50,294
If her trick is discovered

710
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,959
and she dies there,

711
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:55,079
even Fang Jianming who made up the story

712
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:57,119
will be held accountable for it.

713
00:31:58,425 --> 00:31:59,275
Your Highness.

714
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:02,119
You’re killing two birds with one stone.

715
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:04,959
Speaking of Fang Jianming,

716
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:08,300
I think I haven’t seen him

717
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,439
for two or three days.

718
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,880
He didn’t show up
in the morning session.

719
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,319
Yeah.

720
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,359
He hasn’t shown up for a few days.

721
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,239
Secretary Shi also said

722
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,280
that he didn’t see him walking around

723
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,680
in the palace these days.

724
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:27,239
Did Fang Jianming leave the capital?

725
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,719
There are our men at every gate.

726
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:31,400
There is no news

727
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,800
of Fang Jianming leaving.

728
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,719
If he neither

729
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,760
secretly left the capital

730
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,175
nor showed up in public,

731
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,680
maybe he has been

732
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,239
hiding somewhere

733
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:43,439
because of sickness.

734
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
I’ll send a message to Secretary Shi

735
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,920
and ask him to find out what happened.

736
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,560
If Fang Jianming

737
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,119
is sick indeed

738
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,719
and can’t show up,

739
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:57,359
then Fang Haishi is out there alone

740
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:58,680
without his help,

741
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,880
and this show

742
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,475
is going to be more interesting.

743
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,160
Yes.

744
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,599
Madam Pearl

745
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,359
will go on an inspection tour

746
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,479
to the southwest for disaster relief.

747
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,959
The trip is hard.

748
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,615
May things go well for Madam Pearl

749
00:33:33,825 --> 00:33:35,304
and may she return safely soon!

750
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:41,105
- May things go well for Madam Pearl!
- May things go well for Madam Pearl!

751
00:33:41,105 --> 00:33:42,959
- May you return safely soon!
- May you return safely soon!

752
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:47,920
Farewell, Your Majesty.

753
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
You may rise.

754
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,439
Didn’t you say

755
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:36,439
he would wake up in three days?

756
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:37,399
This is the fifth day!

757
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:38,700
Why isn’t he getting any better?

758
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:41,560
Mercy, Your Majesty.

759
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:42,425
I...

760
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,919
I’ve tried my best.

761
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,520
I’ve used needles and burned mugwort.

762
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,239
I’ve done everything

763
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,879
I can think of.

764
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:52,120
But Lord Qinghai is still in a coma.

765
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:52,919
I...

766
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,840
There’s nothing I can do about it.

767
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,360
You...!

768
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,550
Your Majesty!

769
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:58,520
Your Majesty!

770
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,950
Consort Shurong sent a message

771
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,000
that she found something
in the medical book

772
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,360
and she asked to see you now.

773
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,525
I’ll be there right now.

774
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,025
I’ll hold you accountable
if anything happens to him!

775
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:17,550
Wait outside.

776
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:18,239
Yes.

777
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,679
Bizi, leave us.

778
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:20,275
Yes.

779
00:35:26,025 --> 00:35:27,725
You found something in the medical book?

780
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:28,560
When Bizi

781
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,080
was pouring tea for me,

782
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,900
she accidentally spilled some on it.

783
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,520
What does that mean?

784
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,199
This is the ancient language of Zhunian.

785
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,439
It says

786
00:35:51,725 --> 00:35:53,000
no matter

787
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,280
what the poison is,

788
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,080
the one who is poisoned can be cured

789
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,625
with Dragon Tail’s blessing.

790
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,239
Dragon Tail’s blessing?

791
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,159
Except for Fang Haishi,

792
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,000
I’ve never heard of

793
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,340
anyone else who met Dragon Tail.

794
00:36:08,825 --> 00:36:10,239
Was there anyone who got poisoned

795
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,239
going to sea in search of Dragon Tail?

796
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,280
Yes.

797
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,120
But I’ve never heard of

798
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,750
anyone returning with a cure.

799
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,919
When I was a child,

800
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:22,280
I heard some stories

801
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,800
in the palace of Zhunian

802
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:25,080
that some people went to sea

803
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,840
to ask Dragon Tail for the cure,

804
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:29,040
but Dragon Tail didn’t grant.

805
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,040
At that time, people thought

806
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,840
it was the elixir of life.

807
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,399
But now it seems

808
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,225
that it could be the antidote.

809
00:36:39,025 --> 00:36:40,950
Is there anything else on it

810
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,120
that says something specific

811
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,450
about the cure?

812
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:45,159
No.

813
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,881
In this case,

814
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:50,639
I think it’s probably just a legend

815
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,439
and a wish.

816
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:52,560
Your Majesty.

817
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,800
Well,

818
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:55,840
it mentioned in a Leizhou legend

819
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,320
passed down orally

820
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,399
for generations

821
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,399
that the hair, blood

822
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:01,520
and scales of Dragon Tail

823
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,000
can be used as medicine to save lives.

824
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,239
Since there are such records

825
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,600
in the medical book,

826
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,120
it means these legends

827
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,840
may not be meaningless.

828
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:12,040
In that case,
what about luminous pearls?

829
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,560
Can that work?

830
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,679
Luminous pearls...

831
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,800
Luminous pearls
are the tears of Dragon Tail.

832
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:20,760
It should be able to work.

833
00:37:21,425 --> 00:37:23,150
Luminous pearls, right.

834
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:26,399
Thank you, Tilan.

835
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,050
Your Majesty, don’t say that.

836
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,600
You said

837
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,840
that husband and wife
should share the burden together.

838
00:37:37,325 --> 00:37:38,600
About Dawn Flower...

839
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:39,959
I...

840
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,760
You don’t need to explain.

841
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,879
I don’t know the details,

842
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,959
but I know

843
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:47,000
you are worried about something.

844
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,310
Your Majesty,
go and save that person now.

845
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,100
Mu Deqing, hurry.

846
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,600
Your Majesty.

847
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,360
Go and get luminous pearls

848
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,275
from Madam Pearl’s dowry.

849
00:38:07,825 --> 00:38:08,439
Yes.

850
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,199
Your Majesty.

851
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,075
The pearls have been ground up
for use as medicine.

852
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:24,600
Come on.

853
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:03,225
Jianming.

854
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,171
Fang Haishi has left for the southwest.

855
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,130
If you leave now,

856
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,529
you will be separated from her forever,

857
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:16,591
and she will regret it
for the rest of her life.

858
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:19,850
At that time,

859
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,700
I don’t know if I can keep her safe.

860
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,840
Therefore,

861
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,320
even for her sake,

862
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,829
you must wake up soon.

863
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:35,075
Do you understand?

864
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,320
Jianming! Jianming!

865
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:50,959
Jianming!

866
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:52,075
Physician! Physician!

867
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:53,725
This is...

868
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,120
What’s wrong with him again?

869
00:39:58,650 --> 00:39:59,959
How is he? How is he?!

870
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,679
Your Majesty, don’t worry.

871
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,959
I think the luminous pearls

872
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:09,120
forced some poison out of his body.

873
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,679
Lord Qinghai

874
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,239
is safe for now.

875
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,840
Can these pearls

876
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,575
clean

877
00:40:18,575 --> 00:40:20,350
all the poison in his body?

878
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,800
I don’t know yet.

879
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,125
It’ll take a few more days

880
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:25,436
to tell.

881
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:59,275
(Tianqi-Shangyang Pass-Donghe Plain
-Suizhong-Xiping Port)

882
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,520
Your Highness.

883
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:26,560
We will arrive in Xiping Port

884
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,439
two hours later.

885
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,800
Wake up.

886
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,000
Get up. Get up.

887
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:42,840
Mother.

888
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,990
Just as they said,

889
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,320
people are suffering from starvation
in the southwest

890
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,840
and there are victims everywhere.

891
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,639
How is the situation inside the city?

892
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,239
Strangely,

893
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,080
there are so many victims,

894
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,600
but they’re all from
the surrounding prefectures.

895
00:41:57,879 --> 00:41:58,875
There aren’t

896
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,679
fewer people inside the city.

897
00:42:00,879 --> 00:42:02,199
Instead, people are gathering there.

898
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:05,239
I found it quite strange.

899
00:42:05,879 --> 00:42:07,040
People are gathering there?

900
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,239
Is it because they opened the storehouse
for disaster relief?

901
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,750
But a few months ago,

902
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,320
the Prefect of Xiping Port,
Liu Changping,

903
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,360
wrote a memorial

904
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,040
that the storehouse
was running out of food

905
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,320
and there was no food left.

906
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,320
I’ve been to Xiping Port before.

907
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,600
At that time, Mr. Chen Heran

908
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,320
was the Prefect of Xiping Port.

909
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,439
Xiping Port was thriving.

910
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,159
I don’t know much about

911
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,399
Mr. Liu who has just been
transferred here.

912
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,525
Keep an eye on him for me.

913
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,959
