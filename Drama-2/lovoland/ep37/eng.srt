25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,479
Greetings to Your Majesty.

26
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,559
Rise.

27
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,559
You came just in time.

28
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,119
Lord Qinghai said you met an immortal
when you were a child,

29
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,600
but the officials are doubtful

30
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,080
and they don’t believe it.

31
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:28,800
Can you prove it?

32
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,479
Your Majesty.

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,360
I only need a bowl of clear water

34
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,780
to prove myself.

35
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,881
Bring it.

36
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:04,199
How did it happen?

37
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,160
- This is...
- This is...

38
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,759
This is magic.

39
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,160
It’s true that she met an immortal

40
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,360
when she was a child.

41
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,675
Well...

42
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,480
Yeah.

43
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,550
Is it real?

44
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,359
It’s amazing.

45
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,279
Yeah.

46
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:28,359
Your Majesty!

47
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,119
Even if Fang once met an immortal
in childhood,

48
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,160
she did enter the court
dressed as a man!

49
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,839
Lord Qinghai concealed it on purpose

50
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,119
and then the two of them conspired

51
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:40,320
to secretly release the usurper,
Fang Zhuoying.

52
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:43,559
Now he presented Fang to Your Majesty.

53
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,000
Everything Lord Qinghai did
is for his own interest.

54
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,440
I’m afraid he is up to something.

55
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,425
Your Majesty knows best!

56
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,000
- Your Majesty knows best!
- Your Majesty knows best!

57
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,160
Consort Chunrong,

58
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,679
what is that smile about?

59
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,000
Your Majesty.

60
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,640
Every time when these officials

61
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,720
confidently accuse Lord Qinghai,

62
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,519
I’m just curious

63
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,300
that if Lord Qinghai

64
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,640
is as disloyal and wicked as you said,

65
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,480
why hasn’t he eradicated

66
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,350
the so-called loyal officials like you?

67
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:20,040
Instead, he took the blame

68
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,275
every time

69
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,880
just to protect your reputation.

70
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:25,160
That was his trick.

71
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,959
What do you know?

72
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,440
Of course I don’t know it.

73
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,239
I’ve been following Lord Qinghai

74
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,839
to learn martial arts and study
since I was a child.

75
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:35,399
Lord Qinghai taught me

76
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:36,640
not to see my childhood experience

77
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,679
as something auspicious.

78
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,760
Because in Dazheng,

79
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,720
the most auspicious thing

80
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,359
is to have a wise emperor
ruling the country.

81
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:46,500
If Your Majesty needs me,

82
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,799
I am auspicious.

83
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,279
If not,

84
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,040
I’m a soldier of sacrifice.

85
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,640
If I’m a soldier of sacrifice,

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,640
you can just bury me with dirt.

87
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,500
What’s the right thing?

88
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,079
Being loyal to Your Majesty

89
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,839
is the only right thing.

90
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,575
Well done, Lord Qinghai.

91
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,625
It’s true that women and small-minded men
are hard to deal with.

92
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,959
We don’t have a quick tongue like Fang,

93
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,625
but we won’t believe

94
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,625
your lies!

95
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,279
Of course you don’t understand

96
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,200
the way Lord Qinghai handles things.

97
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,375
Not to mention Lord Qinghai

98
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,495
made great contribution to His Majesty.

99
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,320
In recent years,

100
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,640
who led the army

101
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,440
to fight the wars,

102
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,959
repel the Huku people

103
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:29,239
and guard the frontier?

104
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:30,839
Is it you?

105
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,480
Is it you?

106
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,640
Or is it Lord Qinghai?

107
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,000
I don’t know

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,519
if you have ever been to Huangquan Pass.

109
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,160
At there,

110
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,799
no matter it’s the Huku people,

111
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,959
the Nihualuo people,

112
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,160
or the Zhunian people,

113
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,880
without His Majesty’s consent,

114
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:51,119
no one can get through the pass.

115
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,399
Generals and soldiers there

116
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,679
are not allowed to leave

117
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,480
without order.

118
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,200
This is the order given by Lord Qinghai

119
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,559
that must be enforced.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,079
If there is fire

121
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,399
burning the Huangquan Pass,

122
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,600
we will be burnt to death.

123
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,000
If there is drift ice or a torrent

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,359
flooding the Huangquan Pass,

125
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,079
we will be drowned to death.

126
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,480
No one can leave!

127
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,160
What are the soldiers there

128
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,119
risking their lives for?

129
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,160
To let you be able

130
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,119
to question Lord Qinghai here?

131
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:24,839
Of course not.

132
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,320
We’re fighting for the peace of Dazheng

133
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:29,000
and the peace of the people!

134
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:34,200
Lord Qinghai taught me in person

135
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,359
to be loyal to Your Majesty.

136
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,559
I dare not hide anything
from Your Majesty,

137
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,799
nor hide anything from the people.

138
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,350
But if the world knows

139
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,125
that a patriot

140
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,279
is put in such a tough spot at court,

141
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,519
how disappointed

142
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,079
the soldiers of Dazheng will be?

143
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,119
How disappointed
the whole world will be?

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,840
Your Majesty.

145
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,799
Lord Qinghai’s exploits are numberless.

146
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:02,839
He lives a simple and respectable life.

147
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,640
Fang also fights with her life
to make achievements.

148
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,519
I’m ashamed.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,040
You vile men!

150
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,500
You didn’t say anything

151
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,559
when Lord Qinghai went to war.

152
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:14,119
Now he is back
and you want him to die.

153
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,320
Who will risk their lives

154
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,679
to fight again?

155
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:17,850
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

156
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,839
- He is right.
- Yeah.

157
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

158
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,100
Where were they when I was fighting?

159
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,950
That’s ridiculous.

160
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,760
I’ve known about

161
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,720
Consort Chunrong long ago.

162
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,840
It was my decision

163
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,681
to get her into Jifeng Pavilion.

164
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,875
As for Fang Zhuoying,

165
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,559
I’ve made a decision.

166
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,475
Lord Qinghai has been punished.

167
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,039
Don’t talk about it anymore.

168
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:47,760
Adjourn the court session.

169
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:51,916
Adjourn the court session!

170
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,599
- Wise Your Majesty!
- Wise Your Majesty!

171
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,919
- Congratulations on a new consort!
- Congratulations on a new consort!

172
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:00,520
- May Dazheng thrive forever!
- May Dazheng thrive forever!

173
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,780
Your Majesty, why did you
let Consort Chunrong come to court?

174
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,520
She chose to do it.

175
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,119
She still wants to protect you

176
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,631
even if she thinks

177
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,775
that you are using her and lying to her.

178
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,679
You shouldn’t let her choose.

179
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:27,400
She can’t

180
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,599
get involved with me now.

181
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,539
Jianming.

182
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,760
Don’t underestimate

183
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,625
Fang Haishi’s feelings for you.

184
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,050
Even if I don’t tell her,

185
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,400
she knows you’re in a tough spot

186
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,479
and she will do everything

187
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:47,599
to protect you.

188
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,925
That’s exactly why

189
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,280
I can’t get her in trouble.

190
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,919
Give yourself a break,

191
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,479
even just for one moment, all right?

192
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,520
What about Your Majesty?

193
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,239
Are you willing
to let go of Consort Shurong

194
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
and set yourself free?

195
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,119
Consort Shurong
is different from Fang Haishi.

196
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:13,000
No, they are the same.

197
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:14,985
During these days,

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,080
I’ve been watching you.

199
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,359
Consort Shurong
is deeply in love with you.

200
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,050
You blame her

201
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,760
and won’t forgive her

202
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,039
because you have

203
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,280
feelings for her now.

204
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:28,875
Your Majesty,
have you thought about this?

205
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:30,799
Back at that time,

206
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,919
although life in the palace
was not extremely difficult,

207
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,359
we were not living an easy life.

208
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,039
Not to mention Consort Shurong.

209
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,919
Zhunian sees her as a pawn.

210
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
She has no one to rely on in Dazheng.

211
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,679
Someone is watching her from the dark.

212
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,760
You can’t really blame her

213
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,000
that I got poisoned.

214
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:48,000
Besides, even if she didn’t do it,

215
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:49,320
someone else would do it.

216
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,960
Jianming.

217
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,555
Give me some time.

218
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,479
Fang Jianming stole a march on us!

219
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,400
He took such a risk.

220
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,250
I didn’t expect this.

221
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:14,375
He burnt the bridge behind him.

222
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,450
Fang Jianming

223
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,010
takes Fang Haishi as his confidant.

224
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,359
I didn’t expect him

225
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:24,039
to give her to the Emperor.

226
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,119
Did you find out

227
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,750
who leaked the news

228
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,840
that I would make a move
against Fang Haishi?

229
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,731
Most of the servants were born here.

230
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,520
They are reliable.

231
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,125
There are about 70 to 80 servants

232
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,925
we bought from the outside.

233
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,039
Less than 20 of them

234
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,239
have access to the inner courtyard.

235
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:46,559
I’ve looked into them

236
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,719
one by one

237
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,574
and I found nothing.

238
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:52,265
Since you found nothing,

239
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,599
just kill them all.

240
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,080
Kill them all?

241
00:11:58,479 --> 00:11:59,359
Your Highness.

242
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,359
It’s a large number of people.

243
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:03,080
It will draw His Majesty’s attention.

244
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,440
The servants buy some toadstools
by mistake.

245
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,799
These people are poisoned to death
by the soup.

246
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,159
Do you need me to teach you about this?

247
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,440
Yes, yes.

248
00:12:10,075 --> 00:12:11,034
Met an immortal?

249
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,960
Dragon Tail is nothing but

250
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,640
a legendary fairy.

251
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,960
They made use of it.

252
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,960
Now I’m behind them.

253
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,559
Public opinion now

254
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,880
is in favor of Fang Jianming
and Fang Haishi,

255
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,799
If we do anything again...

256
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,960
Spread the news

257
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,559
that I’m going to join hands
with the inside and the outside.

258
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:40,916
Fang Haishi won’t live long.

259
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,840
It will happen one day.

260
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:52,520
Greetings to Your Majesty.

261
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,000
It was a close shave yesterday.

262
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:26,600
You are saved

263
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,840
and the problem of Jianming is solved.

264
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,050
Why did you come to me

265
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,440
early in the morning?

266
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:38,440
I’d like to ask for
Your Majesty’s mercy.

267
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,475
Your Majesty, please untie

268
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:42,320
the Baixi between you and Lord Qinghai.

269
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,520
If you agree,

270
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,799
I will use my life

271
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,039
to serve Your Majesty.

272
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:51,760
Are you pleading for Jianming?

273
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,520
Yes.

274
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:55,960
I know

275
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:57,825
that the last Lord Qinghai

276
00:13:57,825 --> 00:13:59,200
outlived Emperor Xiu by a few years.

277
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:00,479
I also know

278
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:03,520
that you take Lord Qinghai
as a close friend.

279
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:07,505
Probably you also
thought about setting him free.

280
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,325
There are occasional precedents

281
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,625
for things like that.

282
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,709
As you said,

283
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,359
Jianming and I

284
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,025
are a lot closer than real brothers.

285
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,640
But I told you yesterday

286
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:27,550
that I didn’t choose Jianming.

287
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,039
It was Jianming who chose me.

288
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:42,375
In the battle in front of Tongping City,

289
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,025
I was severely wounded and dying.

290
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:48,239
Jianming rushed into the camp

291
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,540
and used Baixi on me.

292
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,500
When I woke up,

293
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,850
there was not a scar

294
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,799
on my body,

295
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:04,960
but Jianming had fallen to the ground

296
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,280
and passed out.

297
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:11,946
These wounds on his body

298
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,429
should have been on me.

299
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,800
From then on,

300
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,325
I’ve wanted to untie Baixi.

301
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,359
I’ve tried everything I can,

302
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:24,255
but nothing is achieved

303
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,640
to this day.

304
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,275
Why?

305
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,600
Unless Jianming wants to do it,

306
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,870
no one else can untie it.

307
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:36,559
You mean,

308
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,119
he doesn’t want to untie it?

309
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,150
No.

310
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,919
Jianming didn’t want
to untie it at first,

311
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,200
but then,

312
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,280
it was too late.

313
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,450
Go to Zhaoming Palace.

314
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,760
- Consort Chunrong...
- Where is he?

315
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,160
Lord is in the study.

316
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,440
Consort Chunrong...

317
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:40,840
How dare you!

318
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,129
I’m guilty.

319
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:54,280
You are guilty.

320
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,575
You came uninvited.

321
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,850
It’s inappropriate
that you broke in like this.

322
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,640
If it happens again,

323
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,079
I’m afraid

324
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,079
I can’t stay in Zhaoming Palace anymore.

325
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,150
I want you to tell me the truth.

326
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,199
Are you

327
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,520
His Majesty’s Baixi?

328
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,325
Yes, or no?

329
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,680
Didn’t you just

330
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,760
verify it yourself?

331
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,680
I want you to tell me in person!

332
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:31,920
Yes.

333
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,319
I’m His Majesty’s Baixi.

334
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Have you ever

335
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,720
wavered a little bit?

336
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:59,254
Have you ever wanted
to get your freedom back

337
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:01,534
and start a family?

338
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:15,984
You have.

339
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:19,959
I can hear you saying

340
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,719
in your heart that you have.

341
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,800
Yes.

342
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:32,175
But it was in the past.

343
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:36,125
We all have a moment of weakness.

344
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,200
I’m no exception.

345
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:43,079
But when it comes to a crucial moment,

346
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,040
I have to choose to do

347
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,400
what I must do.

348
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,640
What is it that you must do?

349
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:54,079
To protect His Majesty,
to protect Dazheng,

350
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,920
and to protect the people
from suffering?

351
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:00,835
Let me ask you.

352
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,050
You gave me up.

353
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,160
What did you get in return?

354
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,571
At this point,

355
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:42,695
you still won’t tell me anything.

356
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,040
When I was a child,

357
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,359
you told me

358
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,020
when I first met you

359
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,040
that if I follow you

360
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,479
and live as a girl,

361
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,630
I would have nothing but an easy life.

362
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,025
If I live as a boy,

363
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,680
I would have everything

364
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,239
except for an easy life.

365
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,239
You told me to decide on my own.

366
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:13,640
Why can’t you

367
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,400
let me decide

368
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,760
this time?

369
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:33,359
From now on,

370
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,806
I’ll have nothing to do with you.

371
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:46,525
(Moral and Virtuous)

372
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:13,825
(Fengwu Palace)

373
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,040
Jianming.

374
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,239
If I go into Fengwu Palace

375
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:26,265
and announce the edict,

376
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:28,199
Fang Haishi

377
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,199
will really become Consort Chunrong.

378
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:30,599
Yes.

379
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:33,280
You can still turn back now.

380
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,560
In the future...

381
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,119
I have no future.

382
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,079
I’ve secretly sent people

383
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,319
to Zhunian to find the cure.

384
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,975
There may be hope!

385
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:44,199
I...

386
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:46,304
I’m in awe of the heaven
and cherish my fate.

Consort Chunrong, Fang,

438
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:40,199
is meritorious and blessed by god

439
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,839
who is dignified and graceful by nature.

440
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,959
Now Commander-in-chief,
also Lord Qinghai,

441
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,920
brings the edict and the seal.

442
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,119
Fang is mannered and gentle,

443
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,920
virtuous and obedient,

00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:54,560

Now Fang is made a consort.

May you always be modest

449
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,839

Go back and get some rest.

460
00:27:10,225 --> 00:27:11,505
I’ll leave then.

461
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:17,675
(Jincheng Palace)

463
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:34,824

465
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,359
The physician has arrived.

466
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:54,640
Hurry, hurry.

467
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,325
Greetings to Your Majesty.

468
00:27:57,325 --> 00:27:58,079
Your Majesty.

469
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:58,880
Don’t speak.

470
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,839
Check Jianming’s injury now.

471
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,479
Yes.

472
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,319
Lord Qinghai.

473
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:24,079
How is it? How is it?

474
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,040
Your Majesty.

475
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,439
The poison in Lord Qinghai
took effect this time

476
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,319
because he worries too much.

477
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,560
I need to add a few more herbs

478
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,439
that can soothe the nerves
in the prescription.

479
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,560
Lord Qinghai.

480
00:28:37,775 --> 00:28:40,160
Please stay calm.

481
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,040
Otherwise,

482
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,750
this will happen more frequently
in the future.

483
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,900
Worry too much.

484
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:48,880
I knew it.

485
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,359
Jianming.

486
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,479
You never showed your feelings.

487
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:55,040
When can you change yourself?

488
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,000
No cure yet?

489
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,850
Mercy, Your Majesty.

490
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,725
This is an extremely rare poison
in Zhunian.

491
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,959
There’s never...

492
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,560
There’s never a cure.

493
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:08,750
I...

494
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:11,280
I’ve turned over
all kinds of medical books

495
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,280
to search for the cure,

496
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,640
and I learned that the king of Zhunian

497
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,000
was also poisoned by the Down Flower

498
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,839
decades ago.

499
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,625
There wasn’t a cure, then he...

500
00:29:27,325 --> 00:29:28,160
Your Majesty.

501
00:29:28,925 --> 00:29:30,119
It’s already like this.

502
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,791
Don’t make it difficult for them.

503
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,375
(Yu’an Palace)

504
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,600
Your Majesty.

505
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,791
Well,

506
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,100
I’m no longer welcomed at Yu’an Palace

507
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,725
because I grounded you?

508
00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:46,400
No.

509
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,439
It’s just Your Majesty

510
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,760
took a consort today.

511
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,760
I thought...

512
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:54,800
What?

513
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:00,359
Nothing.

514
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:01,625
Bizi.

515
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,520
Bring tea to His Majesty.

516
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,280
No need.

517
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,560
Leave us.

518
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,079
Yes.

519
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,040
Are you tired?

520
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:24,625
Um.

521
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,719
Do you want to know something
about Zhunian?

522
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,425
The men I sent to Zhunian

523
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,100
brought news back

524
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,721
that Suolan is the same as always.

525
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,119
He is not controlled or coerced at all.

526
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:51,000
Your mother is also doing well.

527
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:53,959
I’ve ordered the best men
of the Secret Force

528
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,040
to stay in Zhunian

529
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,050
and protect them in the dark

530
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,530
just in case.

531
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:01,800
And the maid,

532
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,400
I’ve also sent people

533
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,625
to bury her properly.

534
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:10,119
Now you can rest assured?

535
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:13,795
Thank you, Your Majesty.

536
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,686
I know.

537
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,560
You never

538
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,120
wanted to poison me.

539
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:31,464
I’ve been thinking about these days

540
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,680
that why you kept everything

541
00:32:35,325 --> 00:32:36,724
to yourself

542
00:32:37,525 --> 00:32:39,925
and why you didn’t

543
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,640
tell me the truth right away.

544
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:46,640
I guess

545
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,280
you still can’t rely on me.

546
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,545
No.

547
00:32:51,975 --> 00:32:53,640
I know Your Majesty

548
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:55,565
has been really good to me.

549
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:59,520
It’s just I grew up getting used to

550
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:02,280
facing everything on my own.

551
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:05,479
I never relied on anyone.

552
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:22,000
Tilan.

553
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:25,839
Do you remember

554
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,425
you once told me

555
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,786
that you will never let me be alone?

556
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:34,839
You said

557
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,475
you will stay by my side

558
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,900
to the end of time.

559
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,800
I said it.

560
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:47,654
Since we will spend our lives together,

561
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:51,200
all the things we can’t tell others,

562
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:52,719
and all the things

563
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,920
we can’t let others do

564
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,760
should be shared with each other.

565
00:33:58,675 --> 00:34:00,234
That’s what husband and wife should do.

566
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,575
Husband... Husband and wife?

567
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,679
Silly.

568
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,360
Are you not my wife?

569
00:34:14,025 --> 00:34:16,265
I’m Your Majesty’s wife.

570
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:20,159
May I be by your side

571
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,360
always and forever.

572
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,719
Why are you crying?

573
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,525
You are about to be a mother.

574
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:32,166
Why are you still like a child?

575
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,239
I’m happy.

576
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,570
You can’t cry for joy.

577
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:39,950
I’m here.

578
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,181
I’m here.

579
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,260
Don’t worry anymore.

580
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,919
Your Majesty.

581
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,200
Time to get up.

582
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,750
Your Majesty.

583
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:19,879
Consort Chunrong is heading for
Jincheng Palace early in the morning

584
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:21,679
to pay respects to you
according to the rules.

585
00:35:21,975 --> 00:35:23,200
Go back now

586
00:35:23,475 --> 00:35:26,834
and tell Consort Chunrong

587
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,011
that the morning
and evening greetings are exempt.

588
00:35:29,575 --> 00:35:30,454
Yes, Your Majesty.

589
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:34,185
Please don’t do this, Your Majesty.

590
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,959
Leave us.

591
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,000
Yes.

592
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,089
Why did you wake up so early?

593
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,800
I can take a nap in Yu’an Palace

594
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,600
during the day,

595
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:53,825
so I don’t sleep for too long.

596
00:35:55,925 --> 00:35:58,919
Why don’t you let Haishi
pay her respects?

597
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,639
Is it because of me?

598
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:03,600
Please don’t snub Haishi

599
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,800
because of me.

600
00:36:07,025 --> 00:36:08,680
I just took a new consort.

601
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,600
You’re not jealous,

602
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,760
and you even ask me not to snub her?

603
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,180
Haishi

604
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,471
is different from other people.

605
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,080
She saved my life.

606
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:23,399
I see her as my confidante.

607
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,825
You are

608
00:36:24,825 --> 00:36:26,239
getting bolder now.

609
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,840
After knowing Fang Haishi is a woman,

610
00:36:29,175 --> 00:36:31,215
you even use the word “confidante”.

611
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,725
You didn’t get jealous
because of Fang Haishi,

612
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:36,320
but I did.

613
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:39,600
Your Majesty.

614
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,360
I forgot to tell you yesterday

615
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:48,185
that I only took Fang Haishi
as my consort

616
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:51,366
to save her and Lord Qinghai.

617
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,280
She is only a subordinate of mine.

618
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:56,560
She is not my wife.

619
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,900
I will set her free one day.

620
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:01,959
Well,

621
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:04,800
am I a womanizer

622
00:37:04,825 --> 00:37:06,439
in your heart?

623
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,840
I already have you,

624
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,365
will I think about other women?

625
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,919
Since you see her as your confidante,

626
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,360
I will order her to visit you often

627
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,725
and talk to you.

628
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,950
Thank you, Your Majesty.

629
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:30,360
(Jincheng Palace)

630
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,320
Greetings to Consort Chunrong.

631
00:37:32,725 --> 00:37:33,645
Eunuch Mu.

632
00:37:33,925 --> 00:37:34,591
Yes.

633
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,000
His Majesty ordered

634
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:40,175
to spare you
the morning and evening greetings.

635
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,550
Thanks to His Majesty.

636
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,800
His Majesty also said

637
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:48,399
that if you feel bored,

638
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,786
you can go to Yu’an Palace.

639
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,199
Consort Shurong is grounded now.

640
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,825
She is thinking about you.

641
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,439
His Majesty is thoughtful indeed.

642
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,959
I’m truly grateful.

643
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,600
Thank you, Eunuch Mu.

644
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,525
Don’t say that.

645
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,320
Fang Jianming is a crafty man.

646
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,000
Now Fang Haishi
becomes Consort Chunrong.

647
00:38:25,575 --> 00:38:27,439
Even the kids on the street

648
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:28,719
are singing a song

649
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,825
about Fang Haishi
meeting an immortal in her childhood

650
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:32,900
and she is the messenger of Dragon Tail.

651
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,800
What a big title.

652
00:38:38,175 --> 00:38:39,579
I’m afraid it’s hard

653
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,000
to make a move against her again.

654
00:38:42,275 --> 00:38:43,995
Met an immortal in her childhood?

655
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:45,855
Madam Pearl?

656
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,159
His Majesty is getting

657
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,360
more ridiculous and capricious.

658
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,120
To save Fang Haishi,

659
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Fang Jianming

660
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,719
did everything he can.

661
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,530
He even made up such a story.

662
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,180
No mortal has ever seen Dragon Tail.

663
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,000
Of course they will believe

664
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,050
what they say.

665
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,311
I like the phrase

666
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,651
“meeting an immortal”.

667
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,169
It sounds auspicious.

668
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,494
Let’s see if she can take it.

669
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:34,280
Your Highness, why did you

670
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,879
get all the medical books

671
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:37,320
you brought from Zhunian

672
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,000
and read them day and night?

673
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,320
Are you looking for something?

674
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:41,360
I didn’t

675
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,959
read these books very carefully before.

676
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,309
I want to read them again.

677
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,330
If it’s just for killing time,

678
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,679
you should read less.

679
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,239
Even if you are not tired,

680
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,840
the little prince in your womb

681
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,919
still needs rest.

682
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,360
The baby hasn’t been born yet.

683
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,275
How do you know it’s a prince?

684
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,959
His Majesty has no children.

685
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,879
If it’s a prince,
he will be the crown prince.

686
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,775
Of course I hope it’s a little prince.

687
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,600
Don’t you want a prince?

688
00:40:05,425 --> 00:40:07,784
It’s the same for me
whether it’s a prince or a princess.

689
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:10,795
I just want him to be safe and happy.

690
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,399
Your Highness.

691
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:17,360
Consort Chunrong is here.

692
00:40:17,475 --> 00:40:18,876
Haishi is here!

693
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,360
Official Haishi greets Consort Shurong.

694
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,399
Haishi.

695
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,639
You are in a consort’s clothes now.

696
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:36,280
Don’t greet me like this again.

697
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,399
You are not an official to me.

698
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:39,560
We are sisters.

699
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,560
From now on, I’ll call you Haishi

700
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,840
and you can call me Tilan.

701
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,159
Bizi, leave us.

702
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,359
I want to talk to Haishi.

703
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,719
- Yes.
- Yes.

704
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,621
You’ve lost some weight.

705
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:08,275
Are you not used to the life here?

706
00:41:08,975 --> 00:41:11,215
I used to serve in the palace

707
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,809
and I never felt
there are so many walls.

708
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,440
Now I’m trapped in the harem,

709
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:17,850
I realized

710
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,975
that I’m like a bird in a cage.

711
00:41:20,325 --> 00:41:21,800
Even you are a caged bird,

712
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:24,040
you’re not a tit or a warbler,

713
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:26,054
you are a gyrfalcon.

714
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,981
Even you are trapped for now,

715
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,511
you will fly away sooner or later.

716
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,269
His Majesty also said

717
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,539
that he will set you free one day.

718
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,120
His Majesty?

719
00:41:39,725 --> 00:41:40,800
He told me

720
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,481
everything about you.

721
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,239
In fact, I knew you are a girl

722
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:49,280
from the day you saved me.

723
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:51,959
At that time,

724
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,479
you were free

725
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,760
and just being yourself.

726
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,159
Although you are a girl,
but you are better than a man.

727
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,125
I was envious of you.

728
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,879
I always thought

729
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,280
I could only keep these words to myself.

730
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,360
I never expected

731
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:07,479
that I’m able to tell you this one day.

732
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:09,280
It turns out

733
00:42:09,825 --> 00:42:11,265
you’ve been protecting me for so long.

734
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,181
Haishi.

735
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:14,840
When I first arrived in Dazheng,

736
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,439
I was totally alone and helpless.

737
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,080
You were the only one
willing to help me.

738
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:19,679
You protected me,

739
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:21,118
how can I not protect you?

740
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,879
I know it’s hard for you.

741
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:27,280
I know you won’t resign yourself
to your fate

742
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,921
and you will break free.

743
00:42:29,325 --> 00:42:30,885
I will help you and support you.

744
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:32,959
You can talk to me

745
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:34,239
when you have something on your mind.

746
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,280
Thank you.

747
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,919
Who is that?

748
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,266
It’s me, Lord.

749
00:43:26,275 --> 00:43:27,040
Come in.

750
00:43:37,425 --> 00:43:38,185
Lord.

751
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,280
You don’t look very well.

752
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,325
Are you sick?

753
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,719
I’ll get a physician here

754
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,639
to check on you.

755
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,639
It’s okay.

756
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,919
Is there any clue about
the poisoning in Yu’an Palace?

757
00:43:49,475 --> 00:43:51,520
I’ve sent people to look into it

758
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,959
and there is no clue.

759
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,760
I guess it should be done

760
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,479
by an acquaintance hiding in the palace.

761
00:43:56,975 --> 00:43:58,520
I targeted those who passed through

762
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,919
Yu’an Palace that day

763
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,431
and I’ve been
looking into them secretly.

764
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,120
It’s dangerous.

765
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:04,794
You must do your best.

766
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:06,280
Yes.

767
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,159
Lord.

768
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,391
There is one more thing
that is very strange.

769
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,280
On the day when His Majesty

770
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,840
made Fang Haishi Consort Chunrong,

771
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:14,919
later that night, 23 servants
in Lord Chang’s Mansion

772
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:16,479
died of having toadstool soup

773
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,650
accidentally.

774
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,919
Seems that Lord Chang
is also eradicating

775
00:44:22,919 --> 00:44:24,850
the spy planted in his mansion.

776
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,840
Keep a close eye on it.

777
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,034
When this is over,

778
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,399
there’s bound to be another storm.

779
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,380
Yes.

780
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,760
Lord.

781
00:44:36,959 --> 00:44:38,000
There is one more thing.

782
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,399
Go ahead.

783
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:41,879
The servant from Fengwu Palace

784
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,080
came to ask about Young Master...

785
00:44:45,775 --> 00:44:47,975
Ask about the eating habits
of Consort Chunrong.

786
00:44:48,525 --> 00:44:50,445
It’s said that she barely ate.

787
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:52,280
The meals prepared for her

788
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,600
were often sent back

789
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:54,815
untouched.

790
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,559
Make a list of her favorite foods,

791
00:44:59,225 --> 00:45:01,750
her preferences and habits

792
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,959
and send it over.

793
00:45:04,025 --> 00:45:04,679
Yes.

794
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:05,840
Lord.

795
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,229
I’ll leave then.

796
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:09,725
