(Princess’s Mansion)

26
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,399
Your Highness.

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,039
What?

28
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,039
This is the score

29
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,800
Mr. Fang Haishi found for you.

30
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,919
He asked me to give it to you.

31
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,679
He said

32
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,160
as long as you were told

33
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,559
the fingering of the score,

34
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:34,240
you would understand.

35
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,839
Where’s he?

36
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,039
He was on patrol this morning.

37
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,160
Now he’s in the east corridor.

38
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,000
Mr. Fang Haishi.

39
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

40
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,960
Thank you for getting the score for me.

41
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,600
It’s so considerate of you.

42
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,039
You still remember the fingering thing.

43
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,479
I came to say thank you.

44
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:57,800
It’s a small favor.

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,839
It’s not worth mentioning.

46
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,320
Don’t be modest.

47
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:02,440
I just came back to the capital
and I’m unfamiliar with everything.

48
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,279
Luckily, you and I are congenial.

49
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:05,479
Make yourself comfortable.

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

51
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:09,119
You’re indeed
Lord Qinghai’s brilliant disciple.

52
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:10,880
It’s the luck of our state

53
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,360
to have a dedicated general

54
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,679
like you.

55
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,559
You flatter me, Your Highness.

56
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,679
Since when

57
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,199
was he so close

58
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,700
to Mudan?

59
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,025
I’ll no longer disturb you.

60
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,479
If you need any help,

61
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,000
come to see me in my mansion.

62
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,650
See you, Your Highness.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,880
What do you think?

64
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,759
Of what, Your Majesty?

65
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:55,466
Does Mudan like Jianming

66
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,639
or Fang Haishi?

67
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,639
Your Majesty,

68
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:04,360
this is a difficult question for me.

69
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,279
I don’t dare

70
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,119
to gossip about Her Highness.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,199
When Jianming is taking his trial,

72
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,679
everybody else is avoiding him.

73
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,279
But Mudan pays special regard

74
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,160
to Jifeng Pavilion.

75
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,760
Interesting.

76
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,320
Youdu?

77
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,519
Haishi.

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,920
Why are you here?

79
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,040
His Majesty ordered
a batch of good horses

80
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,200
from Hanzhou.

81
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,679
In recent days, the horses

82
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:32,959
will be sent to Tianqi City.

83
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,239
His Majesty wants to test the horses

84
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,119
in Dongyu Horse Ranch.

85
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,559
My father and I are asked

86
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:38,320
to take care of that.

87
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,559
Today, I came

88
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,000
to discuss the matter.

89
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,600
I’ve never seen you
in the Palace before.

90
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,440
I even forgot

91
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,160
you were Marquis Wuxiang’s son

92
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,519
and you had an official rank.

93
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,239
Don’t say that.

94
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,040
I just got the title
for the sake of my family background.

95
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,760
Youdu, it’s so generous of you.

96
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,679
Men from noble families in the capital

97
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:56,760
hate it most

98
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,839
when people mention
their family backgrounds.

99
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,700
But look at you.

100
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,799
You keep talking about that.

101
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,839
That’s the truth, anyway.

102
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,799
Now that it’s the truth,

103
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:03,959
what’s the problem of talking about it?

104
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:06,160
For the sake of my family background,

105
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,799
I managed to stay away from the court,

106
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:09,480
travel around the states,
experience more

107
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,760
and do whatever I want.

108
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,640
I’m already so free.

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,640
I don’t care when I’m gossiped about.

110
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:16,920
By the way,

111
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,799
it’s been a while

112
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,239
since I met you at the West Market.

113
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:21,959
I haven’t asked you

114
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,000
whether you figured out

115
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,040
what you were after.

116
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,440
It’s a bit tricky.

117
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,920
This isn’t a good place for a talk.

118
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,920
Let’s go somewhere quiet.

119
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,480
All right.

120
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,239
You want to find old servants
who served Consort Nie?

121
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,350
Mm.

122
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:46,480
I’ll do it for you.

123
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,920
Why will you do that

124
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,160
even without asking me for a reason?

125
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,559
I don’t need a reason

126
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,480
when I want to help you.

127
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,839
Thank you.

128
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,920
Here we are.

129
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you sure

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,559
she’s Madam Liu
who served the Fifth Princess?

131
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,480
Yes.

132
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,920
Nobody else knows it, do they?

133
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:26,650
Don’t worry.

134
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:28,000
Get in there.

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,839
I’ll be waiting here for you.

136
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:29,700
Mm.

137
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:36,656
When I served Consort Nie,

138
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:39,314
the Fifth Princess was
less than twelve years old.

139
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,480
She was very beautiful

140
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,079
and the deceased emperor spoilt her.

141
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,279
She was lively

142
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,720
and loved to ride a horse.

143
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,519
The deceased emperor

144
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,239
didn’t want her to get hurt.

145
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,760
Then he always asked a guard

146
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,799
to lead her Woyun Horse

147
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,200
and not to let it go.

148
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,160
However, Her Highness

149
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,079
always wanted

150
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,200
to ride a horse

151
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,279
without restraint.

152
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,175
Once,

153
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,480
on the hunting ground of western suburb,

154
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,239
when her guards

155
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,519
weren’t noticing,

156
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,959
she got away from them

157
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,399
and rode forward,

158
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,440
waving her whip.

159
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,320
What happened later?

160
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,320
In the woods,

161
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,880
she fell off Woyun Horse

162
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:30,394
and was dragged by several steps.

163
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:33,040
The inner side of her left forearm

164
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,679
was scratched
by the stones on the ground

165
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,559
and there was a scar on it.

166
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:40,160
The deceased emperor was enraged.

167
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:42,040
He killed Woyun Horse

168
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,720
and flogged the guard who led the horse

169
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,200
a hundred times

170
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,825
and expelled him out of the Palace.

171
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,920
Maids like us
who waited upon Her Highness

172
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,480
were flogged 20 times each.

173
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,519
Many maids were expelled, too.

174
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,040
For the sake

175
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,200
that I was the wet nurse
of Her Highness,

176
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:05,760
I wasn’t expelled.

177
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,079
Since then,

178
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,959
the deceased emperor ordered that

179
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,400
Her Highness should never

180
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
enter the hunting ground again.

181
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,320
Thank you for what happened today.

182
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,160
Are you out of your queries?

183
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:31,625
Mm.

184
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:33,880
That’s good, then.

185
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,359
No more.

186
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,719
No more?

187
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,679
You know what?

188
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:44,919
I made the wine personally,

189
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,039
according to the formula

190
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,679
of Three Flower Spirits.

191
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,000
I put the wine here

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,850
to entertain honored guests.

193
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,679
There are only a few jars

194
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,950
and you emptied them all.

195
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:54,840
You made it?

196
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,400
I’ll enjoy it more, then.

197
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,840
Tastes great.

198
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,795
Do your families
really not restrain you?

199
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,559
Even if you’re dead drunk,

200
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,760
they won’t punish you?

201
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:07,960
Don’t worry.

202
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,320
The more I drink, the paler I’ll look.

203
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,440
The drunker I get,

204
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,479
the more serious I look.

205
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,840
Seriously?

206
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,039
Of course.

207
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,520
I’m always addicted to drinking.

208
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,080
When I was in the family school,

209
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,520
I used to sit in the last row.

210
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,719
When the teacher

211
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:22,440
taught us the classics,

212
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,890
I felt very bored.

213
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,280
Then I often drank.

214
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,640
I was usually dead drunk,

215
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,239
but the teacher never noticed that.

216
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:32,375
He even praised me for behaving properly

217
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:33,640
and being elegant.

218
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,320
Fine.

219
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,280
In this case,

220
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,760
I’ll propose more toasts to you.

221
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,200
Sure.

222
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,640
Master, you asked to see me?

223
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,000
You had a drink?

224
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,175
Yes.

225
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:03,119
Why do you think I asked to see you?

226
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,799
For Princess.

227
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,675
I’ll be punishing myself
in the silence room.

228
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,239
In addition

229
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:37,000
to riding a horse,

230
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,479
what else does Her Highness like to do?

231
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,520
Her Highness is young,

232
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,559
but she’s good at many things,

233
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,960
including incense making,
tea making, and arts.

234
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
However,

235
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,844
speaking of her favorite thing,

236
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:55,335
it must be the peony.

237
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,559
She not only loves it,

238
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,359
but is also crazy about it.

239
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,919
Crazy?

240
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,159
How much

241
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,960
does Her Highness like the peony

242
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,559
so that you think she’s crazy about it?

243
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,039
For example, when she has a meal,

244
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:11,440
takes a rest,

245
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,840
or even walks,

246
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,080
she has peonies around her.

247
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,479
She can’t leave them for even a second.

248
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,440
But,

249
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:22,960
peonies only bloom

250
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,640
in late spring and early summer.

251
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,479
In seasons without peonies,

252
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:27,440
what does she do?

253
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,440
There were greenhouses in the Palace.

254
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,479
Peonies bloom in two seasons a year.

255
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,880
In the other two seasons,

256
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,520
perfume was made of peonies.

257
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:50,960
Zhuoying.

258
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,039
Whoever is punished in the silence room

259
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
can’t eat or drink anything.

260
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,760
Come on.

261
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,119
You’re so stubborn.

262
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,359
No wonder Master punished you.

263
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,280
Luckily, you’re only punished
to copy the disciplines.

264
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,520
Tomorrow morning,

265
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,679
Master and I

266
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,280
will accompany His Majesty
to Dongyu Horse Ranch.

267
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,080
I’ll let you out before we leave.

268
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,159
Naughty kid,

269
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,280
behave yourself for a couple of days.

270
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,039
Zhuoying,

271
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,679
Master is going to the horse ranch too?

272
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:27,550
Yes.

273
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,200
I hear the Princess will go there, too.

274
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,560
It’s rumored in the Palace that

275
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:38,050
the Princess and Master
are getting very close lately.

276
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:40,875
I see.

277
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,640
I’ll leave you alone.

278
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,239
Habits and hobbies

279
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,440
may change.

280
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,159
But the scar on her forearm

281
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,479
will not.

282
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:04,100
Ouch.

283
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:06,719
Your Majesty?

284
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:07,919
Horses from Hanzhou have arrived.

285
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:13,080
I’ll test them
in Dongyu Horse Ranch today.

286
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,000
I planned to take you there.

287
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:18,425
But I think you’re still weak.

288
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,760
Wind blows strongly in the horse ranch.

289
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,599
So,

290
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:21,559
I would like you

291
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,960
to stay and rest in Yu’an Palace.

292
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:25,479
Yes.

293
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,440
Tilan,

294
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,719
have you visited Shuangping Lake lately?

295
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,840
I have.

296
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,200
It’s said when a Xieluo Flower

297
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,400
is dried and taken with wine,

298
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:47,176
it gives a dream.

299
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,080
I’ll ask the eunuch

300
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,359
to have it drowned in wine.

301
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,960
I hope all you have

302
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,119
will be sweet dreams.

303
00:15:57,719 --> 00:15:59,479
When you care so much for me,

304
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,775
I’ll certainly have sweet dreams only.

305
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,450
Lie down for a rest.

306
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,000
I’m going to the horse ranch.

307
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:12,700
Mm.

308
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,280
By the way,

309
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,975
when I pick the horses,

310
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,675
I’ll also pick one for you.

311
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,320
A docile

312
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,200
and middle-sized horse.

313
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,760
After you restore your health,

314
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,350
I’ll teach you to ride a horse.

315
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

316
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,239
Take a rest.

317
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,625
(A Quiet Life)

318
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,525
It’s you, Fang Zhuoying?

319
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,275
Keep your voice down.

320
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:27,479
Master hasn’t left yet.

321
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,520
You’ve been kneeling the whole night.

322
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,640
Go back to your room and rest.

323
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,314
Please do me a favor.

324
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:37,040
I want to go to Dongyu Horse Ranch.

325
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,880
Why do you want to go there?

326
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,400
Don’t you fear
Master will punish you again?

327
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,040
I have a reason for that.

328
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,160
Maybe today,

329
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,400
I’ll know the truth.

330
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,479
How about this?

331
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,520
Pretend you’re sick
and hide in your room.

332
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:51,245
I’ll take a shift for you.

333
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,479
Fang Zhuoying.

334
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,199
Master.

335
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,359
Why are you here?

336
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,350
Where’s Zhuoying?

337
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:23,839
He’s sick.

338
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,599
I’ll take his shift today.

339
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:34,175
Miss Ju,

340
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,239
are we going
to Princess’s Mansion today?

341
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:39,800
I hear Her Highness

342
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,119
may go to Dongyu Horse Ranch

343
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,800
with His Majesty.

344
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,850
Mm.

345
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:45,959
Her Highness isn’t good at
riding a horse.

346
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,959
I don’t think she’ll stay there
for a long time.

347
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:49,839
After we fumigate the new dress

348
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,199
and deliver it to her mansion,

349
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,760
she’ll just be coming back

350
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
from the horse ranch.

351
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,599
Yes.

352
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Madam Su,

353
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:01,119
sprinkle

354
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,575
some powder of peony perfume

355
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,254
on unremarkable parts.

356
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,359
Sprinkle?

357
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,300
Yes.

358
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:07,200
Do it.

359
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,640
But when Her Highness

360
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,119
touches the powder,

361
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,040
will she feel uncomfortable?

362
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,520
Don’t you remember?

363
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,800
Since Her Highness was little,
she’s been using this perfume.

364
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,479
Over so many years,

365
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,040
why would she feel uncomfortable?

366
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,239
Yes.

367
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:29,246
(Dazheng)

368
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,760
Good.

369
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,959
Horses from Hanzhou

370
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,640
are indeed robust.

371
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:42,705
Even if they have come to Tianqi City

372
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,760
far away across the sea,

373
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,575
they’re still strong.

374
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:51,199
Jichang.

375
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:53,585
- Jichang!
- Mm?

376
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,000
Mm?

377
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,760
What do you think of the horses?

378
00:20:02,475 --> 00:20:03,599
Big brother, you know

379
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,100
I never like to ride a horse

380
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,000
or fight a war.

381
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,119
Speaking of it,

382
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:10,079
I even know less than Mudan.

383
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,625
Look at you.

384
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,079
All you know

385
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,599
is to play at home.

386
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,000
That’s ridiculous.

387
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,119
I’ll often take you

388
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,000
to the horse ranch

389
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,880
so that you can be more experienced

390
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,400
and more energetic.

391
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:24,920
Yes.

392
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

393
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,760
Your Majesty,

394
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,359
the saddles are ready.

395
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,319
You can test the horses.

396
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:36,160
What a surprise!

397
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,209
A few days ago, you came to the Palace
on your father’s behalf.

398
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,400
Today, you came to test the horses.

399
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,760
What? You changed your temper?

400
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Don’t tease me, Your Majesty.

401
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,800
I’ve been interested in horses lately.

402
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,079
So, I came to have a look.

403
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:50,256
Princess Yanling has arrived.

404
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:51,885
Mudan has come.

405
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,880
Mudan!

406
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,520
She fell off the horse
when she was little.

407
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,800
But she wasn’t scared.

408
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,839
When she knew
someone would come today,

409
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,160
she insisted on coming, too.

410
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:23,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

411
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,205
You may rise.

412
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,389
Mudan, you look

413
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,119
quite energetic.

414
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,180
But I wonder whether you came

415
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,199
to appreciate the horses or a man.

416
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:46,959
Don’t make fun of me, big brother.

417
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,119
I certainly came

418
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,839
to appreciate the horses.

419
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,400
You always know

420
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,700
that my biggest wishes

421
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,439
are staying with peonies

422
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,425
and riding a horse.

423
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:00,125
Mm.

424
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,839
Mudan.

425
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,880
Mudan.

426
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,800
You’re just in time.

427
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,479
Big brother hasn’t started
to pick the horse yet.

428
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,479
Look.

429
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:07,975
I’ve reserved

430
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,400
a seat for you.

431
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,560
Come quickly.

432
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,280
Be seated. Be seated.

433
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,439
Your Highness.

434
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,079
Lord Qinghai.

435
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:23,945
Mudan,

436
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:25,880
here’s a lot of delicious food.

437
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,119
Enjoy it.

438
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,920
Seven,

439
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,079
you’re always nice to me.

440
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,520
But I won’t have any. Enjoy it yourself.

441
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,375
Mm.

442
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,359
Oh, I see.

443
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,560
Mudan,

444
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,199
you’re quite ambitious today.

445
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:40,119
But horses from Hanzhou are tameless.

446
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,550
You’re a girl.

447
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,599
You need someone

448
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,839
to protect you.

449
00:22:44,775 --> 00:22:46,150
How about...?

450
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,511
How about Lord Qinghai?

451
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,239
I hear

452
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:51,760
Lord Qinghai has great martial arts

453
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,800
and he’s famous for his horsemanship.

454
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,839
When he protects Mudan,

455
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:56,959
we don’t need to worry.

456
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,359
It’s a deal, then.

457
00:22:58,839 --> 00:22:59,500
Jianming,

458
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:00,959
I’ll have you protect Mudan.

459
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:01,700
Remember.

460
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,079
Never walk away from her.

461
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,079
Yes, Your Majesty.

462
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,239
Big brother, you’ve had

463
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:11,920
so many good horses
transferred from Hanzhou.

464
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,800
I’ll appreciate them,

465
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,119
pick the best one,

466
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,400
and take it back to my mansion.

467
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,160
I promised to bring you
to the horse ranch.

468
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,250
But I haven’t allowed you
to ride a horse.

469
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,900
If Father knows in heaven

470
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,900
that I allow you to ride a horse,

471
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,450
he’ll blame me.

472
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,525
Mm.

473
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,000
You made sense, big brother.

474
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:30,959
Mudan,

475
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,040
you fell off the horse that year.

476
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:34,439
Even when I think of that now,

477
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,199
I still feel scared.

478
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,079
During the national calamity,

479
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,560
I was forced to leave our state.

480
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,079
When I was running for my life,

481
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:42,520
I rode a horse

482
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,760
for three days and nights.

483
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,479
I’ve made progress in riding.

484
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,000
Or how did I manage to reach Nihualuo

485
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,800
simply by walking?

486
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,680
Mudan,

487
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:54,550
you suffered a lot.

488
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:55,839
Big brother,

489
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,359
if you want to compensate me,

490
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,000
please give me a good horse.

491
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,479
Approved.

492
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:05,880
Jianming,

493
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,160
go with Mudan

494
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,239
and pick the most docile horse for her.

495
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

496
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,359
Thank you, Your Majesty.

497
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,319
Lord,

498
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:21,839
thank you for that.

499
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,479
This way, please, Your Highness.

500
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,825
Has Fang Haishi

501
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:34,040
also come?

502
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,040
Yes.

503
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,199
He has come.

504
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:37,920
Now that he has come,

505
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,839
why is he only looking on,

506
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,599
instead of riding a horse?

507
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,319
When you settle on a horse,

508
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,520
let them get it out.

509
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,280
Greetings.

510
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,359
This horse is black

511
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:01,015
and robust.

512
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:02,880
It has perfect muscles,

513
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,439
but soft eyes.

514
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,119
I guess

515
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,520
it’s the most docile one.

516
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:11,640
You’re quite knowledgeable

517
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,599
and you know everything.

518
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,160
Other horses

519
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,479
are either tameless

520
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:18,199
or defective.

521
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:20,920
In my opinion,

522
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,400
this one is the best for you.

523
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,959
You don’t need to consider other horses.

524
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,640
I’ll take this one, then.

525
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:27,319
My lord,

526
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,439
would you like to test it with me?

527
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:32,680
It’s just been transferred
to Tianqi City.

528
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,160
It will take a few days

529
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,560
before we know its temper.

530
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,000
We’d better test it after that.

531
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,800
Then, in a few days,

532
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,599
will you test it with me?

533
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,119
I’m quite busy working.

534
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,239
Why don’t you ask Commander

535
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,199
to accompany you?

536
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,880
Why do you always

537
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,199
push me away?

538
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,719
You flatter me, Your Highness.

539
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,319
I’m just nobody.

540
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,640
But His Majesty ordered that

541
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,719
you should protect me today.

542
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:03,959
Right.

543
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:06,160
I won’t walk away from you.

544
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,479
This horse is black.

545
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,400
The brown saddle

546
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,319
doesn’t seem to match it.

547
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,400
My lord,

548
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,640
why not

549
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,000
pick another saddle for me?

550
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:28,000
Yes.

551
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,560
Haishi.

552
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,575
Mm?

553
00:26:47,175 --> 00:26:48,016
Which one do you like?

554
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,520
Any will do.

555
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,091
Life was hard in Huangquan Pass.

556
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,725
I used to ride

557
00:26:57,725 --> 00:26:59,119
inferior horses that pulled carts.

558
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,920
When I’m used to such horses,

559
00:27:01,275 --> 00:27:02,839
all the horses here

560
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,479
look spirited.

561
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:06,839
They all look spirited?

562
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,640
It means

563
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,199
you don’t like any of them.

564
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,680
Why do you think so?

565
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,719
Picking a horse

566
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
is like picking a man.

567
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:18,965
If it’s not the one you want,

568
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,520
you’ll know it

569
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:21,839
at the first sight.

570
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,680
Let’s go.

571
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,359
Now that you don’t like
any of the horses,

572
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,800
don’t force yourself.

573
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,839
Not only good horses

574
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,040
have been transferred from Hanzhou.

575
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:31,239
There’s also good wine.

576
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,959
How about enjoying the wine

577
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,119
until we get hammered?

578
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,875
I’ll go help her.

579
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:47,515
Mudan!

580
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,359
Go protect her!

581
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,479
Don’t panic.

582
00:27:58,075 --> 00:27:59,596
Lord Qinghai and some others are there.

583
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:09,850
Mudan is nearly

584
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,920
falling off the horse!

585
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,081
Sorry to offend you, Your Highness.

586
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,640
Haishi.

587
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:36,760
Are you all right?

588
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:39,680
I’m late, Your Highness.

589
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,119
Sorry to make you frightened.

590
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:41,880
Please forgive me.

591
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:42,959
It doesn’t matter.

592
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:44,920
Luckily, Mr. Fang Haishi saved me.

593
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,479
Are you hurt, Your Highness?

594
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:50,200
No.

595
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,079
Your Highness.

596
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,319
Are you hurt, Haishi?

597
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:07,079
I’m fine.

598
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:12,950
Hey…

599
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,569
Master,

600
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,760
you didn’t rush to help her

601
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,560
because you wanted me

602
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,000
to check her scar, right?

603
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:24,675
She’s indeed the princess.

604
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,920
I shouldn’t have suspected her.

605
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,239
Mudan.

606
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,450
Mudan.

607
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,119
Are you hurt, Mudan?

608
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:38,319
I’m fine.

609
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,119
Physician!

610
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:39,920
Come over!

611
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,119
- I don’t need a physician.
- Quickly.

612
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:41,880
I’m not hurt.

613
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,400
Jianming, what was wrong with you?

614
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,239
If Fang Haishi and Youdu

615
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,280
hadn’t saved Mudan in time,

616
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,119
she would have been badly wounded.

617
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,079
I neglected my duty

618
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:52,079
and made Her Highness frightened.

619
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:54,439
Big brother,

620
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:55,599
it was my bad.

621
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,079
I insisted on riding a horse.

622
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,900
Lord Qinghai failed

623
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,760
to stop me.

624
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:03,920
Are you all right?

625
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,040
I’m fine.

626
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,650
Would you like
to go back home for a rest?

627
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,400
Mudan,

628
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:11,280
I’m never good at
horse riding or archery.

629
00:30:11,775 --> 00:30:13,350
Shall I walk you back home

630
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,199
for a rest?

631
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:16,199
But big brother,

632
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,520
I haven’t found

633
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,675
the horse

634
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:19,880
that satisfies me.

635
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,750
You were frightened.

636
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,880
I’ll keep the horses for you.

637
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,439
Come and pick one some other day.

638
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,000
Jianming,

639
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,880
escort Mudan back home.

640
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,200
Don’t let anything go wrong again.

641
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

642
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,480
(Magnificent and Glittering)

643
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,439
My lord,

644
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,079
you went to the horse ranch
early this morning

645
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,880
and have to escort me back home now.

646
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:54,599
Do you feel tired?

647
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:57,040
It’s just my duty.

648
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:58,959
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

649
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:20,025
(Princess’s Mansion)

650
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:22,520
Greetings, Your Highness, my lord.

651
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,599
You may rise.

652
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,959
Miss Ju, what a surprise
to see you here!

653
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,325
Why are you standing at the gate?

654
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:30,600
Did my servants fail to recognize you

655
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,880
and neglect you?

656
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,400
Your Highness,

657
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,319
I just arrived.

658
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:37,050
I have brought you

659
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,160
the new dress.

660
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,160
If it’s a bad time,

661
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,079
I’ll come some other day.

662
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,160
Why?

663
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,479
You’re a rare visitor.

664
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,280
The informal dress you made...

665
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,560
I like it very much.

666
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:50,920
My lord,

667
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,475
why not come in

668
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,920
and have a cup of tea with Miss Ju

669
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,239
for my sake?

670
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:57,920
Yes, Your Highness.

671
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,560
This is the special tea

672
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,640
from Nihualuo.

673
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,920
I wonder if you two

674
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,080
will like its taste.

675
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,319
Before I drink it,

676
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,839
I can smell its aroma.

677
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:25,599
It’s the supreme white tea
from Nihualuo.

678
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,160
What nice tea!

679
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,880
It’s true to its name.

680
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:35,000
You’re indeed knowledgeable, my lord.

681
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:36,199
Enjoy it, please.

682
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Miss Ju,

683
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,550
I’m quite expecting

684
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,199
my new dress.

685
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:54,199
Yes.

686
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:23,375
I can smell it from afar.

687
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,040
It’s the peony perfume.

688
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:26,650
Get it to me.

689
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,280
I feel quite happy.

690
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:33,040
My lord, do you mind

691
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,119
if I check the dress now?

692
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:35,839
No, Your Highness.

693
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,319
It looks so beautiful.

694
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:49,045
And it has the fragrance of peony.

695
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:51,439
Miss Ju,

696
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,920
you can not only do great embroidery,

697
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,239
but are also considerate.

698
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,079
You know I like the peony

699
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,640
and you’ve fumigated the new dress

700
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,719
with the peony perfume.

701
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,560
I lack words to praise you.

702
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,479
Give her the award.

703
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,000
Big award.

704
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:06,125
I’m glad you like it, Your Highness.

705
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,761
What happened to Her Highness
was quite dangerous.

706
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,700
Censor Duan.

707
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:22,280
Censor Duan.

708
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:24,479
Greetings, Mr. Zhuoying and Mr. Haishi.

709
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,639
You’re on duty?

710
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:27,679
Exactly.

711
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:28,879
It’s getting dark.

712
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,199
You really work hard, Censor Duan.

713
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:30,919
What important thing do you have

714
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:31,879
to report to His Majesty?

715
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,520
Mrs. Guchen sued Lord Qinghai.

716
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,840
The case hasn’t proceeded.

717
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,080
I’m working hard on it.

718
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,800
Lord Qinghai quit his job

719
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,399
and he can live an idle life now.

720
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,100
But I can’t be

721
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,080
as lucky as him.

722
00:34:45,975 --> 00:34:46,600
Excuse me.

723
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,840
His Majesty is waiting for me.

724
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,040
I’ll leave you alone.

725
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:18,399
I didn’t expect Master

726
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:19,600
to be stuck in such a dilemma.

727
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:21,800
He didn’t allow me

728
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,040
to interfere with Mrs. Guchen’s case

729
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,360
because it was dangerous in the court.

730
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,679
He didn’t want more trouble

731
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,000
that might get me involved.

732
00:35:28,575 --> 00:35:30,450
Come on, Fang Haishi.

733
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:33,280
Since when were you
so arrogant and muddle-headed?

734
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:34,800
You failed to judge the whole story

735
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,280
and you ignored the overall situation.

736
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,159
You did so many things.

737
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:40,879
Were you trying to help Master

738
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,719
or will you bring trouble to him?

739
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,275
Did you also suspect the Princess

740
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,040
because you were selfish,

741
00:35:47,825 --> 00:35:48,479
discontent,

742
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:49,840
and jealous?

743
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:51,800
If that’s the reason,

744
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:53,719
you’re so mean.

745
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,879
Today, Youdu is here.

746
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
What kind of idiot proposed

747
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,000
to play the poem game?

748
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,399
Look.

749
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,309
We drank so much.

750
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,000
What about him?

751
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,560
He hasn’t drunk any.

752
00:36:06,775 --> 00:36:08,150
This is unacceptable.

753
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:09,879
For the sake

754
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:11,199
that we’re friends,

755
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,775
you must drink it, Youdu.

756
00:36:13,775 --> 00:36:15,000
That’s right. Come on.

757
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,320
Wanxia, fill his cup.

758
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,280
(Three Flower Spirits)
Don’t bother.

759
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,040
I’ll do it myself.

760
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,775
(Three Flower Spirits)

761
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:24,439
Youdu,

762
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,975
what’s wrong?

763
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,840
You used to be debonair

764
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,350
in the capital before.

765
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,399
Yeah.

766
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:33,520
Many girls had feelings for you.

767
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,439
They secretly gave you

768
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:36,919
at least two hundred love poems.

769
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,125
But recently,

770
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,000
why have you been so restrained?

771
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:40,975
Could it be that

772
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,375
you like someone?

773
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,150
Who’s she?

774
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,675
What a lucky girl!

775
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,875
Youdu, even if you like someone,

776
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,520
you don’t need to be so restrained.

777
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:51,879
She isn’t here, anyway.

778
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:53,080
What happens here

779
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,360
will be known to no one,

780
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,320
but only us.

781
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,360
Even if no one else knows it,

782
00:37:00,879 --> 00:37:02,360
I know it.

783
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:03,975
What?

784
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,140
Come on.

785
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,439
What’s wrong with him?

786
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:07,399
Why is he drinking alone?

787
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:08,199
- Yeah.
- What the heck!

788
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,080
Come on. Cheers.

789
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,919
- Yeah. Cheers.
- Come on.

790
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:12,840
Fill my cup.

791
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,159
- I want some more.
- Ignore him.

792
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:14,840
Come on.

793
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,719
All right.

794
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:20,560
Cheers.

795
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,159
Hey.

796
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,040
Where are you going?

797
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,800
Ignore him.

798
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:23,800
Come on. Cheers.

799
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,320
Come on.

800
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,125
Ignore him. Ignore him.

801
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,719
Let’s enjoy ourselves.

802
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,150
- Waiter.
- Yes.

803
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,840
Bill, please.

804
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,525
Coming!

805
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,159
Haishi,

806
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,360
why are you here?

807
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,320
Mr. Zhou,

808
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:38,040
long time no see.

809
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,560
But we just met in the day.

810
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:43,800
Nice to meet you.

811
00:37:44,425 --> 00:37:45,025
Hey.

812
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,059
What now?

813
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:48,679
His drinks are on me.

814
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:50,080
Go arrange a private room for us

815
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,080
and ask my attendant
to get Fang Zhuoying here.

816
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,600
All right, then.

817
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,200
Come on.

818
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:55,919
Come on.

819
00:37:58,959 --> 00:37:59,760
Be careful.

820
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,175
Come on.

821
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:02,879
Be seated.

822
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,431
Come on.

823
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,120
You should thank me.

824
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,399
I helped you twice today.

825
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,199
Master.

826
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
Master.

827
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,199
I’m not your master.

828
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,360
Who are you, then?

829
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I’m Zhou Youdu.

830
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,439
You for ambition

831
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,959
and Du for tolerance.

832
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,560
Nice to meet you.

833
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:37,120
Nice to meet you, too.

834
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:54,760
Why didn’t you drink

835
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,275
with the girls?

836
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:57,760
You saw that?

837
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:58,625
Mm.

838
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,679
I must restrain myself.

839
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,559
Restrain yourself?

840
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,475
So, when you’re drunk,

841
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,679
you keep nagging.

842
00:39:17,175 --> 00:39:18,615
Oh, I see.

843
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,320
You’re afraid of your wife.

844
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:27,159
Just like I’m afraid of my master.

845
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,350
I’m scared whenever he frowns.

846
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:31,919
I don’t want him to be unhappy.

847
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:36,295
I never want him to be unhappy.

848
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,439
I don’t have a wife.

849
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,639
But I have

850
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:42,639
a similar reason.

851
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,600
Haishi.

852
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:47,725
Mm?

853
00:39:47,725 --> 00:39:49,800
There’s a saying.

854
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,800
Mm?

855
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:53,025
Find your true love and never be apart.

856
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,125
Mm.

857
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,320
You must keep this

858
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,159
in your mind.

859
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,719
Fate is mysterious.

860
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,450
If you have the luck

861
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,439
to meet your true love,

862
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,800
you must cherish him

863
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,639
and strive for him

864
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,040
with heart and soul.

865
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,639
Otherwise, your life

866
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:12,639
will be wasted.

867
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,950
Mm.

868
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,550
(Huixian Restaurant)

869
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,755
I want more.

870
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,315
I want more.

871
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,340
More wine.

872
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,080
Zhuoying is on duty now.

873
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,360
- It’s already late.
- I want more wine.

874
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,280
Thank you for taking care of him.

875
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,100
I want more...

876
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:06,919
Waiter.

877
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,439
Waiter, get me some wine.

878
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,639
I’m running out of it.

879
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:18,239
I want some more.

880
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,459
Zhou Youdu.

881
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,400
Zhou Youdu.

882
00:41:28,325 --> 00:41:29,165
I’m not him.

883
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,520
You’re Zhou Youdu.

884
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,301
You are.

885
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,570
You for childish

886
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,325
and Du for tolerance.

887
00:41:41,275 --> 00:41:42,199
I’m not him.

888
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,159
You are.

889
00:41:44,475 --> 00:41:46,235
Write down your name.

890
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,120
Fang is my family name.

891
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,040
And Jianming is

892
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,925
my first name.

893
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:54,204
Fang Jianming?

894
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,959
I know him.

895
00:41:58,075 --> 00:41:59,350
He’s...

896
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,840
Who’s he?

897
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,919
He...

898
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,581
I used to like him.

899
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:16,954
I remember what you told me.

900
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,741
I’ll find my true love
and never be apart.

901
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:48,916
You’ll find your true love
and never be apart.

902
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:46,035
Your Majesty.

903
00:43:49,675 --> 00:43:51,075
Did I scare you?

904
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:54,200
No.

905
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,500
I’ve never been really scared

906
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,320
of you, Your Majesty.

907
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,560
Actually, I know

908
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,525
you’re very softhearted.

909
00:44:10,475 --> 00:44:12,050
On Shuangping Lake,

910
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:14,315
you prepared water lanterns in winter

911
00:44:15,025 --> 00:44:16,950
and Xieluo Flowers in summer

912
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,360
just to relieve me

913
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,575
from my homesickness.

914
00:44:22,675 --> 00:44:23,959
In order not to embarrass me

915
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:25,520
in front of my maternal state,

916
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:29,320
you gave many things

917
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,840
to Zhunian,

918
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,439
though you didn’t want that.

919
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:38,274
I’ve been very stubborn
since I was little.

920
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,375
I did something

921
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:44,450
that hurt you most,

922
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:48,040
but you still chose

923
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,675
to accept me.

924
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:04,855
From this day on,

925
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,360
I hope

926
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,999
I can be the one

927
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,525
who makes you feel warm.

928
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:37,015
Hai...

929
00:45:40,075 --> 00:45:41,275
You had a drink?

930
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,399
I just remember

931
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:48,900
I drank quite a lot

932
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,120
in Huixian Restaurant last night.

933
00:45:53,075 --> 00:45:54,639
