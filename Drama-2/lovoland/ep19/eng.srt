(Jingcheng Hall)

26
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,240
Lord Qinghai.

27
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,440
Greetings, Your Majesty.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,119
Su Ming fled.

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,679
So I’ve been told.

30
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,199
Qiqi

31
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,919
will be buried in Liushang.

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,639
You two

33
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,399
grew up together.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,039
As flawed as she was,

35
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,080
she deserves

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,479
a proper burial.

37
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:10,880
You’re all too kind, Your Majesty.

38
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,639
I’ve been

39
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,039
studying the map lately.

40
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,520
Sometimes, it keeps me awake

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,479
at late night.

42
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:26,440
Jianming,

43
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:27,839
the past

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,839
is coming back to me.

45
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,080
I remember that you begged me

46
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,119
to at least let Su Ming go.

47
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,080
I thought a smart man like him

48
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,440
would choose wisely this time

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,759
and stay on the right track

50
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,080
for his own sake.

51
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:44,919
But

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,320
after all these years,

53
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,600
he went down that road eventually

54
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,240
out of personal grudges.

55
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:58,520
This world

56
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,279
and this court

57
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,039
make me sick.

58
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,320
If I had known

59
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,559
I would’ve been knee-deep in the mud,

60
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,080
no way would I have

61
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,479
sat on that chair.

62
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,200
Your Majesty,

63
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,119
I follow my conscience.

64
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,119
That’s all that matters.

65
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,600
Now that Su Ming

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,959
has become one of the traitors,

67
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,359
it’s my job

68
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,440
to track down all of them.

69
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,640
No one

70
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,480
can get away with it.

71
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:33,760
Good.

72
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,399
I expect you

73
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,000
to seize all his followers.

74
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,959
It’s time to

75
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,079
clean the house

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,399
like the good old days.

77
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,679
Yes, like the good old days.

78
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,640
Lord,

79
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,600
we’ve checked in and out of the palace

80
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,600
but found nothing.

81
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,160
What about Su Ming’s mansion?

82
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,839
I rushed over there

83
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:10,959
right after the bloodbath

84
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,000
at Fabric Office that night

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,240
(General for Stability’s Mansion)

86
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,440
only to find

87
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,640
his steward dead of suicide.

88
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,160
The entire place had been cleaned.

89
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,720
There was no trace of evidence

90
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,160
or anything worth exploring.

91
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:35,519
And the palace?

92
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,040
There was even less we could find.

93
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,359
The three eunuchs drowned in the well

94
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,679
had nothing unusual.

95
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:43,160
They were disciplined

96
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,160
and reliable

97
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,279
with a spotless record.

98
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,200
And they had no contacts

99
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,519
from the inside or the outside.

100
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,119
Lord,

101
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,799
Su Ming is discreet.

102
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,279
He must’ve been planning this for years.

103
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,359
It’s his desperate move.

104
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,000
We spooked him

105
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,279
and he had to escape to Hanzhou.

106
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,160
Right now, all his eyes and ears

107
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,559
are underwater.

108
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,359
We won’t be able to fish them out

109
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,559
until they resurface.

110
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,200
Pass my order.

111
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,239
Stick to the routine
and protect His Majesty.

112
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,119
Be sure to stay on high alert.

113
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,559
Yes.

114
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,640
Oh, and, Lord,

115
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,239
there’s one more thing.

116
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,359
It’s Young Master Zhuoying...

117
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,000
Master,

118
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,679
I failed

119
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,720
to neutralize Su Ming out there.

120
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,359
I’m glad that you followed

121
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:01,839
our protocol.

122
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,519
I should’ve slaughtered him.

123
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,839
We’ll get rid of him sooner or later.

124
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,760
But now, our priority is Tianqi

125
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,519
and everyone inside.

126
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,279
I understand.

127
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,320
For what it’s worth,

128
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,839
I’m the one to blame.

129
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,119
Master,

130
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,040
I’ll bounce back quickly.

131
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,519
How’s Haishi doing?

132
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,000
When will he be back?

133
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,160
He’s still needed there

134
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,679
but he has

135
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,600
recovered.

136
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,480
I wish we could reunite soon.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,239
Then the three of us

138
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,600
could drink under that Jifeng Tree.

139
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:09,880
(Lanzi)

140
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,839
This is it.

141
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,760
Mr. Fang,

142
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:13,799
do come back

143
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,440
and visit us whenever you can.

144
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:17,799
Again, thank you

145
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,320
for saving my life.

146
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,920
I’ll show up at your door again

147
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,799
one day.

148
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,799
Take care, everyone.

149
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,359
We will.

150
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:28,200
I’ve kept in mind

151
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,000
the offense and defense strategies

152
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,480
Lord Qinghai designed for our city.

153
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,920
If I have more questions,

154
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,599
I’ll send you messages.

155
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,200
Sure.

156
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,440
Mr. Fang,

157
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,400
whatever happens in the future,

158
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,359
the Jiamanese

159
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,119
will always have your back.

160
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,520
Heaven and gods

161
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,359
will bless the Jiamanese

162
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,479
with peace and happiness.

163
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,960
(Lanzi)
Gods bless everyone.

164
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:56,119
So long.

165
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,000
- Greetings, Lord Qinghai.
- Greetings, Lord Qinghai.

166
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,239
Rise, Miss Zheliu.

167
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,080
I came to bid Manager Ju farewell.

168
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:56,840
Death shall be the end.

169
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,400
Let bygones be bygones.

170
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,119
May you rest in peace back home.

171
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,760
Rise.

172
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,599
Thank you, Lord.

173
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:30,880
No need.

174
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,320
You’re left alone

175
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:37,840
at Fabric Office.

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,080
As Manager Ju’s distant niece,

177
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,479
if you wish to go back with her,

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,080
I can arrange that

179
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:47,239
and find you a proper place to stay.

180
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,719
That way,

181
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,479
you can lead a peaceful

182
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,960
and worry-free life.

183
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,880
That’s very generous of you

184
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,239
but I’d rather stay here

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,880
and carry on
Manager’s unfinished business.

186
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:04,679
That won’t be easy.

187
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,880
Do you understand

188
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,159
what she was responsible for?

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,640
Yes.

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,359
She had taught me everything.

191
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,119
I’ve already

192
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,479
taken over what she left.

193
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,520
The Ju Family has been serving

194
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,320
under the Fangs for generations.

195
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,280
They share joys and sorrows,

196
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:27,679
thick and thin.

197
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,760
I’d like to be her successor

198
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,919
at your disposal

199
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,880
to serve you

200
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,359
and the nation.

201
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,919
If that’s what you want,

202
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,760
then stay.

203
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,640
Rebuild

204
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,679
Fabric Office first

205
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,599
and then we’ll see.

206
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:52,280
Yes.

207
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,520
Take good care of her.

208
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:56,679
Yes.

209
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:15,360
(Fabric Office)

210
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,359
Physician,

211
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,559
is Miss Zheliu

212
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,200
getting any better?

213
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,599
The poison had done her too much damage.

214
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,200
The treatment

215
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,840
saved her life

216
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,599
but not her eyes...

217
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,960
She’s too young to suffer this.

218
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,679
Miss Zheliu

219
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,719
is Manager Ju’s only successor

220
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,960
and the sole surviving member
of Fabric Office.

221
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,119
Please

222
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:45,919
do everything you can

223
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,960
to cure her.

224
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,080
If you need anything,

225
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,320
just let me know.

226
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,719
Jifeng Pavilion

227
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,039
will give it our all.

228
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,239
Yes, Lord Qinghai.

229
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,559
Lord Qinghai,

230
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:19,880
what did you do

231
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,159
to yourself?

232
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,679
Your wound is festering

233
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,159
instead of healing.

234
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
You didn’t have enough rest,

235
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,359
did you?

236
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,880
It’s merely a flesh wound.

237
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:31,479
I’m fine.

238
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:32,919
You can’t always

239
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,799
put your health behind.

240
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,599
Your pulse is weak,

241
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,599
indicating overuse of energy.

242
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,520
At this rate,

243
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:42,159
it could prove fatal.

244
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,840
You’re tough enough

245
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,840
to endure all kinds of pain,

246
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,719
but this time is serious.

247
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,039
Enough bed rest is needed

248
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:53,080
to heal your cut completely.

249
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,840
And stop using your energy for a while.

250
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,400
No overtime

251
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,000
or more wounds.

252
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,320
I know you’re a busy man

253
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,440
but you can’t

254
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:03,840
burn yourself out.

255
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,159
Otherwise,

256
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,719
even gods couldn’t help you.

257
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,239
Please take my advice!

258
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:16,880
Inspector of Baiyi Bay

259
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,320
handed in another report

260
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,840
to cancel Maritime Trade Office,

261
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,080
saying that

262
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:24,159
members of all foreign ships

263
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,280
dock at Baiyi Bay

264
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,880
shall be registered

265
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,119
and sent to the capital

266
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,479
or Chen Heran.

267
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:32,159
Utter nonsense!

268
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,440
How dare he brazenly propose

269
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,159
sloth in administration!

270
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,919
What’s your reply?

271
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,760
Two words, “Utter nonsense!”

272
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,880
That’s short and rude.

273
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,880
You’ve only begun

274
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,159
to learn my handwriting.

275
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,640
You can intimate it well

276
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,919
in words

277
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:57,359
but not in sentences.

278
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,440
(Utter nonsense!)

279
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,919
Take a break.

280
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,159
You can organize them tomorrow.

281
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:21,640
Consort Shurong might need them then.

282
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,359
She’s been with His Majesty

283
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,760
every day at Jincheng Palace.

284
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,719
I doubt she has time

285
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,679
for those shreds of fur.

286
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:28,919
Speaking of which,

287
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,039
she sews

288
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,679
and tears them apart over and over.

289
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,719
Why?

290
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,799
Winter is long.

291
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,799
She’s probably bored

292
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,039
and doing that to kill time.

293
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,640
That makes sense.

294
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,080
It’s freezing in Tianqi

295
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,520
to go anywhere

296
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,960
while Zhunian

297
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,719
is still warm at this time of the year.

298
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,799
They’ll be celebrating
the Moon Festival tomorrow

299
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,719
by floating water lamps and praying.

300
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,640
The streets will be packed!

301
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,719
Yet we can only be stuck indoors.

302
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,200
Be realistic, will you?

303
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,280
Water lamps are prohibited

304
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,880
in the palace by His Majesty.

305
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,159
Even if they weren’t,

306
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,679
the lake is already frozen.

307
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,280
Where could we float them?

308
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,680
I wonder

309
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,959
how Her Highness is doing.

310
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,199
Why did you stop?

311
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,680
I’m still awake

312
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,680
while you’ve dozed off.

313
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:44,119
Your Majesty...

314
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,880
Consort Shurong is asleep.

315
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,239
Take her back

316
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,479
in a warm sedan.

317
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,319
Yes.

318
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,280
(Yu’an Palace)

319
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,959
Are you awake, Your Highness?

320
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,839
We’ve arrived at Yu’an Palace.

321
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,199
How come I’m back?

322
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,479
You were tired and fell asleep earlier,

323
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,479
so His Majesty asked me

324
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,079
to take you back.

325
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:37,880
Thank you, Eunuch Mu.

326
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:47,640
(Yu’an Palace)

327
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,520
Your Highness, your face is...

328
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,280
What about it?

329
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:00,920
What’s wrong?

330
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,439
Nothing. It’s fine.

331
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,400
You’ve been given a reward.

332
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,680
His Majesty hasn’t been

333
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,599
in such a good mood for a while.

334
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,920
When a man and a woman

335
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,160
were together at night,

336
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,880
you’d expect something romantic.

337
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,599
Yet here you are

338
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,119
back with a painted face.

339
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:36,079
How could His Majesty do this?

340
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,079
Go easy, Your Highness,

341
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,760
in case the paint stays forever.

342
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,280
It can’t be wiped off!

343
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,320
(Huangquan Battalion)

344
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,680
Mr. Fang. Mr. Zhang.

345
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,680
Mr. Fu.

346
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:06,760
You’re going fast.

347
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,800
I trust that you’ve fully recovered.

348
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,599
I meant to check on you

349
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,199
when I was in Lanzi

350
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,160
but got refused by Lord Qinghai.

351
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,359
I appreciate your concern, Mr. Fu.

352
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,560
Get some rest.

353
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,079
General Tang has been waiting for you

354
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:21,000
in his camp

355
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:22,640
this whole time.

356
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,040
- General Tang.
- General Tang.

357
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:31,959
Alright. Be seated.

358
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,079
You had a long journey back

359
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,000
shortly after Mr. Fang got wounded.

360
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:40,599
You should’ve rested first.

361
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
I’ve almost recovered.

362
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,280
Thanks for your concern.

363
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,119
I should apologize

364
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,199
for my extended stay in Lanzi

365
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
and belated return.

366
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:50,319
That’s fine.

367
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,880
Mr. Fang, you guarded Huangquan Pass,

368
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,000
helped the Jiamanese

369
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,280
get back their city

370
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,119
and crushed the Right Tribe of Huku

371
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,400
with Lord Qinghai.

372
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,199
That’s a rare and huge success
of the year.

373
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:01,520
I’m writing to His Majesty

374
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:02,959
to honor you for your achievements.

375
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,479
That’s the result of efforts

376
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,239
of Huangquan Battalion

377
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,800
and the Jiamanese.

378
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:09,439
I couldn’t have done it alone.

379
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,719
Of course.

380
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,760
Mr. Zhang worked undercover

381
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,880
as a captive,

382
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,000
which is admirable, too,

383
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:17,359
and will be in the record of merits.

384
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,920
Thank you, sir.

385
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:21,920
General,

386
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:23,920
Tribes of Huku have been beaten back

387
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,680
but we still can’t

388
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,839
lower our guard.

389
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,520
Is there anything

390
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:30,040
you need us to do?

391
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,319
It’s too cold

392
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
to battle in winter.

393
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,920
The Tribes are gone

394
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,560
and the Jiamanese are our friends.

395
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,839
We’re practically calling a truce

396
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,920
which gives you enough time to rest

397
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:43,839
to be back on your feet again.

398
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:44,839
When spring comes,

399
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,880
we’ll make plans

400
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:46,959
based on Huku’s moves.

401
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:48,040
Agreed.

402
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,119
I’ll use this window for rest

403
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:50,920
and training

404
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,000
while waiting

405
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:53,760
for your orders.

406
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,560
Tribes of Huku

407
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,599
are too damaged

408
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,640
to make a comeback in years.

409
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,640
As long as the border is secure,

410
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,599
national security can be guaranteed.

411
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,680
That’s true.

412
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,800
Soldiers aren’t born to battle

413
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:05,640
but they have to for the safety

414
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,680
of the people behind them.

415
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:07,880
Mr. Fang,

416
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,719
let’s lay back for now

417
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,800
to get ready to serve the nation later.

418
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:25,440

for each of you

457
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,479
in our palace

458
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,599
and

459
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,800
put together a warm bed for Xiaoguai

460
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,680
to go through winter with us.

461
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,959
Don’t burden your eyes too much.

462
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:12,199
Don’t worry.

463
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:13,479
I’ll be fine.

464
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,079
Have some ginseng soup, Your Highness.

465
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,520
Put it there.

466
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,680
I’ll have it later.

467
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,800
By the way,

468
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,839
I had a little chat

469
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,719
with some young maids

470
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,839
on my way.

471
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:31,560
You know what?

472
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,560
They saw something unusual

473
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,319
earlier today.

474
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,959
What could it be?

475
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:36,839
Water lamps are banned

476
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,880
by His Majesty, right?

477
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:40,359
The lake here freezes

478
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,880
in winter.

479
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,760
We couldn’t use it for water lamps
even if they were allowed.

480
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,319
That’s the strangest part.

481
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,839
Those maids said the ice had melted.

482
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,119
The lake is covered with water lamps.

483
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,599
Isn’t that strange?

484
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:52,199
Did someone put them in the lake?

485
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,479
No ice

486
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,520
but water lamps in the water?

487
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,040
I don’t believe that.

488
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,760
Even if God of Lake did the magic,

489
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,359
would Dazheng

490
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,560
also be celebrating

491
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,640
our Moon Festival?

492
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:03,239
Bihong,

493
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,880
be careful with what you say.

494
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:07,040
There’s no such thing as magic.

495
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,520
Stop saying that.

496
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:10,199
Who could’ve melted a lake of ice

497
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,560
other than a god?

498
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,119
Could you

499
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,160
take us there to have a look?

500
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,359
If there are water lamps,

501
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,439
it’d be nice to celebrate

502
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,959
the Moon Festival away from home.

503
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,760
It’s dark

504
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,760
and chilly outside.

505
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:28,040
Please!

506
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,119
Let’s go.

507
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:39,640
It’s right ahead of us.

508
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,119
Watch your step, Your Highness.

509
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:40,199
It is indeed

510
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,560
a winter miracle!

511
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,880
Thank you, Dragon Tail.

512
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,119
Here’s above your Dragon Tail’s reach.

513
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,920
- Good evening, Your Majesty.
- Watch your step, Your Majesty.

514
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:54,560
Rise.

515
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,760
How’s the celebration
of the Moon Festival here

516
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,359
compared with that in Zhunian?

517
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,040
Your Highness,

518
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:10,079
we don’t believe in Dragon Tail

519
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:12,359
in Dazheng,

520
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:14,359
but another True God

521
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,479
is here

522
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,599
right in front of you.

523
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,839
Thank you so much, Your Majesty,

524
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:29,280
for easing my homesickness.

525
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,520
Your Majesty,

526
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,880
it’s too cold outside.

527
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,199
You’d better go back.

528
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,400
So should you.

529
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,839
Don’t catch a cold.

530
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

531
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:55,560
His Majesty is going back.

532
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:18,119
Your Majesty,

533
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,280
Consort Shurong has arrived.

534
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,160
Send her in.

535
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,439
Mu Deqing.

536
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,479
Yes, Your Majesty.

537
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,640
Since when

538
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,760
did you get to decide for me?

539
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,079
Your Majesty,

540
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,119
the wind outside

541
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,920
is too strong for Consort Shurong.

542
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,239
I knew you wouldn’t mind.

543
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,319
Greetings, Your Majesty.

544
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,479
I heard you caught a cold

545
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:10,560
and made congee for you.

546
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,839
Having something warm

547
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,680
will make you feel a lot better.

548
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,160
Please enjoy it while it’s hot.

549
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,119
Only one set of tableware?

550
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,599
What about you?

551
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,400
I dare not eat with you

552
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,000
without your permission.

553
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,439
I don’t like eating alone.

554
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,160
Have them bring in another set.

555
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:51,560
Are you always this quiet

556
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,160
at meal?

557
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,319
No speaking when eating and sleeping.

558
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,800
You and your sister

559
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:01,599
look alike but act differently.

560
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:06,280
Zizan was a role model

561
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:08,199
back in Zhunian.

562
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,520
I’m not as good

563
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,239
and I’ll work harder

564
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:14,359
to improve myself.

565
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:20,280
Zizan and I always ate together

566
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:23,000
and she finished last

567
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,319
because she kept talking.

568
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,839
She was a picky eater, too.

569
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,359
She wouldn’t touch food

570
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,319
she didn’t like

571
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,479
and lived on snacks all day.

572
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:34,560
She was sort of a bully,

573
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,560
and petty as well.

574
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,000
When Jianming was young,

575
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,000
he loved the sweet soup

576
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,520
made by the chef back in my mansion.

577
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,839
We invited Zhunian’s envoy
to dinner one day.

578
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:46,199
Jianming peeked at him

579
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
from afar

580
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:48,680
and mumbled to himself.

581
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,319
He said,

582
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,880
“How come Zhunian’s envoy

583
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,400
is as fussy about food

584
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:53,760
as Zizan?”

585
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,160
Zizan overheard that

586
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,199
and since then,

587
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,520
Jianming didn’t see sweet soup

588
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:03,479
for over six months.

589
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,640
Eat.

590
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,359
You don’t

591
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,800
need to be perfect

592
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:19,439
to be likable.

593
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,760
Don’t listen to

594
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,680
what others say.

595
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,359
Yes.

596
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,160
You made delicious congee

597
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,280
and side dishes.

598
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,719
I know you can cook.

599
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,920
Just loosen up.

600
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,040
From now on,

601
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,479
you can be here anytime without asking.

602
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,160
Your Majesty...

603
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,680
Eating alone is sad.

604
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,880
I could use more of your company.

605
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,359
Eat up.

606
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,520
Your pulse is getting stronger.

607
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,120
I’m glad

608
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,719
that you’ve been resting well.

609
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,679
Lord,

610
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,760
news came from Huangquan Battalion.

611
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,040
Take care, Lord.

612
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,399
I’ll be off.

613
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,679
Lord,

614
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:44,840
Fang Haishi has made a full recovery.

615
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,560
He’s doing perfectly well

616
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,760
and training the troops all day.

617
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:50,320
You can stop worrying.

618
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:56,000
Mr. Fang.

619
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,719
Mr. Zhang.

620
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,199
I knew you’d be here.

621
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,320
Your dedication and persistence

622
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,439
are second to none.

623
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:07,919
I’m not that good, Mr. Zhang.

624
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,159
Anyway, what’s up?

625
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:10,040
Good news!

626
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,800
His Majesty has granted
General Tang’s request

627
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:14,000
that we’re ordered to go back to Tianqi

628
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,399
to report on our work before spring.

629
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,239
We can return to the capital?

630
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:20,719
That’s wonderful!

631
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:21,679
Indeed.

632
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,280
You’ve been away from home for so long.

633
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,199
It’s time to go back.

634
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,879
Master,

635
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:38,479
Haishi and members of
Huangquan Battalion

636
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,760
are on their way back to the capital.

637
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:41,000
They’ll arrive soon.

638
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,439
Master,

639
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,360
Haishi has finally returned.

640
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:47,560
Is he going to

641
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,919
stay in Zhaoming Palace this time?

642
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:49,919
Of course.

643
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,280
Got it.

644
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,959
I’ll prepare everything for him.

645
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,919
Your Highness,

646
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,120
Zhunian’s envoy

647
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,080
has arrived in the capital

648
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:20,239
who will greet His Majesty
tomorrow in court.

649
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,679
He’s here already?

650
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,600
Yes.

651
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:25,439
Zhunian is suffering from floods.

652
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,679
Homeless people are everywhere.

653
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,080
So they sent an envoy over

654
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,239
in haste

655
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:33,320
to ask His Majesty for aid.

656
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:34,439
Your Highness,

657
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,760
you were sent to live there for years.

658
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,320
Are you going to treat the envoy

659
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,520
to dinner as the host?

660
00:36:40,919 --> 00:36:42,800
As a prince of Dazheng,

661
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,879
I can’t be too close
to a foreign official.

662
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,360
Report to His Majesty

663
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:49,879
that...

664
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:52,080
that I’m too sick

665
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,639
to be in court tomorrow.

666
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,040
Yes.

667
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:03,879
For an eagle to fly high,

668
00:37:04,399 --> 00:37:05,239
it has to have strong wings

669
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,760
and sharp claws.

670
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,040
You...

671
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You still have a long way to go.

672
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:11,520
One step at a time.

673
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,520
Your Majesty,

674
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,120
the storm has left Quanming Port.

675
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,159
Mr. Lu is on his way there

676
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,439
to help release

677
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,879
grains in reserve.

678
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,399
Stability has been gradually restored.

679
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:30,080
Overall, the situation is promising.

680
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,439
Your Majesty,

681
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,479
Huangquan Battalion’s application
for rewards has arrived.

682
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,120
Please review it.

683
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,000
Your Majesty,

684
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,600
Zhunian’s envoy

685
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,399
has arrived in the capital,

686
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,800
waiting outside to be summoned.

687
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:56,600
Send him in.

688
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,000
Yes.

689
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:04,639
Send in Zhunian’s envoy!

690
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,120
Zhunian’s envoy, Puyouma,

691
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:32,719
pays respects to the Emperor of Dazheng.

692
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,120
Rise.

693
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,360
Have you traveled

694
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:42,080
half the world

695
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:44,840
to visit Consort Shurong?

696
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,879
Your Majesty,

697
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:49,639
Princess Tilan

698
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,360
has been here for a while.

699
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,479
Her father heard

700
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,639
you treat her

701
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,080
very well

702
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,800
and sent me to thank you on his behalf.

703
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:05,800
You always know too well

704
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:09,320
about my privacy, don’t you?

705
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,320
Granted.

706
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

707
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:18,439
And

708
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,520
there’s one more thing

709
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:20,919
that I’m here for,

710
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,959
Your Majesty.

711
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:25,560
We’re experiencing
severe natural disasters.

712
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:27,760
We hope

713
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,959
you can help us, Your Majesty.

714
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,479
Disasters again?

715
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,479
Hurricanes

716
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,239
and rain are nonstop this year.

717
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,479
Countless houses have been destroyed.

718
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,840
The homeless are flooding
into our capital

719
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,159
with nowhere else to go.

720
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:45,560
People are dying of hunger
here and there.

721
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,120
It’s the second time

722
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:50,159
this year

723
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:51,199
that you’ve reported floods.

724
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,919
Your Majesty,

725
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:57,080
Zhunian and Dazheng are in-laws.

726
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,760
I beg you

727
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,479
to supply us with aid.

728
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:21,959
Your Majesty,

729
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,280
Zhunian’s envoy must be tired

730
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,479
after such a long trip.

731
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,280
I’ve prepared

732
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,679
food and bed for him.

733
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:33,239
I’ll take good care of our guest

734
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:34,919
on your behalf.

735
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:35,959
Granted.

736
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,879
Your Majesty...

737
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,360
Your Majesty...

738
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
Your Excellency,

739
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,120
this way, please.

740
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,840
Please.

741
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,800
Zhunian’s report of disasters
never ends.

742
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,919
That small tribe

743
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,399
keeps asking us

744
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,919
for more and more,

745
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,120
enough to cover

746
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,280
twice their population.

747
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:14,560
Jianming,

748
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,080
what do you think they’re up to?

749
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,199
I assume you’ve already

750
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:18,959
had the answer, right, Your Majesty?

751
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,399
You’re tossing it back to me.

752
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,600
It’s a state affair

753
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:27,439
but also your private business.

754
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:28,959
I shouldn’t interfere.

755
00:41:36,399 --> 00:41:38,000
When Zizan was alive,

756
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:39,840
they pulled the same stunt.

757
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,879
She kept telling me

758
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,280
not to ask Father for help

759
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,239
for Zhunian.

760
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:49,919
Ironically,

761
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,280
back then,

762
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:54,000
even though I knew

763
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:55,399
they were greedy,

764
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,679
I thought I could bear with them.

765
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:01,199
Now that she’s left,

766
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:03,439
all that

767
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,560
is just unbearable.

768
00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:09,120
Never mind.

769
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,879
Forget that.

770
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,600
Let’s talk about Su Ming’s case.

771
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:14,879
Where are we

772
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,159
on arresting his remnants?

773
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,040
They’re too deep underground

774
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,239
to be removed soon.

775
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,840
Let’s eat.

776
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:33,439
We can have this big meal

777
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:35,239
all to ourselves.

778
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:36,639
Isn’t that great?

779
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,239
His Majesty is probably occupied.

780
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,399
That’s fine.

781
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,320
Let’s eat without him.

782
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,239
We should enjoy ourselves

783
00:42:52,399 --> 00:42:54,239
for waiting so long.

784
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,199
Your Highness,

785
00:43:03,399 --> 00:43:04,800
Zhunian’s envoy has arrived.

786
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,639
His Majesty said

787
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:07,919
you could meet him at the side chamber.

788
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,719
Greetings, Princess Tilan.

789
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:25,600
Rise, Uncle.

790
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:27,639
Thank you.

791
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,600
Take a seat.

792
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,520
Uncle,

793
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:40,399
how’s my father?

794
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,800
This year’s monsoon season is too long

795
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,560
together with hurricanes.

796
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,439
Our capital has been flooded.

797
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,399
Tons of people are dead without food.

798
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,719
Your father is working day and night

799
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,560
which is taking a toll on his body.

800
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:01,959
Earlier today,

801
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,760
I begged the Emperor of Dazheng

802
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:05,800
in court to help us

803
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,520
but he

804
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:11,800
didn’t give me an answer.

805
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,879
We had similar situations

806
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:16,000
years back

807
00:44:16,879 --> 00:44:18,040
when the Emperor

808
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:19,600
was still Prince Xu

809
00:44:19,919 --> 00:44:21,239
and he asked his father to give us aid.

810
00:44:21,879 --> 00:44:24,479
It was Princess Zizan

811
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:27,320
who talked him into that.

812
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,840
We’re facing a national crisis now.

813
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,239
Please convince the Emperor

814
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,199
to lift us out of it.

815
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,600
Uncle,

816
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,719
I don’t deserve such courtesy.

817
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:53,560
What happened?

818
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,439
Your Majesty,

819
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,679
Zhunian’s envoy

820
00:44:58,959 --> 00:45:01,399
greeted Consort Shurong
at the side chamber.

821
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:02,639
They were catching up with each other

822
00:45:02,879 --> 00:45:05,159
before he left

823
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,479
15 minutes ago.

824
00:45:07,399 --> 00:45:08,560
Then

825
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,800
Consort Shurong

826
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:13,879
appeared to have cried.

827
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,879
How shameless

828
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,840
that they’re using

829
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,560
another girl as their pawn!

830
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,080
Consort Shurong was born
and raised in Zhunian

831
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,320
but she’s not their slave.

832
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,280
Your Majesty,

833
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:29,159
it’s time for dinner.

834
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,560
Not hungry!

835
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,600
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

836
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,840
Is His Majesty still at Jingcheng Hall?

837
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:56,159
He’s been in there

838
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,879
since he had lunch at Jincheng Palace

839
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,719
after the morning court

840
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,159
without seeing anyone.

841
00:46:01,479 --> 00:46:03,320
He even skipped dinner.

842
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,360
What should we do?

843
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,919
Your Highness,

844
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,479
you can go there to see him.

845
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,239
Empress Zizan set the precedent

846
00:46:13,439 --> 00:46:13,919
for this matter.

847
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:14,719
It’s easier for you

848
00:46:14,879 --> 00:46:16,439
to bring it up again.

849
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,959
Right now,

850
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,360
I’m the last person

851
00:46:23,959 --> 00:46:24,800
His Majesty wants to see.

852
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,000
You’re wrong!

853
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:29,840
His Majesty has been
quite nice to you recently.

854
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,879
He’s less a talker

855
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:33,199
than a doer.

856
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,840
All the more reason

857
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,800
to not bother him.

858
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,840
With all due respect,

859
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,239
Mr. Puyouma’s request

860
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,000
is legit.

861
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,439
Zhunian is hit by floods so heavy

862
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:48,560
that even the capital has been damaged.

863
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:50,439
They must be in dire straits.

864
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,360
What’s worse, floods are always followed

865
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,760
by an outbreak of disease.

866
00:46:52,959 --> 00:46:53,760
It’s understandable

867
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:54,679
that you step up

868
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,120
and speak for Zhunian.

869
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:58,479
“Floods are followed
by an outbreak of disease”?

870
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:00,000
