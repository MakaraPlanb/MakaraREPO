You remember.

27
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,280
One of the mysterious
Heluo alchemic skills.

28
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,800
An alchemist’s body is
like strong armor.

29
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,920
Your throat is as hard as iron.

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,640
You must be a great alchemist.

31
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,560
Step aside!

32
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,280
No way!

33
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,575
Master,

34
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,960
this assassin’s moves are bizarre.

35
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,880
Haishi, stay on your toes.

36
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,800
Your Majesty, take the sword.

37
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,485
Let’s end this in your tribal way.

38
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,920
Wrestle!

39
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,120
Your Majesty, go!

40
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,000
No!

41
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,720
It’s said Alchemy

42
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,720
and Wind Waking

43
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,800
have been lost.

44
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,080
It’s quite unexpected

45
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,125
they’re carried on in foreign tribes.

46
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,400
Don’t you find that interesting?

47
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,325
Protect His Majesty.

48
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,920
Kill me.

49
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,800
Grant me the glory of a warrior.

50
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,125
See you in the Nether.

51
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,320
See you in the Nether.

52
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,760
Your Majesty.

53
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,435
Mm-hmm.

54
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:43,225
You both have done well protecting me.

55
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:44,920
Tell me.

56
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,800
What reward do you want?

57
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,000
I’m afraid it’s too much to ask.

58
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,600
Whatever it is
that the country can offer,

59
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,125
you’ll have it.

60
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,350
If Your Majesty says so.

61
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,375
Don’t!

62
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,320
Jianming!

63
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,850
Master!

64
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:09,200
Lord!

65
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:17,295
Jianming.

66
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,040
Zhuoying has never existed.

67
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,550
I’m Duohan.

68
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,575
Get him back.

69
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:23,600
Yes.

70
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,200
Your Majesty,

71
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,320
I’ve been keeping a rebel.

72
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,440
Your Majesty.

73
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,480
Zhuoying...

74
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,900
He must have a painful reason to do so.

75
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,925
Jianming,

76
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,120
once again,

77
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,320
you took a blow for me.

78
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:49,640
You always say that Jincheng Palace

79
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,750
has no shadows

80
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,160
where secrets can lurk.

81
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,450
But in the end,

82
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,320
it’s the man in eternal light

83
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,520
that nearly took your life.

84
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,075
What’s the point of being so persistent?

85
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,480
For those promises?

86
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,560
Let go.

87
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,560
You don’t owe me anything anymore.

88
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:24,760
Master.

89
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,560
Bring Zhuoying back.

90
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,320
If you can’t do that,

91
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:30,840
kill him.

92
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,480
Master...

93
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,880
Kill Fang Zhuoying.

94
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,250
He’s in a frenzy.

95
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:39,440
I’m afraid no one else

96
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,280
is a match for him,

97
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,040
except you.

98
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,320
He’s your brother,

99
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,525
and won’t hurt you.

100
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,560
Lord,

101
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,520
I’ve dressed the wound.

102
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,360
You must be careful in the future.

103
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,640
I’ll make some medicine for you.

104
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Be back soon.

105
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,480
Young Master Haishi.

106
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,480
Master.

107
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:21,885
How many people have you killed?

108
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
Countless.

109
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:27,600
When was the last time

110
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,680
you killed someone?

111
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:33,800
In the fake princess’s suppression.

112
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:34,960
Liar!

113
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,560
It was yesterday.

114
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,280
You killed Zheliu.

115
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:41,080
According to the secret guards,

116
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,070
you dismissed the staffs
of Fabric Office

117
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,640
and talked to Zheliu for a while.

118
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,040
You killed her with just a few words.

119
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:50,065
And Aunt Su.

120
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:52,120
You killed her too, didn’t you?

121
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:58,000
Do you think she’d curse you

122
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
a painful death before she died?

123
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,720
What exactly do you want Zhuoying

124
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,960
to do for you?

125
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,320
Zhuoying is a man

126
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,960
who puts his promises before his life.

127
00:11:11,225 --> 00:11:12,200
Since you took him under your wing,

128
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,720
he’s been loyal to you ever since.

129
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:15,200
He has never

130
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,660
disobeyed any of your orders.

131
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,800
Even if Zheliu killed herself soon after

132
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,880
she came back from Lord Chang’s Mansion,

133
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,840
Zhuoying would seek revenge

134
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,600
on Lord Chang,

135
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:26,585
instead of His Majesty.

136
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,000
Master,

137
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,600
is it really you?

138
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,760
Why did Zheliu have to die?

139
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,440
She’s just a

140
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,960
blind orphan.

141
00:11:42,075 --> 00:11:43,355
Zhuoying loves her

142
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,030
as much as he loves his own life.

143
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,560
When he found her dead,

144
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:51,125
he wailed.

145
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,400
I doubt if he would

146
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,800
cry again for the rest of his life.

147
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:59,265
That’s why the blind girl had to die.

148
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:01,685
If she didn’t die,

149
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,295
she’d be a weakness for Zhuoying.

150
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:13,720
Master.

151
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,690
You’ll never have any weaknesses,

152
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:18,960
right?

153
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:23,695
What are you trying to say?

154
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:29,240
Zhuoying and I

155
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
are like brothers

156
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,680
and best friends.

157
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,400
We drink and practice together,

158
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,640
and ride side by side,

159
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,360
like real brothers.

160
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,160
But you’re my master,

161
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,080
my...

162
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:51,200
Master, you’re so cruel.

163
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,560
All of us, including Zheliu,

164
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,685
Zhuoying,

165
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,040
and those who pledged

166
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,520
their loyalty to you

167
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:02,615
are merely your pawns

168
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,560
who are expendable, aren’t we?

169
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,200
Young Master Haishi.

170
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,475
A word from the palace.

171
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:14,715
The troops have been assembled.

172
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:16,320
They’re urging an immediate departure.

173
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,920
Tell them

174
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,480
the young master is on the way.

175
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,810
Yes.

176
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,400
Master,

177
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:28,720
did you raise us

178
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,200
to see us

179
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,440
kill each other?

180
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,725
Can I trust you anymore?

181
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:16,840
Mr. Fang,

182
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:17,920
the traitor Duohan

183
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,250
is hiding in this hut.

184
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:05,175
I know you’re under an imperial order.

185
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,600
Come on.

186
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,440
Mr. Fang,

187
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:28,840
will your wound be alright?

188
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:33,385
Fang Jianming

189
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,520
really impressed me

190
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,520
by killing two of

191
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,840
my best men.

192
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,440
Lord, what’s our next move?

193
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,600
Since

194
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,400
a few assassins can’t kill

195
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,160
Emperor Xu and Fang Jianming,

196
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,080
I have to assemble an army

197
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,600
and go all out.

198
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,160
Are you saying

199
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,100
that we attack Huangquan Pass?

200
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,230
Have you established contact

201
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,840
with Su Ming’s undercover?

202
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:01,760
Yes, I have.

203
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:03,400
He’s willing to help us

204
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,625
avenge Su Ming’s death.

205
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,855
But Huangquan Pass
is a hard nut to crack.

206
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,160
I know what you mean.

207
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,725
I don’t want
to lose too many men, either.

208
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:18,560
You mean?

209
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,250
Lord Chang

210
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:23,455
intends to join forces with me
to attack Tianqi.

211
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,550
But now it’s autumn.

212
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,520
Soon winter will be upon us,

213
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,840
not the best time

214
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,720
to launch an attack.

215
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,200
We’ve discussed.

216
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,520
In the next spring,

217
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,575
he’ll stage an uprising in the city,

218
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,080
and I will attack Huangquan Pass.

219
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,400
We’ll join forces

220
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:47,880
and take Dazheng down.

221
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,720
Mr. Fang,

222
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,480
I’m sorry you have to come back

223
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,800
to Huangquan Pass on such a mission.

224
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,800
Mr. Fang,

225
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:57,240
it’s late in the afternoon.

226
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,460
But none of the ten scouts
have returned.

227
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:00,480
What’s worse,

228
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,280
since we heard two warning horns

229
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,360
from the grassland,

230
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,880
there has been no further news.

231
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,880
I’m afraid the scouts have been killed.

232
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,440
In case Fang Zhuoying’s friends
set him free,

233
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,880
Lord Qinghai selected 500 men

234
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,240
from Beifu Army instead of Secret Force

235
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,000
to hunt him down.

236
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:17,040
I heard

237
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,440
most of them were once Mr. Fu’s men

238
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,280
from Huangquan Pass.

239
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,800
- Mhm.
- But Mr. Fang, you and the men

240
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,599
have tried several times

241
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,640
in half a month to round him up.

242
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:25,640
Fang Zhuoying is all alone.

243
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,119
He’s like a ghost.

244
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,240
It’s thousands of kilometers

245
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,360
from Zhongzhou to Hanzhou.

246
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,280
Yet we failed to capture him.

247
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,400
Instead, we lost a few

248
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,320
excellent fighters.

249
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:34,840
Now Fang Zhuoying

250
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,400
has gone over Mount Piluo,

251
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,400
and ten more lives are lost.

252
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,400
It seems

253
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,960
he’s really hard to seize.

254
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,000
Now that he’s

255
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,040
entered Jiamanese territory,

256
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,320
it’s not proper
for the remaining 400 men,

257
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,000
being neither envoys

258
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,200
or merchants,

259
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
to cross the border

260
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,040
fully armed.

261
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,280
Mr. Fu and I will go after him

262
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,280
with a few men.

263
00:17:58,525 --> 00:17:59,100
Mm-hmm.

264
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,240
Mr. Fang,

265
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,360
I’ll take care of

266
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,600
Fang Zhuoying’s arrest.

267
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,320
No.

268
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,420
Master gave the task to me.

269
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,150
I must be the one to do it.

270
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,800
You should stay at Huangquan Pass.

271
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,960
When are you going to ride out?

272
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Right now.

273
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,360
Is that him?

274
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:20,880
It looks like him.

275
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,000
I think it’s him.

276
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:23,160
Look, Commanders!

277
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,200
A Huku troop.

278
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:32,640
Sir,

279
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,640
when the traitor

280
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
blends in the Huku troop,

281
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:35,755
there’ll be no way we can hunt him down.

282
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,480
Who would have known

283
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,960
that the traitor summoned a Huku troop

284
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,840
to meet him here?

285
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,040
So now,

286
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:42,840
I guess only Mr. Fang can shoot him down

287
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,640
with his arrows.

288
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,320
Let me give it a try.

289
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,040
Zhuoying,

290
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:37,480
this is the last bet

291
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
between you and me.

292
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,600
If you believe in your brotherhood

293
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,440
with Haishi

294
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,480
and that he would rather
disobey my order

295
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,880
than kill you,

296
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,905
take this bet.

297
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:50,720
If you win,

298
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,125
the reward will be your freedom

299
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:54,695
and the vast land of Hanzhou.

300
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,200
I won’t hide.

301
00:21:57,675 --> 00:22:00,075
You have to shoot your target.

302
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,720
I believe

303
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,280
you can hit me.

304
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:06,425
(Huangquan Pass)

305
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,200
Mr. Fang,

306
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,220
are you sure you won’t rest
for a few days?

307
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:11,440
Mr. Fu can set out

308
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:12,480
for Tianqi City first

309
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,520
and report to His Majesty.

310
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,120
Yes.

311
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:15,960
Mr. Fang,

312
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,200
your wound hasn’t healed.

313
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:18,350
It’s too soon for you to ride out.

314
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,375
Why don’t you take some time to rest

315
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:20,480
before riding back?

316
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,040
Winter comes early in Hanbei.

317
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,360
If it snows, the roads will be blocked.

318
00:23:24,775 --> 00:23:26,480
I’d better get back to Tianqi
as soon as possible

319
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,440
and report to my master and His Majesty.

320
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,880
If you insist,

321
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,320
I will say no more.

322
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,160
Mr. Fu.

323
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,640
Yes.

324
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,360
Please take care of Mr. Fang

325
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,560
on your way back.

326
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,000
Sure.

327
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,720
Let’s say goodbye here.

328
00:23:39,325 --> 00:23:40,480
So long.

329
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:42,800
So long.

330
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:04,400
General Fang,

331
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,840
it’s Chishan City up ahead.

332
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:13,925
Mr. Fang!

333
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,125
General!

334
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:19,080
Mr. Fang!

335
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:20,000
Mr. Fang!

336
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:21,440
Now,

337
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,560
take Mr. Fang to Chishan City.

338
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,125
Yes.

339
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,560
Mr. Fang was wounded,

340
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,040
and rode day and night.

341
00:24:29,525 --> 00:24:30,960
He coughed blood.

342
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,000
Now he’s unconscious due to fever.

343
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:34,325
Please check

344
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,480
his condition.

345
00:24:43,575 --> 00:24:44,350
Sir,

346
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,880
can we have a word alone?

347
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,000
Sir,

348
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,320
how is Mr. Fang’s

349
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,240
condition?

350
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,680
You can tell me.

351
00:25:03,275 --> 00:25:04,200
Sir,

352
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,800
the commander has an old wound.

353
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,240
Due to the long ride

354
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,760
and cold weather,

355
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,120
she caught a cold.

356
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,760
Yes, she’s a woman.

357
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,520
It’s too much a blow

358
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,160
for her body to manage.

359
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,040
Are you sure?

360
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,360
I’ve been a physician for 30 years.

361
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,800
I can tell men from women

362
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,560
by checking

363
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,240
their pulses.

364
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,080
The weather is far too cold.

365
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,720
If there are women on your journey,

366
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,760
I suggest they ride a carriage

367
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
with

368
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,320
burning charcoal in it.

369
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,325
You’re right, sir.

370
00:25:56,325 --> 00:25:56,825
Mm-hmm.

371
00:25:56,825 --> 00:25:58,480
But I have my reason

372
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,360
to make such an arrangement.

373
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Right.

374
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,040
This news concerns your life.

375
00:26:11,825 --> 00:26:12,350
Huh?

376
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,560
Do you understand?

377
00:26:13,925 --> 00:26:14,550
Oh.

378
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,560
Yes, I do.

379
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,480
You...

380
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,360
You...

381
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,600
Who are you?

382
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:38,320
You...

383
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,280
Mr. Fang.

384
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,775
Mr. Fu.

385
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,720
Is the fever gone?

386
00:27:12,075 --> 00:27:12,750
You still

387
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,320
don’t look well.

388
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,880
Maybe the prescription isn’t working.

389
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,680
No. It is working,

390
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,840
except that it’s not working well.

391
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:22,280
The fever goes down a bit,

392
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,320
but is not completely gone.

393
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,125
Oh.

394
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,120
Mr. Fang,

395
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,675
we’ve been staying in Chishan City

396
00:27:27,675 --> 00:27:28,680
for quite some days.

397
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,720
But I haven’t seen

398
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,280
any improvement in your health.

399
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,040
And the capital
is waiting for our report.

400
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:35,840
Shall I

401
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,520
lead the men out first?

402
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,560
When you’re cured,

403
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,360
you can catch up with us.

404
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,025
What do you think?

405
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,480
That’s a great plan, Mr. Fu.

406
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,800
When you were unconscious,

407
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Xiaoliu had been looking after you.

408
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,200
I can tell

409
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,125
she’s a caring girl,

410
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,840
so I paid her

411
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,760
to look after you.

412
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,480
Thank you.

413
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,550
Then I’ll gather the men and set off.

414
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,325
Mr. Fang,

415
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
take care of yourself.

416
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,400
I’ll see you when you catch up.

417
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,480
Please, Mr. Fu.

418
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,600
Lord.

419
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,880
Come in.

420
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:55,975
Lord,

421
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,400
Fu Yi and the men

422
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,320
have left Chishan for Tianqi City.

423
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,080
But Haishi’s wound hasn’t healed,

424
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,320
so he’s staying in an inn
in Chishan City.

425
00:29:08,025 --> 00:29:09,400
He’s been hunting Zhuoying

426
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,880
for more than a month.

427
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,360
Without proper treatment, his wound

428
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,960
could cause unimaginable damage.

429
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,120
I asked you to prepare some medicine

430
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,920
to be delivered to Chishan City.

431
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,800
Have you prepared it?

432
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Yes, I have.

433
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,960
However...

434
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:22,925
What?

435
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,960
I’m not sure if Haishi

436
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,240
will accept your medicine.

437
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:31,680
Tell him it’s from you.

438
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,120
Yes, Lord.

439
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,600
Fang Jianming is sly.

440
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,640
How sophisticated

441
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,880
and decisive!

442
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,200
To drag

443
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,600
Your Highness down,

444
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,840
he even killed Zheliu.

445
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,880
Cunning fox.

446
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,200
What a brilliant plan

447
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,640
it is!

448
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,925
I’m sorry

449
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,040
that I’m not smart enough.

450
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,680
- I shouldn’t have...
- Hey.

451
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,960
Even if the blind girl didn’t die,

452
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,960
Fang Zhuoying would keep

453
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,160
going against me in Hanzhou.

454
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,920
The blind girl’s death

455
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,160
only hardened

456
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,360
his heart.

457
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,160
Like Commandery Princess Fenyang,

458
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
even if she didn’t die,

459
00:30:31,325 --> 00:30:32,400
I wouldn’t allow Emperor Xu

460
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,680
to have an easy life.

461
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,520
I shouldn’t

462
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,560
have told you this.

463
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,200
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

464
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,625
My ears

465
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,760
are deaf

466
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,320
to what I shouldn’t know.

467
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,200
Smart man.

468
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,680
Since you’ve been in touch

469
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,760
with Lord of Left Pudun,

470
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,200
you must know my deal with him.

471
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,925
I dare not lie to Your Highness.

472
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,160
I do know.

473
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,080
In the next spring,

474
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,160
you will stage an uprising in Tianqi,

475
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,000
and the Left Lord will attack
Huangquan Pass.

476
00:31:07,425 --> 00:31:10,585
Together, your victory is secure.

477
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,800
Sadly,

478
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,120
Fang Jianming’s henchmen

479
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,000
are quite some eyesores.

480
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
I’m not sure

481
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,360
if they’ll get in my way.

482
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,480
Since they’re eyesores,

483
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,725
why don’t Your Highness and I

484
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:25,240
get rid of these henchmen

485
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,440
before

486
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,080
the next spring comes?

487
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,840
Sounds ambitious.

488
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,240
Who do you work for?

489
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,280
Why let it bother you, Your Highness?

490
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,080
A shared goal makes us allies.

491
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
Your ally

492
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,560
will show himself

493
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,880
when the day comes.

494
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,960
The most reliable are the ones
who are in it for profit.

495
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,560
Go.

496
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,200
Gather flaws

497
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,280
of Fang Jianming’s men.

498
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,525
Stay low.

499
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,640
Make sure they’re eliminated.

500
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,040
Yes.

501
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:33,800
Commandery Princess Fenyang,

502
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,800
you were brave,

503
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,040
but you knew no tactics.

504
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,160
You were a fool.

505
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,000
But for the sake

506
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,120
that you didn’t

507
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,400
betray me in the end,

508
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,720
I’ll make your death worth it.

509
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,025
How far have you gotten?

510
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,960
The page that she pulled out her pin

511
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,880
to beat a bamboo on a snowy night.

512
00:33:06,075 --> 00:33:07,675
It’s been years

513
00:33:08,575 --> 00:33:09,800
since the last time I went out

514
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,720
on a snowy day.

515
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,840
I don’t even remember

516
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,025
the last time

517
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,760
I admired the snow view.

518
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:19,440
Would you like to see the snow?

519
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,160
What’s so difficult about that?

520
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,840
If Your Majesty

521
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,800
lends Eunuch Mu to me,

522
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,200
I can

523
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,720
make your wish come true tonight.

524
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,350
Blend these two.

525
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,950
Oh.

526
00:33:40,325 --> 00:33:42,160
Then scatter them

527
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,350
from up there.

528
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,560
Oh, really?

529
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,080
- Alright, I see.
- Mm-hmm.

530
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,640
You can count on me, Your Highness.

531
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,080
Your Majesty.

532
00:34:00,925 --> 00:34:01,920
Come with me, please.

533
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,480
There it is!

534
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:37,475
Hold the ladder.

535
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:38,560
- And hold it firm.
- Yes, sure.

536
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,040
Go.

537
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,960
How did you do it?

538
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,200
Ice from the bottom of Yingge Sea,

539
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,850
when blended with Xieluo pollen,

540
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,480
turns into flakes.

541
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,880
I gathered a lot of Xieluo pollen

542
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,275
in the summer.

543
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:06,320
Thought I could make some cakes for you.

544
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,400
Unexpectedly,

545
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,880
it’s coming in handy now.

546
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,200
How did you know

547
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,240
this method to make snow?

548
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,840
It doesn’t snow in Zhunian
all year round.

549
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,880
When I was a kid,

550
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,760
I once blubbered for snow.

551
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,200
So my mother

552
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,160
gave me

553
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,840
the first snow in my life

554
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,120
in the same way.

555
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:26,360
Right.

556
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:27,880
On the west side of Jingcheng Hall,

557
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,800
there’s also a bamboo grove.

558
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,080
When it snows this year,

559
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,125
we’ll go there and pull out our pins

560
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,000
to beat the bamboos.

561
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:33,150
By then,

562
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,640
you can hear the swish

563
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,760
of snow falling

564
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,640
from bamboo leaves.

565
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,080
The view is amazing.

566
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,280
We can also

567
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,700
drink a big bowl of warm tea.

568
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:43,440
And roast deer meat.

569
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,000
And build snowmen.

570
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,560
A lot of them.

571
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,600
We’ll paint eyes, noses

572
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,680
and mouths on them

573
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,640
with a brush

574
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,800
and pine ink.

575
00:35:53,775 --> 00:35:55,075
What else can we do?

576
00:35:57,775 --> 00:35:59,000
We’ll see.

577
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,040
(Zichen Hall)
Prince Duohan of Huku

578
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,680
(Zichen Hall)
lurked in Jifeng Pavilion for decades.

579
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,480
(Zichen Hall)
The assassination is unpardonable.

580
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,400
Yet due to Fang Haishi’s negligence,

581
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,720
he fled to Huku.

582
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,920
Although Lord Qinghai

583
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,320
saved Your Majesty,

584
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,080
he should be held accountable
for his apprentices.

585
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,525
Your Majesty.

586
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,560
Lord Qinghai holds a prominent position

587
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,760
that concerns Your Majesty’s safety.

588
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,360
His negligence

589
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,040
rings an alarm.

590
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,680
Punishment

591
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,800
is essential to ease public anger.

592
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,880
- We sincerely request for Lord Qinghai’s
- We sincerely request for Lord Qinghai’s

593
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,400
- punishment for the stability of Dazheng.
- punishment for the stability of Dazheng.

594
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,560
- Please punish Lord Qinghai.
- Please punish Lord Qinghai.

595
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,475
Your Majesty,

596
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,320
I implore Your Majesty to think twice.

597
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,800
Although Lord Qinghai has done wrong,

598
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,800
his loyalty is...

599
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,840
Your Majesty places great trust

600
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,760
in Jifeng Pavilion.

601
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,120
If one man from Jifeng Pavilion

602
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,080
goes rogue,

603
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,920
no feat can offset

604
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,200
the damage it causes.

605
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,840
Please punish Lord Qinghai

606
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,920
and screen the staff of Jifeng Pavilion.

607
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,680
- Please punish Lord Qinghai
- Please punish Lord Qinghai

608
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,400
- and screen the staff of Jifeng Pavilion.
- and screen the staff of Jifeng Pavilion.

609
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,525
Your Majesty,

610
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,160
I request to be dismissed.

611
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,880
Denied!

612
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,440
It’s not the first time
you’ve asked for a dismissal.

613
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,360
What do you take me and the court for?

614
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,360
It’s true

615
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,880
that Lord Qinghai was wronged last time.

616
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,040
But this is different.

617
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,280
Your Majesty mustn’t keep a potential
traitor by your side.

618
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,160
Enough!

619
00:37:45,425 --> 00:37:46,850
During the fake princess’s treason,

620
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,280
were it not for Lord Qinghai,

621
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,040
would I even have been able to sit here?

622
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,120
Each and every one of you

623
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,480
is loud now,

624
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:54,560
but if you were there,

625
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,800
you would have fled, wouldn’t you?

626
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,650
Your Majesty,

627
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
I’m grateful for your grace.

628
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,320
But being in a critical position,

629
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,120
I deserve a fair punishment
more than anyone else.

630
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,160
So I ask

631
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,680
to stand guard at the North Palace Gate

632
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,920
and reflect on my issues.

633
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,040
I said you won’t be punished,
and you won’t.

634
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,880
What you do is up to you.

635
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,120
The assembly is over.

636
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,200
The assembly is over.

637
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,640
- Good day, Your Majesty.
- Good day, Your Majesty.

638
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,920
Good day, Your Majesty.

639
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,440
What did you cook?

640
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,400
It smells so good.

641
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,425
Marinated quail,

642
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,925
with sesame oil and seeds.

643
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:49,000
Oh.

644
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:54,960
What’s this?

645
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,050
Congee with long wheat,

646
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,400
lotus seeds and shredded chicken.

647
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,120
It calms the mind and warms the stomach.

648
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:01,975
Oh.

649
00:39:04,525 --> 00:39:05,600
I had

650
00:39:06,475 --> 00:39:07,600
a terrible day.

651
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,760
I know.

652
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,040
Anyone in court

653
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,825
whom I can give

654
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,360
my absolute trust to

655
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,480
is subject to constant impeachments.

656
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,980
They’re trying to turn me against him.

657
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
They will not stop

658
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,000
until they make me

659
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,720
a real loner.

660
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,725
There won’t be a day

661
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,640
when Your Majesty becomes

662
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,560
a loner.

663
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,760
With your permission,

664
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,680
I will always be here for you.

665
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,760
Will you?

666
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,320
Until when?

667
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,600
Until the end of time.

668
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,600
Then it’s a deal.

669
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:51,450
Mm-hmm.

670
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,224
(Dinghe Gate)

671
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,100
Lord,

672
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,400
His Majesty has decreed that
you will not be punished.

673
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,880
Why are you doing this?

674
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,240
When standing guard,

675
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,560
we’re not allowed
to chat or move freely.

676
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:18,425
(Dinghe Gate)

677
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,360
Lord Chang.

678
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:26,925
Lord Qinghai,

679
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,480
I’m so sorry that I couldn’t

680
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,320
stop those officials

681
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,920
from fanning anger.

682
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,920
Your Highness is so kind.

683
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:38,900
Please, Your Highness.

684
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,840
You must serve Lord Qinghai

685
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,120
wholeheartedly.

686
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,440
If anything goes wrong,

687
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,760
I will

688
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,920
not spare you.

689
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:52,880
Yes.

690
00:41:14,675 --> 00:41:15,440
Eunuch Mu,

691
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,560
Consort Shurong has returned
to Yu’an Palace.

692
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,200
Your Majesty,

693
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,280
Consort Shurong has returned
to Yu’an Palace.

694
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,240
Please go back to the palace and rest.

695
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,360
Is Lord Qinghai

696
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,160
still standing guard
at the North Palace Gate?

697
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,920
Your Majesty,

698
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,640
Lord Qinghai is still there.

699
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,960
I guess he will be there

700
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,760
for some time.

701
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,600
What a headstrong man!

702
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,800
He has to make a fool of himself.

703
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,125
Your Majesty,

704
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,760
perhaps Lord Qinghai is doing this

705
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
to ease public anger,

706
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,400
so that they won’t put too much pressure

707
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,720
on Your Majesty.

708
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,225
By the way...

709
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:00,725
Hmm?

710
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Tomorrow,

711
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,440
tell the Directorate of Astronomy

712
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,640
to choose an auspicious day,

713
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,360
and Fabric Office
and Imperial Manufactories

714
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,640
to provide the Empress’s daily use

715
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,080
to Consort Shurong.

716
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

717
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:28,975
Eunuch Mu.

718
00:42:28,975 --> 00:42:29,520
Hmm?

719
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,680
Isn’t it against the rules

720
00:42:30,725 --> 00:42:32,400
to provide the Empress’s daily use

721
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,240
to a consort?

722
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,920
Silly lad,

723
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,250
don’t you get it?

724
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,520
The Empress’s Palace has been
vacant for years.

725
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,640
Soon, it won’t be.

726
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,800
You’ll see.

727
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,880
The mistress

728
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,360
of Yu’an Palace

729
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,840
will soon become the Empress.

730
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,120
Good evening, Your Highness.

731
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,680
Has anyone seen you coming?

732
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,200
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

733
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,400
I made sure I wasn’t tailed

734
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
before I came in.

735
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,300
Mr. Fu,

736
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,880
you’re so reassuring.

737
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,560
This prey of ours

738
00:43:23,525 --> 00:43:24,680
is quite resilient.

739
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,040
His self-punishment

740
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,680
gives me no chance to do anything.

741
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,800
Your Highness shouldn’t worry.

742
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:33,840
Any man

743
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,840
has his weaknesses.

744
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,120
When we find his,

745
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,440
he will no longer fight back.

746
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,600
You’re very perceptive,

747
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,560
unlike your former master,

748
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,880
who only knew to confront Fang Jianming.

749
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,450
Thank you for the compliment.

750
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,850
As long as Your Highness

751
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,280
agrees to avenge General Su’s death,

752
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,425
I, Fu Yi,

753
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,160
am at Your Highness’s disposal.

754
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,400
Last time you reported

755
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,120
you had something on Fang Jianming.

756
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,400
Tell me about it.

757
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,000
Lord Qinghai’s

758
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,640
favorite apprentice, Fang Haishi,

759
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,800
coughed blood and had a fever.

760
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,600
I invited a physician to check his pulse

761
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,720
in Chishan City.

762
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,040
The physician said

763
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,880
that Fang Haishi is a woman.

764
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,280
It’s inevitable that her health
will take a blow.

765
00:44:14,825 --> 00:44:15,700
You mean...

766
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,960
Fang Haishi is a woman.

767
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,600
Have you confirmed it?

768
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,080
She once spent some time

769
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,040
at Huangquan Battalion.

770
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,400
But she never shared a tent,

771
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,440
or a bath with others.

772
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,120
I thought she was

773
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
just a spoiled young master.

774
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,350
When I think about it again,

775
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,240
who would behave like this

776
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,400
except for a woman?

777
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,960
I also found out

778
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,760
that Fang Haishi never

779
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,880
sought a physician’s treatment.

780
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,120
Even when she was wounded,

781
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,040
she treated herself.

782
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,200
The physicians in Huangquan Battalion

783
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,760
have never treated her.

784
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,320
Well,

785
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,400
where is the physician
from Chishan City?

786
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,240
We got the confirmation,

787
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,400
so there’s no reason to keep him alive.

788
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,040
Good.

789
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,475
Your Highness,

790
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,640
His Majesty refuses to listen to advice.

791
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,720
The officials’ effort is vain.

792
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,520
But Prince Duohan of Huku

793
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,880
attacked His Majesty

794
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,080
after years of lurking,

795
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,240
and had just fled to Huku.

796
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,760
The aftermath isn’t over.

797
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,480
Now we found Fang Haishi
faked her identity

798
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,320
during the Imperial Examination,

799
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,760
and was later conferred
as General of Cloud-like Flag,

800
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,280
a high-rank officer.

801
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,560
Fang Jianming covered her up

802
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,225
and deceived His Majesty.

803
00:45:17,225 --> 00:45:18,120
There’s no excuse for this.

804
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,280
With two crimes on his head,

805
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,560
I’m sure he won’t get away.

806
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,640
Fang Jianming

807
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,360
wins the absolute trust of His Majesty.

808
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
Judging by his counter strikes,

809
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,800
I guess he has seen it coming.

810
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,800
No rush.

811
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,720
Never let your rival know

812
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,880
what moves you’re going to make.

813
00:45:55,475 --> 00:45:56,100
Mm-hmm.

814
00:45:56,525 --> 00:45:57,400
