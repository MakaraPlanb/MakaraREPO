00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,559
After you.

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,919
Shall we go out together?

00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,400
All right.

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
- General Tang.
- All right.

32
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:27,919
I’ll live in Zhaoming Palace tonight

33
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,520
and I won’t go out with you.

34
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:31,650
Fine, then. Off you go.

35
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,250
Mm.

36
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:43,004
I’ll leave you alone.

37
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,066
See you.

38
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:51,250
See you, My Lord.

39
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,091
See you, My Lord.

40
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,360
What a beautiful moon!

41
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:23,240
It’s as bright and round

42
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:24,839
as the one in my hometown.

43
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,639
You miss your hometown?

44
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,360
I haven’t been back for years.

45
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,080
I have a blurred memory of Linjie.

46
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,880
All I can remember is the moon.

47
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:39,955
I still want to sigh when I think of it.

48
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:42,350
Mm.

49
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:49,039
I remember the poem you taught me.

50
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,160
“High mountains make the moon
look small.

51
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,800
The moon yet shines brightly.

52
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,600
The man I miss is far away.

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,440
When I can’t see him, I feel so lonely.”

54
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,759
I don’t even remember that.

55
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,160
It doesn’t matter.

56
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,800
I remember it, anyway.

57
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,040
Eunuch Mu,

58
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,920
what’s this?

59
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,225
Your Highness,

60
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,011
this is the contraceptive decoction.

61
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,920
His Majesty hasn’t had a lineal son yet.

62
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,880
According to rules,
you can’t have a baby now.

63
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,175
But there isn’t an empress yet.

64
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,359
It still depends

65
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,799
on the decision of His Majesty.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,640
You may not need

67
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,760
to obey old rules.

68
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,480
You know what you should do.

69
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,679
That’s good.

70
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,661
Here’s a decree of His Majesty.

71
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,600
Dazheng and Zhunian

72
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,799
are always related by marriage

73
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
and stay in harmony.

74
00:06:11,775 --> 00:06:15,799
Now, Zhunian is suffering
from a rare natural disaster.

75
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,600
Ten thousand taels of gold,

76
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,839
2,500 tons of grain,

77
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,679
twenty thousand bolts of cloth,

78
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:25,880
and ten carts of medicine

79
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,799
will be sent to Zhunian.

80
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,239
Respect this.

81
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,265
Yeah.

82
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:38,200
That’s right.

83
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,471
What do you think, Lord Qinghai?

84
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,519
It’s up to you, Your Majesty.

85
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,720
Let’s do it then.

86
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,880
Your Highness,

87
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,160
you may get up for dinner.

88
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:12,679
Here’s a decree from His Majesty.

89
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:21,480
What is it again?

90
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:34,839
His Majesty commanded that

91
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,284
Consort Shurong should accompany him
in Jincheng Palace.

92
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,079
Respect this.

93
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:43,000
Your Highness,

94
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,480
you should express your gratitude.

95
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,640
I’m grateful to His Majesty.

96
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:02,265
Don’t bother.

97
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:05,519
I asked you to accompany me,

98
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,079
instead of serving me.

99
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,600
Yes.

100
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,159
What?

101
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,320
Are you afraid that I’ll fix your makeup

102
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,919
or are you afraid of staying
in Jincheng Palace?

103
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,039
I’m not afraid.

104
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:08,126
Now that you intend
to disguise yourself as Zizan,

105
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:11,075
why do you bother to say that?

106
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,880
In Tianqi City, from this day on,

107
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:16,280
I allow you to disobey rules.

108
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,880
We’ll accompany each other
day and night.

109
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,200
And we’ve got a long life to live.

110
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:56,359
Come on.

111
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,640
Why must you go fishing in the dark?

112
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,880
Don’t let her have a wasted trip.

113
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,200
The sun is blazing in the daytime.

114
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,799
Zheliu is a girl.

115
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,679
We shouldn’t have her

116
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:08,960
bask in the sun.

117
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,799
It’s dim at night.

118
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,000
But I can adapt to it.

119
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:13,650
Anyway,

120
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,919
days and nights

121
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:15,559
make no difference

122
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,359
to Miss Zheliu.

123
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,559
She can’t see things now.

124
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,239
I can’t make her accommodate herself.

125
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:21,400
Then I have to yield to her.

126
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,080
Very good,

127
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,919
Fang Zhuoying!

128
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,880
You quite surprise me
after I haven’t seen you for days.

129
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,440
It’s more considerate of you.

130
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:31,479
I wish

131
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,000
Miss Zheliu could think this way, too.

132
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:38,440
You... you...

133
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,799
Do this again.

134
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:46,679
Fang Zhuoying.

135
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:47,599
You...

136
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:48,150
Mm?

137
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:49,359
Have you seen

138
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,760
the new Lord of the Left Tribe of Huku?

139
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,320
Why did you ask?

140
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,119
When I saw him for the first time,

141
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,200
I was quite taken aback.

142
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,559
You two look nearly the same,

143
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,679
except for the color
of the hair and eyes.

144
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,320
Master brought you back

145
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,960
from the Red Plain.

146
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,719
You and the new lord...

147
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:17,350
- Can you be...?
- Come on!

148
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,359
In this world,

149
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,640
many people look alike.

150
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,239
It’s just a coincidence.

151
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,300
Coincidence?

152
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,840
People usually can’t live
to 100 years old.

153
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,000
Don’t always try

154
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
to get to the root of everything.

155
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,440
Or you can’t live a happy life.

156
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,640
You make sense.

157
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,281
Human hearts are incomprehensible.

158
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,960
Don’t think everything can be all right

159
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,359
simply because it’s all right
for the moment.

160
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,039
You’d better be cautious.

161
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,719
Tianqi City

162
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,799
is turbulent enough.

163
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,239
Now that we’re in this city,

164
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,799
what else can we be scared of?

165
00:12:55,469 --> 00:13:00,075
(Fabric Office)

166
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,520
Here we are.

167
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,119
Thank you.

168
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,359
Zhuoying,

169
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,760
this is where I leave her.

170
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,440
I’ll leave you alone.

171
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,840
You...

172
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:17,479
Can you take care of her?

173
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,919
I can, of course.

174
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,440
Don’t be clumsy.

175
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:22,719
I’m leaving.

176
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,425
Mm.

177
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,200
Leave.

178
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,320
Let’s go.

179
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,150
General Fang.

180
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,559
Tang Qianzi?

181
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:03,960
Why did he come to the Palace?

182
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,950
(Yu’an Palace)

183
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:27,039
Yu’an Palace?

184
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,239
Your Highness,

185
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,850
how about asking them

186
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,880
to get you a brazier?

187
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,700
No.

188
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:50,039
Keep quiet about it.

189
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,159
Shall I get a physician for you?

190
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,039
Even if you don’t want a baby,

191
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,880
His Majesty is still so cruel.

192
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,760
The contraceptive decoction isn’t good.

193
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,280
If you keep taking it,

194
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,000
your health will be ruined.

195
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,300
I’m feeling a bit better.

196
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,919
I don’t feel as much pain as just now.

197
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,575
You...

198
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,119
You may leave me alone.

199
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,919
I want a nap.

200
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,760
But Your Highness...

201
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,400
Leave me.

202
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:02,960
Here.

203
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:11,919
The bracelet...

204
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,799
You know it?

205
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:19,000
No.

206
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,359
I just think

207
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,820
it looks nice on you.

208
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah.

209
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,159
I got it from a friend

210
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:33,719
that I’ve never seen.

211
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,960
I like it.

212
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,155
So, I’ve been wearing it.

213
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,000
You’ve never seen him?

214
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:45,599
Right.

215
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:49,239
I’ve never seen him.

216
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,520
But in my heart,

217
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:54,505
he’s my first friend in the Palace

218
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:57,195
and my only friend here.

219
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,155
I’m sure it’s also his luck

220
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,089
to have a friend like you.

221
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,200
Ah.

222
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,715
A fish is biting the hook, I think.

223
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,040
It is!

224
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,920
Come on. Hang in there.

225
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:28,959
Mr. Fang.

226
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:30,745
One, two, three!

227
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:39,959
Haishi,

228
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,079
you seldom have some days off.

229
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:42,920
Why are you making something here,

230
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,560
instead of going out for fun?

231
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,319
This is something nice.

232
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
It’s Dream Catcher.

233
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,560
You’re born to be clumsy-handed.

234
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,920
Don’t force yourself.

235
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:54,319
Even if no one marries you,

236
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,880
I won’t have you make a living

237
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,199
by doing such handwork.

238
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,839
When I have my own mansion,

239
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,319
I’ll have you sleep in the woodshed.

240
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,479
You...

241
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,800
You don’t understand.

242
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,400
This is a handicraft from Jiaman.

243
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,719
I learned it from a friend.

244
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,119
I hear

245
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,040
when we hang the Dream Catcher,

246
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,199
we’ll have few dreams

247
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,719
and have a good sleep.

248
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:12,119
Even if we have dreams,

249
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,479
we’ll have sweet dreams.

250
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,300
Mm.

251
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,520
Sounds good.

252
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,079
These days, I often dreamed

253
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,000
of eating roast chicken.

254
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,119
Every time I nearly

255
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,079
bit it,

256
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:21,199
I woke up.

257
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,199
Give one to me.

258
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:23,239
In your dream!

259
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,560
I’ve only made two.

260
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,439
The other one

261
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,239
is for my good friend,

262
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:27,959
Consort Shurong.

263
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:29,599
Haishi...

264
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,199
You...

265
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,325
How heartless you are!

266
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:32,550
Come on! What?

267
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,079
Smells so good.

268
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,199
Master,

269
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,719
I mean this smells good.

270
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,000
It...

271
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,040
You!

272
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,359
You make a gift of my pancake.

273
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,199
Master,

274
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,119
that is mine.

275
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:01,880
Give it back to him.

276
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,839
Master,

277
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:09,719
if you don’t mind,

278
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:10,640
I’ll leave you alone.

279
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,375
Mm.

280
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,400
I have something to tell you.

281
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,239
What is it, Master?

282
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,800
I’m having some days off lately.

283
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:22,640
By the way,

284
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,560
I’m going to the seashore of Linjie.

285
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,119
If you want to go home,

286
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,640
you can go with me.

287
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,599
Go home?

288
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,640
You said you missed home, didn’t you?

289
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:31,719
What?

290
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,560
You don’t want to go?

291
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,119
I do, of course.

292
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:35,880
Before leaving,

293
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,160
go tell Tang Qianzi about it as usual.

294
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,439
When he approves,

295
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,520
we’ll set out.

296
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:41,600
Mm.

297
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,319
Your Highness,

298
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:50,959
how about asking them

299
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:51,880
to get you a brazier?

300
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,640
No.

301
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:55,959
Keep quiet about it.

302
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,400
Shall I get a physician for you?

303
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,959
Even if you don’t want a baby,

304
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,000
His Majesty is still so cruel.

305
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,959
The contraceptive decoction isn’t good.

306
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,599
If you keep taking it,

307
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,560
your health will be ruined.

308
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,975
(The war lasted for three days...
Pirates attacked fertile lands again...)

309
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,160
May I come in, General Tang?

310
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,239
Come on in.

311
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,000
Greetings, Mr. Tang.

312
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:38,880
We’re colleagues.
Don’t stand on ceremony.

313
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,920
I have a favor to ask you.

314
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,800
Just tell me about it.

315
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,119
As long as I can help,

316
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,040
I’ll help.

317
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,920
I’ve been away
from my hometown for years.

318
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,680
My mother still lives there.

319
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,359
Since we’re back in the capital,

320
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,760
I want to ask for a leave

321
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,719
so that I can recuperate for a while

322
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,920
and visit my mother in my hometown.

323
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,925
Oh.

324
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,479
Sorry for not remembering that.

325
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:01,199
On our way back,

326
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,160
you talked about that.

327
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,239
Mr. Fang,

328
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,839
don’t worry about military affairs

329
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,520
and just have a good recuperation.

330
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,439
If there’s any official business,

331
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,800
I’ll have an order

332
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,400
sent to you.

333
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,640
Thank you.

334
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:14,880
Be careful.

335
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:15,839
Be very careful.

336
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,075
Come on.

337
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,319
Be careful with them.

338
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,000
So?

339
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,920
Are you happy that Master is taking you

340
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,560
with him?

341
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,680
Zhuoying,

342
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,319
please do me a favor.

343
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,280
I had planned

344
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,040
to give the Dream Catcher

345
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,119
to Consort Shurong personally.

346
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,640
Now, you have to give it to her for me.

347
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,199
Besides, please bring

348
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,280
my message to her,

349
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,199
“Take care”.

350
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,839
Fine, then.

351
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:41,400
You never think of me for good things.

352
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,350
But when you need help,

353
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,479
you always think of me.

354
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:44,880
I’m your brother, anyway.

355
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:45,800
Thank you, Zhuoying.

356
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,959
I’ll think of you for good things later.

357
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,760
All right.

358
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:49,920
That’s more like it.

359
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:50,920
Go.

360
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:54,975
(Tianqi City)

361
00:21:54,975 --> 00:21:55,959
(Tianqi City)
Take good care of Master.

362
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,719
His lordship ordered that

363
00:21:58,719 --> 00:21:59,959
you should pack light.

364
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:01,520
So, not too many subordinates will go.

365
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,800
During your trip,

366
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,839
please stay safe, Young Master.

367
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,599
Don’t worry.

368
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,239
I’ll take good care of Master.

369
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:07,599
I’m leaving.

370
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,839
Take care.

371
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,625
How I wish

372
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,800
we could keep traveling like this!

373
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:52,325
(Splendid Dazheng)

374
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,000
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

Let me move your tools

380
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,199

00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:35,280
Your Majesty,

424
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:36,479
this is the rabbit

425
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:37,439
Consort Shurong raised.

426
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,525
She asked us

427
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:40,000
to send it to the Fabric Office.

428
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:41,920
To the Fabric Office?

429
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,760
She’ll no longer raise it?

430
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,839
Her Highness said

431
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,750
she was too tired

432
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,040
to raise the rabbit anymore.

433
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:48,920
Then she asked us

434
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,160
to send it to the Fabric Office

435
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,750
so that it could
accompany the rabbit there.

436
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:56,520
Now that she knew
she couldn’t take good care of it,

437
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,239
why did she raise it?

438
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:00,560
Mu Deqing.

439
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,225
Here, Your Majesty.

440
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,880
The same for tonight.

441
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,640
Get Consort Shurong to accompany me
in Jincheng Palace.

442
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,199
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:17,700

444
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,000

445
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,640
Your Majesty,

446
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,319
it’s already 9:00 PM.

447
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,239
Why hasn’t she come yet?

448
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,119
She...

449
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,199
Two hours ago,

450
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:34,880
your decree was sent to Yu’an Palace.

451
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,719
Your Majesty,

452
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:41,175
Bizi from Yu’an Palace asked to see you.

453
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,319
Get her in.

454
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,079
Greetings, Your Majesty.

455
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,319
Where’s Consort Shurong?

456
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:56,599
Your Majesty,

457
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,239
Her Highness caught a cold

458
00:29:58,239 --> 00:29:59,079
and fell sick.

459
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:01,160
In case of infecting you,

460
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,839
she asked me to come and apologize.

461
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:03,850
She caught a cold?

462
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,800
Yes.

463
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,959
Her Highness...

464
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:08,199
I’ll go and check

465
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,800
if she is so sick

466
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,160
that she can’t even get up.

467
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:34,719
Your Highness,

468
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,719
shall I go

469
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:37,000
get a physician?

470
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:39,959
We sent for a physician

471
00:30:40,325 --> 00:30:41,640
and I took some medicine.

472
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,599
It’s no use trying again.

473
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:48,000
Bizi has gone to Jincheng Palace

474
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,760
to apologize to His Majesty.

475
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,119
It’s been an hour,

476
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:50,839
but she hasn’t come back yet.

477
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:51,920
I wonder

478
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,959
if she’s held up on her way back.

479
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,959
Why did she go to Jincheng Palace?

480
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,920
His Majesty summoned me today?

481
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,239
Yes, you were asleep

482
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,359
and your face was ghastly pale.

483
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,680
Bizi was sure that

484
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,400
you couldn’t go today.

485
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,719
So, she has gone
to apologize to His Majesty.

486
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,800
Then you don’t need to go today.

487
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,199
How stupid you are!

488
00:31:10,975 --> 00:31:11,880
Why did she think

489
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,359
she could persuade His Majesty?

490
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,439
Get me up.

491
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,680
Let’s go to Jincheng Palace.

492
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,560
What if she annoys His Majesty?

493
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,760
What if I get her implicated?

494
00:31:20,925 --> 00:31:22,079
Even if we’re in trouble,

495
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,400
neither Bizi nor I will be scared.

496
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,199
Don’t force yourself, Your Highness.

497
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:26,079
Your Highness,

498
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:27,479
His Majesty has come.

499
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,680
How impolite you are!

500
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,640
Come out and welcome His Majesty!

501
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,439
Greetings, Your Majesty.

502
00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:46,735
You’re still alive?

503
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,719
Now that you can still crawl,

504
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:54,025
why did I fail to summon you?

505
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,319
I’m sorry, Your Majesty.

506
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,479
I think you’ve forgotten the rules
you just learned.

507
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:02,839
Go out and kneel for four hours

508
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,450
and reflect on yourself.

509
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:05,800
Your Majesty,

510
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,959
Her Highness can get off the bed now.

511
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,839
But she’s too weak to be tortured.

512
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,839
When you torture her like this,

513
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,319
even if she survives today,

514
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:14,880
she’ll die tomorrow.

515
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:16,119
Bihong.

516
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,359
Please show some mercy, Your Majesty.

517
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:24,600
Consort Shurong,

518
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,280
do you also think

519
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:33,000
I’m a heartless man?

520
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,000
I made a mistake first.

521
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:43,719
I’m willing to take the punishment.

522
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,319
What...?

523
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:54,199
Your Majesty,

524
00:32:54,525 --> 00:32:55,160
she...

525
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:09,880
Go.

526
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,839
Go get a physician!

527
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,650
Oh.

528
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,479
Go get the physician.

529
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:13,160
Be quick!

530
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,200
How’s she?

531
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:27,479
Every day, Her Highness takes
the contraceptive decoction.

532
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,839
Her body is against the decoction.

533
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:31,319
So, she’s sick of coldness.

534
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,599
When it comes on,

535
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,439
I’m afraid
she’ll have a severe bellyache

536
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,839
and that’s unbearable.

537
00:33:36,325 --> 00:33:37,800
It’s already hard for her

538
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,079
to bear with it up to today.

539
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,400
If she’s so sick,

540
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:44,359
why didn’t you tell me earlier?

541
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,250
Don’t be angry, Your Majesty.

542
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,239
Physicians asked about her condition,

543
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,800
but Her Highness said she was all right.

544
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,520
I also...

545
00:33:57,225 --> 00:33:59,920
Now, she has to be nursed gradually

546
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,319
to get rid of the coldness in her body.

547
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,199
We’ll come here every day

548
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:07,119
and give her treatment.

549
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:07,719
All right, then.

550
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,320
Go write a prescription.

551
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:11,679
Yes, Your Majesty.

552
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:14,840
I’ll go write a prescription
for the decoction.

553
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,000
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

554
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,239
You’re awake?

555
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:30,239
Where does it still hurt?

556
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:34,719
The decoction indeed worked.

557
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:37,199
His Majesty has left?

558
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,399
Yes.

559
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:39,875
You passed out

560
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,120
from the pain.

561
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,080
His Majesty looked terrible

562
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,439
and left then.

563
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,925
What decoction did I take?

564
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:52,479
Physician Li came

565
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,320
and prescribed
some nutritious decoction.

566
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:56,439
It’s beneficial, anyway.

567
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,439
If we knew it,

568
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,399
we should have

569
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:00,800
told His Majesty the truth earlier.

570
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:07,800
I made another bowl of decoction.

571
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,800
Would you like to have some?

572
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:11,719
Put it there.

573
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,761
I want some peace alone.

574
00:36:20,775 --> 00:36:22,520
I’m quite upset now.

575
00:36:24,275 --> 00:36:25,840
You may leave me alone.

576
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,600
It’s wrong here.

577
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:40,275
Before you take the next step,

578
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:41,959
think about the direction
of the previous one,

579
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,840
and then it won’t go wrong.

580
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,080
Yes.

581
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,320
Manager,

582
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,239
it’s been days

583
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,320
since His Majesty made you Manager.

584
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,280
But you still live with embroiderers.

585
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,239
Others don’t know that you aren’t picky

586
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,040
and they may think
we take poor care of you.

587
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,600
It’s a sunny day today.

588
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:59,959
Why don’t we

589
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,719
clean your room up

590
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,159
so that you can move in?

591
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,520
Let’s just do it today.

592
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,399
I’ll take some girls
to get the room straight.

593
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,399
Don’t.

594
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,239
I’m very familiar with everything

595
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,560
in the room of the previous manager.

596
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
If you change something,

597
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:14,879
it’ll take me a lot of time
to get used to it.

598
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,360
I can’t see things now.

599
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,560
All you need to do

600
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,399
is to bring my daily essentials
to that room.

601
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,760
For the rest of the things,

602
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,639
I’ll use what the previous manager left.

603
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,360
Yes.

604
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,080
Considering it’s a sunny day,

605
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,040
I’ll take your quilts out

606
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
and air them.

607
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,785
Oh.

608
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,280
Here’s another thing.

609
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,840
Maids from Yu’an Palace

610
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,120
brought Consort Shurong’s rabbit here

611
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,919
the day before yesterday.

612
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,239
They said you agreed on that.

613
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,320
Yes, I knew that.

614
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,439
Miss Bizi who serves Consort Shurong

615
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:40,639
told me about it.

616
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,679
Fine, then.

617
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,439
I’ll then raise the rabbit

618
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:44,439
together with Xiaobai.

619
00:38:57,879 --> 00:38:58,639
Be careful.

620
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:02,425
Put these things on the table.

621
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:03,280
Yes.

622
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,719
Put these on the bed.

623
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,159
Manager,

624
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,439
please be seated.

625
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,950
Leave us.

626
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,239
Yes.

627
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,639
Manager,

628
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,719
in this room,

629
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,879
nothing has been changed.

630
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,760
We only swept the floor

631
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,439
and cleaned the furniture.

632
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,120
The quilts are on your bed.

633
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:42,919
Very good.

634
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,840
Aunt Su,

635
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,439
go take a rest.

636
00:39:47,775 --> 00:39:49,399
I want some peace alone.

637
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:50,560
If you need anything,

638
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,280
let me know.

639
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:01,320
Let me look at you.

640
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,120
You’ve grown up.

641
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,560
I will

642
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,479
stay with you

643
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:06,959
and serve you.

644
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:10,800
Aunt,

645
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,120
I’ll find out the murderer

646
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,201
who killed you
and harmed the Fabric Office.

647
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,439
From this day on,

648
00:40:23,225 --> 00:40:24,785
I’ll live in this room.

649
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:30,024
If you can feel it in heaven,

650
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,880
please protect me.

651
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,000
Hanbei is in peace today.

652
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,560
Everything is all right.

653
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,360
The Left Tribe of Huku has been
out of Huangquan Pass.

654
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,600
These are messages to Aunt

655
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,080
from the spies

656
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,840
that are planted in Hanzhou.

657
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,639
Why does she keep these messages

658
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:28,080
in this place?

659
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,919
The prisoner is a girl.

660
00:41:41,525 --> 00:41:44,879
Fang Haishi is Fang Jianming’s lover

661
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,679
as well as his informer in Lanzi.

662
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:24,919
Master.

663
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:25,800
Here we are.

664
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:29,360
Get off the carriage.

665
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,625
Mm.

666
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:48,919
You are...?

667
00:43:03,925 --> 00:43:04,760
Mother.

668
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,325
You’re Haishi?

669
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,639
Mother.

670
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,919
Haishi!

671
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,800
Haishi.

672
00:43:22,025 --> 00:43:23,824
I miss you so much!

673
00:43:27,325 --> 00:43:29,600
You’ve grown up.

674
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,639
Get up and let me have a look.

675
00:43:42,275 --> 00:43:44,040
If we met on the street,

676
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,640
I wouldn’t even recognize you.

677
00:43:47,575 --> 00:43:48,520
Mother,

678
00:43:49,525 --> 00:43:50,800
over so many years,

679
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:52,959
sorry to have you live a hard life.

680
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:03,159
Mother,

681
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,399
this is my friend in the army.

682
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,840
He’s Fang Jianming.

683
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,159
He’s your friend?

684
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,000
Come on.

685
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Come in, please.

686
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,679
Come in and take a seat.

687
00:44:17,439 --> 00:44:18,360
Haishi,

688
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:21,560
let me look at you.

689
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,560
Mother.

690
00:44:25,675 --> 00:44:26,200
Mm.

691
00:44:26,479 --> 00:44:27,159
I’ve been

692
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:28,525
sending gold to you, haven’t I?

693
00:44:29,175 --> 00:44:31,040
Why not do less rough work?

694
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:32,239
Look.

695
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:33,439
Look at your hands.

696
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,679
You’ve given me enough money.

697
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,959
Not only you,

698
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,000
but some people from the capital

699
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,439
also send me a lot of money regularly.

700
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,520
I can even afford a big house.

701
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,959
But I always want to keep myself busy.

702
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:46,719
After you left,

703
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:48,879
some people punished
those ruthless officials.

704
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,639
Villagers all said that

705
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,719
those people

706
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:53,639
settled us down

707
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:55,000
simply for your sake.

708
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:57,080
Everyone takes good care of me.

709
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,639
It’s their duty.

710
00:45:00,919 --> 00:45:02,320
You have a good daughter.

711
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,719
Why does he know

712
00:45:09,879 --> 00:45:12,120
you are a girl?

713
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,750
We grew up together.

714
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:23,825
Mm.

715
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:25,925
Is that true?

716
00:45:32,919 --> 00:45:33,525
Yes.

717
00:45:34,439 --> 00:45:35,959
We grew up together.

718
00:45:39,925 --> 00:45:41,320
You can call me Jianming.

719
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:45,525
Oh.

720
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:47,320
Jianming,

721
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,760
I have something to ask you.

722
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,239
Don’t worry.

723
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,600
I’ll answer all your questions

724
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
according to facts.

725
00:45:57,399 --> 00:45:58,479
Are your parents alive?

726
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:00,560
How many siblings do you have?

727
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,719
Are you firstborn?

728
00:46:01,879 --> 00:46:03,879
What does your family do for a living?

729
00:46:03,879 --> 00:46:04,600
Mother.

730
00:46:04,919 --> 00:46:05,520
It’s okay.

731
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,040
My father was a military officer.

732
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:13,879
But my parents passed away long ago.

733
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,600
I sought refuge

734
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,719
with an elder brother
who was a family friend.

735
00:46:17,075 --> 00:46:18,399
I worked in the capital

736
00:46:18,919 --> 00:46:19,679
and then joined the army.

737
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,280
Now, I’m a military officer

738
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:23,760
and I don’t have

739
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,639
any siblings.

740
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:31,080
You match each other in other aspects,

741
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,479
but you have a better family background.

742
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,760
Mother, what...?

743
00:46:34,879 --> 00:46:36,080
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

744
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:37,239
Don’t be shy.

745
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:37,879
I...

746
00:46:39,025 --> 00:46:39,800
Jianming,

747
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,040
I’ll go make lunch for you.

748
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:43,239
All right.
