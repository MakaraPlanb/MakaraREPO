Love at Night
EP20

2
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:36,400
Thank you.

3
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,279
Lost patience?

4
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:43,720
You must be anxious, too.

5
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,800
Nobody knows Mr. Mo better than me.

6
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,440
I can see clearly

7
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:51,559
his affection towards you.

8
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,919
But don't worry.

9
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,559
I'll keep it to myself

10
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,599
of the relationship between you and him.

11
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,720
Thank you.

12
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Even you can feel his affections towards me.

13
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,680
I shouldn't worry then?

14
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,319
But you yourself

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,879
is still seeking certain answers.

16
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,199
You must feel anxious, right?

17
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,559
Don't make fun of me, Director Xu.

18
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,080
I know exactly what level I am.

19
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,279
I also know

20
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,240
the gap between me and her.

21
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,199
The answer, positive or negative, doesn't matter.

22
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:23,080
You know what,

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,880
I used to think likewise,

24
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,039
hesitating because of the gaps between two lovers.

25
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,880
But there's only regrets

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
left if you missed it.

27
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,839
Love takes courage,

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,559
Or you would just miss it.

29
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,759
There is only one ship left

30
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,240
to take us back.

31
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:00,800
But,

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,360
it is pretty nice to stay here.

33
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,679
The scenery is beautiful.

34
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:04,720
Besides,

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,119
we can continue our date.

36
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,800
Director Xu

37
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,479
I have just retired from a business meal.

38
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,800
I'm so tired right now.

39
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,399
Sorry I cannot keep you company.

40
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,360
Are you mad at me because I asked you to

41
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,440
have a meal with Lin Siyu?

42
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,160
I'm using stalling tactics.

43
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,399
Believe me.

44
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,039
Stalling tactics?

45
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,960
So, Director Xu, tell me

46
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,559
Do you regard me as a chess piece

47
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,119
or a tactic?

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,320
It's her last wish.

49
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,559
And I asked you to do it

50
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:41,160
because I totally trust you.

51
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,919
Director Xu, you are so generous

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,919
and never feel jealous.

53
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,360
It seems that

54
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,080
you have me under control, right?

55
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,000
Kind of.

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,679
Kind of?

57
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,440
Let's see sunrise tomorrow.

58
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,160
I heard that the sunrise here is very famous.

59
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,320
No.

60
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,399
No.

61
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,239
Come on.

62
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,839
I heard that the sunrise here is so beautiful.

63
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,920
What a precious opportunity.

64
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,640
Just go with me.

65
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,519
No.

66
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,880
I'll regard it as a yes.

67
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,880
Kiss me, then I'll go.

68
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,119
Kiss me, then I'll go.

69
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,799
How about now?

70
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,239
Not enough.

71
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,519
Sweet lazy-in-bed, wake up.

72
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,519
Let me sleep more.

73
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,679
It's already 5 o'clock.

74
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,679
Don't sleep!

75
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,519
Five o'clock is too early!

76
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,799
Who said yesterday that we were going to see sunrise?

77
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:21,079
Who said yesterday that we were going to see sunrise?

78
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,640
Who said that?

79
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,399
Not me, anyway.

80
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,720
Unless...

81
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,519
Hug me.

82
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,200
Come on. Hug.

83
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,720
Come on.

84
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,079
Get up.

85
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:41,640
Let's go.

86
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,519
How lucky we are.

87
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,119
I thought we were going to miss it.

88
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:50,399
To be honest,

89
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,920
this is my first time to see sunrise in my whole life.

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I have my long-cherished wish come true.

91
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,600
Long-cherished?

92
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:00,040
What wish?

93
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,440
To see sunrise with my most important person.

94
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:04,880
So, Director Xu,

95
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,679
who was your most important person in the past?

96
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,440
Fang Qi.

97
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,399
It seems that you are so curious about

98
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,399
my life in the past.

99
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:20,640
From now on,

100
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,480
that person can only be me.

101
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,040
Hello.

102
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:40,760
This Yunhai Tech

103
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,679
was always reluctant.

104
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,000
Why they suddenly agreed to cooperate?

105
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,600
I also felt strange when I heard the information.

106
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,040
Mr. Wang has put obstacles in the way several times.

107
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,399
They were merely deliberately making trouble and holding back.

108
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:54,320
All of a sudden, they accepted our conditions.

109
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,760
However,

110
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
I have inspected their data and

111
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,200
brief reports carefully.

112
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,720
There is no problem in there.

113
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,839
Negotiate prices once more.

114
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,959
Find out what they are up to.

115
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,440
Okay.

116
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,799
I will play it safe.

117
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:08,040
But the knottiest problem

118
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,079
is on Taikang Biological Project.

119
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,519
What's your plan?

120
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,839
We cannot depend on Fengtang Capital anymore.

121
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:16,640
If we cannot depend on others,

122
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,600
we can only collect evidences by ourselves.

123
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,679
What requirements did Tang Xi make?

124
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,679
You are not even willing to think about it.

125
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,679
There's no need to think about.

126
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,239
We should still take samples by ourselves.

127
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,480
Take the oldest approach.

128
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,480
Go to the retail stores who cooperates with Taikang

129
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,799
and check the data one by one.

130
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,559
We've only got a few days

131
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,960
to collect and collate the data.

132
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,559
It is impossible to get anything evident.

133
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,840
Data check is not the point.

134
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,559
The point is to spread out the information that

135
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,960
we doubt the counterfeit of Taikang Biology.

136
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:46,919
Got it.

137
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,599
Once they hear the message, they must panic.

138
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:49,400
Once they panic,

139
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,440
they will do something.

140
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,719
Not only Taikang,

141
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,119
but also those who

142
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,239
want to gain benefits from it.

143
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Do you mean that

144
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,719
it's not only targeted towards Taikang?

145
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,159
Wait and see.

146
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,479
They are coming for me.

147
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,479
Fengtang hasn't responded at all.

148
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,559
It seems that Mo Lingze

149
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,119
also didn't buy a vowel.

150
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,960
Taikang is such a hot potato.

151
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,520
All Fengtang needs to do is to evaluate the risk,

152
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,400
and they may not get mixed up with the mess.

153
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,359
We will see when our Mr. Mo

154
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:26,400
will drop the hot potato

155
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,919
in the end.

156
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,359
I'll let him understand that

157
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,239
one should never touch anything

158
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,599
that does not belong to him.

159
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,719
Keep an eye on Taikang Biology.

160
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,919
It's not my business if the cat is out of the bag.

161
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,080
Lawyer Fan lays his plan carefully.

162
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,919
Naturally, I should not drop the ball at the last minute.

163
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,960
Don't worry.

164
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,960
After all, our cooperation will last long.

165
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:53,559
It's hard to say.

166
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:56,520
Maybe next time, we will be enemies.

167
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,559
It's not right.

168
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:59,599
You should use scarlet,

169
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,840
not vermilion.

170
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,679
What scarlet?

171
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:03,919
Let me tell you.

172
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,559
Nobody can tell the difference,

173
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,719
so just use some color randomly.

174
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:08,960
No, there's a big difference.

175
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,159
Check this out

176
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,840
The style of the whole drawing should be bright.

177
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,760
And suddenly an inconsistent color appears,

178
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,919
disrupting the style of the whole drawing.

179
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,280
So abrupt!

180
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,599
Oh, come on.

181
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,719
Do you really think you are painting murals in the Versailles?

182
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,080
Get over yourself.

183
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,000
We are professional, too.

184
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,440
Don't show off those technical terms.

185
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,719
Bro, you know so much about drawing.

186
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,200
Did you graduate from a top university?

187
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:35,559
Not a top one.

188
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,359
I used to study in National School of Fine Arts

189
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,719
for a couple of years in Paris.

190
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,080
Don't get cocky, boy.

191
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,080
School of Arts, Paris.

192
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,359
And then you copy murals here?

193
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,400
You funny indeed!

194
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,080
He's not lying.

195
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,080
And there's no need to lie to you.

196
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,280
But it's true that he shouldn't have been here.

197
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:02,479
Keep on working.

198
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,640
Fang Qi, why are you here?

199
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,479
No wonder Mr. Wang

200
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,840
has done a U-turn.

201
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Because The Snail Maiden [Chinese myths] is helping me silently.

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,960
Who allows you to meddle in my affairs?

203
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,039
Who allows you to help me get the project

204
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,039
at the expense of your time and dignity?

205
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:24,239
No.

206
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:25,000
Fang Qi.

207
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,479
I didn't mean to meddle in your affairs.

208
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:28,239
I just...

209
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,039
I just thought

210
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,919
it was the best of both worlds.

211
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,200
And I didn't suffer from injustice at all.

212
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,000
What a good chance to practice.

213
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,280
Don't get mad at me.

214
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,119
Don't quit the project.

215
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,520
Who told you I need this project?

216
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:46,479
I heard it in the park that day.

217
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,599
Follow me.

218
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,840
What do you mean?

219
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,159
Didn't you tell me it was for free?

220
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,440
Are you going to rob me?

221
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,880
It's you who will

222
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:21,280
rob me!

223
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,880
We have an appointment before.

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,200
Did you sign a contract?

225
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,559
No.

226
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,119
There you go.

227
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,520
What do you mean?

228
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,559
Get some labors to pull down the wall.

229
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,080
You must be out of your mind.

230
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,799
Don't worry. I only need the painting on the wall.

231
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,280
I'll compensate your loss of bricks.

232
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,280
You...

233
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,400
Fang Qi

234
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,919
Fang Qi

235
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:06,840
I know I did a wrong thing this time.

236
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,080
I didn't take everything into consideration.

237
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,840
I made you angry.

238
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,640
Could you please relax?

239
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:11,640
Next time...

240
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,080
No, there's definitely no next time.

241
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:14,640
Well...

242
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,440
Don't, don't be mad at me.

243
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,840
Just forgive me this time, okay?

244
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,960
I did it

245
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
to help you.

246
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:22,840
Well, just forgive me this time.

247
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:24,119
Please...

248
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,200
Fang Qi

249
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,239
I have had a crush on you

250
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,880
I really want to

251
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:58,840
be with you for the rest of my life.

252
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,359
If you have anything to deal with

253
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:19,559
or any troubles, I'll be always there for you.

254
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,479
True love is fulfillment, not possession.

255
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:51,760
So,

256
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,520
I'm willing to step back.

257
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,159
Chasing a car on bike.

258
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,200
Are you a fool?

259
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:39,760
Fang Qi, I just want to tell you.

260
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:42,159
I did this,

261
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,719
because I wanted to do something for you.

262
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:48,200
I know

263
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,880
you really care about the case.

264
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,960
But it happened that I offended Mr. Wang.

265
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,880
I also know

266
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,039
you don't like someone like me.

267
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,080
I have no money, and I'm not mature enough.

268
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,919
I just don't want to be your burden.

269
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,000
I want to do my best to make your life easier.

270
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,719
Don't you dream of holding an art exhibition in Pompidou?

271
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,880
Don't do those

272
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,359
thankless tasks.

273
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,119
Holding an art exhibition is my dream.

274
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,160
But I also have another dream,

275
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,880
which is to let you live a better life

276
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,239
because of me.

277
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:51,839
What?

278
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,400
You don't like it?

279
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,040
Forget it

280
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:15,880
Wang Ji

281
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:18,040
Mr. Mo

282
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:18,920
What are you doing?

283
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,680
A lady in the room wants to talk to you.

284
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:22,959
I couldn't stop her.

285
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:27,959
Dismissed.

286
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,920
Let's go. Let's go.

287
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:41,479
You didn't respond my SMS,

288
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,839
so I have to look for you by myself.

289
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,959
Miss Tang is here without invitation.

290
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,560
I'm sure you've figured it out.

291
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,439
Can't I come here because I care about you?

292
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:54,479
Miss Tang, if you come here for a business,

293
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,439
we can talk.

294
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:56,680
If not,

295
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,439
sorry I cannot keep you company.

296
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,079
Can I guess the so-called business

297
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:02,920
for you, Mr. Mo?

298
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,160
More than 100 stores.

299
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,959
Even though you check them for a week

300
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:09,040
for 24 hours every day,

301
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,479
you won't get what you want.

302
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,439
Miss Tang

303
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,040
If you keep on entangling with me,

304
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,479
you will also not get what you want.

305
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,880
Please go back.

306
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,119
We haven't seen each other for so long.

307
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,479
Is it necessary to drive me away in such a hurry?

308
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:33,319
I only care about the present and the future at the moment.

309
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,800
I don't want to waste time in talking about the old days.

310
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:38,199
Is there any difference between the past and the present?

311
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,400
You used to like drinking

312
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,479
Geisha coffee,

313
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,199
and you still do right now.

314
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,040
It's Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee.

315
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,680
How about the wine?

316
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,640
I remember when you couldn't sleep well,

317
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,479
you would have a sip of it.

318
00:19:58,199 --> 00:19:59,079
Excuse me.

319
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,479
We don't drink wine during working time.

320
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,719
You're right.

321
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,839
After all, in wine there's truth.

322
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:09,680
It's easy to expose one's weak point.

323
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,400
Just like Mr. Wu from Taikang Biology.

324
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,319
What are you looking at?

325
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,479
There's an unfamiliar lady in there,

326
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,719
saying that she would talk to Mr. Mo about the business.

327
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,839
Actually, I prepared a gift for you.

328
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,920
I think this tie really fits

329
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,719
the current Mr. Mo.

330
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,439
Let me help you to try it on.

331
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,719
What's the matter?

332
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:51,280
Shangger Capital doesn't welcome idlers.

333
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,160
Mr. Mo, am I an idler?

334
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:55,959
I think you should really

335
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,880
discipline your employees.

336
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,839
Didn't you hear what she said?

337
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,359
Please leave.

338
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,040
Alright. My gift has been given to you anyway.

339
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:09,439
But Mr. Mo, you will

340
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,800
give me a present back soon.

341
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:25,719
Sorry for disturbing.

342
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:26,719
It's okay. It's okay.

343
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,680
You should change a new folder.

344
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:37,719
Thank you.

345
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:38,719
You're welcome.

346
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:52,079
Mr. Mo, it's not working time right now.

347
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:53,400
I want to have a word with you

348
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,719
as the best friend 

349
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:55,640
of Xu Qingyou.

350
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,400
No way.

351
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,400
I can't stand it anymore!

352
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,760
I have to speak it out.

353
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,119
I've done some research

354
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,439
Tang Xi is very cunning.

355
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,280
She hooked up the financial baron Feng Fei.

356
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,400
They got married after dating for only a few months.

357
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,599
And her career just soared as if riding a rocket.

358
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,359
She gained fame and fortune in a very short period.

359
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,079
After marriage, Feng Fei established Fengtang Capital for her.

360
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,880
After no more than three years,

361
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,359
she divorced with him,

362
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,079
and took the whole Fengtang Capital.

363
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,079
I know everything about it.

364
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,640
I also know she's your ex-girlfriend.

365
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,280
So what?

366
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,160
Xu Qingyou is innocent and straightforward.

367
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,680
She is sharp-tongued but tender-hearted.

368
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:38,160
She's definitely not your ex-girlfriend's match.

369
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,520
If you do anything wrong to her,

370
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,000
upsetting her,

371
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,119
I would never let you run away

372
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,160
Even though you're my boss.

373
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,239
Don't worry.

374
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,640
I won't give you the chance.

375
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,000
That's good.

376
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,839
Have you come off duty?

377
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:05,839
I need to work overtime.

378
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,959
I'll make it up for you tomorrow night.

379
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:07,920
Remember to go to the bar.

380
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:25,400
No way. No way.

381
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,359
She doesn't have an affection on you.

382
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:32,040
She's just playing with you.

383
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:33,479
She likes me.

384
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:34,880
So abusing!

385
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,199
I'm gonna mail a razor blade to the writer!

386
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,040
She kissed me yesterday.

387
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,520
Did Fang Qi kiss you?

388
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:47,520
So I will date her in a while.

389
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,319
I am so sad today.

390
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:53,079
The comic book ends with a sad story.

391
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,239
Can't you stay here to accompany me?

392
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,760
No.

393
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,839
My time is left for my girlfriend.

394
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,920
A kiss doesn't mean anything.

395
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,439
Why hasn't she texted you?

396
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,959
How do you know? We made an appointment today.

397
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:08,880
A date tonight

398
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,760
She must be dressing herself up right now.

399
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,560
Trying to be formal.

400
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:16,920
Take it to my room for me.

401
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,839
Bye-bye.

402
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,479
You... You...

403
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,719
You really won't stay here to accompany me.

404
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,640
Dates before mates!

405
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,160
Sa

406
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,239
Why did you come back so early?

407
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,439
Where's Lingze?

408
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,640
He's in the backstage.

409
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,160
Come here.

410
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,959
The seat is specially reserved for you.

411
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,719
For me? So luxurious!

412
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,760
That guy

413
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,000
exchanged it with dozens of free shows.

414
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,800
Come here. Have a seat.

415
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,079
I'll get you a tasty mixed drink.

416
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:52,839
Okay.

417
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:13,000
We have formulas to restore the Rubik's cube.

418
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,800
It's you! Come here for a show?

419
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:18,839
Yeah.

420
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:19,920
I come here to watch a show

421
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,560
performed by one who means a lot to me.

422
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,599
Me, too.

423
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,959
But I'm not really good at it.

424
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:27,479
It there any know-how?

425
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:27,680
You see.

426
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,719
We should restore the

427
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:30,280
white cross-shaped cubes in the bottom.

428
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,400
No. I've told you.

429
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,040
One day. Just for one day.

430
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:35,839
See?

431
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,719
So marvelous!

432
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:37,520
Just so easy!

433
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,400
It really doesn't work.

434
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,040
Only one day?

435
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,920
Why did you come back?

436
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,199
Haven't you abandoned the home?

437
00:25:58,479 --> 00:25:59,000
Bobo

438
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:03,839
Do I have to report if I

439
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,079
go to my own base camp?

440
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,319
We don't welcome you.

441
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,319
Having been waiting for a long?

442
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,800
No. I just came here.

443
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,359
Let me introduce her to you.

444
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,880
This is a family member of our band.

445
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:20,800
Xu Qingyou

446
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:21,920
Hello, sister-in-law.

447
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,280
A family member.

448
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,119
Good!

449
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,959
Hello!

450
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,640
Qingqing Zi Jin, Youyou Wo Xin (a Chinese poem by Cao Mengde).

451
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,239
What a good name!

452
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,319
Let me introduce myself. I'm Tang Xi.

453
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,800
Hello.

454
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,880
Actually, it was me who

455
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,520
invited Lingze to the band.

456
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,920
We were both pretty young, right?

457
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:47,439
I've never expected Lingze

458
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,119
still leads the band

459
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,239
up to now.

460
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:52,160
So, thank you for

461
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,599
taking care of him when I was absent.

462
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,040
It's me who should thank you.

463
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,599
Before my presence,

464
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,599
thank you for protecting him so well.

465
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,839
Right?

466
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,359
Wait me here for a while.

467
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,719
I'll get you a present.

468
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,479
Have a seat.

469
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:24,079
You texted me 15 messages,

470
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,680
just to play this?

471
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,079
Qiqi

472
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:30,680
To thank you for your accompany,

473
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,520
I want to give you a present.

474
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:42,959
Ten more please.

475
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
Don't toss anymore.

476
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,839
Don't play anymore, okay?

477
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,479
No.

478
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,000
Qiqi

479
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,160
I just feel that the King Kong

480
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,439
looks a little bit like you.

481
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,040
I want to put it in your bed.

482
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,880
It is you who looks like King Kong!

483
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,359
Give me that. Let me have a try.

484
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,479
Am I marvelous or not?

485
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,239
Here you are.

486
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,719
I think this King Kong

487
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:23,359
really looks like you.

488
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,599
It's yours now.

489
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,119
Put it in your bedroom to guard you.

490
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:27,920
Here's a more important thing.

491
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:31,359
Don't call me Qiqi.

492
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,199
I'm allergic to it, understand?

493
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,239
The first song today

494
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,719
is given to a special audience.

495
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,479
She's my girlfriend.

496
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,760
She's really cute.

497
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,400
But it's also easy for her to be jealous.

498
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,439
So the first song must be given to her.

499
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:30,680
Thank you.

500
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:35,079
Bravo!

501
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,079
Another song! Another song!

502
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,119
Tang Xi. You're Tang Xi.

503
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,319
Do you still remember me?

504
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,079
I always came to watch your concert.

505
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,880
I was the one with a ponytail. I...

506
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,520
I know you.

507
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,959
Were you always in the first row?

508
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,040
Yes! My God!

509
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:51,439
I've never expected that you two

510
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:53,040
reunion in my lifetime

511
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:54,800
Momo has sung a song today.

512
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,599
Tang Xi, aren't you going to sing a song later?

513
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:57,760
I...

514
00:30:59,119 --> 00:30:59,760
Many of us are your fans

515
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,319
who follow you all these years

516
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,959
You dismissed your band overnight.

517
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,719
We were very sad at that time.

518
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,560
Just do us a favor, okay?

519
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,719
Sing a song!

520
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:20,319
Sing! Sing! Sing!

521
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,560
I know the band

522
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,760
has owed you a show a few years ago.

523
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:34,839
We will make it up for you tonight,

524
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,280
okay?

525
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,319
Okay!

526
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,239
It's hard to refuse your proposal today.

527
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,479
Thank you.

528
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,760
Thank those who have liked our band

529
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,160
for over a decade.

530
00:31:58,199 --> 00:31:59,520
I want to sing a song.

531
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,359
The song was written by

532
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,400
a very significant person in my life

533
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,640
for me.

534
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,479
Over the past decade,

535
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:09,160
I have dared not sing the song.

536
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,199
Because once the melody is on,

537
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:12,920
Countless memories from old days

538
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:14,760
will come.

539
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,800
But today,

540
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,560
I want to sing the song for him.

541
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:54,719
Actually, it was me who

542
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:56,400
invited Lingze to the band.

543
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,160
We were both pretty young.

544
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,400
I've never expected Lingze

545
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,040
still leads the band

546
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,160
after so many years.

547
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:54,520
The song was written by

548
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:57,839
a very significant person in my life for me.
