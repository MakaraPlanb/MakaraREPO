Our Secret
EP18

2
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,710
President, is Xing Lufei here?

3
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,990
The costume sector has been urging us.

4
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,200
Wait a second.

5
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,160
I'll give her a call.

6
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,200
Okay.

7
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,080
What's the rush? Here I am.

8
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,560
It's great to have you, Xing.

9
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,440
How's the costume going?

10
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,950
Almost done. There are still two sets to go.

11
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,710
Have a look at this form, please.

12
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,910
Is there any part to be finished?

13
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,560
Xing, where did you get these chocolates?

14
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,110
They are from Zhou Siyue.

15
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,350
Song Ziqi

16
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,880
I thought you said you'd

17
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,960
rather be dead than eat my food.

18
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,710
Zhou Siyue

19
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,600
Why did you give the chocolates to her?

20
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,440
Xing Lufei took them herself.

21
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
No more excuses.

22
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,470
Just tell me if you are not that into me.

23
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,079
Why did you do this to me?

24
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,750
Honestly,

25
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,470
you also don't support me to get in

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,320
the scientific research group, right?

27
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,350
Right.

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,680
You don't care about it at all.

29
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,080
You know clearly the only reason I choose

30
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,270
computer department and get in the group

31
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
is for you.

32
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,160
I do all these to make us a better future.

33
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
I try to get close to you.

34
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,750
I don't care whether it fits me or not.

35
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,630
Or whether I'm good at it or not.

36
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,270
But I realized that

37
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,400
you haven't even taken any actions to be with me.

38
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,400
Because it matters to me whether it fits you or not

39
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,630
and whether you're good at it nor not.

40
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,040
Ding Xian

41
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,520
I told you already

42
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,800
the day you had the interview for the research group.

43
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,960
I hope you could think about yourself clearly

44
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,600
before you make every decision,

45
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,550
But not thinking about me all the time.

46
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,710
Think clearly about what?

47
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,350
I don't understand. I really don't.

48
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,320
You keep saying they are all my decisions.

49
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
What about you?

50
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,079
Don't you have a crush on me at all?

51
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,110
Does the three years' memory

52
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,190
mean nothing to you?

53
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,710
I see.

54
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,430
I'll never come to you again.

55
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,839
Ding Xian

56
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,150
Aren't you going to explain it to her?

57
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,120
Maybe leaving me is the only way for her

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,750
to think about herself more.

59
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,840
You are causing troubles for yourself.

60
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,750
Cancel the meeting with the client at 8 p.m. tonight for me.

61
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,840
I've got an emergency.

62
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,080
Xianxian

63
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,190
What a coincidence.

64
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,750
Su

65
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
What are you doing here?

66
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,800
I have a meeting with a client nearby.

67
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,470
Let me give you a ride.

68
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,280
Why are you still outside at this hour of night?

69
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,520
I feel bored.

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,400
I wanna take a bus,

71
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,430
but I have nowhere to go.

72
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,080
Su

73
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,750
Why are you in a business suit?

74
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,150
I could hardly recognize you.

75
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,400
I'm in a start-up now.

76
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,190
It's inevitable to meet

77
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,560
clients anytime.

78
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,150
So to dress formally is required.

79
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,630
You have no time for dating, I suppose,

80
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,030
since you are so busy.

81
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,310
What's wrong?

82
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
Nothing, the red light.

83
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,080
I don't have a girlfriend.

84
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,520
So there's no need to worry about

85
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
how to balance work and life.

86
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,430
Xianxian

87
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,630
Would you like to watch the art exhibition

88
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,680
you liked before?

89
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,240
Right now?

90
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,240
You are much fascinated.

91
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,720
Seemingly,

92
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,590
I feel much relaxed only

93
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,030
in the art exhibition.

94
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,430
I remember you were quite good at drawing.

95
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,960
Are you still drawing?

96
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,400
I joined the Comics Club in school.

97
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,520
I draw when the club holds the activity.

98
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,150
I think you can keep it up.

99
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,870
Don't waste your talent.

100
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,310
But

101
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,120
I seem to barely recognize myself.

102
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,030
Did something happen

103
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,430
to you today?

104
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,190
You seem quite upset.

105
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,630
Never mind.

106
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,310
It's okay if you don't want to talk about it.

107
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
People always get confused.

108
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,110
It's okay to be not like yourself

109
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
or to make comprises for life.

110
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,750
You'll finally find your own way.

111
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,990
What important is that

112
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,110
never forget why you started.

113
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,190
Besides,

114
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,430
you don't need to follow anyone.

115
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,110
Where's Ding Xian?

116
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,360
She asked for a sick leave.

117
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,550
She doesn't feel well.

118
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,840
Why does she ask for a leave frequently?

119
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
She may get fired by Professor Ye if she keeps doing like that.

120
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,870
You are talking too much.

121
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Hello, dad.

122
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,360
Hey, Xianxian.

123
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,670
What have you been doing lately?

124
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,960
You haven't called us for a long time.

125
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,400
I got too busy lately for the school stuff.

126
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,870
Have you got a cold? Your voice sounds strange.

127
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,550
Got a cold?

128
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,550
Tell her to drink some water.

129
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,480
Did she wear too few clothes?

130
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,670
Go to the hospital if she doesn't feel well.

131
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,790
Do you hear your mom?

132
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Nuh...

133
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,400
I didn't catch a cold. Don't worry.

134
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,080
Is there anything wrong?

135
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,360
Tell daddy what happened.

136
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,230
You can't understand at all.

137
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,360
Xianxian

138
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,630
Listen to me.

139
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,430
Now it's the beginning of a new season.

140
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,630
You gotta wear more clothes to keep warm.

141
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,190
When you come back,

142
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,110
mommy will cook you some good meals.

143
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,310
Mom, I feel quite good.

144
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,160
Just don't worry.

145
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,790
I'm tied up.

146
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,400
I'll hang up.

147
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,480
No matter you choose the liberal arts or science subjects,

148
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,720
never mind others' opinions.

149
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,600
Just choose what you like

150
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,790
and what you're good at.

151
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,960
I'll be there to support you anyway.

152
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,520
What if I tell you

153
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,310
it was him who told Professor Ye

154
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,990
you're not right for scientific research?

155
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,230
I hope you could think yourself clearly

156
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,190
before you make any decisions.

157
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,400
But not thinking about me all the time.

158
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,670
You keep saying they are all my decisions.

159
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
What about you?

160
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,600
Don't you even have a crush on me at all?

161
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,400
Did I wake you up?

162
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,280
I'm sorry, Su.

163
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,400
I fell asleep.

164
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,430
Never mind. You look tired.

165
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,550
Get more rest.

166
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,080
I got nothing to do today.

167
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,870
No, thank you. Go ahead with your business.

168
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,550
I gotta go back to school.

169
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,160
Thank you.

170
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,670
Okay.

171
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,750
I'll never make you feel aggrieved again.

172
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,040
You get up early today.

173
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,230
Yeah.

174
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,360
You looked a bit down before.

175
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,080
Anything happened?

176
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,630
Nothing.

177
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,790
Thanks for your concern.

178
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,110
Never mind.

179
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,550
Today's weekend. Would you like to

180
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,400
have a hotpot with me?

181
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,630
No, thanks.

182
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,430
I'm gonna do my own business.

183
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Why are you still in bed?

184
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,960
I bought you breakfast.

185
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,630
Stop talking. I got a headache.

186
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,360
Just let me sleep for a while.

187
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,840
The second series of national broadcast gymnastics for middle school students:

188
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,190
The Times Are Calling.

189
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,110
Are you insane?

190
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,520
I got a terrible headache.

191
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,670
Why don't you allow me to have more rest?

192
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
Don't you do the housework when you live here?

193
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,160
What housework?

194
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,040
We're two losers in love.

195
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,990
Just let me sleep.

196
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,310
I'm not a loser as you.

197
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,360
You are such a drunkard.

198
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,480
Hello?

199
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,430
Zhou Siyue, it's me.

200
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,550
Kong Shadi?

201
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,280
What's the matter?

202
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,720
Is Song Ziqi at your place?

203
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,960
No.

204
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,750
I don't buy it.

205
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,400
Tell me to my face.

206
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,430
I'm waiting for you outside your school gate.

207
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,520
Come out now.

208
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,720
What?

209
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,990
Come out quickly.

210
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:10,870
I'm telling you.

211
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
I won't leave

212
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,960
until you come out.

213
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,920
Bye.

214
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,750
You are at my school...

215
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,600
What can I do now?

216
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,080
President

217
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,230
This is my portfolio for the competition of the publishers.

218
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,630
But it's overdue.

219
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,480
By the way,

220
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,110
do you know how to contact the chief editor?

221
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,280
Hello,

222
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,230
I come to visit your

223
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,870
chief editor, Sun Yuanxiang.

224
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,840
Have you made an appointment?

225
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,670
Sorry, no.

226
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,040
I'll make a call for you.

227
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,190
Thank you.

228
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,400
Shadi

229
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,600
Where is Song Ziqi on earth?

230
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,160
I have no idea.

231
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,160
How is that possible?

232
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,190
You are his best friend.

233
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,160
If you come to

234
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,600
me for this,

235
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,920
I gotta go then.

236
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,040
At least we have known each other for a dozen years.

237
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,960
You really don't like me this much?

238
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,190
Shadi, it's not about you.

239
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,080
Zhou Siyue

240
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,840
I'm asking you seriously.

241
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,910
Did Song Ziqi get kicked out of school?

242
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,550
I have known it all.

243
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,190
I went to his school.

244
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,359
He just got a disciplinary punishment and a one-year suspension.

245
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,150
You do know everything.

246
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,880
I have always treated you like my brother.

247
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,640
How could you do this to me?

248
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,030
Shadi

249
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,150
You've always been clinging to Song Ziqi.

250
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,550
From the kindergarten,

251
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,840
you did the same things as him.

252
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,910
Have you ever thought about that

253
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,310
it's your own life.

254
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,790
Why do you take him as your

255
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,390
goal and your direction?

256
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,960
You guys are the same,

257
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,790
saying that it's for our benefits.

258
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:56,910
Why do you always sit up high

259
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,360
in the leading position,

260
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,880
and decide everything?

261
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,510
You have no idea what

262
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,600
Song Ziqi means to me.

263
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,960
He broke up with me with no explanation.

264
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,430
What about my feelings?

265
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,550
Zhou Siyue, you don't understand.

266
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,600
Song Ziqi can't just disappear.

267
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What if Ding Xian disappears too,

268
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,960
leaving you forever?

269
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,880
Have you ever thought about it?

270
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,840
Wait a moment.

271
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,360
Okay.

272
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,760
Go ahead.

273
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,270
Thank you.

274
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,120
Have a seat, please.

275
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,550
Nice to meet you, Ms. Sun.

276
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,550
I'm Ding Xian from the Comics Club
of Huaqing University.

277
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,960
I know you.

278
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,640
Anything I can help you?

279
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,030
I wanna show you my drawings.

280
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,310
Tell me.

281
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,600
What do you need?

282
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,670
I want to

283
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,080
take part in your drawing competition.

284
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,960
But it has already passed

285
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,790
the deadline.

286
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,240
I know. So I come to ask if

287
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,960
there are any other ways?

288
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,150
How about

289
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,030
leaving your portfolio here.

290
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,390
If you haven't received any messages
till tomorrow,

291
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,150
you are out of chance.

292
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,960
Okay, thank you, Ms. Sun.

293
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,360
I'm expecting to hear from you.

294
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,760
Thanks.

295
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,840
Xianxian

296
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,120
Shadi

297
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,760
What took you so long?

298
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,080
I'm too busy lately.

299
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,360
Stay with me tonight.

300
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,670
But there will be a roll-call at eleven.

301
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,720
I gotta come back.

302
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,760
It's been a long time.

303
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,360
Don't you want to spend

304
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,190
a night of girls?

305
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,240
Alright. You beat me.

306
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,430
I went to the hospital to visit Zhou
a few days ago.

307
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,880
So

308
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,190
concentrate in your major.

309
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,640
Just come to me if

310
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,640
you need money.

311
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
It's okay. I can do it.

312
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,720
Mind your health.

313
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,390
You know what,

314
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,430
the selection of exchange students

315
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,790
has already started.

316
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,150
It won't not be a problem for you
to study abroad

317
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
once you finish this project.

318
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,510
Okay.

319
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
One more thing.

320
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,480
Ding Xian came to me a few days ago,

321
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,760
saying that she found something she is more interested in

322
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,840
and she wanted to quit the group.

323
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,880
I said yes.

324
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,270
It's great.

325
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,600
I had no idea

326
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,270
so many things happened

327
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,550
between you and Zhou Siyue.

328
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,310
What's that senior's name exactly?

329
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,120
Which department does she in?

330
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,840
I can meet her for you.

331
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,880
You missed the point.

332
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,360
It has already happened.

333
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,190
I'm not thinking of him anymore.

334
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,910
You know what?

335
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,760
I've been always thinking that

336
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,790
it must be you to stay with Zhou Siyue.

337
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,240
What about now?

338
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,080
Now I'm confused too.

339
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,840
Relationship between lovers
has become so complicated

340
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,430
since we grow up.

341
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,910
What shall we have for lunch?

342
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,670
It's up to you.

343
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,360
I always want to eat...

344
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,310
What?

345
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,840
Mr. Charming.

346
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,550
What's fun in the phone?

347
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,030
Even ignored Mr. Charming.

348
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,240
I'm waiting for the call from the press.

349
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,760
So you and Zhou Siyue...

350
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,720
Don't mention him.

351
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,550
Did you cut off the thread of love?

352
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,150
Yeah, now I am ascetic.

353
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,600
I only concerned about my career.

354
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,000
It can't be better.

355
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,790
Ding Xian

356
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,430
I finally got you.

357
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,150
What's the matter, President?

358
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,480
Ms. Sun from the Dream Journey Press
has come to you.

359
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,270
Do I get the chance for the competition?

360
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,640
No, she's going to sign a contract with you.

361
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,720
Sign a contract?

362
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,600
For real?

363
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,640
Yes.

364
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,670
I knew it.

365
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,910
Why doesn't she come to me herself?

366
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,670
She said you were in a rush,

367
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,510
with no contact left.

368
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,510
How could she come to you herself?

369
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,510
Right.

370
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,360
Is this the popular novel The Shadow

371
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,150
on the Lijiang Literary website?

372
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,550
Do you want me to adapt it into a comic?

373
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,790
What do you think?

374
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,030
Do you have the confidence?

375
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,310
The contract has already been drawn up.

376
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,640
Take a look.

377
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,150
If there's no argument about the price,

378
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,390
we can set about the next step.

379
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,150
May I take it back and have a close look?

380
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,310
Of course.

381
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,190
But there are still

382
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,760
lots of candidates for this project.

383
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm a little worried.

384
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,670
You know, time waits for no one.

385
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,720
Thanks for your trust.

386
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,550
I ought to keep faith with you too.

387
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,670
Mr. Su, this is the sponsoring proposal

388
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,760
of the Comics Club of Huaqing University.

389
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,550
The contact information is on the last page.

390
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,120
Okay, thank you.

391
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,120
Hello.

392
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,000
Is this Xing Lufei?

393
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,430
Yes.

394
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,760
I'm not sure if you remember me or not.

395
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,390
I'm Su Bocong, from Chima Technology.

396
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,150
Would you like to

397
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,600
go out for a dinner today?

398
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,120
I happen to have a few high school mates

399
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,190
from Huaqing University.

400
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,270
We'd like to gather with you.

401
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,840
You may know them.

402
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,720
You have not uttered a single word since you came back.

403
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,640
It's not like you, Mr. Zhou.

404
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,080
Was I being too mean

405
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,430
the other day?

406
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,190
Which day?

407
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,760
Don't play dumb with me.

408
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,390
You were not only being mean.

409
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,960
You were being a jerk.

410
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,840
I just wanted her to

411
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,390
do something she likes.

412
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,910
She shouldn't sacrifice herself for me.

413
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,670
Do you feel regret?

414
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,270
She may not talk to you now even if you come to her.

415
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,760
You deserve it.

416
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,790
You dug yourself a grave.

417
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,550
I thought you don't like dinner parties.

418
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,030
But this one, I must go.

419
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,640
Bocong, sorry to keep you waiting.

420
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,480
You are here.

421
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,550
Hello,
I'm the president of the Comics Club, Ji Hang.

422
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm Su Bocong, nice to meet you.

423
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,360
Please be seated.

424
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Xianxian, sit here.

425
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,600
Su

426
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,240
I didn't know you are the sponsor.

427
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,600
Ding Xian

428
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,880
If we know you two are this close,

429
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,910
you'd be in charge of the sponsorship.

430
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,000
Where's Zhou Siyue?

431
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,760
He's on the way.

432
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,910
We've just arrived.

433
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,000
Have a seat here.

434
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,190
Zhou Siyue

435
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,550
It's been a long time.

436
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,600
Right, it's been a long time.

437
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,150
It seems you've known each other.

438
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,030
No more introduction then.

439
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,790
Let's start to order now.

440
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,960
What would you like to eat?

441
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
Xianxian

442
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,030
What would you like to eat?

443
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,550
Zhou Siyue, this is for you.

444
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,120
Sorry to take your

445
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,030
chocolates last time.

446
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,790
I got you a same one.

447
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,270
Stop being mad at me.

448
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,550
Come on, let's eat up.

449
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,190
Bocong is so young and promising.

450
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,150
You only graduated two years earlier than us,

451
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,550
but you've already started to invest us.

452
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,600
You are much more excellent.

453
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,190
I was just

454
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,030
being lucky to

455
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,790
be appreciated.

456
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,360
You are too modest.

457
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,000
Xianxian

458
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,240
This Sour Soup Fish tastes

459
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,000
similar to that in our hometown.

460
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Have a try.

461
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,430
Ding Xian doesn't like sour things.

462
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,960
Don't you like it anymore?

463
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,430
I'll have a taste.

464
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,720
How do you like it?

465
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,030
Well, Bocong

466
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,270
I am quite curious.

467
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,390
For what?

468
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,640
What's the relationship between

469
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,880
you and our little sister Ding Xian?

470
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,880
My parents get on well with his family.

471
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,550
So we've known each other since we were kids.

472
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,880
Grow up together.

473
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,790
So you are childhood sweethearts.

474
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,240
I mean it seems that

475
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,360
Bocong has a crush on you.

476
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,720
I do like her

477
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,600
and I'm going to invite her

478
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,030
to my company when she graduates.

479
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,510
Of course, you're all

480
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,880
warmly welcomed.

481
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,430
Bocong, you are so nice to Xianxian.

482
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,480
I need to go to the toilet.

483
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,790
Excuse me.

484
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,240
Help yourselves.

485
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,390
Zhou Siyue

486
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,960
What are you going to say?

487
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,600
I like Ding Xian.

488
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,430
So what?

489
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,480
I like her since we were kids.

490
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,880
I'll gradually make up the hurt

491
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,240
she got from you.

492
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,720
I'm capable of giving her a better life.

493
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,430
So please get away from her.

494
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,910
What's between her and me

495
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,600
has nothing to do with you.

496
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,270
Despite my relationship with Xianxian,

497
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,270
I have promised Xianxian's parents

498
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,640
to take care of her.

499
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,840
So I'm responsible for her stuff.

500
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,790
Why don't you talk about your relationship?

501
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,550
I'd like to know what kind of relationship

502
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,000
between you and Ding Xian.

503
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,600
What about yours?

504
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,240
No matter what relationship between us now,

505
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,790
she will only be with me for her life.

506
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,240
Xianxian

507
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,880
Ding Xian

508
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,480
Ding Xian

509
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,550
Zhou Siyue, what else do you want?

510
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
I was being too harsh

511
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,120
to you the other day.

512
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,190
I'm so sorry.

513
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,390
I didn't expect Mr. Zhou would apologize.

514
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,910
After that day,

515
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,790
I've been thinking all the time.

516
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,360
I can't imagine

517
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,430
what my life will be

518
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,790
without you.

519
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,480
Stop flattering yourself, Zhou Siyue.

520
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,240
You have no right to

521
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,190
decide the relationship between us,

522
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,390
nor make decisions for me.

523
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,880
I said you are not the center of my life any more.

524
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,670
You don't need to make any explanations to me.

525
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,150
Ding Xian

526
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,150
Calm down please.

527
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,670
Honestly...

528
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,640
Calm down?

529
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,190
You think I'm totally

530
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,120
obsessed with you, right?

531
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,960
Or is it fun to play me like a fool?

532
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,640
You just get used to having me

533
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,670
follow you all the time.

534
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,960
But I'm tired.

535
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,240
Let everything stop here.

536
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,310
Xianxian

537
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,880
Get in the car. I'll give you a ride.

538
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:42,949
Xianxian

539
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,030
It seems the dishes today

540
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,199
didn't suit your taste.

541
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,550
Would you like to eat something else?

542
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,840
Thank you, Su.

543
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
I'm not hungry.

544
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,950
Have you heard

545
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,680
what we said in the restaurant?

546
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,270
Only a part of it.

547
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,840
But it's enough.

548
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,120
It is all over.

549
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,840
I won't feel upset for him any longer.

550
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,470
How about I come back to Shen Hai with you in the New Year's vacation.

551
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,360
I can also get some fresh air.

552
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,400
I can't go with you.

553
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,880
I still have a Comicon to go in Huaicheng.

554
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,400
Kong Shadi

555
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,470
It's me.

556
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Listen to me.

557
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,550
I just had a nightmare,

558
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,750
in which Kong Shadi and I

559
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,950
were stuck in a rainforest.

560
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,310
We were on a big tree,

561
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,120
with lots of crocodiles below.

562
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,440
Then she said to me,

563
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,160
Song Ziqi, I will feed you to the crocodiles.

564
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,750
And she pushed me off right away.

565
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,470
So scary.

566
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,920
Song Ziqi

567
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,990
I got one question for you.

568
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,840
What would you do

569
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,200
if Kong Shadi disappears some day?

570
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,680
Such a boring question.

571
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
I've thought about it very clearly.

572
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,510
It was all over between us.

573
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,510
You'd better give up too.

574
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Song Ziqi would have come to you

575
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,950
if he wants to see you.

576
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,550
Don't curse on

577
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,160
my love.

578
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,950
I'll find him

579
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,880
wherever he goes.

580
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,640
I must know the answer.

581
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,990
It's not that important to know the answer.

582
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,360
You are forcing yourself to accept that

583
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,120
it's not important.

584
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,230
Can you really give up easily?

585
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,550
I know I can't.

586
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,310
I know I can't

587
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,120
give up easily.

588
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,600
And I can't help falling in love with him

589
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,470
every time I see him.

590
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,920
But I have to tell myself

591
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,600
to hang in as possible as I can.

592
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,990
Alright.

593
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,440
I'm always here to support you.

594
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,160
Bye-bye.

595
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,230
Bye.

596
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,600
Zhou Siyue, why have I become the one

597
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,600
who knows you the least?

598
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,990
Why can't you just be honest with me?

599
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,120
It has been four years, Zhou Siyue.

600
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,920
Do you really think I haven't confirmed it myself?

601
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,440
I have asked myself for a thousand times,

602
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,080
am I fall in love with you,

603
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,440
or it's just an illusion in puberty?

604
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,360
The only thing I can

605
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,270
be sure in this world

606
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,200
is my feelings toward you.

607
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,990
You just get used to having me

608
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,790
follow you all the time.

609
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,710
But I'm tired.

610
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,270
We are over now.

611
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,200
Hey, Xianxian.

612
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,160
Hey, Su.

613
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,680
I got your present.

614
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,750
It's too valuable. I can't keep it.

615
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,710
You must keep it.

616
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,840
I knew you wouldn't accept it to my face.

617
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,470
So I asked someone to put it at your dorm.

618
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,600
If you feel apologetic,

619
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,510
draw more and better pictures with it.

620
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,880
Take it as a sort of investment.

621
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,080
Thank you.

622
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,440
I'll save up to give you a birthday...

623
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,230
Xianxian

624
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,510
I got another call.

625
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,710
I gotta go.

626
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,840
Okay.

627
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,200
Okay, see you.

628
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,230
Bye-bye.

629
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,160
Song Ziqi

630
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,710
Hello?

631
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,950
Where are you?

632
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,990
Kong Shadi's around.

633
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,550
I'm worried she may follow you to find me.

634
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,840
So I just come out and hide for a while.

635
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,640
Good for you.

636
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,710
I gotta go.

637
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,680
Song Ziqi

638
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,360
Miss, you got the wrong person.

639
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,200
Who's Song Ziqi?

640
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,950
Song Ziqi!

641
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,990
Song Ziqi, stand still.

642
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,270
Wait for me.

643
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,470
Hey, Shasha.

644
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,950
Hey, Ding Xian.

645
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,550
Zhou Siyue is a big liar.

646
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,030
What did he do?

647
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,160
He lied to me that he didn't know where Song Ziqi is.

648
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,030
He's been right here.

649
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,360
How did you know?

650
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,030
I just saw him.

651
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,200
I'm so mad.

652
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,160
I'm going to your school later.

653
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,230
Get out now.

654
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,600
Wait a second. I'm on my way.

655
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,400
What are we doing here exactly?

656
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,790
I'm going to follow Siyue.

657
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,360
He knows for sure where Song Ziqi is.

658
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,440
I can surely find that jerk

659
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,200
by following him.

660
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,680
You can do it yourself. Why do you call me here?

661
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,200
Aren't you my bestie?

662
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,640
Come alone with me, please.

663
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,470
What? How did she find you?

664
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:23,640
How could I know she would go to

665
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,600
the bookstore, bro?

666
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:26,990
Bookstore?

667
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,990
I didn't expect you would go to the bookstore either.

668
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,750
You two are indeed a perfect match.

669
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,470
Stop joking with me.

670
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,880
Just tell me what should I do.

671
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,750
Where are you right now?

672
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,030
I'm at the basement.

673
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,950
Come back now.

674
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,080
I'm frightened.

675
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,680
Alright, don't be frightened.

676
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,230
I'm on my way.

677
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,360
Don't be frightened.

678
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:51,360
He is going back.

679
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,880
Let's go, let's go.

680
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,640
He's looking over here.

681
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,270
It's okay.

682
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,470
Will he find us?

683
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:18,680
No, he won't.

684
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:22,400
Have a look now.

685
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,680
Let me see.

686
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,840
He's gone.

687
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:40,990
Didn't she follow you?

688
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,550
She did,

689
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,790
with Ding Xian.

690
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,270
Take it easy.

691
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:47,990
I saw them.

692
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:49,920
They won't come here.

693
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:52,990
Is it here?

694
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,680
Well, are you sure you've got rid of them?

695
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:57,510
Are you definitely sure...

696
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:58,950
I thought I heard Song Ziqi's voice.

697
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:59,950
You need to take this seriously.

698
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:01,270
I'll be dead if she

699
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:02,680
shows up at the door.

700
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,440
Really.

701
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,030
I could hardly sleep

702
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,790
these days.

703
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:07,360
I have nightmares every night.

704
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,160
It should be here.

705
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:12,790
Zhou Siyue
