Our Secret
EP06

2
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,270
I'm ready.

3
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,870
Come on, Ding Xian.

4
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,120
How many have I done, bro?

5
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,590
Come on, Ding Xian.

6
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,000
Are you counting?

7
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,360
You are free

8
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,670
after the physical fitness test.

9
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,829
Come on, let's play in groups.

10
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:21,720
In groups.

11
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,800
Okay, I'm the first.

12
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,470
Pass it to me.

13
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,110
Are you tired, Ding Xian?

14
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,440
Not at all. I'm OK.

15
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,960
I quit.

16
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,880
Why?

17
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,670
You don't play?

18
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,079
Oh, let him go. Game starts.

19
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,110
Come on,

20
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,360
pass the ball to me.

21
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,360
The last thing before you leaving.

22
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,360
The sports meeting

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,750
is coming next month.

24
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,520
In usual, you have many complaints

25
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,390
when the PE class

26
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,079
is occupied by other subjects.

27
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,320
Now it's the time to

28
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,390
release your passion for it.

29
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,320
Don't worry,

30
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,880
only one requirement.

31
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,880
I want to see my students

32
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,080
in every event.

33
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,190
It's better for you to have good performance.

34
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,160
Song Ziqi, you are in charge of sports activities.

35
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,550
Collect the signing up results

36
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,390
and put the entry form on my desk.

37
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,440
Yes, sir.

38
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,440
Classes are over.

39
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,190
Hey, you can

40
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,360
compete in the shot put.

41
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,390
Song Ziqi, are you crazy?

42
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,800
Hey, it's rude.

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,030
I'm serious. I reckon that you can do it.

44
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,800
Your punch is so hard.

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,520
You may win a prize.

46
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,960
Think it over.

47
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,160
Little Monster

48
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,440
Forget it.

49
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,720
You are too thin

50
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,390
to compete in the sports meeting.

51
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,670
Siyue

52
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,079
Do you wanna join the long-distance running?

53
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,829
Do it as you see fit.

54
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,360
Okay, it's up to me.

55
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,960
Short-distance running, shot put,

56
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,160
high jump and long jump... oh you are so busy.

57
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,440
Can you tell me, except this game,

58
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,800
do we have other entertainments?

59
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,550
What do you like?

60
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,320
Um, like basketball

61
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,800
or billiards.

62
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,200
You've promised to me that

63
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,320
you would concede me points.

64
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,440
When will you do it?

65
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,040
Answer me.

66
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,070
Ding Xian, do you remember me?

67
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,790
You Keke

68
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,600
One thing to give you.

69
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,200
Please help me

70
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,640
to give it to Zhou Siyue tomorrow.

71
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,320
-I, or you... -It took me

72
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,550
one morning to finish it.

73
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,670
Just be careful.

74
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,720
Thank you.

75
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,270
Why should I do that again?

76
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,270
It's for you.

77
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,830
Thank you, but I'm good.

78
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,070
I read your letter.

79
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,830
I've forgiven you.

80
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,070
Well,

81
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,000
that's not my letter.

82
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,760
Don't defend it.

83
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,950
It's from You Keke, a girl in Class Ten.

84
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,640
And what's this?

85
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,600
This is...

86
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,390
Come outside with me.

87
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,270
The class is beginning.

88
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,270
Come out.

89
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,000
Delivered the letter. Now the gift.

90
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,320
Are you a courier?

91
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,830
I'm just helping her.

92
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,390
Why not deny it?

93
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,920
I apologize.

94
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,880
It's my fault.

95
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,350
I won't ask you to do my mission anymore.

96
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,710
I'm not so mean.

97
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,030
So why are you unhappy?

98
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,440
You are close to Liu Xiaofeng

99
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,760
and never mind others' comments.

100
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,200
We all are schoolmates. Anything different?

101
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,200
Tell me.

102
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,200
Ding Xian

103
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,350
Can you tell me

104
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,110
what you are thinking?

105
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,230
Or you just reckon that

106
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,110
it's interesting that we were not on speaking terms?

107
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,200
I don't see it that way.

108
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Just tell me please,

109
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,110
what's your worry?

110
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,760
Don't put these rubbish

111
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
into my desk.

112
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,560
The playground is bathed in the warm sunshine.

113
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,120
The male Group B of high jump of Grade Two will begin.

114
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,150
On the playground, athletes' robust posture

115
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,230
shot across the sky.

116
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,080
The ocean is mighty

117
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,880
and the drumming is splendid.

118
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,080
Dear athletes,

119
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,590
you're mighty as the ocean today.

120
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,280
We will cheer for you.

121
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,470
What are you doing?

122
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,910
I'm writing the composition.

123
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,030
That's not my point.

124
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,960
Is your deskmate in any race?

125
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yes.

126
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,080
Now male long-distance running of Grade One will begin.

127
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,670
All participants please gather at the starting line.

128
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,640
Zhou Siyue, our race will begin.

129
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,590
Okay.

130
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,350
Wait a minute.

131
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,710
I should check the composition for me.

132
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,960
Just a minute.

133
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,440
Ding Xian, have you finished it?

134
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,400
My race will begin.

135
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,400
Almost done. I'll hand it in.

136
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,550
It's for me, isn't it?

137
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,880
I have to go, see ya.

138
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,790
Let's go.

139
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,710
I found him

140
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,400
was special to you.

141
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,840
You are kidding me.

142
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,400
I'm handing in the composition.

143
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,670
Though athletes running on the playground

144
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,550
can't receive flowers,

145
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,710
you'll embrace the rainbow after rains.

146
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,200
Athletes from Class Three,

147
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,320
we feel proud of you.

148
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,790
Liu Xiaofeng, you can make it!

149
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,840
Come on, Class Three!

150
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,550
Come on, Class Three!

151
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,280
Come on, Class Three!

152
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,000
Come on, Class Three!

153
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,670
Come on, Class Three!

154
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,910
That's your work?

155
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,320
Much better than my letter.

156
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,840
You can be my ghost writer next time.

157
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,880
Sorry, your letter...

158
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,030
What did you say just now?

159
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,880
What's wrong?

160
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,840
Your letter...

161
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,000
You didn't give it to him?

162
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,350
I did give it to him.

163
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Just a joke. Take it easy.

164
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,080
What's wrong?

165
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,320
I tore it by accident

166
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,670
but I made a transcript.

167
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,840
You've read my letter to Zhou Siyue.

168
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
How about it?

169
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,520
Oh, don't worry.

170
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,280
I didn't write it by myself.

171
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,030
I know you don't care

172
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,350
but I should apologize.

173
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,910
It was an accident.

174
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,790
If you feel sorry,

175
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,880
you can do me another favour.

176
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,640
What's it?

177
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,080
Come on, Class Three!

178
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Shadi, look at this.

179
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,910
I bought it, too.

180
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,400
Now we have the same earphone,

181
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,320
but its quality seems to be worse

182
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,470
than my old one.

183
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,200
I want to

184
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,110
have lunch with you every day.

185
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,150
Have lunch with me?

186
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,670
Yep.

187
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,880
Why not eat with girls in your class?

188
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,840
I don't like being with them.

189
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,590
Okay, it's a deal.

190
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,670
We are lunch pals.

191
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,150
See you.

192
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,640
I...

193
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,670
The male long-distance running

194
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,030
is coming to the end.

195
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,910
With perseverance,

196
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,880
athletes are approaching the end now.

197
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,150
Let's cheer them on!

198
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,230
Come on! Come on!

199
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,030
Come on! Come on!

200
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,350
Here you are. Good job.

201
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,280
It's for me?

202
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,880
I knew it.

203
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,590
The final exam of this year is coming.

204
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,790
I haven't sent

205
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,710
the picture I drew for Zhou Siyue

206
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,550
to him.

207
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,200
And I haven't been reconciled with Kong Shadi.

208
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,150
I don't know

209
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,110
how to say no to You Keke.

210
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,350
I may admit

211
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,550
that I'm just a timid girl

212
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,590
who can't say no.

213
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,640
The final exam of your first year

214
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,200
is very important.

215
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,080
It's linked to

216
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,910
your class dividing in Grade Two, arts or sciences.

217
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,350
If you've made up your mind,

218
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,150
you should be well prepared.

219
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,550
If you have no idea,

220
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,080
this exam is a chance

221
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,230
to examine yourself.

222
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,280
Which one do you like?

223
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,840
Which one is suitable?

224
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,400
At last, I wish you have good performance!

225
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,280
Come on!

226
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,550
You can make it!

227
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,080
Make it!

228
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,150
Make it!

229
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,200
Why did you hit me?

230
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Can you be girlish?

231
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,110
Oh you deserve it.

232
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,950
Any question?

233
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,109
I have to go, bye.

234
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,069
How is it going with your robot contest in the summer holiday?

235
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,160
Got a prize?

236
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,589
Have a guess.

237
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,430
Well done.

238
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,760
You could go to the Huaqing University with so many prizes.

239
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,310
It's not as easy as you thought.

240
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,880
And you'll have the birthday party tonight.

241
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,800
Good things come in pairs.

242
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,470
Good.

243
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,350
That's Little Monster.

244
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,950
Did you ask her to join us?

245
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,110
Sister, I don't want to stay here.

246
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,280
It's so boring.

247
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,230
I'm going there.

248
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
Okay.

249
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,950
Why are you guys so weird?

250
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,590
It really bothers me.

251
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,590
The thing between she and she is not the one

252
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,710
between she and me.

253
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,070
Is that a tongue twister?

254
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,160
I can't get it.

255
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,950
I only knew you made me embarrassed.

256
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,520
Girls are difficult to understand.

257
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,040
Don't like us, simple and innocent.

258
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,640
You're innocent, not me.

259
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,280
Let me go!

260
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,520
Really fierce, boy.

261
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,350
Let me go!

262
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,000
You two, leave me alone.

263
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,310
Hey, hurry up

264
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,230
or she'll go.

265
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,880
Come on, she's gone.

266
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,640
Piss off!

267
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,160
What are you doing?

268
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,920
Piss off!

269
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,110
Get away!

270
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,470
Stand here! I'll pummel you!

271
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,160
Are you OK?

272
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,760
It's none of your business.

273
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,430
Okay, come back home.

274
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,470
Don't run around anymore.

275
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
Hurry up.

276
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,590
Be rebellious at home

277
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,430
and be bullied outside.

278
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,830
Why not fight against them?

279
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,110
It's not your business.

280
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,760
Not my business.

281
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,760
I'm your sister, so it's my business.

282
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,400
Keep still.

283
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,920
Now it hurts?

284
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,950
Two-faced, are you?

285
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,920
Oh, stop it.

286
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,160
You're the same as me.

287
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,590
Be fierce in front of me

288
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,680
and be a lady in school.

289
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,800
Ding Juncong

290
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,520
It looks delicious!

291
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,800
Shall we begin now?

292
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,560
Wait a minute.

293
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,430
Be patient.

294
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,880
How long are we going to have to wait?

295
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,160
Don't complain.

296
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,160
Why not?

297
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,110
Okay.

298
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,800
Let's start, guys.

299
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,190
Here you come.

300
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Sorry,

301
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,190
I'm late.

302
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,830
Where are the others?

303
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,350
They went to the Karaoke.

304
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,950
Why are you here?

305
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,070
I've had enough of the regular activities.

306
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,400
A bit boring.

307
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,590
I'm sorry.

308
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,160
For what?

309
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,920
For your

310
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,070
having quarrel with me?

311
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,110
Or for the absence of my birthday party?

312
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,590
Both of them.

313
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,000
Okay,

314
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,800
I've forgiven you,

315
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,040
but how can you compensate me?

316
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,680
Well,

317
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,000
I'll come to your next birthday party,

318
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,560
I promise.

319
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,640
Why should it be the next one?

320
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,000
It's still my birthday now.

321
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,000
Zhou Siyue

322
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,000
Happy birthday to you.

323
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,640
Thank you.

324
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,560
It's for you.

325
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,160
My gift?

326
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,920
Let me see.

327
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,760
It's the nebula picture on your birthday.

328
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,350
It's beautiful.

329
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,040
Good.

330
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,160
I like it.

331
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,950
I'm glad you like it.

332
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,070
Thank you.

333
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,590
Blow out the candle.

334
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,590
I hope your birthday wish will come true.

335
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It came true.

336
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,430
What's your wish?

337
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,000
It's my secret.

338
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,590
Here,

339
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,350
I have a gift for you, too.

340
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,000
Oh, it's too expensive.

341
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
I can't take it.

342
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,640
It's not so expensive.

343
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,950
It's free.

344
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,110
Free?

345
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,950
I participated in a contest days ago.

346
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,760
That's my prize.

347
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,400
I can't take this.

348
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,880
Or you sell me the picture,

349
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,110
and this is paid for it.

350
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,400
My picture is valueless.

351
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,950
I don't think so.

352
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,710
It may appreciate someday.

353
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,590
Okay,

354
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,950
Take it easy.

355
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,920
Now I lend it to you,

356
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,680
you can return it when you get a new one.

357
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,350
I don't want to lose contact with you anymore.

358
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,040
Hello?

359
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,680
Hey, Ding Xian.

360
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,590
I... pressed the wrong button.

361
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,000
Silly girl.

362
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,470
Xianxian, you should get up.

363
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,280
Dad

364
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,160
It's holiday. Let me sleep in.

365
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,950
Wake up, my girl.

366
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,520
Your holiday was over.

367
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,070
Today you should go to school.

368
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,680
Hurry up. The meal is on the table.

369
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,110
I'm going to work.

370
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,760
What's the sound?

371
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,880
Alarm clock, dad.

372
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,310
I'm changing clothes.

373
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,230
Okay, don't be late.

374
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,800
Go to school together. I'm downstairs.

375
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,760
Good morning.

376
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,640
We would skip the morning self-study course

377
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,070
if you were later.

378
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,230
Sorry, I overslept.

379
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,560
Did you forget that it's a school day?

380
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,640
Just feel that the summer hasn't finished.

381
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,070
It's silly.

382
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,230
It's our second year.

383
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,070
The division of arts and sciences is coming.

384
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,310
Why are there so many choices in our life?

385
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,400
Hurry up

386
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,310
or we'll be late.

387
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,880
My hairs...

388
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,160
Siyue, can I copy your math homework?

389
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,310
Ding Xian

390
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,470
Give him yours.

391
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,400
You are reconciled.

392
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
I've said that

393
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,310
we had to maintain the friendship with deskmates.

394
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,310
-Or you... -Song Ziqi

395
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,590
Take your breakfast or I'll dump it.

396
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,350
I'm here, madam. Don't dump it.

397
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,520
Why is she mad at you?

398
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,830
Because of the letter.

399
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,520
How dare you mention it?

400
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,640
It's an accident.

401
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,710
It's so typical of you.

402
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,800
I'm sorry.

403
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,880
I promise it won't happen again.

404
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,680
What's the probability that

405
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,830
the times you get red balls

406
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,640
is more than the times

407
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,230
you get the white ones?

408
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,430
What's the probability?

409
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,830
You have to apply this formula.

410
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,230
Okay, keep sleeping.

411
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,310
No one cares.

412
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,590
We'll continue when all of you

413
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,000
wake up.

414
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,830
Why do you know the knowledge of Grade Two?

415
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,190
I've seen it in a Mathematical Olympiad problem.

416
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,000
So I learned it in advance.

417
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,710
Wake up, guys!

418
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,040
The exam of class dividing is coming.

419
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,070
You are in the second year now.

420
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,230
It's as important as the last year.

421
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,920
Do you understand?

422
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,680
Song Ziqi

423
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,400
Stand up!

424
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,110
If you are still sleepy,

425
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,950
you can stand up.

426
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,110
What are you thinking?

427
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,310
Don't like taking lessons?

428
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,710
These are extra lessons

429
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,640
but not teachers' compulsory obligation.

430
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,310
We want to help you

431
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,760
finish the courses of high school sooner,

432
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,950
so in the last year

433
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,040
you can have enough time to revise.

434
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,760
What do you think

435
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,590
why I don't take the summer holiday

436
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,350
but stand here to give your extra lessons.

437
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,710
Am I crazy?

438
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,950
Well, next class is Physics.

439
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,230
Wake up, guys.

440
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,350
Wash your face if you feel drowsy.

441
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,310
Okay?

442
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,590
Okay.

443
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,590
Um,

444
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,760
Deng Wanwan,

445
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,040
remember to hand out the

446
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,470
application forms of the class dividing.

447
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,430
Yes, sir.

448
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,680
Take this period

449
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,950
to think it over.

450
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,590
Give me before this Friday.

451
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,110
Zhou Siyue

452
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,400
Come here.

453
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,400
Shadi

454
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,400
Wanwan

455
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,190
I want to drink water, too.

456
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,040
Let's go together.

457
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,560
Okay.

458
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,040
Little Monster

459
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,000
Don't mind.

460
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,310
That's how she usually is.

461
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,280
Can you help me hand out the homework?

462
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,430
Nature calls.

463
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,310
Thank you.

464
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,350
I've put your name down on the list

465
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,230
of participants of the municipal math competition.

466
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,430
I'll give you some exam papers in a few days.

467
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,430
You should prepare for it.

468
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,230
If you can win a prize this time,

469
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,430
you can take the national college entrance exam next year.

470
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
Thank you, sir.

471
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,950
Though you've taken municipal contests at junior high school,

472
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,470
the contests of high school is more difficult.

473
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,880
All in all, you can make your schedule now.

474
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,710
Okay, sir.

475
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,950
I trust you.

476
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,760
Come on.

477
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,160
You're done.

478
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,470
It's Shadi's favorite diary.

479
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,830
Sorry, Shadi.

480
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,560
It's an accident.

481
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,430
Why are you here?

482
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,760
I didn't mean to.

483
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,710
I can buy you a new one.

484
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,560
How can you get it?

485
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,160
It's bought by my dad in Japan.

486
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,350
I'll figure it out.

487
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,800
How?

488
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,640
Buy a same one

489
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,070
and transcribe the content

490
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,350
like you do to You Keke's letter?

491
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,560
What do you mean?

492
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,800
That's typical of you, Ding Xian.

493
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,110
I've had enough, Kong Shadi.

494
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,800
Sorry, Shadi.

495
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,150
Don't cry.

496
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,560
Leave me alone.

497
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,520
Don't bother me.

498
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,760
How dare you.

499
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,150
I didn't mean it that day.

500
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:26,120
I'm so sorry.

501
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,560
Don't cry.

502
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,840
Forgive me.

503
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:33,080
Stop crying

504
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,389
or I want to cry, too.

505
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,040
You are heartless.

506
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,469
You're right.

507
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,520
Why don't you go to You Keke?

508
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,600
She's your friend.

509
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,360
Why did you come to me?

510
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,949
You are my friend, too.

511
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,230
Listen, Shadi.

512
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,670
Because of the letter

513
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,520
I've made such a mess of my life.

514
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,560
You are mad at me,

515
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,600
so is Zhou Siyue.

516
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,470
It reminds me

517
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,600
of my early days

518
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,150
in this high school.

519
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,120
And I realized that

520
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,080
I was a yea and nay

521
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,430
coward.

522
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,950
You are so brave and confident.

523
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,230
That's why

524
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,670
I really like being friends with you.

525
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,520
Can you forgive me? Please.

526
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,190
It's stinking.

527
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,870
It's ugly.

528
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,040
Okay,

529
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,430
let's go.

530
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,560
Don't cry.

531
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,430
You're so ugly after crying.

532
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,600
You're ugly.

533
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,230
Let's have lunch together.

534
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,800
Have something good.

535
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,670
You two

536
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,600
are reconciled?

537
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,630
Oh you shut up.

538
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,280
You are reconciled.

539
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,320
It took a long time to beg her pardon.

540
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,630
You know how to beg one's pardon.

541
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,190
Good job.

542
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,230
You can beg her pardon

543
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,760
but refuse to coax me.

544
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,390
I've spoiled you.

545
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,230
It's different.

546
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,800
What's the difference?

547
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,000
I want the same treatment

548
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,120
if we have a quarrel next time.

549
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,870
Okay.

550
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,320
Hey.

551
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,470
Siyue

552
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,190
Have you handed in the application form?

553
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,280
Not yet.

554
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,560
No need to be hurried.

555
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,710
You've handed it in?

556
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,840
There's no need to hesitate

557
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,600
since I'm sure to learn sciences.

558
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,950
You chose sciences.

559
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,840
Of course.

560
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,320
Do you think I can learn arts?

561
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,600
I'll choose sciences, too.

562
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,390
Are you serious?

563
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,280
You wanna follow me?

564
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,430
Stop being narcissistic.

565
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,910
What if Yang Chunzi and I

566
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,760
enter the same class if I learn arts?

567
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,670
I can't stand that.

568
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,670
Right,

569
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,390
I think girls will prefer liberal arts.

570
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Yang Chunzi is too far-sighted

571
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,150
to choose the liberal arts. It's easier.

572
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,280
If you learn sciences,

573
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,390
you'll be apart with Little Monster.

574
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,150
Xianxian, will you learn arts?

575
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,280
If you choose arts,

576
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,870
we can't see each other in class.

577
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,360
It's sad.

578
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,150
I'm not sure.

579
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,600
I may choose arts.

580
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,230
Really?

581
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,760
Then Zhou Siyue

582
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,840
can continue to be your tutor.

583
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,600
Trust me,

584
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,910
I can depend on myself.

585
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,760
I won't trouble him.

586
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,040
I knew you would forget.

587
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,430
Keke

588
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,560
Why are you here?

589
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,000
Ding Xian's promised me to have lunch together.

590
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm sorry.

591
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,320
Or you

592
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,520
eat with us.

593
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:37,950
Um,

594
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,120
who can introduce

595
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,600
this lady...

596
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,080
Why did you step on my foot?

597
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,390
Again?

598
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,390
Are you insane, Kong Shadi?

599
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,040
You are insane. Eat your food.

600
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,000
Hello, Zhou Siyue.

601
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,360
Nice to see you.

602
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm from Class Ten,

603
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,230
the girl who sent you the letter.

604
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,280
I know you.

605
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,080
Take it easy.

606
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,670
I did send you the letter,

607
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,040
but I won't pester you.

608
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,870
Your deskmate

609
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,390
is more interesting than you.

610
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,080
Little Monster now is

611
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,190
popular with others.

612
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,470
Can you stop it?

613
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,520
Just focus on your food.

614
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,760
I've had enough.

615
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,670
Help yourself.

616
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,630
You are annoying.

617
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,800
Why are you always around us?

618
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,040
I'm here for Ding Xian, not you.

619
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,630
Just leave here if you don't like me.

620
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,470
Why should I leave?

621
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,470
Why don't you leave?

622
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,800
Kong Shadi

623
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,520
Do you hate me

624
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,040
just because

625
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,150
I'm more beautiful than you?

626
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,600
Scared of feeling small?

627
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,360
Are you kidding?

628
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,230
Don't pester us anymore.

629
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,280
Oh, no way.

630
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,430
I'll keep pester you and Zhou Siyue.

631
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,390
I'll also go to the boy called Qi.

632
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:51,950
You...

633
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,600
Xianxian, I wanna pummel her.

634
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,560
Okay, Shasha,

635
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,040
you go back to the classroom.

636
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,360
I'll have a talk with her.

637
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,150
Don't promise her anything.

638
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
I don't like her.

639
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,800
Keke

640
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,670
Let's have a talk.

641
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:23,760
Okay.

642
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,390
There are only us. What do you want to say?

643
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,360
Sorry, Keke.

644
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,190
Why do you apologize?

645
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,280
For what?

646
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,390
Come on.

647
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,040
Actually,

648
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,800
I should apologize to you.

649
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,470
At the beginning,

650
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,950
I made use of you to approach Zhou Siyue.

651
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,710
Because I

652
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,710
don't like being with girls,

653
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,870
I always make friends with boys.

654
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,560
But I found that

655
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,910
you were more interesting than them.

656
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,150
And this time I found

657
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,000
Zhou Siyue

658
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,910
had a special charm,

659
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:12,670
but I don't like to

660
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,600
make friends with one boring like him.

661
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,670
He's an interesting man,

662
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,670
not as boring as you said.

663
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,760
Don't mind.

664
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,360
I may prefer boys like Song Ziqi

665
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,840
who is more outgoing.

666
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:27,800
No, you can't.

667
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,120
You can't approach him.

668
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,430
I've promised not to pester Zhou Siyue

669
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,840
but I didn't make any promise about Song Ziqi.

670
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,080
Please,

671
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,430
you'll provoke Shadi.

672
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,870
Okay,

673
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,120
take it easy.

674
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,840
You'll look better with bangs.

675
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,710
Shadi once said the same words.

676
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,760
Really?

677
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,320
I think

678
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,190
you two can be good friends.

679
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,520
Okay, I should have my lesson.

680
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,320
What's going on with that You Keke?

681
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,000
She's my friend.

682
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,470
A letter makes you be friends?

683
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,520
It's complex.

684
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,560
Hard to explain.

685
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,950
I never found that

686
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,670
you were keen on helping others build relationships.

687
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,320
But listen,

688
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm not interested in You Keke.

689
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,630
Don't play tricks.

690
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,760
Why?

691
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,520
You Keke is so popular.

692
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,470
If I were keen to make friends with those who are popular,

693
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,230
and there are many such people here,

694
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,230
I would be as busy as a bee.

695
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,360
Good point.

696
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,280
It's my fault this time.

697
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,760
I apologize.

698
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:21,630
Sorry.

699
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,470
I'm sorry.

700
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,630
Nice.

701
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,280
Better than before.
