Our Secret
EP08

2
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,800
I see now.

3
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,440
My daughter's grown up.

4
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,950
You think you can make a choice by yourself, right?

5
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,800
I can't control you anymore, right?

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,830
But I can still control you! Am I right?

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't care!

8
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,630
No matter what method you use,

9
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,720
you have to change her to the liberal arts class!

10
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,000
If you can't, let me tell you,

11
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,830
from tomorrow,

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,120
wash your clothes yourself!

13
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,040
Cook by yourself!

14
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,440
I won't care about you anymore!

15
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,270
You…

16
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
Xianxian

17
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,390
Your teacher paid a home visit today.

18
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,320
He gave us this.

19
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,320
That's what your mother's angry for.

20
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,030
Xianxian

21
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,520
Do you know why your mother's so angry?

22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,670
She thinks you've grown up.

23
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,190
and don't need her anymore.

24
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,190
She doesn't know how to express it,

25
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,750
so she behaves like that.

26
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,630
You should understand her.

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,910
I should also criticize you.

28
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,550
Why did you keep it as a secret

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,240
to hand in the application form?

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,190
Dad. It's my bad.

31
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,160
I should have told you.

32
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,190
Please help me beg mom

33
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,520
not to change me to the liberal arts class, okay?

34
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,270
I feel really happy at my present class.

35
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,470
And I don't want to be separated from my friends.

36
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,030
Alright. As for your mom,

37
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,800
I can help you.

38
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,440
But,

39
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,470
I am not that capable.

40
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,800
I can only give you one month.

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,000
For next monthly test,

42
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,520
try to get a good grade.

43
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,470
If you can do it,

44
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,960
there will be a way out of this.

45
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,670
Alight?

46
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,110
So students to the liberal arts and natural science classes

47
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,600
are temporarily settled.

48
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,269
It's not finalized, of course.

49
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,000
If some of you still want to study liberal arts

50
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,230
after studying for a while in this class,

51
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,790
tell me as soon as possible

52
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,160
to change it.

53
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,350
As for the placement test questions,

54
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
I won't teach them.

55
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,760
Later I'll hand out answers to you.

56
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,320
Analyze your errors after class,

57
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,670
and hand in the analysis before this Friday.

58
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,159
Alright. Let's continue.

59
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,760
I can only give you one month.

60
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,950
For the next monthly test,

61
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,550
try to get a good grade.

62
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,480
If you can do it,

63
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,880
there will be a way out of this.

64
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,550
Alright?

65
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,160
What's on your mind?

66
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,920
I was thinking…

67
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,760
I don't see great changes

68
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,950
of this class placement.

69
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,670
Because students who choose liberal arts

70
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,000
are few in reality.

71
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,160
No changes?

72
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,950
My dream girl, Yang Chunzi, left.

73
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,600
Now that you miss her so much,

74
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,760
just go with her.

75
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,510
It's too late.

76
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,760
Do you know anything else also late?

77
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,880
What?

78
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,600
The game disc I lent to you before.

79
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,040
I won't lend it now.

80
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,640
No, no, no.

81
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,270
Please! Lend me for a while!

82
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,000
Ask Yang Chunzi if she has it or not.

83
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,110
Borrow it from her.

84
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,550
I won't give you.

85
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,830
Song Ziqi! Kong Shadi!

86
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,550
Stand up!

87
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,720
It's all your fault.

88
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,790
Stand back!

89
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,200
Let's take out Mathematics Compulsory III.

90
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,510
Turn to Page 23.

91
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,640
Let's continue our class.

92
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,350
Let's learn Euclidean algorithm.

93
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,790
Euclidean algorithm is a kind of algorithm

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,950
recorded by Euclid in the "Elements".

95
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,920
Assume two integers are unequal.

96
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,350
Divide the larger one by the smaller one.

97
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,320
If the remainder

98
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,600
is still a non-zero number,

99
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,159
continue to divide until the remainder is zero.

100
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,510
Dad

101
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,110
Xianxian

102
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,720
Why do you come to this floor?

103
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,510
Didn't you say you would give me one month?

104
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,950
I come here to print a material.

105
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,440
The printer upstairs breaks down. Don't worry.

106
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,390
Did you chat with my mom?

107
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,950
Is she still angry?

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,230
Still a little bit.

109
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,480
She has another requirement for you.

110
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,160
Get at least 270 points in natural science.

111
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,880
That's killing me.

112
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,070
Just give my life to her!

113
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,160
My silly girl! Your life was originally given by your mom.

114
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,160
Well, I am not that capable.

115
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,830
That's all I can help you.

116
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,760
Fighting!

117
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,510
Thanks, Dad.

118
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,110
How can I get 270 points?

119
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,720
Studying while preparing for the competition

120
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,110
is such a burden for normal people.

121
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,480
Poor thing!

122
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,230
You are awake.

123
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,670
Did you stay up late to study?

124
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,640
Aren't you too tired in this way?

125
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,390
Can you get enough sleep?

126
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,600
It doesn't matter.

127
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,920
I've just made up for it.

128
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,550
What happened to you?

129
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,160
May I ask you:

130
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,640
Is there a way

131
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,230
to raise my grade to 270 points

132
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,640
of natural science in one month?

133
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,880
By dreaming.

134
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,440
Right now,

135
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,760
don't think too much.

136
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,080
Do more exam papers.

137
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,200
At your current level, you cannot even get 250 points,

138
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,790
let alone 270 points.

139
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,150
You're the 250 ("250" means "stupid" in Chinese)!

140
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,590
At least, I should work hard from now on.

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,910
Fighting!

142
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,470
Come on, Congcong.

143
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,960
Eat more meat.

144
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,400
Your body are growing. Eat more.

145
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,000
Mom

146
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,000
Why did you make so many delicious dishes today?

147
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,760
I wouldn't do it if you were not students.

148
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,110
Come on. Dishes will be cold soon.

149
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,710
Delicious!

150
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,710
Mom. Thanks for your hard work.

151
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,840
Eat more.

152
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,640
I've been cooking for over a decade.

153
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,590
Not until now have I heard a good word.

154
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,880
Come on, Congcong.

155
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,550
Eat more.

156
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,670
What a big dinner this evening!

157
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,880
Where's mine?

158
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,470
Well, I, I'm not that hungry.

159
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,000
Help yourselves, help yourselves.

160
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,320
I'll go reading for a while.

161
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,230
Tomorrow is weekend.

162
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,760
I'll take you to fill a prescription for your lenses.

163
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,110
Thanks, Mom.

164
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,230
Don't slack off in your study.

165
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,000
Two hundred and seventy points. We've made a deal.

166
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,470
One point less is not allowed.

167
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,230
Two hundred and seventy.

168
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,000
One point less is not allowed.

169
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,110
Be quiet.

170
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,790
The last weekly physics test papers

171
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,790
have been handed out.

172
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,320
Mr. Yang asks every student

173
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,320
to bring the error analysis

174
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,470
to him in his office in one week.

175
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,590
Don't forget it.

176
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,110
What's going on?

177
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,030
I'm helpless!

178
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,910
Let me see.

179
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,910
You got the formula wrong for this question.

180
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,470
You should've got this score.

181
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,670
And this one.

182
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,400
You didn't understand this question well.

183
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,550
The mass of the ping-pong ball is a misleading proposition.

184
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,350
You should've also got this score.

185
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,520
And this one.

186
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,640
It's even more unreasonable.

187
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,320
Every procedure is right

188
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,520
except for the result, which is so easy to get.

189
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,840
What were you thinking at that time?

190
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,710
If I could do everything right,

191
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,520
I would be the one to get 90 points.

192
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,110
No excuse for doing it wrongly.

193
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,440
This one…

194
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,230
Xianxian

195
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,550
Su

196
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,520
Why are you here?

197
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,550
Don't you need to take classes back in your university?

198
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,640
The new term hasn't begun yet.

199
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,150
So I want to come here to see you.

200
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,470
Are you free now?

201
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,150
Your mom is so demanding of you,

202
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,590
because she believes you are able to do it.

203
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,350
Don't be discouraged.

204
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,230
Because I also believe

205
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,840
you can do it.

206
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,200
I also thought I could,

207
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,200
but no comparison, no harm.

208
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,200
If there's anything you don't understand, you can ask me.

209
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,350
Didn't you learn liberal arts?

210
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,910
You look down upon me, don't you?

211
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,840
It's a piece of cake for me to teach you.

212
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,320
Maybe I think

213
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,230
I'm not that confident.

214
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,280
Thanks anyway, Su.

215
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,910
Oh, right.

216
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,150
I have another thing to say.

217
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,670
On the day of the graduation ceremony,

218
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,080
I wanted to take a photo with you.

219
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,640
But I didn't get a chance.

220
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,110
You should make it up to me today.

221
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,790
No problem.

222
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,400
Come here.

223
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,150
How time flies!

224
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,760
You're a college student now.

225
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,840
Does it mean we won't see each other for a long time?

226
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,760
What are you afraid of?

227
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,200
I'll come back during vacation.

228
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,520
I should go back for the class.

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,710
Our class supervisor will come there soon.

230
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,320
Xianxian

231
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,230
This is for you.

232
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,080
I hope you

233
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,000
can smile like that forever.

234
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,110
Definitely.

235
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,960
Go back for your class.

236
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,590
Xianxian, it just occurred to me…

237
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,520
Who took this photo for you?

238
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,400
Su took it for me just now.

239
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,280
Let me see. Let me see.

240
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,710
Look at the smile while looking back.

241
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,150
Su really knows how to take photos!

242
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,790
Look, look, look.

243
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,760
I've written down reasons why you made mistakes.

244
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,280
Look at them carefully this evening.

245
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,670
And there are two papers.

246
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,960
Finish them and give me tomorrow.

247
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,230
Two papers for one evening?

248
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,640
If you find them hard, don't do them.

249
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,110
If you get 200 points, you can still go to a college.

250
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,230
I didn't mean it.

251
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,110
Zhou Siyue

252
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,670
Why are you so cruel to our Xianxian?

253
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,400
Am I cruel to her?

254
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,710
College entrance examination is much crueler than me.

255
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,280
I'm helping her.

256
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,000
How about that?

257
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,880
Pay attention to the National Mathematics Olympiad first.

258
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,680
Fine. I won't care about you anymore.

259
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,350
Xianxian

260
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,560
Why haven't you been to the school?

261
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,350
Good morning. I'm waiting for Zhou Siyue.

262
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,640
Did he go downstairs?

263
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,830
Didn't he tell you?

264
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,310
He went to the training camp with other team members

265
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,230
of the Olympiad by bus this early morning.

266
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,350
I see.

267
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,280
I'll go to school now, Madam.

268
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,310
Be careful.

269
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,830
Good-bye, Madam.

270
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,470
Good-bye.

271
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,230
With huge waves are gone all those. Gallant heroes of bygone years.
(A Song Poem by Su Shi)

272
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,000
West of the ancient fortress appears.

273
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,110
At Red Cliff General Zhou won fame during the Three Kingdom.

274
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,760
Rocks tower in the air and waves teat on the shore.

275
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,160
Rolling up a thousand heaps of snow.

276
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Zhou Siyue is off for the National Olympiad.

277
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,640
Not until now do I notice

278
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,400
that it's so hard to get used to the days

279
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,640
without a deskmate.

280
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,760
It seems as if he went to

281
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,310
a battlefield alone.

282
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,680
It may just be my illusion.

283
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,230
After all,

284
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,470
he should be very familiar with

285
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,310
this kind of competition life.

286
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,710
Who would pluck them?
(A Song Poem by Li Qingzhao)

287
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,400
Leaning on the window, how can I pass the time till night alone?

288
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,760
The drizzle falls on the buttonwood trees.

289
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,560
Rain-drops drip down at dusk.

290
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,680
As a time like this, what immense sorrow I must bear!

291
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,160
I always feel that he will go to a bigger

292
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,830
and broader world.

293
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,710
By his light,

294
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,830
I've also glimpsed what the broad world looks like.

295
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,800
I come to realize

296
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,520
that I also want to go there.

297
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,190
I don't want to be left behind.

298
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,430
I've heard that there's no

299
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,310
recruitment plan for the Shot Put Team.

300
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,640
Fine, fine, fine.

301
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,470
What are you doing here?

302
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,110
What? You frightened me!

303
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,590
Are you tailing after someone?

304
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,110
No, I'm not.

305
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,350
How stubborn you are!

306
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,640
Song Ziqi

307
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,640
I understand he didn't wait for me after class.

308
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,590
How dare he walk with another girl!

309
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,640
Piss me off!

310
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,640
Are you jealous?

311
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,760
I'm not.

312
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,000
I'll go home.

313
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,920
Well,

314
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,190
do you have any good idea?

315
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,190
I haven't come up with one,

316
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,000
but I'm a little bit hungry.

317
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,590
I see.

318
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,280
I'll treat you. Let's go!

319
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,160
Xianxian

320
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,590
Shadi, Keke.

321
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,920
Xianxian

322
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,230
Why do you study so hard recently?

323
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,760
Monthly test is coming.

324
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,400
I should be fully prepared.

325
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,560
When did you two hang out together?

326
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,430
Hello. May I help you?

327
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,400
Two lemonades.

328
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,350
Okay.

329
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,710
I thought you didn't care about Song Ziqi.

330
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,350
If the dog you raised from childhood ran with someone else,

331
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,430
wouldn't you feel anxious?

332
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,160
If I'm angry,

333
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,350
Song Ziqi also cannot live cozily!

334
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,920
I have an idea.

335
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,400
You can also find someone else to hang out.

336
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,350
Make him jealous.

337
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,520
You can organize a party.

338
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,680
Invite all classmates in front of him

339
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,950
except for him.

340
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,070
Let's see what his reaction is.

341
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
Good idea!

342
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,680
My birthday happens to be coming.

343
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,190
I'll organize a birthday party this weekend.

344
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,350
You must come there at that time!

345
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
When did you two

346
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,310
become such good friends?

347
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,520
You friends are also my friends.

348
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,830
Are you coming or not?

349
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,070
Of course. I'm sure I'll go there.

350
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,280
Here are your drinks.

351
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,800
-Thank you.  –Thank you.

352
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,520
You're welcome.

353
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,310
Why are you here?

354
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,350
Why didn't you say hello to me?

355
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,430
Let me sip yours. I'm dying of thirst!

356
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,470
Buy it by yourself!

357
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,040
I'll drink…

358
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,000
Song Ziqi

359
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,280
What's wrong by drinking yours?

360
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,190
How stingy you are!

361
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,830
Thank you.

362
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,710
Come on. Let's go home.

363
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,710
Go back yourself.

364
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,230
I'll go with Keke today.

365
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,000
Alright.

366
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,800
I'll go alone. Bye-bye.

367
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,520
Do you think

368
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,470
it's an indirect kiss?

369
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,760
Okay. I see.

370
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,640
Wait for me in the billiard room.

371
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,520
We should stop here. I'll hang up now.

372
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,190
Hello, Siyue!

373
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,880
Aren't you in the training camp?

374
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,640
Yes.

375
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,800
Do me a favor.

376
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,920
Take care of the little monster.

377
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,830
Guys! I'll hold a birthday party this weekend.

378
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,310
Come together!

379
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,400
Okay. Who will be there?

380
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
Just me, Ding Xian,

381
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,680
and a girl in Class Ten.

382
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,830
Only three of us.

383
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,830
Come over there. All of you!

384
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,310
Okay!

385
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,350
Good. They two will just play for these days.

386
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,160
Will you come or not?

387
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,110
Kong Shadi, what do you do in your birthday party?

388
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,190
In my birthday party?

389
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,880
We just sing, have dinner,

390
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
and play billiard.

391
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,680
Whatever you want to do.

392
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,400
You have fun, and my father pays the bill!

393
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,920
-Is it great?  -Really?

394
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,680
Don't cheat us!

395
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,640
For what?

396
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,160
I can prove it.

397
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,560
The party last year was even bigger than this year's.

398
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,760
To be honest, it was really interesting.

399
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,190
Count me in.

400
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,710
Count you in.

401
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,800
Who else?

402
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,640
Remember to come to me after class!

403
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,880
Come to me! Come to me!

404
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,800
Come to me after class! Did you hear me?

405
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,520
Your Highness

406
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,230
Are you going to celebrate your great birthday?

407
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,000
What a big scale!

408
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,110
Don't you know there will be a monthly test

409
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,880
after the National Day holiday?

410
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,070
Can you all get full marks

411
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,110
or achieve something like that?

412
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,040
Can you?

413
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,040
No.

414
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,640
Then cancel it!

415
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,800
Do your homework!

416
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,230
You two are awake?

417
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,640
I'm coming!

418
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,880
Xianxian

419
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,280
Shadi, Keke.

420
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,280
Come in.

421
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,760
No need to change your shoes.

422
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,280
I was just mopping the floor.

423
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,880
Come in.

424
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Have a seat.

425
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,110
Are you alone at home?

426
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,280
My mom went out with my little brother.

427
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,430
My father went back to Keshan.

428
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,190
Why did you come here?

429
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,070
To invite you to my birthday party!

430
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,230
After being criticized by Auntie,

431
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,950
didn't you say you wouldn't organize it?

432
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,800
Forget it.

433
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,110
Song Ziqi, the bastard,

434
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,520
has no reaction at all!

435
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,110
But it doesn't hinder us three

436
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,190
to hang out together!

437
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,880
But

438
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,230
I still have so much homework to do.

439
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Are you nuts?

440
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,470
Today's my birthday, Ding Xian.

441
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,760
Yes. How about that?

442
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,190
Take your homework with us.

443
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,560
Okay.

444
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
So, let's go!

445
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,470
Ding Xian. Are you going to wear these

446
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,880
to celebrate birthday with us?

447
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,070
What's wrong with these clothes?

448
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,110
I knew it.

449
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,830
Thankfully, I prepared this.

450
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,470
Here you are. Wear it.

451
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,800
What's this?

452
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,710
You celebrate your birthday.

453
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,070
Why should I wear it?

454
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,950
If I wear it, nobody's going to notice.

455
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,350
Try it on.

456
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,230
Hang on.

457
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,350
What's the matter again?

458
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,760
What's wrong with your jarhead?

459
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,880
Don't mention it!

460
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,230
Of course it's her who is to blame!

461
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,160
Alright. Let me handle it for you.

462
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,040
Let's go!

463
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,280
How will you fix it?

464
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,470
I'll help you to trim your jarhead.

465
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,760
Will it become…

466
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,760
If you keep doing it, I'll go back!

467
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,800
It's the most boring birthday

468
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,110
I've ever celebrated!

469
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,280
How miserable I am!

470
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,520
Well… How about shopping?

471
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,280
Boring.

472
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,400
How about the amusement park?

473
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,590
Boring.

474
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,640
Then what on earth do you want?

475
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,760
I want a buzz.

476
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,230
I want a party.

477
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,800
I want him to hang out with me!

478
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,190
I know you are all here.

479
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,230
Aren't you celebrating your birthday?

480
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,190
Where are others?

481
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,280
The birthday party has been canceled.

482
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,590
Didn't you say you wouldn't come?

483
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,470
Why didn't I come?

484
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,680
I went to each of your birthday party!

485
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,430
This is your present.

486
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,880
Don't ask me for more this year.

487
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,230
What's the matter? Your Highness?

488
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,800
She just wants a buzz,

489
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,880
a party,

490
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,800
and others to hang out with her.

491
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,350
It's not a big deal.

492
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,040
Come on. Let's go to karaoke together.

493
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,280
I'll contact my classmates for you.

494
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,350
Ask more to come here.

495
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,560
Really?

496
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:37,800
Okay.

497
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,280
Xianxian, let's go together.

498
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,280
You go and have fun.

499
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,760
I should finish doing the paper first.

500
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,040
Today's my birthday!

501
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,800
I want you to be with me!

502
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,350
I'm not really good at singing, actually.

503
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,350
I'm afraid I'll spoil your spirits.

504
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,110
After the monthly test,

505
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,160
I guarantee that I'll make it up to you.

506
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,280
I swear.

507
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,880
Just let her go home.

508
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,110
Or her parents will be worried.

509
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,640
Alright.

510
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,040
Be careful when you go back home.

511
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,190
We'll go now.

512
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:08,710
Okay.

513
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:09,560
Bye-bye.

514
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,880
Bye-bye.

515
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,880
Zhou Siyue

516
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,640
The monthly test is coming.

517
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,680
If I can't get good grades this time,

518
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,760
my parents will transfer me to a liberal arts class.

519
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,110
I feel so nervous!

520
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,710
Give me two.

521
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,350
Okay.

522
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,430
Here you are. Hold them.

523
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,110
Thank you.

524
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,190
Let's go.

525
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,040
Excuse me. I need a bottle of water.

526
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,000
Okay.

527
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,520
Here's your change.

528
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,040
Hold it.

529
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,920
Okay. Thank you.

530
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,520
Hello. May I help you?

531
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,280
A bottle of water, please.

532
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,760
Okay.

533
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,560
Your phone's here!

534
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,400
You! Thief! Stop!

535
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,640
Hello. What's the matter?

536
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,430
Siyue

537
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Ding Xian is being followed by someone.

538
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,800
Where is she?

539
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,190
I'll go there first.

540
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,760
Stop!

541
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,280
Go to find her.

542
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,950
Thief! Give me my phone!

543
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,190
What if I don't give it to you?

544
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,400
Bro, you're here.

545
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,920
It's you.

546
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,190
Stop!

547
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,350
Come back!

548
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,040
Come down right now!

549
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,680
Don't run!

550
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,640
Come back!

551
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,430
Stop!

552
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,280
Come back!

553
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,470
Song Ziqi. Come back now.

554
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,280
Something's wrong.

555
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,280
Open the door! Open the door!

556
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:24,920
Get out!

557
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,920
Open the door! Get out!

558
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,400
Open the door! Hurry up!

559
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,280
Open the door!

560
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,350
Open the door! Get out right now!

561
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,230
Get out right now!

562
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,230
Do you think you're safe in there?

563
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:35,830
Open the door!

564
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,110
Hurry up! Get out!

565
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,190
Open the door! Open it!

566
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,640
Open the door!

567
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,000
What are you doing here?

568
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,950
Are you the one we met last time?

569
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,800
Let me tell you.

570
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,350
It has nothing to do with you.

571
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,070
Leave us alone!

572
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,470
What if I don't leave?

573
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,070
What are you doing?

574
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,400
Want a fight?

575
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,280
Fuck you!

576
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,160
Fight with us?

577
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,110
Bastard!

578
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,950
Look how weak you are!

579
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,470
You piece of shit!

580
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,230
Siyue

581
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,880
Are you okay?

582
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,430
Come on!

583
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,360
Siyue

584
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,670
What's going on?

585
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,389
Who are you?

586
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
If you don't want to die, piss off!

587
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,280
Go.

588
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,760
Go. Hurry up!

589
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,800
Ding Xian

590
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,280
Xianxian

591
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,710
Are you okay?

592
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,870
I feel so worried!

593
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,909
I'll accompany her home now.

594
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,280
Let's leave here right away.

595
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:54,000
Or they'll ask more to come here.

596
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,670
Let's go.

597
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,430
Go, go, go!

598
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,360
Well, I haven't celebrated my birthday.

599
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,150
Let's go to celebrate your birthday.

600
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,390
Let's sing! Go, go, go!

601
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,470
Alright.

602
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,560
Go upstairs now.

603
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,040
Are you hurt?

604
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,320
No.

605
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,080
How come?

606
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,470
Don't worry.

607
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,320
From now on,

608
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,000
they dare not make trouble on you anymore.

609
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,910
How did you find me?

610
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,360
Jiang Chen

611
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,280
stumbled upon someone following you.

612
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,840
So he called me.

613
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,470
Did you see the message I texted to you?

614
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,670
Yes, I saw it.

615
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,080
You

616
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,390
just relax.

617
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,360
Don't give too much pressure on yourself.

618
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,910
I got a good grade of mathematics last week.

619
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,870
So I think I'll reach my goal in the monthly test.

620
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,360
It seems that you can still

621
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,230
get good grades without me around.

622
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,630
Of course.

623
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,520
No.

624
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,360
If you're around,

625
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,520
I can do better.

626
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,320
Alright.

627
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,000
Go upstairs.

628
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,320
Okay.

629
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,150
Zhou Siyue. You are sure to get good results.

630
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,840
And I will also stay in the natural science class.

631
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,150
Fighting!

632
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,600
Fighting!

633
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:04,800
I'm leaving.

634
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,320
Mom! You scared me!

635
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,280
Oh, you know you should come back.

636
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,840
I…

637
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,080
Whose clothes are you wearing?

638
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,710
A classmate of mine.

639
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,600
Today's her birthday.

640
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,040
So we hung out together.

641
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,320
Good for you.

642
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,230
Your monthly test is coming.

643
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,670
If you don't get good grades…

644
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,600
I see!

645
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,000
Mom. I will study hard.

646
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,280
Hello.

647
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,320
Did you come back?

648
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,840
I'm in my dormitory.

649
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,950
When you came back, were you criticized?

650
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,560
How come?

651
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,000
Teachers didn't notice it.

652
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,230
That's great.

653
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,800
I felt at ease when

654
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,600
I heard your voice.

655
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,430
Didn't you say you would study hard?

656
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,470
If you leave the camp without permission,

657
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,150
you will be disqualified!

658
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,360
Do you know it or not?

659
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,470
Where did you go?

660
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,470
Are you going to tell me or not?

661
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,040
If you aren't,

662
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,800
run ten laps around the playground right now!

663
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,670
Reflect on what you've done!
