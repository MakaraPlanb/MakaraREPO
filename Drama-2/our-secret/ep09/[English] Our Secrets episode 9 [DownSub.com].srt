Our Secret
EP09

2
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,479
Didn't you say you wanted to study?

3
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,479
You didn't even open your book.

4
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,800
I was just about to open it.

5
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,509
Mom, you can go back to rest.

6
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,910
I will study.

7
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,360
Take it out.

8
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,630
Whom did you call just now?

9
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,000
My classmate.

10
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,160
What classmate?

11
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,320
It's so late now.

12
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,829
I asked him about the homework today.

13
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,320
Mom

14
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,520
I promise I won't

15
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,670
chat with classmates at night.

16
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,960
I'll keep it for you first.

17
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,550
It's for your own good.

18
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,000
Study hard and don't be distracted.

19
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,880
Remember to eat the fruit.

20
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,880
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

21
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,470
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

22
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,240
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

23
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,360
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

24
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,670
Happy birthday!

25
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,670
Thank you.

26
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,240
Make a birthday wish.

27
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,550
In one breath.

28
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,750
OK.

29
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,470
No need to thank me.

30
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,630
Just have fun.

31
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,360
Enjoy yourselves.

32
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,000
Kong Shadi, really it's you here.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Haven't seen you for a long time.

34
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:37,720
It's us.

35
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,960
We were playmates in junior high.

36
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:40,880
Remember?

37
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,550
You are...

38
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,360
That's unimportant.

39
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,470
The point is that

40
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,390
you're more and more beautiful.

41
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,320
You didn't invite us both

42
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,960
to your birthday party.

43
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,390
What happened?

44
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,440
I only invited my classmates this time.

45
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,880
I'll invite you next time.

46
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,630
Don't wait until next time.

47
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,190
Come to join us. Let's go.

48
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,320
No, no.

49
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,670
Didn't you hear her say no?

50
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,550
Who are you?

51
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,080
It's not up to you to tell me what to do.

52
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,080
You don't know I'm from No.18 Middle School.

53
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,550
Right?

54
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,960
It doesn't matter who I am.

55
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,510
Do you know Jiang Chen?

56
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,510
Of course.

57
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,440
I was with him just now.

58
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,760
He's my childhood friend.

59
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
What are your names?

60
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,790
I'll phone and ask him.

61
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,320
Wait a moment.

62
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,480
No no no, forget it.

63
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,480
Don't bother Chen.

64
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,640
It was all a big mistake, bro.

65
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,920
Since you're the friend of Chen

66
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,950
we won't bother you.

67
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,390
We.

68
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,000
We're leaving.

69
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,070
We're just kidding.

70
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,640
-Happy birthday.  -Happy birthday.

71
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,880
Bye.

72
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,040
-Ziqi, you're so cool.  -Cool.

73
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,270
Keep a low profile.

74
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,640
Enjoy yourselves.

75
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,320
I'll find someone to cut the cake.

76
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:56,950
Why are you looking at me?

77
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,000
You don't have enough friends?

78
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,920
lt is none of your business.

79
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,640
How can you be friends with them?

80
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,440
You don't learn from good examples.

81
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,000
Is it not enough for you to have me?

82
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,830
Studying hard with me is the most important.

83
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,600
Do you hear me?

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,830
Do you hear me?

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,920
Yes.

86
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,040
Let's play games.

87
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,390
Any advice?

88
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,830
Word chain.

89
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,270
You're bored.

90
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,480
-So boring.  -Listen to the birthday girl.

91
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,040
Shadi, Shadi, what's your opinion?

92
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,760
What do you want to play?

93
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,720
Word chain.

94
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,510
Look! Look!

95
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,480
Mr. Liu

96
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,640
How's it going? Have you figured it out?

97
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,880
Yes.

98
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,950
The abscissa of point P is one.

99
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,550
You are sure to win the prize.

100
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,950
Let me tell you about the last question.

101
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,880
Many students...

102
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,070
Is that what I asked you?

103
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,790
Will you tell me

104
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,320
where you went last night?

105
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,920
Siyue, if you have something on your mind

106
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,110
you can tell me.

107
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,110
I understand you.

108
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,270
But do not keep them bottled up.

109
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,390
Understand?

110
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,070
Yes.

111
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll tell you next time.

112
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,720
What? You.

113
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,040
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

114
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,270
You little brat.

115
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,670
Mr. Liu

116
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,880
I know where Zhou Siyue went last night.

117
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,200
You are everywhere.

118
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,880
Wait.

119
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,440
Tell me. Where did he go last night?

120
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,070
Hello. What's up?

121
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,000
Where is she?

122
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,600
I'll go there first.

123
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,830
You go to get others.

124
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,000
Little Monster

125
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,590
Help.

126
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,710
Please give me your English homework.

127
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,590
Why don't you borrow Childe Zhou's?

128
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,470
He has just finished the competition and is sleeping.

129
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,590
How dare I wake him up?

130
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,880
So I have to settle for second best

131
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,150
and copy yours grudgingly.

132
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,790
Don't take your undeserved gain for granted.

133
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,550
Xianxian

134
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,230
Please give me your math homework.

135
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
You two are definitely deskmates.

136
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,150
Thank you.

137
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,000
The monthly quiz results have come.

138
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,350
The class supervisor also said

139
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,280
he would talk with us

140
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
one by one.

141
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,320
Be prepared.

142
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,710
How did it happen?

143
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,470
Yes!

144
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,280
What's wrong?

145
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,320
My score of natural science is 270.

146
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,760
A perfect pass.

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,030
I said I would stay here.

148
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,230
By the way

149
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,790
my mom confiscated my phone.

150
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,320
So we can't call at night.

151
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,400
Nobody wants to call you.

152
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,520
You called me.

153
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,790
You.

154
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,030
Don't you remember?

155
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,200
Who?

156
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,150
It's you.

157
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,400
You called me.

158
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,200
Who did you mean?

159
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,320
Don't touch my hair.

160
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,350
-Say it again.  -What are you doing?

161
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,550
Concentrate on self-study.

162
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,880
Why are you so happy? A stroke of luck?

163
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,710
Mom, let me show you something.

164
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,640
So

165
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,230
I can stay in science class, right?

166
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,790
You did well enough in this quiz.

167
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,880
It's nothing to me.

168
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,880
In fact, science is not as difficult as you think.

169
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,880
But, Xianxian.

170
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,910
Although you did well this time

171
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,230
-in fact...  -Stop.

172
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,710
Mom, we came to an agreement.

173
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
It's dishonest of you to go back on your word.

174
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,440
All right, all right, all right.

175
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,670
Anyway, you choose your own way.

176
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,960
Go by yourself.

177
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,080
Then you know it's hard.

178
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,760
Well.

179
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,670
Mom.

180
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,880
I have finished the exam.

181
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,670
I want...

182
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,590
I know what you're thinking.

183
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,640
Thank you, mom.

184
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,840
Have fun. Pride comes before a fall.

185
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,840
The monthly quiz this time

186
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,280
is relatively simple.

187
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Although your score has improved greatly

188
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,640
your ranking is still relatively low.

189
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,030
Never take it lightly.

190
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,230
OK, Mr. Liu.

191
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,670
Ding Xian

192
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,280
One more thing.

193
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,840
I saw you chat a lot

194
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
in class with Zhou Siyue recently.

195
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,960
Did he affect your study?

196
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,400
No, Mr. Liu. He didn't affect me.

197
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,520
But someone did tell me

198
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,150
you two had been so close lately.

199
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,320
And you often go out together after school.

200
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,960
Ding Xian, there's no time to waste.

201
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,550
Focus on your study now.

202
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,030
This is not the case.

203
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,110
Our relationship is not what you think.

204
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,590
Well, change seats with Song Ziqi

205
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,670
after going back.

206
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,320
I'll study hard when I go back.

207
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,880
We won't chat in class.

208
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,150
Don't worry, Mr. Liu.

209
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,960
If I don't make progress

210
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,000
in the next monthly quiz

211
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,550
I'll change seats

212
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,000
on my own.

213
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,400
Who told Auntie?

214
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,840
So gossipy.

215
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,080
Don't ever let me know.

216
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,590
I guess it must be a girl.

217
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,470
She was jealous of your close relationship.

218
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,640
Watch what you say.

219
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,670
We're merely deskmates.

220
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,230
Maybe we won't be deskmates later.

221
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,520
Why?

222
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,590
Auntie asked me to change seats.

223
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,150
He said it would affect my study.

224
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,640
No way.

225
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,790
Why do all teachers like this?

226
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,400
Not only that

227
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,670
he asked me to change seats with Song Ziqi.

228
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,110
You can't.

229
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,440
Don't you dislike him?

230
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,200
I was just speaking casually. I don't mind.

231
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,710
I smell a rat.

232
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,960
When we went to KTV that day

233
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,520
he was angry when he saw

234
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,640
I was singing with other boys.

235
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,350
He just sat there without a word.

236
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,710
Finally, he took me home.

237
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,640
I suddenly felt

238
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,840
he was a little different that day.

239
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,590
Fickle.

240
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,710
You weren't like this the other day.

241
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,280
You were mad to see him

242
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,030
walking with the girl.

243
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,760
That was a mistake.

244
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,200
He told me later

245
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,000
they just discussed

246
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,440
the basketball game.

247
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,960
How did you know that?

248
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,080
I went to her that day to find it out.

249
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,880
Hello.

250
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,880
What's up?

251
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,670
She is actually a national

252
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,910
second level shot-putter.

253
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,350
She almost killed me.

254
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,760
Stop talking about me.

255
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,710
When do you change seats?

256
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,550
Maybe after the monthly quiz.

257
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,520
It depends on my quiz result.

258
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,440
Ding Xian

259
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,910
Can you solve this problem?

260
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
I've been stuck for a long time.

261
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,520
Let me have a look.

262
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,350
The function

263
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,350
of ordinate.

264
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,760
Answer.

265
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,760
R is greater than B.

266
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,080
RX proves...

267
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,150
1025.

268
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,280
X equals 1025.

269
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,110
So accurate.

270
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,470
What about this one?

271
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,760
I'll try again.

272
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,910
547.

273
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,400
Nine o'clock.

274
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,320
547.

275
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,350
You can count in your head?

276
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Don't you feel tired of solving problems all the time?

277
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,960
I mean, rack your brain.

278
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
No, I don't.

279
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,320
I'll do reading comprehension for relax

280
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,520
when I feel tired.

281
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,150
You're a real brain box.

282
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,150
Let's go on.

283
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,200
I still couldn't understand this question.

284
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,470
Can you teach me with your method?

285
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,760
Superficial knowledge is enough.

286
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,670
OK.

287
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,030
If you can't solve the problem later

288
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,790
you can ask me directly.

289
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,760
OK, OK.

290
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,080
Zhou Siyue

291
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,350
Let's play basketball.

292
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,960
You called me out so early for this?

293
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,000
Haven't you heard

294
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,520
a saying from my idol?

295
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,150
Have ever seen the scene

296
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,840
of Shenhai at 4 a.m.?

297
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,590
It's six o'clock.

298
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,230
They're the same.

299
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,440
Hardship increases status.

300
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,550
I haven't seen you study so hard.

301
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,640
What's the matter with you lately?

302
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,200
It's just a competition.

303
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,350
Why are you so tired?

304
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,000
Competition is not tiring

305
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,840
but explaining problems is.

306
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,710
You're so strange.

307
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,710
Liu Xiaofeng is not much of your friend.

308
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,160
Why are you explaining problems to him every day?

309
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,950
Nobody else here.

310
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,800
I'm leaving.

311
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,829
They will be here soon.

312
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,190
The game is coming.

313
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,190
Everyone will train against the clock.

314
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,800
I won't take part in the game.

315
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,470
Why should I train?

316
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,920
Don't you want to see

317
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,950
pretty girls cheering for you?

318
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,040
Don't you want to

319
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,230
help me teach Class Eight a lesson?

320
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,350
It's none of my business.

321
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
But I signed you up.

322
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,280
Nobody can change it.

323
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,950
Come on.

324
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,190
I'll go back to bed.

325
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,430
Practice hard.

326
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,760
Xianxian

327
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,350
Why didn't you go to the basketball game?

328
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,350
Nothing special.

329
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,520
I'm preparing for the monthly quiz.

330
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,400
Zhou Siyue is also the player.

331
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,560
You don't want to go?

332
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,280
Didn't he refuse to take part in it?

333
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,000
Don't you know Song Ziqi?

334
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,950
He must grab Zhou Siyue

335
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,590
no matter what he does.

336
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,950
Class Eight is too arrogant.

337
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,680
They're showing off because they have

338
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,880
posters and banners.

339
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,310
Why not print one?

340
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,430
We're not afraid of them.

341
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,400
But it's too late to print now.

342
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,520
Do you have any cardboards?

343
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,830
I can draw.

344
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,830
How can I forget you?

345
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,070
I'll bring some paper.

346
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,760
Bring it.

347
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,590
Hurry up. Come on.

348
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,520
Here you are.

349
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,920
You guys, come here.

350
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,040
What's the most in science class?

351
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,950
Right.

352
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,560
Boys.

353
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,230
Today is the time for Class Three to distinguish ourselves.

354
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,160
Just do it.

355
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
But they have cheerleaders.

356
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,560
And megaphones.

357
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,000
Come on, Class Eight!

358
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,040
Come on, Class Eight!

359
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,040
Come on, Class Eight!

360
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,920
Come on, Class Eight!

361
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,950
Come on, Class Eight!

362
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,880
So what?

363
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,950
We have Childe Siyue.

364
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,950
Right?

365
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,190
Please do me a favor, bro.

366
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,160
If you don't go, girls won't watch either.

367
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,040
I told you I didn't want to play today.

368
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,710
Suit yourself.

369
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,230
Come here, guys.

370
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,590
Come on.

371
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,310
One two three. Come on.

372
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,470
Ding Xian, you draw very well.

373
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,950
I'm leaving. Thank you.

374
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,800
Thank you. Bye.

375
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,920
Thank you. Bye.

376
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,680
OK. Let's go.

377
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,680
Wait a moment.

378
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,830
Xianxian

379
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,830
Can you draw another one for me?

380
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,000
Write "Song Ziqi is handsome" on it.

381
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,190
Something's wrong with you.

382
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,040
Help me.

383
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,520
OK. Song Ziqi is handsome.

384
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,400
What do you mean?

385
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,710
OK. I'll draw it for you.

386
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,430
Come on!

387
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,560
Come on, Class Eight!

388
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,400
Come on, Class Eight!

389
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Come on, Class Eight! Come on, Class Eight!

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,400
Come on, Class Eight!

391
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,710
How did you pass the ball?

392
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,400
Stop dawdling.

393
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,040
The game has already begun.

394
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,880
Don't rush us.

395
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,230
Don't you see we're busy now?

396
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,880
Done.

397
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,880
So good-looking.

398
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,400
Look. Is it good-looking?

399
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,040
This one is for Zhou Siyue.

400
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,310
I prepared it for you.

401
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,160
It's so kind of you.

402
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,830
Well, you win.

403
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,280
Naive.

404
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,950
No, Class Eight is too aggressive.

405
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,880
I can't hold out.

406
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,040
Hurry to enter the court, Childe.

407
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,190
I'm too tired to play.

408
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,230
You.

409
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,110
You've performed below par?

410
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,950
Yang Chunzi

411
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,400
I'm glad that you bring me water.

412
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,880
But you're in Class Eight now.

413
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,710
I'll feel awkward if you do this.

414
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,040
Siyue, drink water.

415
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,590
Thank you.

416
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,880
Put on airs.

417
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,520
Don't you think she's a hypocrite?

418
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,710
She has the same expression

419
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,830
no matter she's happy or not.

420
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,920
Yes indeed.

421
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,520
They're not in the same class now.

422
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,230
Does she specialize in water delivery?

423
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,230
What are you laughing at?

424
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,400
We're on your side.

425
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,800
Who's tired?

426
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,350
I can't make it. I can't make it.

427
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,110
You can have a rest.

428
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,950
Finally you're awake, bro.

429
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,160
Let's go.

430
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,520
Come on. Come on.

431
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,190
Zhou Siyue. Come on. Come on.

432
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,310
Zhou Siyue. Come on. Come on.

433
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,710
Zhou Siyue, you can do it!

434
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,830
Come on, Zhou Siyue.

435
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,000
Come on, Class Three!

436
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,760
Come on, Class Three!

437
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,560
Come on, Class Three!

438
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,560
Come on, Class Three!

439
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,040
Bravo, Zhou Siyue!

440
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,430
Where is your energy of misbehaving?

441
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,830
We can't lose in momentum.

442
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,830
Shout.

443
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,590
Zhou Siyue, you're the best.

444
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,520
Come on, Class Three!

445
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,230
Come on, Class Three!

446
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,000
Come on, Class Three!

447
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,680
Come on, Class Three!

448
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,000
Come on, Class Three!

449
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,470
Zhou is great.

450
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,230
Pretty? Are you blind?

451
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,160
One day has passed.

452
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,760
Why hasn't Siyue come yet?

453
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,920
Did he ask for leave?

454
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,520
We're not

455
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,280
inseparable, right?

456
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,470
I have a piece of good news.

457
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,190
In the math competition of our city

458
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,280
Zhou Siyue

459
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,000
doesn't let us down.

460
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,710
He has won the first place in our city.

461
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,160
Deng Wanwan

462
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,110
Hang the award on the wall.

463
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,830
Zhou Siyue is so brilliant.

464
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,590
Don't be discouraged if you don't

465
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,560
get the ranking this time.

466
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,470
There are many chances in the future.

467
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,040
Look forward.

468
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,160
OK. Stop discussing.

469
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,800
Start your free study class.

470
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,430
Zhou Siyue deserves to be Mr. Liu's son.

471
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,560
What's your meaning?

472
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,560
Let me tell you.

473
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,560
Zhou Siyue was found sneaking out

474
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,280
the night before the competition.

475
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,400
He was still qualified to participate in the competition.

476
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,070
Now he won the first place through the back door.

477
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,350
I can't catch up with him

478
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,000
in this field.

479
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,800
Watch what you say.

480
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,560
He Xingwen, can you be less jealous?

481
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,230
Siyue has won honour in the basketball match

482
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,520
for our class.

483
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,000
He also comes out in front in math.

484
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,070
What? You're jealous, aren't you?

485
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,830
I'm jealous?

486
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,190
Why am I jealous?

487
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,520
I just think it's unfair.

488
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,350
Why is the teacher so partial to him?

489
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,800
I heard Siyue was also punished.

490
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,680
He seemed to have run ten laps in the playground.

491
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,350
Ten laps?

492
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,680
Only ten laps after such a big mistake.

493
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,280
Isn't that obvious favoritism?

494
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,590
If you think it's unfair

495
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,760
you can tell the teacher.

496
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,070
Why do you comment on him behind his back?

497
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,230
That's all what you can do now?

498
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,160
Right.

499
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,800
-Why don't you mention it just now?  -Right.

500
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,520
Why don't you mention it just now?

501
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,350
Zhou Siyue

502
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,040
Zhou Siyue

503
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,230
The light is on.

504
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,400
Zhou Siyue

505
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,350
Zhou Siyue

506
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,950
Zhou Siyue

507
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,040
Zhou Siyue

508
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,430
Who is it?

509
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
You have a cold?

510
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,800
I caught cold while playing basketball before.

511
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,230
It's so cold in your house.

512
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,950
You dare to open the window.

513
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,160
Aren't you afraid of getting worse?

514
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,800
It's you?

515
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,760
I didn't mean it.

516
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,920
It can ventilate your room.

517
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,950
It's good.

518
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,640
Where is your mother?

519
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,880
She

520
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,040
went out.

521
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,830
Have you eaten yet?

522
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,190
I just woke up.

523
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,280
I feel lazy.

524
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,110
Is there anything to eat at home?

525
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,920
Instant noodles?

526
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,520
Well.

527
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,470
Is it enough?

528
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,560
Soup?

529
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,000
It's porridge.

530
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,800
I cooked it for the first time.

531
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,830
It looks nice.

532
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,280
How does it taste?

533
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,520
Tasty.

534
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,590
Eat more.

535
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,710
I'll help myself.

536
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,070
I'll repair the window.

537
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,760
No.

538
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,590
It will hurt your hand.

539
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,110
Sit down.

540
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,070
Why did you visit me suddenly?

541
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,950
You have won the first place in the competition.

542
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,710
I want to tell you.

543
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,640
And

544
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,400
Mr. Liu punished you

545
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,920
because you

546
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,950
sneaked out, right?

547
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,560
Who told you?

548
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
Sorry.

549
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,070
Not because of you.

550
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,280
Are

551
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,190
you tired?

552
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,280
Yes.

553
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,560
But then what will happen?

554
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,909
I'm afraid you're too tired.

555
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,670
What if

556
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,280
you get depressed one day?

557
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,760
What will

558
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,320
you do if that day comes?

559
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,670
I will help you unconditionally

560
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,840
and stay with you.

561
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,040
Stupid.

562
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,600
I'm not as vulnerable as you think.

563
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,320
And

564
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,470
there must be many more difficulties in the future.

565
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,800
But I won't let you worry.

566
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,870
I'll get you a cup of hot water.

567
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,280
Not bad.

568
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,150
Ding Xian

569
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,080
Where did you put

570
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,950
those dirty clothes?

571
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,080
I'll bring them to you later.

572
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,840
What are you doing?

573
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,120
Your cooking?

574
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,950
It's terrible.

575
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,230
Ding Xian, don't cook anymore.

576
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,000
It's dark cuisine.

577
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,950
You eat my cooking and blame me.

578
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,280
-Ding Xian.  -Come here.

579
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,630
Mom, what are you doing with my diary?

580
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,040
Ding Xian

581
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,470
How old are you?

582
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,000
You didn't put your mind on your study.

583
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,430
What are you thinking about?

584
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,430
You read my diary?

585
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,430
I won't know

586
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,430
what you have done if I don't read it.

587
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,840
I lost to him in the game room.

588
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,670
Mom, stop reading.

589
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,520
Isn't that what you write?

590
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,390
Why are you afraid to hear that?

591
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,080
Give me.

592
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,950
Give me your diary.

593
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,000
This doesn't end if you don't give me.

594
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,800
Give me.

595
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,000
What are you doing? Give me.

596
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,710
Are you satisfied?

597
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,520
I won't keep a diary anymore.

598
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,430
Suit yourself.

599
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,470
I tell you.

600
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,710
You're not allowed to go out from now on.

601
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,390
What are you doing?

602
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,390
I quarreled with my mother.

603
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,760
I threw out my diary.

604
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,080
Are you sure you threw it here?

605
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,000
I just saw a rag man pass by

606
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,120
on the other side.

607
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,280
Excuse me. Did you see a rag man?

608
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,670
He left early.

609
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,000
He left.

610
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,600
Don't cry.

611
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,150
I'm fine.

612
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,600
Let it go.

613
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,630
If you don't want to go home

614
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,040
stay in my house for a while.

615
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,600
Let's go.

616
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,470
Are you hungry?

617
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,230
You didn't have breakfast?

618
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,600
I cooked porridge and

619
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,840
wanted to bring it to you.

620
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,430
But I ran out in a fit of pique and couldn't get it back.

621
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,430
And

622
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,950
the porridge is terrible.

623
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,520
You're kidding me.

624
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,470
Maybe it's because I'm sick

625
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,870
so my taste sense doesn't work.

626
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,150
It seems that there is nothing to eat at home.

627
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,670
Only instant noodles.

628
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,360
Come on.

629
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,430
Seafood or braised beef flavor?

630
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,120
Either.

631
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,430
OK.

632
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,870
I'll boil the kettle.

633
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,760
It's done.

634
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,760
It's my first time to eat instant noodles.

635
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,800
Usually mom doesn't let me eat.

636
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,710
Your mother

637
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,630
treats you well.

638
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,950
Perhaps.

639
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,670
But she doesn't understand

640
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,000
or believe me.

641
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,390
She peeked at

642
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,430
my diary this time.

643
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,120
Your mother

644
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,710
did that because she

645
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,120
cared about you.

646
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,670
Your mother treats you really well.

647
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,280
By the way.

648
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,000
Let me show you something.

649
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,670
What's this?

650
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,870
My awarded work

651
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,080
in the robot competition.

652
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,600
Come on, D2-T3. Dance.

653
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,760
It's cute.

654
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,080
Why does it dance like Chaplin?

655
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,840
You know Chaplin?

656
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,360
Good.

657
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,950
How do you feel?

658
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,040
Feel better now?

659
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,120
Much better.

660
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,000
It's interesting.

661
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,950
A successful test.

662
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,670
Test?

663
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,360
It

664
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,800
is actually a comedian robot.

665
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,870
It specializes in treating

666
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,910
patients with mental diseases.

667
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,470
You're with mental disease.

668
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:38,760
Well. Hurry up.

669
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,230
I'll take you home after finishing it.

670
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:43,840
I don't want to go back yet.

671
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,840
Can I stay here for one night?
