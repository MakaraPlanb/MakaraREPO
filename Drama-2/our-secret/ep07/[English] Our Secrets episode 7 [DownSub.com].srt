Our Secret

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,759
Siyue

3
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,360
Let's play billiards this Sunday.

4
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,950
What are you planning?

5
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,160
Count me in.

6
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,270
I'll think about it.

7
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,120
The math competition is approaching.

8
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,000
Xianxian, you can join us.

9
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,039
I can't play billiards.

10
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,440
Neither can I.

11
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,120
Anyway,

12
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,230
you just aim at the billiard ball and poke it.

13
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,800
That's so embarrassing. I don't want to go with you.

14
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,910
Oh my!

15
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,910
I don't want to go with you, either.

16
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,670
Well, let's go with them.

17
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,550
I can teach you how to play billiards.

18
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,320
Yeah!

19
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,520
How about asking Jiang Chen to join us?

20
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,470
Forget it.

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,550
He's too good at it. We don't want to embarrass ourselves.

22
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,110
If you can't see clearly, just tell me.

23
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,190
I can take the notes for you.

24
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,829
You need to focus on your competition paper.

25
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,750
I can finish it on time.

26
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,910
Dinner is ready.

27
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,270
I'm coming.

28
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,440
Hurry up.

29
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,440
Here you are.

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,750
Mom

31
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,240
I want to discuss something with you.

32
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,030
I want to change a pair of stronger glasses.

33
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,960
Your nearsightedness has gotten worse?

34
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Yeah.

35
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,550
Xianxian, it was just pseudo myopia before.

36
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,190
Wearing glasses is to correct visual acuity.

37
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,190
How could it get worse?

38
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,470
I have no idea. I can't see clearly sometimes.

39
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,720
Which row of seats are you in now?

40
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,910
The fifth one.

41
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,440
Then you can talk to your teacher

42
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,390
to move your seat to the front row.

43
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,750
You'd better

44
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,440
not depend too much on glasses.

45
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,320
If your nearsightedness keeps getting worse,

46
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,600
you have to wear glasses all the time.

47
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,080
If you don't want to talk to the teacher yourself,

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,320
I can talk to him about it.

49
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,880
No. Forget it.

50
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,190
You dad told me that

51
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,880
the science-arts division is coming.

52
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,350
It comes just in time.

53
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,200
When you are in the arts class,

54
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,230
you can sit in the front row.

55
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,320
All will be settled then.

56
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,760
But I may choose science, too.

57
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,920
You are a girl. How can you learn science?

58
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,640
Why can't girls learn science?

59
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
I don't mean that girls can't learn science.

60
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,510
It's just girls are usually not good at learning science courses.

61
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:42,880
You must think that

62
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
there is little difference between your academic performance on the two courses.

63
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,640
The science courses will be much more difficult in the junior and senior years.

64
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:48,880
But ......

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,830
That's enough.

66
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,350
I have made the decision for you. Choose the arts class.

67
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,320
How can you say that?

68
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,790
This is my own business.

69
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,110
Don't I have the right to

70
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,350
make my own choice?

71
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,670
You don't know how to make a better choice.

72
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,760
I'm only telling you this for your own good!

73
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,670
And you dad can help you with the courses.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,040
So you can go to a better college.

75
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,040
We did this all

76
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,510
for your own good!

77
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,230
Stop arguing with me.

78
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,230
That's enough.

79
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,200
Calm down.

80
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,230
It is a very big deal.

81
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,720
We should talk it over.

82
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,320
Xianxian

83
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,880
Don't talk to your mom like that!

84
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,920
I'm full.

85
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,070
You can't educate children like that.

86
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,320
You are good at educating.

87
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,830
You really did a good job,

88
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,320
and she just left the table like that.

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,480
Xianxian, come online quickly.

90
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,830
Accept my friend request online.

91
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,110
Welcome Little Monster.

92
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,110
Put down your cell phone and do your homework carefully.

93
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,350
Xianxian

94
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,390
You told mom that you want a phone

95
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,230
a few days ago.

96
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,600
And we bought you

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,159
this one.

98
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,950
What's wrong?

99
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,350
Sorry, dad.

100
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,640
I lied to you.

101
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,950
About what?

102
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,390
Zhou Siyue lent me this.

103
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,510
I saw it this morning.

104
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,550
Well,

105
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,760
just return it

106
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,550
to him later.

107
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,640
Xianxian

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,350
Since we have bought you this mobile phone,

109
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,390
I'd like to make some rules for you.

110
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,640
First,

111
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,000
don't bring the phone to school.

112
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,200
It will distract you.

113
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,200
Second,

114
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,790
I hope you can think about

115
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,110
what your mom said to you just now.

116
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,440
She had a point there.

117
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,040
Dad, you also think

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,200
I should choose arts?

119
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,200
I have the same idea as your mother.

120
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,950
It's just that girls may suffer more

121
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,670
to learn science courses.

122
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,790
And we don't want you to go through this.

123
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,640
How about you, dad?

124
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,000
Why did you choose to major in politics?

125
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,110
Me?

126
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,280
I was not good at science courses.

127
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,080
And it shows exactly that

128
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,960
girls are good at arts courses

129
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,400
while boys are good at science courses

130
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,590
is not a correct theory.

131
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,640
By the way,

132
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,840
I get angry not because you don't want me to learn science.

133
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,280
I'm angry because you don't let me make the choice myself.

134
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,230
Xianxian

135
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,710
We did this because

136
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,280
we are afraid that you will make a wrong choice

137
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,080
and can't bear the consequences it may cause.

138
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,030
If you've made your determination,

139
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,470
I'll

140
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,960
respect your decision.

141
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,030
Thank you, dad.

142
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,470
And, yeah,

143
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,320
don't be angry with your mother anymore.

144
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,640
Her bark is worse than her bite.

145
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,880
You know that.

146
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,230
And

147
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,230
I think she may be going through menopause.

148
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,470
Okay.

149
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,520
I'm not mad at her anymore.

150
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,150
Honey.

151
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
You may do your homework now.

152
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,110
Hello, senior.

153
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,550
Could you please do me a favor

154
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,400
to give me some exercises and materials

155
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,080
of science for junior students?

156
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,550
This is the composition topic of this year's college entrance examination.

157
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,640
Finish it

158
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,590
in two classes.

159
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,150
These are exercises of science for junior students.

160
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,230
It's not that difficult.

161
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,840
Yeah.

162
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,440
I can handle all these now.

163
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,550
If I choose science

164
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,350
and work very hard,

165
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,200
maybe I can get better grades than you.

166
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,350
Miss...

167
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,880
What are you doing?

168
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,470
I've finished the composition.

169
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,960
Come to my office

170
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,760
before the noon self-study course.

171
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,280
Your composition is pretty good.

172
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,000
Your writing skills are not bad.

173
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,150
You'll choose the science class?

174
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,520
Mr. Liu

175
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,230
What's the matter with these girls of your class?

176
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,470
Kong Shadi said she wanted to choose the science class yesterday.

177
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,640
And so does her.

178
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,200
Have you handed in your application form for the science-arts division?

179
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,030
Not yet.

180
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,080
Think it twice.

181
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,760
May I come in?

182
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,670
Yes, please.

183
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,880
Mr. Liu

184
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,670
I want to participate in the math competition, too.

185
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,840
The Placement Test is about to come.

186
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,760
Can you handle all these?

187
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,440
Chinese is a very important lesson.

188
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,520
He Xingwen

189
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,280
Attending the competition is not the only way to go to a good college.

190
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,790
Your academic performance of all courses

191
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,470
is pretty good.

192
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,960
You can go to a good college by attending the college entrance examination.

193
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,550
Zhou Siyue can participate in the competition.

194
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,960
My academic performance is better than his.

195
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,640
Why can't I participate in the competition?

196
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,110
Very well.

197
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,230
Then you may

198
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
finish this paper first

199
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,520
and give it to me tomorrow.

200
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,710
Ding Xian, are you listening to me?

201
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,030
Yes, I am.

202
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,440
I'll think about it.

203
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,400
Well,

204
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,030
don't

205
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,640
do anything irrelevant to Chinese in my class.

206
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,880
Did our Chinese teacher criticize you?

207
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,550
Not really.

208
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,470
Zhou Siyue

209
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,110
Do you think that girls are more suitable to learn arts courses?

210
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
I don't see any connections between them.

211
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,840
Neither do I.

212
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,200
But my parents and our Chinese teacher all said

213
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,030
that girls should learn arts

214
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,790
and they don't want me to learn science.

215
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,280
Then do you think

216
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,520
you are good at arts or science?

217
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,840
On choosing arts or science,

218
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,790
you don't need to care about others' thoughts.

219
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,150
You just

220
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,760
make your own decision on the basis of

221
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
your interest.

222
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,790
I'll support you no matter what decision you'll make.

223
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,030
Really?

224
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,350
Will you support me

225
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,110
if I choose arts?

226
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,030
Of course.

227
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,670
Forget it.

228
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll take a nap first.

229
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,910
Deng Wanwan, what's wrong with you?

230
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,550
He Xingwen, are you the only one who has homework?

231
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,790
I don't have homework?

232
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,910
Don't you feel embarrassed

233
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,400
to make me do the cleaning

234
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,400
outside alone?

235
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,910
No one force you to do so.

236
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,840
And it's my own business to do it or not.

237
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,710
I'm busy preparing for the math competition

238
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,320
and have no spare time.

239
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,840
Don't be mad.

240
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,910
He Xingwen

241
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,280
How could you say that?

242
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,550
Zhou Siyue also participates in the competition.

243
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,230
And he never takes it as an excuse.

244
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,640
No wonder Mr. Liu likes him,

245
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,000
not you.

246
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,200
Everyone knows that you like Zhou Siyue.

247
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,640
What are you saying?

248
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,910
It's ridiculous.

249
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,640
Mr. Liu treats him so well just like his own son.

250
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,670
Maybe he will be recommended for admission to college.

251
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,080
He's the future student of top university.

252
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,350
I can't afford to offend him.

253
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,150
He Xingwen

254
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,110
I used to think that you're able to go to top university, too.

255
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,000
But now,

256
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,150
I think you can just go to an

257
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,080
ordinary college at most.

258
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,350
You can just mind your own business.

259
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,590
Why do you judge others like that?

260
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,910
If my friend can be recommended for admission to a prestigious university,

261
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,550
I'll be happy for him.

262
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah.

263
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,790
This is just sour grapes.

264
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,150
It's dangerous to have thoughts like this.

265
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
Not bad.

266
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,589
Our good girl knows how to lash out at somebody.

267
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,950
Thanks to you.

268
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,160
Silly girl.

269
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,430
Zhou Siyue

270
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,190
Actually, I'm not silly.

271
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,470
I know.

272
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,640
12 to 12.

273
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,350
You did scare me when

274
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,590
you lashed out at He Xingwen.

275
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,280
You are so brave!

276
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,470
I didn't think much of it at the time.

277
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,070
It's just that He Xingwen was way out of the line.

278
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,070
You begin to defend Zhou Siyue, now.

279
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,070
13 to 12.

280
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,950
Do you remember last time Mr. Liu said I violated the rules?

281
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,590
He was the first one that

282
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,070
defended me since I came to this city.

283
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,830
So now,

284
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,430
I'll defend him, too.

285
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,470
Shadi

286
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,680
Come with me to have my hair cut after the exam, okay?

287
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,710
What?

288
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,710
I want to have my bangs cut.

289
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,800
I want to look pretty.

290
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,310
I'm so happy to hear it.

291
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,190
You know what?

292
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,520
I know a good hairdresser.

293
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,710
It's hard to get an appointment with her.

294
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,350
I'll take you to see her after the exam.

295
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,430
Ding Xian

296
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,920
Xianxain, are you okay?

297
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,560
Ding Xian, I didn't mean it.

298
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,880
Are you okay?

299
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,710
Are you okay?

300
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,680
What happened?

301
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,710
Let me take a look.

302
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,520
It hurts.

303
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,560
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,040
May I take you to the school infirmary?

305
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,640
You go to class first, and I'll take her to the infirmary.

306
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,310
All right, let's go to the class.

307
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,190
Go to the class.

308
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,680
I've examined your eyes.

309
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,560
I suggest you

310
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,190
go to the hospital for an X-ray

311
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,520
to check if the retina is injured.

312
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,680
All right.

313
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,830
Let's go to the hospital.

314
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,430
I think it won't be that worse.

315
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,160
We have classes later.

316
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,280
Fine, then you just stay here and go blind.

317
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,560
Okay, let's go to the hospital.

318
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,160
Then do we need to ask for a leave first?

319
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,190
Finished?

320
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,000
You can get some sleep.

321
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,760
We need to wait half an hour to get the results.

322
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,710
Your eye is injured.

323
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,470
Why are you talking so softly?

324
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,190
Zhou Siyue

325
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,880
You don't need to take notes for me.

326
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,070
I'm afraid that

327
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,760
it may waste your time preparing for the math competition.

328
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,470
After the exam,

329
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,280
I'll ask my mom to take me

330
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,110
to change a pair of glasses.

331
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,470
You can focus on your own stuff.

332
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,710
Okay.

333
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,950
Zhou Siyue

334
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,680
Thank you.

335
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,470
There's no need to thank me for this.

336
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,920
I don't mean this.

337
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,680
It's just that

338
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,070
when everyone was against

339
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,760
my choice,

340
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,310
only you told me to

341
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,880
choose what I like.

342
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,160
So,

343
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,470
I appreciate it.

344
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
As long as you have made your determination, everything will be fine.

345
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,430
Ding Xian, hurry up.

346
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,830
I'm going to be late.

347
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,880
I've got to go, now.

348
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,950
Hang on a minute.

349
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,350
When will you hand in the application form of science-arts division?

350
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,760
Just these days.

351
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,710
Then remember to hand in it on time.

352
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,470
Okay, I got it, mom.

353
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,400
I have to go now.

354
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,470
Okay, be careful on the road.

355
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,880
Zhou Siyue, did you lose your mind?

356
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,640
May I come in?

357
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,950
Ding Xian, what's the matter?

358
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,070
Mr. Liu, may I come back later?

359
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,190
It's okay. Come in.

360
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,400
Mr. Liu, this is my application form of science-arts division.

361
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,230
You can put it here.

362
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,520
Anything else?

363
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,280
No.

364
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,640
Then you can leave.

365
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,800
Okay.

366
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,190
You chose the science class.

367
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,400
Are you sure?

368
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,070
Yeah.

369
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,280
I want to show everyone that

370
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,710
I can work very well

371
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,430
on science courses, too.

372
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,350
Why did Mr. Liu scold you just now?

373
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,640
Did you do something wrong?

374
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,160
I haven't been doing well in the competition papers lately.

375
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,430
So he's mad at me.

376
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,400
He's too strict with you.

377
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,920
You already have so much to do.

378
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,710
How could he keep putting on you

379
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,190
so much pressure?

380
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,350
Don't worry.

381
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,590
I can handle it.

382
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
Zhou Siyue

383
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,920
No matter what you do,

384
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,400
I'll support you, too.

385
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,470
I know.

386
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,560
By the way,

387
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,680
my dad bought me a new phone.

388
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,920
Thank you for

389
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,310
lending me this.

390
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,520
Spend more time on your study and less on the phone.

391
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,710
You, too.

392
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,590
Two girls were peeking at you in the examination room just now.

393
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,760
Did you notice that?

394
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,000
Really?

395
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,760
It seems that you did very well in the exam.

396
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,280
You can even notice what others are doing.

397
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,350
Yeah, not bad.

398
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,350
I did well in Chinese, English and comprehensive liberal arts tests.

399
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
And the math test was okay.

400
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,280
As for the comprehensive science test, I finished it anyway.

401
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,470
You are still talking about the exam?

402
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,710
Don't you forget

403
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,950
what we've planned to do after the exam?

404
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,310
Of course not.

405
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,000
I'll see you in the billiards room after dinner. Let's go.

406
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,800
Come here.

407
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,710
You don't forget what you've promised me, do you?

408
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,830
Of course not.

409
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,190
I'll see you at your house after dinner.

410
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:38,710
Okay.

411
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,000
Shadi

412
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,760
How do I look?

413
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,000
Very good.

414
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,070
Just wear this.

415
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,520
Ding Xian

416
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,710
-I have prepared some fruit.  -Mom...

417
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,950
I'm changing clothes.

418
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,400
Don't come in, please.

419
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,310
Even mom cannot come in?

420
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,590
Okay, fine.

421
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,470
I'll pick up your brother.

422
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,280
The place is all yours.

423
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,800
Okay.

424
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,710
After my mom going out,

425
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,470
let's go to the hairdresser instantly,

426
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
or we'll be late.

427
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,680
Don't worry. We won't get late.

428
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,000
You are the hairdresser,

429
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,160
aren't you?

430
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,110
You...

431
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
You're kidding!

432
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,710
Don't worry.

433
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,680
Believe me. I'm an expert in cutting bangs.

434
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,110
No hairdresser can do better than me, okay?

435
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,000
Slanting bangs. Straight bangs.

436
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,430
European and American style, Korean style and Japanese style.

437
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,830
I can cut all styles of bangs

438
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,760
as long as you name it.

439
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,830
Select one.

440
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,560
Maybe we should just forget it.

441
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,590
No.

442
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,430
Select one.

443
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,590
This one.

444
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,680
It's not good enough.

445
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,800
It's not stylish at all.

446
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,710
How about this one?

447
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,800
This is a stylish haircut.

448
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,520
Stay still.

449
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,350
Are you sure it is used this way?

450
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,070
Trust me.

451
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,710
Tonight,

452
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,190
it'll definitely amaze you.

453
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,350
Shadi

454
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,110
I'm a little scared.

455
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,640
Don't be.

456
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,520
You have a small face,

457
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,190
so all I need to do is a little

458
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,040
touch up.

459
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,160
According to my experience,

460
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,760
bangs in this length are

461
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,160
the most suitable for you.

462
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Well,

463
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,640
be careful.

464
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,040
Okay, we've finished.

465
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,430
How does it look?

466
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,310
It seems that

467
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,040
I have made a mistake.

468
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,760
What do you mean?

469
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,350
Shadi

470
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,880
It is just

471
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,430
too rustic.

472
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,830
Not that bad.

473
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,430
In fact, it is okay when getting used to it.

474
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,680
It's just that

475
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,950
when you first see it,

476
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,920
you'll feel it's a little weird.

477
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,590
Then

478
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,190
can you come up with some methods

479
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,680
to make me get used to it at the first sight?

480
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,040
Let's sever our friendship.

481
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,430
Slow down, I can't see the way.

482
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,400
You have covered your face with this hat

483
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,110
and you certainly will walk this slowly.

484
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,830
It is your masterpiece that should be to blame.

485
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,110
Bye!

486
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,920
I'm so thirsty.

487
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm going to buy something to drink.

488
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Be quick.

489
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,280
Okay.

490
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,880
Give me a bottle of drink, Mr.

491
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,110
Isn't the clerk there?

492
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,230
No.

493
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,640
I'm coming.

494
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,520
Mr.

495
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,800
Girl, mind your own business.

496
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,590
What do you want?

497
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Come here. Come.

498
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,640
What happened?

499
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,350
What are you doing?

500
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,950
Nothing.

501
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,710
I'm back. Let's go.

502
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,230
Are you okay?

503
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,280
Yeah.

504
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,400
Let's go.

505
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,710
We'll take a billiards table, Mr.

506
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,070
Okay, wait a minute please.

507
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,520
Do you smell something?

508
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,160
What?

509
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,280
Zhou Siyue used hair gel.

510
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,110
Wait.

511
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,070
He began to use hair gel.

512
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
What does this mean?

513
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,160
Let's get started.

514
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,070
I'm going to put down the drinks.

515
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,710
What are you laughing about?

516
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,880
Nothing.

517
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,310
Why do you wear a hat in the room?

518
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,830
Don't look at me.

519
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,830
What?

520
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,800
It's kinda cute.

521
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
Do you mean it?

522
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,640
No need to wear that.

523
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,350
It does no good to your hair.

524
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,590
If two men ride on a horse, one must ride behind.

525
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,190
We two celebrities of Shen Hai High School must duke it out today.

526
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,160
I'll show you.

527
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,710
What kind of celebrity are you?

528
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,950
Zhou Siyue is a celebrity indeed.

529
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,400
Stop bragging.

530
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,430
Let me have a try.

531
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,710
Here. Here.

532
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,920
I'll do this.

533
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,110
It seems not that difficult.

534
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,800
You can have a try.

535
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,470
I can't play it.

536
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,800
I'll show you.

537
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,190
You'd better just give it up.

538
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,830
There is a hemispherical method in math.

539
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,560
Do you know it?

540
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,230
It's a waste of time to teach you.

541
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,800
The correct billiards hit point

542
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,680
should be on the extension line

543
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,160
connecting the center of the bag and the center of the ball.

544
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,920
As long as you can aim at the point,

545
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,520
it will get into the bag in most cases.

546
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,160
Have a try.

547
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,230
Your hands cannot be like this.

548
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Like this.

549
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,040
What are you laughing about?

550
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,760
Your bangs

551
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,310
split.

552
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,040
Zhou Siyue

553
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,560
I got it.

554
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,630
I'll have a try myself.

555
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,469
You lucky dog. Novices are always so lucky.

556
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,670
Awesome.

557
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,389
Ding Xian

558
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,630
You didn't practice this

559
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,190
behind our backs, did you?

560
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,670
No, I just learned it.

561
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,670
Siyue, do you notice that

562
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,000
this girl is barely satisfying in study

563
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,600
while she's so good at these stuff

564
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,909
just like in the game hall last time.

565
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,320
It's hard to explain.

566
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,909
She is a gifted player.

567
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,000
And she has a good teacher.

568
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,949
I'll have a try.

569
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,760
You're too protective of her.

570
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,360
How do you do? Are you Ding Xian's mother?

571
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,320
Yeah, I am.

572
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,600
I'm Ding Xian's head teacher, Liu Jiang.

573
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:24,800
How do you do?

574
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,910
Mr. Liu, how are you?

575
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,000
Please come in.

576
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,800
Okay.

577
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,560
Sorry to bother you. Do I need to change shoes?

578
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,520
No. No. No.

579
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,910
Sit down please.

580
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,280
I'll get you some water.

581
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,800
Don't bother. I won't stay long.

582
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,560
That's okay. Sit down, please.

583
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,520
I know that

584
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,950
you two are partnering to bully me today.

585
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,910
You can only blame yourself for your poor skills.

586
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,430
You skills are good? You don't even touch the cue.

587
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,150
That's because

588
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,390
you are not a good teacher to teach me this.

589
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,710
Give me the wallet.

590
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,150
I'll foot the bill.

591
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,080
It's in my pocket.

592
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,760
Did Ding Xian do something wrong in school?

593
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,950
Or did she fail the exams?

594
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,760
No. No. No.

595
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:21,950
Don't worry, Mrs. Ding.

596
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,840
I come here to

597
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,840
complete a task of the school.

598
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,670
It is just a common home visit.

599
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,080
The holiday classes just finished.

600
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,280
And they'll be junior students soon.

601
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,520
Do you know the science-arts division?

602
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,760
Yeah. I asked her to choose arts.

603
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:39,950
Arts?

604
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,430
Yes.

605
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,840
But Ding Xian chose science.

606
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,630
It can't be.

607
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,560
I asked her to choose arts.

608
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,760
Well.

609
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
I'll show you here.

610
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,600
This is the application form filled by Ding Xian

611
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
and she chose science here.

612
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,760
She didn't tell me this.

613
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,000
I can change it for her. Give me a pen.

614
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,710
Mrs. Ding, stay calm.

615
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,910
I think

616
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,430
we should listen to

617
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,080
Ding Xian's opinion about this.

618
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,840
She'll be mad at us

619
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,630
if we change her choice like this.

620
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,800
-Yes.  -Do you think so?

621
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,080
Yeah.

622
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,230
And I

623
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,630
have analyzed the situation

624
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,520
about her choice.

625
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,190
You can listen to me and see whether my analysis is reasonable.

626
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,840
-Okay.  -I think

627
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,630
the students in science classes

628
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,390
are all well-performed students.

629
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,520
Most of them are

630
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,520
top students.

631
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,760
Compared with these students,

632
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,800
Ding Xin is

633
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,520
obviously mediocre.

634
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,840
No. Mr. Liu

635
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,760
Ding Xian was

636
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,120
a top student

637
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,120
in her previous school.

638
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,470
I never worried about her studies since she was a child.

639
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,710
And the grades of the latest exam are not released, right?

640
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,560
And she is very resistant to pressure.

641
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,520
Since she came back,

642
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,600
she never complained that she had trouble in study.

643
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,230
As her teacher,

644
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,190
you should encourage her more.

645
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,080
How could you say that?

646
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,190
Don't get me wrong. Mrs. Ding, calm down.

647
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,870
You misunderstood me.

648
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,230
Sorry, Mr. Liu.

649
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,360
I've got stuff to do.

650
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,710
So, shall we ......

651
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,840
stop here......

652
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,630
Okay, then I'll go now.

653
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,760
Okay, okay. Thank you for coming.

654
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:19,800
Mrs. Ding

655
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,470
You really misunderstood me.

656
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,080
Goodbye, Mr. Liu.

657
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:23,430
I ......

658
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:23,870
Thank you for coming.

659
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,870
Thank you.

660
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,120
I ... I wanted to tell you ......

661
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,670
See you, Mr. Liu.

662
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,870
See you.

663
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,080
Here is your change.

664
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,430
Okay, thank you.

665
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:36,910
You are welcome.

666
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,910
Let's go to KTV.

667
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,080
Okay, I can go.

668
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,430
Maybe some other time. My parents are about to go home.

669
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,430
It will be so boring if you don't.

670
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,760
Come with us, okay?

671
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,560
Shadi, I'll come with you next time.

672
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:48,870
You may go now.

673
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,360
I'll walk her home.

674
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,630
Okay. Go.

675
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,120
Let's go.

676
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:52,870
Okay.

677
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,470
It's cold outside. Put your clothes on.

678
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,430
Your bangs are pretty.

679
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,870
That's a lie.

680
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,320
I know what my bangs look like.

681
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,230
By the way,

682
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,870
when will you attend the competition？

683
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,800
This October.

684
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,840
So soon after the school starts,

685
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,390
I'll go to get confined training.

686
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,600
For this period of time,

687
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,230
you have to be on your own.

688
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,430
Be careful.

689
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
Don't worry. I can make it.

690
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,120
So confident.

691
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,840
Since I've made my decision to learn science,

692
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,150
I'll work very hard in the future.

693
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,600
Even if without your help,

694
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,950
I can get good grades myself.

695
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,150
I'll show you.

696
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,280
Okay.

697
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,320
Let's see your monthly quizzes grades.

698
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,430
What are you looking at?

699
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,710
I'm home!

700
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,150
Xianxian, you are back.

701
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,150
Mom

702
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,560
You cut your hair?

703
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,430
It looks awful.

704
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,560
Don't talk nonsense.

705
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,800
It's time to go to bed.

706
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,950
No.

707
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,630
Who allows you to cut your hair?

708
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,600
Mom

709
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:23,150
I don't even have the right to cut my own hair?

710
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,710
Yeah.

711
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,520
She has grown up

712
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,120
and has her own idea.

713
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,630
We should respect her choice.

714
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,280
I work hard to take care

715
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,360
of your daily life.

716
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,670
What's your return to me?

717
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,360
One didn't listen to my opinion and chose science,

718
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,080
and the other knew clearly her choice

719
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,560
but didn't tell me a word.

720
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,360
You take my words as garbage, don't you?

721
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,150
I deserve to suffer all these

722
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,190
and should keep my mouth shut, right?

723
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,040
I see.

724
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,870
You've grown up

725
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,360
and want to make your own decision.

726
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,560
You won't listen to me anymore.

727
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,190
But will you still listen to me?

728
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,280
I don't care.

729
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,600
No matter what method you'll take,

730
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,000
she has to be transferred to the arts class.
