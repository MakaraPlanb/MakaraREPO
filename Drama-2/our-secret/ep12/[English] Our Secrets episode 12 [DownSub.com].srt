Our Secret
EP12

2
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,590
Anyway, I feel happy

3
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,310
to stay with Ziqi, Shadi,

4
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,759
and you.

5
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,310
It's really great.

6
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,759
You're nice, too.

7
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,710
Well.

8
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,160
Now that your direction is clear,

9
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,440
let's start

10
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,350
with a small goal.

11
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,910
Let's work together!

12
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,750
OK.

13
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,240
Hello.

14
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,270
Xianxian, come back quickly!

15
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,880
There's something wrong.

16
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,320
I don't know

17
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,190
if your grandmother can make it through this time.

18
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,600
I have to go back to take care of her.

19
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,190
Congcong is still young.

20
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,710
I can't leave him alone.

21
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,350
Are you gonna be okay on your own?

22
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,400
Yes, I'm OK.

23
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,160
Mom, don't worry.

24
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Grandma will be OK.

25
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,829
Your father

26
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,520
teaches senior three and has to live in school.

27
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,240
You need to take care of yourself.

28
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Don't be distracted by these things.

29
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,550
School will begin soon.

30
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,910
Remember to study hard.

31
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,800
Understand?

32
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,350
I got it.

33
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,440
By the way,

34
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,240
your living expenses...

35
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,520
At the table.

36
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,040
I will remember to take it.

37
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,990
I should eat fruit every day.

38
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,440
I need to text and call you.

39
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,710
If I have anything, I can call Auntie Li.

40
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,240
I remember it all.

41
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,190
Jinyun

42
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,990
I have to thank you.

43
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,750
You're welcome.

44
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,470
Her grandma's health is very important.

45
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,990
Don't worry.

46
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,680
We will take good care of Xianxian.

47
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,240
Auntie, don't worry.

48
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,470
Then I'll go.

49
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:46,960
Here you are, Xianxian.

50
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,000
Here.

51
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,909
Time is limited,

52
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,310
so I didn't prepare anything.

53
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,400
Eat some wonton first.

54
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,310
Xianxian, how about

55
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,720
I tell your mother that

56
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,350
you live here

57
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,630
during this period.

58
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,150
Siyue,

59
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,150
what's your opinion?

60
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,030
This

61
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,870
depends on her own idea.

62
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,150
It's okay, aunt.

63
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,630
I can take care of myself.

64
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,150
All right.

65
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,960
If you have something,

66
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,190
you can come to me.

67
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,870
Don't be shy.

68
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,560
Remember to come here to eat.

69
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,190
It will be more lively with more people.

70
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,800
Thank you, aunt.

71
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,470
You two take your time.

72
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,720
I'll go out to buy some fruit.

73
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,150
Eat it.

74
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,720
Don't forget your wallet again.

75
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,430
Got it.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,080
I can't eat so much.

77
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,280
You can eat more.

78
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,310
What if

79
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,750
my grandma...

80
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,560
Don't talk nonsense.

81
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
The best thing you should do now

82
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,800
is to take good care of yourself.

83
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,520
Don't let your mother worry about you.

84
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,520
When your grandmother is recovered,

85
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,190
you will go to see her

86
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,870
happily and healthily.

87
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,910
That's good.

88
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,240
Don't worry.

89
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,310
Your grandma will be all right.

90
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,870
Eat quickly.

91
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:48,840
Aunt,

92
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,470
I'll go back first.

93
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,750
Xianxian

94
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,680
Why don't you stay for a while?

95
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,430
I'm leaving, aunt.

96
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,240
I've been at your house all day.

97
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,470
It's too much trouble for you.

98
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,120
Then you should be more careful when you live alone.

99
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,750
Tell me if you have anything.

100
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,910
Siyue, you go to walk Xianxian home.

101
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,520
-Okay.  -No, no, no.

102
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,430
It's close.

103
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,840
I can go back by myself.

104
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,430
All right.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,520
Then be careful on the road.

106
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
Don't worry, aunt.

107
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,150
OK.

108
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,750
I'm leaving. Goodbye, aunt.

109
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,240
See you later.

110
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,000
Be careful.

111
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,910
If my parents allow you to come to my home,

112
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,840
it will be great.

113
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,430
It is OK.

114
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,190
It's the same with you calling me at night.

115
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,909
Aren't you afraid at home alone?

116
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,470
And in case...

117
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,150
Don't say it.

118
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,630
I thought it's okay,

119
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,120
but when you say it...

120
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,000
Shadi

121
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,080
Don't talk.

122
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,790
Get out of here!

123
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,920
Someone at home!

124
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,790
It's me!

125
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,870
You hit me pretty hard.

126
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,230
You...

127
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,230
Why are you...

128
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,870
Before your mother left,

129
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,480
she left a spare key in my house.

130
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,750
I knocked on the door for so long. Why don't you answer?

131
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,840
I'm afraid.

132
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,520
I thought it was...

133
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,920
It's okay.

134
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,670
The security guard just

135
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,280
caught a thief downstairs.

136
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,840
A thief?

137
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,110
Look at the door.

138
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,400
It's marked by someone.

139
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,750
Hello.

140
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,190
She's all right.

141
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,360
She's next to me.

142
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,720
You can go home first.

143
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,920
Who?

144
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Song Ziqi

145
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,480
Kong Shadi told him

146
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,750
that something happened to you.

147
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,230
They're both on their way here.

148
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,110
It's too scary.

149
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,480
Isn't that too much trouble for you?

150
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,160
It doesn't matter.

151
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,960
Don't say that.

152
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,840
Then thank you for taking care of Xianxian.

153
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
As soon as I finish my businesses,

154
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,310
I'll be right back.

155
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,430
Let's keep in touch.

156
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,520
Goodbye.

157
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:00,600
Here you are.

158
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,480
Aunt,

159
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,600
I'll trouble you for a while.

160
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,430
You are

161
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,840
always so sensible.

162
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,670
It's great that you're okay.

163
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,360
I'm still a little scared.

164
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,160
I told you to move in.

165
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,190
By the way, Siyue,

166
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,520
you help Xianxian pack up

167
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,840
and move in as soon as possible.

168
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,920
It doesn't matter.

169
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,400
I can pack the luggage myself.

170
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,430
Fortunately, Xianxian is okay.

171
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,360
It's a false alarm.

172
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
I told you.

173
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,160
They live so close.

174
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,920
If anything happens to her,

175
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,840
Siyue is sure to rush over at the first time.

176
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,840
But I'm worried about her.

177
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,310
You think everyone is as heartless as you.

178
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,550
Fortunately, Siyue is very considerate.

179
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,630
If something happened to me,

180
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,920
will you come?

181
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,430
You speak with your conscience.

182
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,400
I've been with you every time you have an accident

183
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,360
since you were young.

184
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,840
It seems to be that.

185
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,600
Remember something good about me, okay?

186
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,750
You do more bad things than good things.

187
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,960
How can I remember?

188
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Well, let's go.

189
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,840
Where to go?

190
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,040
Anyway, we're hanging out.

191
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,870
You don't want to go home so early, do you?

192
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,670
There is a restaurant ahead.

193
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,920
I'll treat you to dinner.

194
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,720
Come on. I'll treat you.

195
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,190
I can't believe that you invite me to dinner.

196
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,230
Did I hear you right?

197
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,310
What's wrong?

198
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,600
For the sake of

199
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,520
helping me a lot,

200
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,430
I'll give you a reward today. Let's go!

201
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,360
Thank you, Little Princess.

202
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,160
Today my mother told me that

203
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,600
grandma looks much better.

204
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,400
The doctor said

205
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,520
she can leave the ICU soon.

206
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,310
And...

207
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,920
I'm moving to

208
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,110
Zhou Siyue's home tomorrow.

209
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,280
Is this

210
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,430
God's arrangement?

211
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,550
Suddenly

212
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,630
this summer

213
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,360
comes to an end.

214
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,110
Good morning.

215
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,990
Have you packed up?

216
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,670
You just take one suitcase with you?

217
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,990
We live so close.

218
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,750
If I forget something, I can come back and get it.

219
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,720
Where to go?

220
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,920
Go shopping.

221
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,190
This is good.

222
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,230
This is OK, too.

223
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,310
Get some juice.

224
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,670
Get some instant noodles.

225
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,480
We need to buy some shampoo.

226
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,670
Wait a minute.

227
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,400
Do I look like I need shampoo

228
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,750
to prevent hair loss?

229
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,600
I don't need it.

230
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,920
I have a lot of hair.

231
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,040
I'm not afraid.

232
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,630
I don't know which one you like.

233
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,400
We can buy a few and have a try.

234
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,230
Let's take the most common one.

235
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,430
We need to buy bath lotion, too.

236
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,960
I have.

237
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,550
I can take it.

238
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,630
OK.

239
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,550
You're quite diligent and thrifty.

240
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,430
You are too extravagant and wasteful.

241
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,400
I'll lead the way.

242
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,870
Give it to me.

243
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,310
I'll take it.

244
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,720
Lead the way.

245
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,110
Let's head for the stationery area.

246
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,840
Here is stationery area.

247
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,080
What do you want to buy?

248
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:17,790
Take a look.

249
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,430
This is so cute.

250
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,080
Childish.

251
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,520
It's fancy.

252
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,520
It's expensive but difficult to use.

253
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,190
When did you see me use it?

254
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,360
This is amazing.

255
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,630
Are you a child?

256
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,550
My little brother doesn't even use this.

257
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,990
What does your brother know?

258
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,480
Come on, come on.

259
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,430
One for each person.

260
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,750
OK.

261
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,480
Make up for your missing childhood.

262
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,310
Come on, come on.

263
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,110
What else?

264
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,190
Ding Xian

265
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,080
Zhou Siyue

266
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,760
Keke

267
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,030
Why are you two

268
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,270
together?

269
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,790
This is my new friend.

270
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,270
OK. You're the boss.

271
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,599
Why are you two together?

272
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,190
I...

273
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,360
Why can't we be together?

274
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Don't talk about this.

275
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,720
I heard you play billiards very well.

276
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,000
Find a chance to play.

277
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,480
Can you ask something useful?

278
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,030
What are you two doing?

279
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,480
Don't interrupt when girls talk.

280
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,150
What's going on with you two?

281
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,030
Nothing.

282
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,960
Tell me the truth.

283
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,240
We...

284
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,390
You and Zhou Siyue live together, right?

285
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
No.

286
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,640
You didn't tell me such a big thing.

287
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,120
I knew it from Keke.

288
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,390
It's not what you think.

289
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,240
I just stay at his house for a few days.

290
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,480
Can I come in?

291
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,790
Auntie, come in please.

292
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,670
Xianxian, I bring you a new towel.

293
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,600
How's the room?

294
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,480
Time is limited.

295
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,550
I just arrange it briefly.

296
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,510
Tell me if you need anything else.

297
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,910
No, I don't need.

298
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,080
I'm happy to see you.

299
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,310
You're clever and sensible.

300
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,910
I wanted a daughter

301
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,270
like you a long time ago.

302
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,760
I forget to collect these photos.

303
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,760
This is a picture of Siyue when he was a child.

304
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,600
Auntie, is this in Keshan?

305
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,120
Yes, it is in your hometown.

306
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,150
This is Siyue's first visit to Keshan.

307
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,670
Unfortunately, there was a flood.

308
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,270
His grandfather sent him to your house.

309
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,790
After coming back, he cried all day

310
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,880
and said he would never go to Keshan again.

311
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,880
The flood probably frightened him.

312
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,360
This one is interesting.

313
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,430
This is a picture of Siyue wearing a dress as a child.

314
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,510
This photo...

315
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,120
Mom

316
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,880
Why do you take out this photo again?

317
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,150
Why are you here?

318
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,190
I'm chatting with Xianxian.

319
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,270
If he bothers you in the future,

320
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,670
you can tell me.

321
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,030
I'll help you teach him a lesson.

322
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,510
OK.

323
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,120
But he's nice.

324
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,790
Take a shower later and then go to bed.

325
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,030
Siyue, help Xianxian tidy up.

326
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,910
Thank you, aunt.

327
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,080
In this photo,

328
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,240
your look is very unique.

329
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,670
My mom always liked to

330
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,720
dress me up during that time.

331
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,760
Who remembers things as a child?

332
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,190
Take a bath and sleep.

333
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,360
Ding Xian

334
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,550
Hey, hey, hey.

335
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,270
Hello.

336
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,190
Hello.

337
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,640
You still say like this.

338
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,880
He even asks you to take a bath.

339
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,150
It's not what you think.

340
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:36,880
Come on.

341
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,600
You are not allowed to be absent

342
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,910
at the girls' group meeting tomorrow. Bye.

343
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,270
Why don't you lock the door?

344
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,510
Go on.

345
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,960
Where is the hair dryer?

346
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,960
Mom

347
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,510
Where is the hair dryer?

348
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,270
The hair dryer is

349
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,760
in the cupboard under the sink.

350
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,430
Look for it carefully.

351
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,600
Ding Xian

352
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,480
We're going to be late.

353
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,030
Still asleep.

354
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,190
The second set of national broadcast gymnastics for middle school students,

355
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,640
the Time Is Calling.

356
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,430
Get ready.

357
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,670
Zhou Siyue, are you crazy?

358
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,640
Hurry up.

359
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,080
Why do you ride your bike today?

360
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,120
You're too slow.

361
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,510
I don't want to be late.

362
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,550
I didn't beg you to wait for me.

363
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,120
If you are in a hurry, you can go first.

364
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,430
I spoil you too much.

365
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,190
If you don't want to be late,

366
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,550
you can beg me to give you a ride.

367
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,760
I don't need.

368
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,360
Lazy bug.

369
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,960
Childish.

370
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,310
Good morning, Shadi.

371
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,360
Good morning.

372
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,910
I've seen this.

373
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,270
How about living next door to Prince Charming?

374
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,000
Put those two words away.

375
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,120
He...

376
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,270
He's simply not in his right mind.

377
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,030
You don't appreciate the happy life you enjoy .

378
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,720
You have to tell me everything today.

379
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,270
Living under the same roof

380
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,240
is really not what you think.

381
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,720
Imagine that

382
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,390
you and Song Ziqi

383
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,550
meet every day.

384
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,270
Are you happy?

385
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,190
By the way,

386
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,640
I lived with him for a while

387
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,960
when I was a small kid.

388
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,480
Tell me the story.

389
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,480
I tell you.

390
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,670
Song Ziqi always loved to run away from home

391
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,390
when he was young.

392
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,390
At that time,

393
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,120
the relationship between our two families was good.

394
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,880
He always loved coming to live with me.

395
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,030
He slept on the floor in my room.

396
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,310
He snores,

397
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,910
grinds his teeth and farts

398
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,310
when he sleeps.

399
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,360
This is not the most tiresome thing.

400
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,240
Do you know what it is?

401
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,000
What?

402
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,080
Every time

403
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,030
I got up from a nap,

404
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,000
he was lying on the bed

405
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,880
and I was lying on the ground.

406
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,840
How could he do that?

407
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,760
It seems

408
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,720
I'm still quite comfortable.

409
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,510
Thank you.

410
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,030
And then?

411
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,640
You didn't

412
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,510
say anything else at night?

413
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,510
About what?

414
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,430
I'm so tired.

415
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,600
It's boring.

416
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,430
Boring?

417
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,030
Think about it.

418
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,480
Isn't this Full House?

419
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,480
There is a long way to go.

420
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,030
Stop watching so many idol dramas.

421
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,720
Instead, I think

422
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,150
the closer the distance is,

423
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,510
the easier it is to be disillusioned.

424
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,790
You get it.

425
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,000
It seems that you lived with others.

426
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,550
You...

427
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,000
Then you say.

428
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,760
I don't know how to say it.

429
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,240
Anyway,

430
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,790
I'm quite happy.

431
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,640
A fickle woman!

432
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,670
Childe,

433
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,480
how's it going?

434
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,550
You and Ding Xian live in the same room.

435
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,310
You're talking nonsense.

436
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,510
In the same room?

437
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,840
Am I wrong?

438
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,120
Anyway, Little Monster

439
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,150
is also a beautiful woman

440
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,430
with beautiful eyebrows and clear eyes.

441
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,240
She is a girl.

442
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,670
What about me? Why should I take him in?

443
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,430
A boy.

444
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,000
I have to pay for his family dispute.

445
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,910
What's the matter?

446
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,880
You both look at me like this.

447
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,390
When do you plan to go back

448
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,910
this time?

449
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,270
In my opinion,

450
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,600
your dad is too cruel this time.

451
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,640
It's not the first time he has done this.

452
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,670
But it's longer than before, isn't it?

453
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,960
Even if

454
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,760
your father is angry,

455
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,270
I think your mother

456
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,790
will be worried about you.

457
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,840
Let's play games.

458
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,550
My mother goes to play cards.

459
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,960
Make do with it.

460
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,310
Do you usually

461
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,270
eat alone?

462
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,880
But now

463
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,550
I have one more person to eat together.

464
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,670
It's quite lively.

465
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,240
Not bad.

466
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,240
Really? Then you should cherish me.

467
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,760
I'm not afraid.

468
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,640
I'll go to your home

469
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,430
and eat there every day.

470
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,600
Keep dreaming.

471
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,360
It's a little salty.

472
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,150
My mom doesn't cook usually.

473
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,550
Otherwise,

474
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,480
I'll take you out to eat.

475
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,030
No, I think it's delicious.

476
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,960
And it's comfortable to eat home-cooked food.

477
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,510
OK, you wash the dishes

478
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,840
after eating.

479
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,910
I often help you make up lessons for free.

480
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,510
You need to make up to me.

481
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,030
All right.

482
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,670
Childe, I will wash.

483
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,960
You also prepared some fruit.

484
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,600
Can I watch TV?

485
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,310
Sure.

486
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,390
Where is the remote control?

487
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,480
Did you hide it?

488
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,910
How can I hide the remote control?

489
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,430
No.

490
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,640
You get up and let me have a look.

491
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,510
I didn't hide it. Don't touch me.

492
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,430
I saw it. You just hid it.

493
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,030
Here.

494
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,270
You're still quibbling.

495
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,880
Have you finished your homework?

496
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,600
You just want to watch TV.

497
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,360
I have finished.

498
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,640
Let me have a look.

499
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,640
OK.

500
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,310
If you can grab it, I will let you watch TV.

501
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,190
Zhou Siyue

502
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,270
Don't push me.

503
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,550
What's up?

504
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,270
My brother and I

505
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,270
robbed the remote control at home

506
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,080
for so many years.

507
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,190
You're a little rude.

508
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,030
Because you usually watch TV in a comfortable environment.

509
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,390
Look at you.

510
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,430
You're like my brother who couldn't grab the remote control.

511
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,480
As like as two peas.

512
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,550
Did you use the website

513
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,720
I gave you last time?

514
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,480
Yes.

515
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,080
I quite like it.

516
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,600
Thank you.

517
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,510
I'm glad you enjoy it.

518
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,150
It's worth

519
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,840
my effort.

520
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,190
If you want to use a computer,

521
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,270
you can use mine.

522
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,510
The password is six zeros.

523
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,760
Really?

524
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,080
Here's the remote control.

525
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,640
Then I'll borrow your computer.

526
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,840
Don't play too late.

527
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,030
We have to get up early tomorrow.

528
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,150
Got it.

529
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,880
I asked you to go to bed early.

530
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,960
Look, you're going to sleep again

531
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,030
in class today.

532
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,880
I had gone to bed early.

533
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,240
I was playing cards with Zheng's wife this afternoon.

534
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,510
She said Zheng stays at home

535
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,030
and helped his son with his lessons.

536
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,240
Zhou Zongtang, you lied to me.

537
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,640
Would you please stop crying?

538
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,390
The children will be back soon.

539
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,760
I told you many time

540
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,720
but you don't believe me.

541
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,150
Zheng was there at that time.

542
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,720
He answered a phone and left.

543
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,030
Jiang stayed with me all the way.

544
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,670
You can ask him.

545
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,720
You think I don't know.

546
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,270
Jiang is your friend.

547
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
He lied for you.

548
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,550
I wouldn't believe him.

549
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,670
Zhou Zongtang, tell me the truth.

550
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,720
Are you cheating me?

551
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,640
What are you talking about?

552
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,030
I can't talk with you.

553
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,760
Xianxian, you are here.

554
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,360
Why don't you say hello when you go home?

555
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,510
Didn't you tell me when you came back?

556
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,790
Haven't you eaten? Yun

557
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:32,960
The children are back.

558
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,960
I'm going to cook.

559
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,720
You are back.

560
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,720
I'll help your dad.

561
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,360
Come in.

562
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,390
Do you have questions?

563
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,790
I'll teach you when I finish this.

564
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,880
No. You can go on.

565
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,790
Aren't you preparing for the National Olympiads?

566
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,510
I come to see you.

567
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,790
The room is a bit messy.

568
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,880
Sit down.

569
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Have you read all these books?

570
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,440
I want to tell you

571
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,510
I won't tell others what I heard

572
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,230
this afternoon.

573
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:23,989
I promise.

574
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:24,989
I swear.

575
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,550
How can a couple not quarrel?

576
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,400
Don't be too sad.

577
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,120
What's the matter?

578
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,710
You find my home

579
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:45,030
is not as harmonious as you think.

580
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,080
Are you psychologically balanced?

581
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:48,989
No.

582
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,270
No?

583
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,230
Maybe

584
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,400
a little.

585
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,440
But I didn't gloat.

586
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,200
It's okay.

587
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,440
My mother

588
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,950
doesn't have a job,

589
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,440
so her focus is on my dad.

590
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,470
You know my dad. He's busy at work.

591
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,310
He doesn't have much time for my mother.

592
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,550
So my mother is always paranoid.

593
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,990
She listens to rumors.

594
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,950
I'm used to it.

595
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,310
And look at my mom.

596
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,640
She grew up in a honeypot since she was a child,

597
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,550
so she thought

598
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,470
everyone around her would be good for her.

599
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,550
She's not the sort of person to bear a grudge.

600
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
She may forget

601
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,230
many things in two or three days.

602
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,710
But I remember

603
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,440
all the grievances

604
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,840
my mother suffered.

605
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,710
What's up?

606
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,750
Do you find that

607
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,200
I'm not as good as I usually look?

608
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,750
No.

609
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,680
Of course not.

610
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,160
Don't lie to me.

611
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,230
I think you are very good.

612
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,470
We're both seventeen.

613
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,080
There will definitely be a lot of troubles and confusion.

614
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,470
But no one is perfect.

615
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,120
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

616
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,080
I'm not like my dad.

617
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,160
I won't let the people around me be wronged.

618
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,920
Drink it.

619
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,270
Have a good sleep after drinking.

620
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,230
When

621
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,270
Shadi and Keke asked me,

622
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,550
I didn't know the answer.

623
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,950
But I think

624
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,550
there may be

625
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,470
neither fantasy

626
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,640
nor disillusionment for me.

627
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,750
Sometimes, he is very considerate.

628
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,080
Sometimes, he's annoying.

629
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,950
Sometimes, he's fragile.

630
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,840
But all this

631
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,200
only makes me happy.

632
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,600
Because at the moment,

633
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,990
he really

634
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,600
exists in my heart

635
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,840
and will not disappear

636
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,990
in front of me.

637
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,200
What are you laughing at?

638
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,310
I feel like

639
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,230
we've been getting along well lately.

640
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,400
And I know a lot of his secrets.

641
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:34,880
What are the secrets?

642
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,270
Tell me.

643
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,790
No way.

644
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,310
I promised him to keep the secrets.

645
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,710
It's boring.

646
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,230
But I can't imagine that

647
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,990
you can get something on Zhou Siyue.

648
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,440
He has been excellent since childhood.

649
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,510
Have you heard about He Xingwen's family?

650
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,710
His father seems to have had an accident on the construction site.

651
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,510
Stand up.

652
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,680
Hello, teacher.

653
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,470
Sit down please.

654
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,030
Some people may have heard about

655
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,920
what happened to He Xingwen's family.

656
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,120
Although it is a voluntary contribution,

657
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,600
I still hope everyone can lend a helping hand

658
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,080
to help He Xingwen

659
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,400
and his family

660
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,840
get through the difficulties.

661
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,640
He looks really pathetic.

662
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,200
But I was angry

663
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,080
when I thought of what he had done before.

664
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,200
He's so mean.

665
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,200
I feel like

666
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,920
I'm helping the bad guys.

667
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,680
You're stupid.

668
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,360
Your expression is not suitable.

669
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,230
I don't like him.

670
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,920
But this is a different thing.

671
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,360
You should help if you have the ability.

672
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,990
But I'm still angry.

673
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,550
He reported Ding Xian before.

674
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,680
And the last time we were punished because of chatting.

675
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,600
He is to blame for these.

676
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,120
Maybe

677
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,120
he also did the thing about Siyue last time.

678
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,120
You're right. He did it.

679
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,230
We all know that Auntie talked to him later.

680
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,030
You know it all.

681
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,990
It doesn't matter.

682
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,080
Anyway, the money is not for him.

683
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,640
It's for his grandparents.

684
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,080
Two old people have just lost their son.

685
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,680
It would be sad for them

686
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,920
to find that their grandson is not living well.

687
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,750
You donated all your pocket money.

688
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,680
Do my best.

689
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,680
If the same thing happened to me one day,

690
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,270
I should also hope that everyone can help me.

691
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,680
So much.

692
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,790
It's the same.

693
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,750
It is a token of my affection.

694
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,680
Let's go.

695
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,080
Thank you.

696
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,030
And

697
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,230
I'm sorry.

698
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,920
Look at this.

699
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,080
If you can't solve it,

700
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,510
just ask me directly.

701
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,710
Don't split hairs all day.

702
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,310
There will be more mistakes.

703
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,840
I can't rely on you all the time.

704
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,710
I have to work hard on my own.

705
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,710
Good.

706
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,160
Your idea is good.

707
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,880
I'm satisfied with you.

708
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:31,840
By the way,

709
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,550
can you go to Huaqing University directly

710
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,680
after the National Olympiads?

711
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,470
This time

712
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,880
if I win the first prize

713
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,470
and plus some other awards,

714
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,200
it should be OK.

715
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,310
What's the matter?

716
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,510
No.

717
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,950
I envy you very much.

718
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,680
If you go to Huaqing University,

719
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,080
you can go to Jiangling with your father.

720
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,550
Jiangling is big and prosperous.

721
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:11,950
I'd like to see it, too.

722
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,310
Ding Xian

723
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,200
How about

724
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:28,710
you come to Jiangling with me?
