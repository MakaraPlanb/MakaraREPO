2
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,560
Astronomy Club.

3
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,270
Welcome to Astronomy Club.

4
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,520
Welcome to Astronomy Club.

5
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,950
That one.

6
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,950
Music Club sounds good.

7
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,120
It's suitable for you.

8
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,390
That's...

9
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,080
Zhou Siyue

10
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,520
Thank you for the application.

11
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,270
I want to invite you to dinner when you are available.

12
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,270
Come on. Can't let you pay.

13
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,039
It's on me.

14
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,080
I have to go, maybe another day.

15
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,400
Comics Club.

16
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,190
Here, welcome to Astronomy Club.

17
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,960
Welcome to Astronomy Club.

18
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,320
Calligraphy Club.

19
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,750
Just join us!

20
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,960
Excuse me, I can sign up for the Animation Club here?

21
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,960
Yeah, do you wanna come in?

22
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,710
Okay.

23
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,110
Sit down, please.

24
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,750
Ding Xian

25
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,470
You have some drawing experience, right?

26
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,040
Can you show us some previous works?

27
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,110
Okay, here you are.

28
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,960
You are the illustrator,

29
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,800
The Little Monster?

30
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,800
You know me?

31
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,440
I know you for a long time.

32
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,040
You are a gifted illustrator.

33
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,079
It's a surprise for me to be in the same college with you.

34
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,800
I thought you could be a student of an academy of fine arts.

35
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,400
Thank you.

36
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,710
In fact I'm an amateur.

37
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,880
Be confident.

38
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,040
The gift you have

39
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,710
is more important than skills.

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,800
Could you tell me

41
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,550
is Zhou Siyue in this club?

42
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,079
Zhou Siyue

43
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,440
If you want to look for him,

44
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,910
this isn't the right place.

45
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,520
Siyue isn't our member,

46
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,960
but a friend in another class.

47
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,800
Comics Club is designing an application

48
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,240
to show our works.

49
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,710
He does a favour for us.

50
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,080
I got it.

51
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,270
Ding Xian

52
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,040
Have you changed your mind?

53
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,320
No.

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,910
Come to our meeting on the next Monday.

55
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,470
I'll add you to our group chat later.

56
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,040
Okay.

57
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,240
I found you!

58
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,750
Why you didn't answer my call?

59
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,350
I didn't hear it.

60
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,630
Our counselor is looking for you.

61
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,870
Counselor?

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,680
Hurry up.

63
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,280
I gotta go now, bye.

64
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,310
Is the counselor here?

65
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,870
I'm waiting for him.

66
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,590
He hasn't been back yet.

67
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,190
What's the matter with you?

68
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,150
He wants to talk to me

69
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,909
about that thing.

70
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,080
He's kind.

71
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,910
Don't worry.

72
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,630
I have to go.

73
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,350
It's so exaggerating.

74
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,590
We aren't like Song Ziqi and you.

75
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,430
Don't mention him.

76
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,840
I'm angry with him.

77
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,630
Still not reconciled?

78
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,630
I've tried to bring up a topic,

79
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,120
but he didn't reply.

80
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,310
It has been days.

81
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,350
Can you ask Siyue for me

82
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,470
if possible?

83
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,150
Okay, I will try

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,310
though I myself haven't found the chance to talk to him.

85
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,560
Seriously?

86
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,400
Ban Jiayu, why did you have your hair done today?

87
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,680
It's time to go!

88
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,520
I'll hang up, Shasha.

89
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,870
I have a party tonight.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,800
Okay.

91
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,280
Hang up, bye.

92
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,800
See you.

93
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,190
Let's go.

94
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,280
You go there in this suit?

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,520
Why not?

96
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,000
They are dull-colored.

97
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,150
Really?

98
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,310
I can wear another.

99
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,350
We are here, come on!

100
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:24,960
Come on!

101
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,720
Here comes our news topic.

102
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,720
You the Huaqing University for love?

103
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,150
Disappointed?

104
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,720
The one you go after is not here today.

105
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,909
It's none of your business.

106
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay, all of us are here.

107
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:44,840
Have a toast.

108
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,590
Welcome our new members.

109
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,870
Thank you.

110
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,840
You've eaten too much.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,190
We have to come back home tomorrow.

112
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,030
Have you finished?

113
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,630
Let's play games.

114
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,030
Okay.

115
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,470
Good.

116
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,310
Have you all played Truth or Dare?

117
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,190
Yes.

118
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,720
Okay, come on.

119
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,280
Wow.

120
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,080
Do you have questions?

121
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,000
Any question for her?

122
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,750
I have many questions for you.

123
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,470
You went away with Zhou Siyue that day,

124
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,750
and what happened after that?

125
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,240
He took me to the playground

126
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,030
and taught me a lesson.

127
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,080
He told me how to

128
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,430
get a first in every subject.

129
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,310
This is Truth or Dare.

130
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,630
You have to tell the truth.

131
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,000
Please obey the rules.

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,280
Agree.

133
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,310
Okay, truth or dare.

134
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,680
I choose the dare,

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,560
so I don't have to tell the truth.

136
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,910
Okay, it's up to you.

137
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,750
Please do what you did

138
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,310
in front of male dormitory.

139
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
We've never seen such a big scene.

140
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,750
Agree.

141
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
You are so annoying.

142
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,240
I don't think it's interesting.

143
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,590
The video has been uploaded by others.

144
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,310
If you want,

145
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,560
you can find it online.

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,520
Can we continue the game?

147
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,520
Of course yes.

148
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,630
Well,

149
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,030
let me sing a song for you.

150
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:32,990
That's great.

151
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,520
That's good. Come on.

152
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,919
Sing.

153
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,480
Sing.

154
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,400
You're a good singer.

155
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,360
Zhou Siyue

156
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,960
I want to study in Jiangling, too.

157
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,670
Bravo.

158
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,360
Okay.

159
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,110
After the game and the song,

160
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,520
do you want to order some other dishes?

161
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,840
I'd like roast trotter.

162
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,520
You're a good diner.

163
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,280
Waiter

164
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,670
Okay.

165
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,040
What a coincidence.

166
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,160
Zhou Siyue

167
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,670
You

168
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,110
are working here?

169
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,310
Yes, a part-time job.

170
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,870
I can help you order dishes.

171
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,040
Here you are.

172
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,190
Your prince charming

173
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,280
looks like a poor childe.

174
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,080
This restaurant is good. I planned to come here long before.

175
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,550
It's pity

176
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,960
that you are on duty

177
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
or you can eat with us.

178
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,480
It doesn't matter.

179
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,230
There are signature dishes.

180
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,160
The seafood is transported by air.

181
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,310
Good for party.

182
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,230
Do you like these?

183
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,190
Okay, take your advice.

184
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,400
Okay.

185
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,280
Ask me

186
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,080
if you need.

187
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,310
Uncle Liu, let me do this.

188
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,430
It's okay. I can do this.

189
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,110
I'm sorry to ask you

190
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,840
to change the shift with me.

191
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,160
It doesn't matter.

192
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,160
Come back and look after your kid,

193
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
or he will fall sleep.

194
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,040
Okay, thank you.

195
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,960
Zhou Siyue

196
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,280
Why are you still here?

197
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,840
It's a return gift for your treat yesterday.

198
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,960
Anything else?

199
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,790
What happened to you?

200
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,430
Nothing.

201
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,280
My father isn't well recently,

202
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,960
so my life is not what it used to be.

203
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,110
I take a part-time job

204
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,430
to help my parents.

205
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,960
Are your parents all right?

206
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,840
Can I help you?

207
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,230
They are fine.

208
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,190
Don't worry about us.

209
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,190
They said you were going to the karaoke.

210
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,870
You have to go now.

211
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,430
You can't turn me away.

212
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,360
Ding Xian

213
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,920
I've told you

214
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,960
that we have our own life.

215
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,750
Now your university life begins. There are lots of

216
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,190
interesting people and things.

217
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,310
You should explore the new life,

218
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,600
don't waste time on me.

219
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,430
I also have a new life.

220
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,360
Embracing a new life means

221
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,840
forgetting the past, right?

222
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,430
The past is the past.

223
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,630
Okay,

224
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:56,920
I got you.

225
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,920
You finished?

226
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,080
The manager is looking for you.

227
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,600
I'm here.

228
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,990
Here I am, manager.

229
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,310
You wiped the table?

230
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,430
I can tidy it up again.

231
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,430
You don't have to.

232
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,040
You are complained by a guest.

233
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,550
I don't understand.

234
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,360
The guest...

235
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,230
Sometimes their complaints are

236
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,280
totally unprovoked,

237
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,599
but you have to understand me,

238
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,599
catering business is depressed recently.

239
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,839
And he topped up 10000 yuan in his VIP card.

240
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,190
I cannot afford to offend him.

241
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,310
I got it.

242
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,390
Well,

243
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,880
this is my last night here.

244
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,119
I'll leave here tomorrow.

245
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,079
Okay.

246
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Forgive me.

247
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,030
Alright.

248
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,430
Good for you.

249
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,240
You are sweeping the post bar recently.

250
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,120
Are they serious?

251
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,480
These are rumors.

252
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,000
Please,

253
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,840
let me alone.

254
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,550
Okay.

255
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,480
Does someone know the story of

256
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,430
Zhou Siyue, the one majors in computing?

257
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't know the details either.

258
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,030
The department told us to keep quiet about it.

259
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,480
It was dealt with in secret.

260
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,240
Only one post left.

261
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,080
You can read it.

262
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,080
Don't judge him if you don't know him.

263
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,000
What do you know about him?

264
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,360
He's a...

265
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,480
He's an excellent man.

266
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,760
Siyue

267
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,480
Come here.

268
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,190
It's too late to have a meal.

269
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,880
No appetite.

270
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,910
Your dad is tired. He's asleep.

271
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,310
My salary of this month.

272
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,190
Why do you get it so early?

273
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,960
It's for my good performance.

274
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,000
You should save a little.

275
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,510
Don't worry. I have scholarship.

276
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,760
It's enough.

277
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,030
You must be tired. You are thinner.

278
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,880
It's not bad.

279
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,430
I look great, right?

280
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,150
Everything will be all right.

281
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,790
Take it easy.

282
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,790
Everything will be okay.

283
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,910
It will be fine.

284
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,310
Hey,

285
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,910
wait for me.

286
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,000
You studied all afternoon.

287
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,390
You can't feel tired?

288
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,760
A lazy man can't understand.

289
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,550
Okay, you are right.

290
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,480
Your GPA is 4.0. I can't compete with you.

291
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,030
You see, there's a post about that girl again.

292
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,270
She is so popular.

293
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,120
You are mentioned, too.

294
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,640
It's none of my business.

295
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,360
Look at this!

296
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,430
Come on.

297
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,790
So beautiful, so sweet.

298
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,760
If she were my girlfriend...

299
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Nice.

300
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,430
It sounds perverted.

301
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,910
The photo is good.

302
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,030
It's taken in front of the bathhouse.

303
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,910
A stalker?

304
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,390
Oh!

305
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,390
You never heard that

306
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,960
a man pestered Xing Lufei

307
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,240
and followed her everywhere

308
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,840
last year.

309
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,310
Then the matter was dropped. We don't know who he is.

310
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,670
He returns to his old trade?

311
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,430
Hey, where are you going?

312
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,390
Back to the lab.

313
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,000
You went there just hours ago!

314
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,910
Yuan Fang the traitor.

315
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,600
How dare you get out alone at night?

316
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,430
You've met so many difficulties.

317
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,670
Why not tell me?

318
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,150
The new life you said

319
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,360
is totally an excuse.

320
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,670
You encouraged me to embrace a better future

321
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,640
only because you were afraid.

322
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,670
Just because of these things,

323
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,720
you want to dump me.

324
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,550
Ding Xian

325
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,150
Have you ever thought over

326
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,670
the relationship between us?

327
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,480
Why should I think over?

328
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,390
It's a simple thing.

329
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,720
There may be some mistakes.

330
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Your friends used to be few.

331
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,240
We two

332
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,480
may be intimate when being deskmates,

333
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,270
so you take our friendship as love.

334
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,640
Four years.

335
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,390
It's been four years, Zhou Siyue.

336
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,720
You reckon that I don't know my own feeling?

337
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,840
I've asked myself for numerous times

338
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,430
if I really like you

339
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,360
or it's just an illusion.

340
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,240
If I can assure myself

341
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,760
of a single thing in the world,

342
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,550
that should be my love to you.

343
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,840
Though you have many friends,

344
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,960
are you sure that

345
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,790
you regard me as a friend but not a lover?

346
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,240
Yes, I am sure.

347
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,000
I don't know you want to

348
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,390
deceive me or yourself.

349
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,240
We all know the truth.

350
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,190
I have to go.

351
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,390
So triggered.

352
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,880
Always beat around the bush.

353
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,430
Why not tell me your true thoughts?

354
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,310
Ask me to figure things out.

355
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,080
I do know my heart.

356
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,150
It's annoying.

357
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,760
In addition,

358
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,270
don't take that tone with me!

359
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,480
Mock at me and pull a face.

360
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,960
Let me guess every day.

361
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,670
Are you dumb?

362
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,190
Speak!

363
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,910
You orator.

364
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,670
Now you are mute like timber!

365
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,480
And you,

366
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,670
don't look at me.

367
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,600
Why are you looking at me?

368
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,430
I'm not afraid of you!

369
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,670
Sorry to be rude.

370
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,550
Sorry.

371
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,880
Will you feel too tired

372
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,000
and depressed someday?

373
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,510
What if

374
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,760
that day comes?

375
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,910
I'll help you in any case.

376
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,880
I'll be there for you forever.

377
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,080
Can you take me in?

378
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,310
The boundless sky and endless earth may pass away,

379
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,960
but his vows unfulfilled I'll never forgive.

380
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,150
Men are liars.

381
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,270
I might be crazy to

382
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,480
tell him that.

383
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,120
What should I do next time I meet him?

384
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,760
I don't know what to say.

385
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,510
Stop your complaints.

386
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,510
At least you can see him,

387
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,670
but I don't even know

388
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,880
where Song Ziqi is.

389
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,600
Our stories are tragic.

390
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,960
Ding Xian

391
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,760
I have an idea

392
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,550
to help you and myself.

393
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,030
Okay, I'm listening.

394
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,120
Tell me, why did you move?

395
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,360
I go to work and the hospital every day.

396
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,670
Always come back at midnight

397
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,790
and the gate of dormitory is closed.

398
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,120
So I rent a house

399
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
outside school.

400
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,790
What happened to you?

401
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:49,790
Fought with others.

402
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,760
Me too.

403
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,510
Got a demerit.

404
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,840
Me too.

405
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,030
I broke up with her.

406
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,480
You see.

407
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,430
I told you we were different.

408
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,600
You two haven't been together seriously yet.

409
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,310
You dare to say that?

410
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,960
Do your parents know that?

411
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,760
I told them and got a scolding from my mom.

412
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,640
You know my dad.

413
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,430
So here I am.

414
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,360
Stay away from them.

415
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,080
And what about Shadi?

416
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,720
We broke up.

417
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,360
Don't fool me.

418
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,910
You've broken up for many times.

419
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,030
It's not a joke.

420
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,760
We are serious this time.

421
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,550
She used to dump me,

422
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,080
but I dumped her this time.

423
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,390
That's my victory.

424
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,510
Come on, don't fib.

425
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,720
What can I do?

426
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,150
I can't tell her these things.

427
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,670
It's okay.

428
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,640
She can find a better boy.

429
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,430
How long do you intend to escape from her?

430
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,030
As long as you will.

431
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,190
Come on.

432
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,310
At sight of injustice with a big roar.

433
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,390
Do it when it's time to go.

434
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,480
They'll make or break your heart and soul.

435
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,960
Hey, hey, yo.

436
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,720
Let me go.

437
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
You can ask others.

438
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,150
I want to ask you

439
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,600
about the party

440
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,480
of computing department.

441
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,030
We freshmen want to invite some senior students

442
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,310
to share your experience.

443
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,030
I just want to ask your schedule.

444
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,880
Since you are busy,

445
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,720
I can...

446
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:57,880
Wait.

447
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,150
I didn't know what you wanted to ask.

448
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,120
I'm free. I can go to the party.

449
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,120
Really?

450
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,760
If you are free,

451
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,910
could you do me another favour?

452
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,670
Many senior students

453
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,240
wanna go to the party

454
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,030
because of Ban Jiayu.

455
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,030
If you want to join us...

456
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,030
I got you.

457
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,480
What can I help you? I'll do everything

458
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,000
for you if I can.

459
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,080
Okay, here he is.

460
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,480
Why did he change the job?

461
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,640
What's wrong with the restaurant?

462
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,670
Don't mention it.

463
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,760
Because of Dong Zhengfei and his gang.

464
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,240
They just went there

465
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,670
to embarrass him.

466
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,270
to embarrass him.

467
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,840
Dong failed

468
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,310
and lost his temper with Siyue.

469
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,030
He complained to the manager.

470
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,080
It's not bad in fact.

471
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,480
The restaurant is too far from our school.

472
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,760
This one is closer.

473
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,720
Now you arrive.

474
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,960
Remember to add me in the group chat.

475
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,310
Wait up.

476
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:05,880
What's up?

477
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,670
Could you bring him this?

478
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,960
There are some dishes.

479
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,840
No, he will know it if I go again.

480
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,910
Please, you are so kind.

481
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,760
Hey, man.

482
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,720
Why are you here?

483
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,000
I'm afraid that you're too busy to eat. Here is the meal.

484
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,960
So kind of you.

485
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,670
Yeah.

486
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,390
Okay, you got it.

487
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,960
She's too pitiful

488
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,510
and I can't say no.

489
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,550
But you,

490
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,030
don't deny the tea between you two.

491
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,360
You even know her handwriting.

492
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,640
Is she coming here with you?

493
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,430
She is waiting at the gate.

494
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,960
Like taking photos?

495
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,720
Never appear in front of me.

496
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,910
Thank you.

497
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,760
I didn't know he was dogging me.

498
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,199
Here you are.

499
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,600
What's this?

500
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:17,679
That's an alarm.

501
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,120
Carry it all times to prevent harassment.

502
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,159
You've known him for a long time?

503
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,679
Don't send me away.

504
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,310
I have something to ask you.

505
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,840
Kong Shadi wants to ask you

506
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,360
where's Song Ziqi.

507
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,270
Really?

508
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,920
You still have the mood to worry about others?

509
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,989
You should worry about your own safety.

510
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,880
Your photos are posted online

511
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,600
but you never mind who takes them.

512
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,270
Today he stalked you and took photos of you

513
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,990
and he would do other things to you.

514
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,550
I get it.

515
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,470
Okay.

516
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,030
Come back now.

517
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,510
I'm afraid of being alone.

518
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,120
Zhou Siyue

519
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,640
What's up?

520
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,030
I'm sure that

521
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,880
you are concerned about me.

522
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,550
You're so imaginative.

523
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,550
Can we have a peaceful and frank talk.

524
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,510
Now that you can't escape me,

525
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,920
you can tell me your true thoughts.

526
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,680
Just a moment. Thank you.

527
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,200
I have to go back to work,

528
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,990
so I will stop here.

529
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,440
Okay,

530
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,990
Lou Feng will come to me soon.

531
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,230
Zhou Siyue

532
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,950
why don't you tell me the truth?

533
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,310
Ding Xian

534
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,990
I'll study abroad in the next term.

535
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,030
You'll go abroad?

536
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,030
She entered Huaqing University for you.

537
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,990
I don't mean to poke my nose into your affairs.

538
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,440
As your friend

539
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,680
I could see her efforts to go after you.

540
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,080
Just feel that

541
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,710
she's suffered a lot for you.

542
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,030
I don't want her to go after me.

543
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,310
Well, it's a pity

544
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,400
if you let her go.

545
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,510
You used to be intimate.

546
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,440
If you let her get away, you'll regret.

547
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,360
Try to imagine yourself in my shoes.

548
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,080
I'm not eligible to

549
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,360
start a relationship.

550
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,680
It has nothing to do with

551
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,990
eligibility.

552
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,360
If you fall in love,

553
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,840
why not be together?

554
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,990
It’s easy to say that,

555
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,920
but you are also here to escape your trouble.

556
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,400
It's apples and oranges.

557
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,750
Mine is a special case.

558
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,200
No more excuses.

559
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,990
Don't persuade me. You screwed it.

560
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,920
Are you through?

561
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,310
My words are all good for you.

562
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,360
Just for your own good.

563
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,640
What are you thinking?

564
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,950
Why are you so irritable now?

565
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,470
Then you can stop it.

566
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,510
I don't want to talk about this.

567
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,310
I'm triggered enough.

568
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,470
Little Monster is braver than you.

569
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,990
She never escapes from her feeling directly.

570
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,600
And you don't escape?

571
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,550
Then why are you here?

572
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,360
Okay,

573
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,600
you win.

574
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,880
It's good for you to die alone.

575
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,270
Ding Xian

576
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,310
Ding Xian

577
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,550
Come here.

578
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,710
Please give it to Zhou Siyue.

579
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,360
I give it to him?

580
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,270
Yeah, we've asked his favour to

581
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,360
make an application,

582
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,200
and now it needs some changes.

583
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,470
It's inconvenient for you?

584
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,920
Why are you here?

585
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,880
Our president asked me to send it.

586
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,840
Okay.

587
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,550
I got it.

588
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,510
It's too late.

589
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,600
You have to go back soon.

590
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,270
I don't believe the excuse

591
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,400
you gave me last night.

592
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,600
And

593
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,160
I'm not here to force you to date with me.

594
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,950
I don't care.

595
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,470
Zhou Siyue

596
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,120
We love each other.

597
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,120
As I see,

598
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,600
there's no simpler thing than it.

599
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,160
I'll always be with you

600
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,310
no matter how many times you refuse me.

601
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,920
It's my promise.

602
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,990
I found a good fortunetelling book. Let me see yours.

603
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,880
This month is not suitable to start a relationship.

604
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,750
You'd better bide your time

605
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,200
or you'll meet your Waterloo.

606
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:11,360
Xianxian, or you sit tight.

607
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,310
Haste makes waste.

608
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,200
Stop your nonsense.

609
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,640
I won't help you two

610
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,030
if you talk rubbish again.

611
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:23,360
Hey, that's not my fault.

612
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,840
The book tells me.

613
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,990
The research group

614
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,680
sounds hard to get in.

615
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,120
Don't to mention the opportunities to go abroad.

616
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,120
I know it's difficult,

617
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,990
but

618
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,360
I can't leave him alone.

619
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,840
He has had many troubles.

620
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,270
I want to make up for my absence in his difficulties.

621
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,640
I can't part with him for these reasons.

622
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,360
What's more, I can make it.

623
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,470
I'll show him my determination.

624
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,550
God doesn't help me

625
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,440
but I can help myself.

626
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,160
Thank you, sir.

627
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,880
This is a freshman.

628
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,200
Siyue

629
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,360
She's from your senior high school.

630
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,710
Do you know her?

631
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,080
The next one.

632
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,270
Hello,

633
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,640
I'm a freshman majoring in computing.

634
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,750
I'm Ding Xian.

635
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:43,880
Why are you laughing?

636
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,750
Anything interesting?

637
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,400
Why do you want to join us?

638
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,550
I...

639
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,470
Ding Xian

640
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:16,750
What do you want to do?

641
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,550
I want to go abroad with you.

642
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,990
It's not as easy as you thought.

643
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,470
You would give up many things for it.

644
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:27,990
You're in the Comics Club.

645
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:29,990
Do you have enough time to do it?

646
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,640
I can do it.

647
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,270
I'll put much time on it.

648
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,680
You and drawing are both my pursuit.

649
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:45,920
I'm wondering that

650
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:51,310
what's your reason to major in computing

651
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,880
though you don't like it?

652
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,710
It's for...

653
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,030
For me.

654
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:10,790
You've struggled for one year

655
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:14,600
to gain admission to Huaqing University.

656
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,750
Don't do what you don't like to.

657
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,680
I hope you can think it twice

658
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,840
before you make every decision.

659
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,790
Think of what you like.

660
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,840
I've thought it over.

661
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,230
I've said that I couldn't give you up.

662
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,470
If your reason is going abroad,

663
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,080
I'll go with you.

664
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,030
I can deal with everything for you.

665
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:45,360
Never mind.

666
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,470
You don't think I can pass the entrance test?

667
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,510
I've never worried about your test.

668
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:58,120
I know you can do everything

669
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:59,880
if you want to.

670
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,640
It's no small matter.

671
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,750
As long as you're in the scientific research group,

672
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:09,600
I won't regret my choice.

673
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,920
I can make it.

674
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,230
Trust me.

675
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,600
So stubborn.
