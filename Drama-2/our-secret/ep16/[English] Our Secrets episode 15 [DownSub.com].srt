Our Secret
EP15

2
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,479
Senior

3
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,390
I'm so exhausted.

4
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,560
Really, I'm so exhausted.

5
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
It is myself who choose to be a re-attendee of College Entrance Examination.

6
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,560
I have no right to complain about this.

7
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,990
So no matter how hard it is or how exhausting it will be,

8
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,800
I cannot stop fighting.

9
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,880
But I'm also very scared.

10
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,400
I don't know whether I've made the right decision

11
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
to start all over again.

12
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,630
Xianxian

13
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,830
Compared with your peers,

14
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,630
you are good enough.

15
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,550
This is not enough.

16
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,829
It is not even close to the life I want,

17
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,160
and the person

18
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,960
I wish to follow.

19
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,710
The person.

20
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,880
You mean Zhou Siyue, right?

21
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,190
Zhou Siyue is so brilliant.

22
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,320
I used to think that we were at the same level,

23
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,440
and as long as I can work very hard,

24
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,910
I can go to the same university with him.

25
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,270
But he is too brilliant.

26
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,990
I just found out that

27
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,320
there's a large gap between us.

28
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,270
No matter how much I like him,

29
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,800
I cannot stand that I'm not good enough for him.

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,270
I'm afraid, one day,

31
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,710
someone may ask

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,240
why Zhou Siyue is

33
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,800
with me.

34
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,600
I don't think so.

35
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,800
At least,

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,630
I won't ask a question like this.

37
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,520
If I were you,

38
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,520
I won't be affected by others' voice

39
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,440
as long as I have made my determination.

40
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,079
Don't ask for too much.

41
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,550
That's the best answer.

42
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,959
Drink the milk and go to bed early.

43
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,240
Thanks, mom.

44
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,350
It's nearly midnight. Don't stay up too late.

45
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,400
Mom

46
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,430
Don't worry.

47
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,310
I'll go to bed early today.

48
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,560
Zhou Siyue

49
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,190
I miss you so much.

50
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,470
I'm so exhausted.

51
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,150
Really, I'm so exhausted.

52
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,870
School starts today, right?

53
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,240
Congratulations on becoming a student of Huaqing University.

54
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,280
I'm sorry.

55
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,190
For such a long time,

56
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,910
you have been so tired.

57
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,400
Thank you.

58
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:34,960
Hi.

59
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,240
Do you know how to get the Automation Department?

60
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,150
No, I don't.

61
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,030
What's your major then?

62
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,150
-I also major in automation.  -You major in automation, too?

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,280
Nice to meet you. I'm Yuan Fang.

64
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,240
I'm Zhou Siyue.

65
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,680
Boys and girls.

66
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,680
This is the first lesson for your new school life here.

67
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,840
I hope you can remember the eight characters

68
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,030
deep in mind.

69
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,910
Never forget our responsibility and mission.

70
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,400
You made a mistake on such an easy question?

71
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,430
Just this one.

72
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,870
You're asking too much of me.

73
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,720
You have so many excuses.

74
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,630
Silly girl.

75
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,720
What were you thinking?

76
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,960
If I did all these correct,

77
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,240
I would be the one who got 90 points.

78
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,470
So many excuses.

79
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,840
Professor Ye

80
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,909
-Good morning.  -Good morning.

81
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,080
My name's Dong Zhengfei.

82
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,190
For the member selection of the research group,

83
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,190
I've got an idea.

84
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,030
I'm thinking about designing a relevant network like this.

85
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,030
Please have a look when you're free.

86
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,350
Boy, it's good to have your own idea.

87
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,190
You can show this while attending the election later.

88
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,680
You may go back now.

89
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,960
Okay, Professor Ye.

90
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,720
Siyue

91
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,280
I'm just going to see you.

92
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,240
Professor Ye

93
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,520
This semester, you don't need to attend

94
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,840
the course of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

95
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680
I've seen your homework.

96
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,080
It's beyond my expectation.

97
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,520
So I want you to

98
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,280
concentrate on the preparation for

99
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,750
the assessment of my lab.

100
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,680
Okay. I got it.

101
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,470
How's your father?

102
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,030
He's busy with the investigation.

103
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,430
But I believe the time will soon come to reveal the whole truth.

104
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,720
Okay. Don't worry.

105
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,110
Just focus on your study.

106
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
You are a promising student.

107
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,039
Thank you, Professor Ye.

108
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,310
Zhou Siyue, are you busy recently?

109
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,190
In medical field,

110
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,080
humanoid robots can be used in prosthetic

111
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,310
and organ transplantation.

112
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,040
Making use of the technology of humanoid robot,

113
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,720
powered prosthesis can be created

114
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,920
to help realizing paralytic patients'

115
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,720
dream of walking again.

116
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,630
We have such a handsome classmate.

117
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,600
He's in Class One.

118
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,040
It's said that he was recommended for admission from Shen Hai High School.

119
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,960
He's a brilliant student.

120
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,630
So in this respect,

121
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,310
a deeper research and investigation is still needed.

122
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,360
Wait and see.

123
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,190
He's mine.

124
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,360
Thank you.

125
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,480
There you go again.

126
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,920
Bravo! Bravo!

127
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,040
Thank you.

128
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,920
Bravo! Bravo!

129
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,840
Good for you.

130
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,280
The applause thundered forth.

131
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,430
If you want to see him, just go.

132
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,310
He doesn't reply to my messages now.

133
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,080
He may be quite busy.

134
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,280
How busy can he be?

135
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,190
I'm a university student, too.

136
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,520
Just forget it.

137
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,480
I don't have time to see him.

138
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,600
Aren't you free during the National Day holiday?

139
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,720
Well, I'm free that time. But...

140
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,160
Then why are you hesitating?

141
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,960
You always want to

142
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,480
visit Huaqing University, don't you?

143
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,230
Just take this as a surprise for Zhou Siyue.

144
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,750
A surprise?

145
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,230
Where's the Automation Department?

146
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,110
Hello.

147
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,280
Hi.

148
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,310
My name's Xing Lufei.

149
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,230
I'm in Class Five of the Computer Department.

150
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,520
Can I make friends with you?

151
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,360
Well,

152
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,960
I listened to your report that day when attending the election.

153
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,230
And I think you are awesome.

154
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,550
So I want to discuss with you

155
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,790
some questions about study.

156
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,430
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,280
I'm quite busy today.

158
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,960
This is our lab.

159
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,630
At present, in China,

160
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,040
whether in terms of the equipment or technology,

161
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,990
it is in the leading position.

162
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,960
There are few such advanced laboratories

163
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,110
in the whole country.

164
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,360
Siyue, come and have a look at the equipment.

165
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,430
Sorry, I'm late. Professor Ye.

166
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,360
I went to a wrong lab just now.

167
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,230
New members are all here, now.

168
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,360
Siyue

169
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,040
As the group leader of your grade in our department,

170
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,840
you are responsible for the connecting with

171
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,870
your seniors.

172
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,080
The rest of you can visit the lab, now.

173
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,630
Okay. Thank you, Professor.

174
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,960
Professor,

175
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,190
I'm an intern team member.

176
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,430
Senior

177
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,990
Project progress data of the laboratory

178
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,080
can be found in the computer.

179
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,520
These are the relevant research topics.

180
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,840
You may read by yourself.

181
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,960
You top students

182
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,190
are all so unfriendly?

183
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,480
Why are you still here?

184
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,720
Because I'm curious about the world of you genius

185
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,990
and want to take a look with my own eyes.

186
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,040
To be honest, I think you are indeed a brilliant student.

187
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,990
As a freshman,

188
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,080
it is good enough to know

189
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,310
how to write the code.

190
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,400
While you are

191
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,230
ready to learn how to make robots.

192
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,110
What's this?

193
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,040
Don't touch things in the laboratory casually.

194
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,080
Siyue, congratulations.

195
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,360
You are the group leader now.

196
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,990
The research topic you reported last time was pretty good.

197
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,790
Thank you.

198
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,790
We can talk about it

199
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,790
someday when we are free.

200
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,040
Okay.

201
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,990
Look,

202
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,040
this is our school post bar.

203
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,840
Yeah.

204
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,310
How could this happen?

205
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,080
His son is right there.

206
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,280
He is the son?

207
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,790
Professor of Academy of Fine Arts in Huaqing University is suspected of academic fraud.

208
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,630
The son of him

209
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,630
was admitted to Huaqing University by pulling strings.

210
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,870
What's this?

211
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,630
Yeah.

212
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,110
It's him.

213
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,430
What's the matter? Are you okay?

214
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,790
I hope not.

215
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,360
Use the vulgar means of controlling the host to send information.

216
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,750
It seems that you want me to know that you did it

217
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,630
You must be mistaken.

218
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,600
I've sent a message to the phone that controls the host

219
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,720
by means of the network.

220
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,670
He posted this.

221
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
He did this.

222
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,960
Zhou Siyue

223
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,080
The academic misconduct of your father

224
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
is no news at all.

225
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,280
Stop arguing for him.

226
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,040
Hope you will never do things

227
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,310
you father has already done.

228
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,550
Finished?

229
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,600
Yeah.

230
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,520
What can you do with me?

231
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,550
Sue me?

232
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,360
Stop. Stop.

233
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,310
Stop it.

234
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,630
Calm down.

235
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,230
Yeah. Calm down.

236
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,230
Are you okay?

237
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,790
My ankle...

238
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,870
I sprained my ankle because of you.

239
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
Can't you take me to the school infirmary?

240
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,190
Let's go.

241
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,520
It hurts.

242
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,599
Zhou Siyue

243
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,150
I have to study hard for the examination.

244
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,119
Let's stop contacting each other from now on.

245
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,550
Perhaps,

246
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,960
from the moment I decided to repeat a school year,

247
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,550
the life tracks of us

248
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,030
have already been staggered.

249
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,960
I'm apart from everyone,

250
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,270
and my life gradually deviates from the original track.

251
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,480
I thought all can back to normal eventually,

252
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,270
but I forgot

253
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,390
that you have already

254
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,840
begun your new life.

255
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,790
We are about to usher in

256
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,030
December 21st, 2012.

257
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,430
It's said to be the end of the world in Mayan culture.

258
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,510
If one day,

259
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,910
we all disappear from the world,

260
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,600
who do you hope

261
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,910
to be with you that day?

262
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,910
What do you think the end of the world

263
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,390
in 2012 is like?

264
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,390
I think

265
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,360
it's just like what the movie has shown to us.

266
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,760
Earthquake, tsunami,

267
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,510
and volcanic eruption.

268
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,880
It's December 21st, now.

269
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,190
Who's with you?

270
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,640
If the end of the world is about to come,

271
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,760
I hope

272
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,670
there will be fireworks all over the sky

273
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,840
So that we can face death

274
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,760
with the last beauty.

275
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,360
The fireworks of the end of the world disappeared in the sky.

276
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,760
But it let me

277
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,390
see a new dawn on the night

278
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,910
before the coming of destruction.

279
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,720
If tomorrow is the end of the world,

280
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,550
the last one I want to see

281
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,390
is you.

282
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,720
Zhou Siyue

283
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,790
Wait for me in Huaqing.

284
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,120
Zhou Siyue

285
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,190
I'm sorry.

286
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,480
I'd like to join Dong Zhengfei's research group.

287
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,790
Okay.

288
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,120
Good luck.

289
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,670
Boss

290
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,790
Are you serious?

291
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,760
Yeah.

292
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,390
Dong Zhengfei has recruited our members like this for weeks.

293
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,310
You don't know this?

294
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,600
Our research topic is humanoid robot.

295
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,760
There are many uncertainties.

296
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,600
She feels it's hard to continue the topic.

297
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,120
Do you want me to burn her boat?

298
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,960
At first, her academic performance was at the bottom

299
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,080
and no group but us accepted her.

300
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,480
Now she has learned the skills.

301
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,600
And the research is in the middle, she kicks down the ladder now.

302
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,120
Where can I find someone else to design the drive mechanism?

303
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,150
Don't worry. It's not that difficult to find one.

304
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,510
If we depend on your relations with others,

305
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,080
it is very difficult indeed.

306
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,430
Don't you aware that

307
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,910
in the beginning you was a loner?

308
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,190
You didn't talk with others

309
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,190
and they didn't know you.

310
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,310
So they all thought you were arrogant.

311
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,640
It's only me who want to stay and be in the same group with you.

312
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,720
Yeah.

313
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,790
I should really be grateful

314
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,190
for you being there with me.

315
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,640
That's not necessary.

316
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,390
We should try to find a qualified member, now.

317
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,600
Don't worry.

318
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,480
At worst, I can just spend more time doing it myself.

319
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,840
You only sleep for five hours a day, now.

320
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,760
Are you out of your mind?

321
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,030
You know I'm tired.

322
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,670
Then go back to work now.

323
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,430
Boss

324
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,760
You see,

325
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,310
I've stayed here for two days.

326
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,720
I'm longing to take half a day off this afternoon.

327
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,510
There are many new girls in campus today.

328
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:09,960
If I miss the chance to know them,

329
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,270
I'll regret all my life.

330
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,600
Always think about this stuff.

331
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,240
Just go.

332
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,120
Thank you.

333
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,600
I'll go now.

334
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,120
I don't know Zhou Siyue's new number.

335
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,270
Do you find him now?

336
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,390
Where's Zhou Siyue?

337
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,600
I don't even know where I am now.

338
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,640
This is unbelievable.

339
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,840
All have gone

340
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,600
in such a short time

341
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,670
A girl is just over there.

342
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,000
You may go now.

343
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:43,960
Good brother.

344
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,720
Wait, wait.

345
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,240
Do you know what to say?

346
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,480
No.

347
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,910
Buddy, come here.

348
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,600
Thank you.

349
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,190
You should be obliging

350
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,150
and take the girl and her luggage to the dormitory

351
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,510
in case of others offering help to her.

352
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,640
I got it.

353
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,360
Okay. Okay. Go.

354
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,000
Come on.

355
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,000
Hi, why are you here alone?

356
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,240
You must get lost.

357
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,000
You are going to the girls' dormitory, aren't you?

358
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,390
I'll take you there.

359
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,360
I don't go to the girls' dormitory. I'm going to the boys' dormitory.

360
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,510
Don't worry. I'm not a bad guy.

361
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,000
Look. I'm a volunteer.

362
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,190
It's my duty to help you.

363
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,640
No, thanks.

364
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,720
I don't need your help.

365
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,150
It's okay.

366
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,600
It's okay. Leave her alone. You rascal.

367
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,190
You always say that you are a volunteer

368
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,760
and do such things every year.

369
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,190
But bro, just now you...

370
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,080
What? What?

371
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,150
Who's your bro?

372
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Save it.

373
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,030
There are many liars like him every year.

374
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,480
If you need

375
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,670
help and...

376
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,390
You bad guy.

377
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,790
Stop following me.

378
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
No, thanks.

379
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,840
Zhou Siyue's character and academic performance are all excellent.

380
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,910
He is handsome and modest.

381
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,240
If Dong Zhengfei gets the chance,

382
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,960
I won't agree.

383
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,880
He's not that excellent.

384
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,760
A crooked stick throws a crooked shadow.

385
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,720
I don't want to join his research group.

386
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,670
Something bad will happen sooner or later.

387
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,600
Girl

388
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,550
This is boys' dorm.

389
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Girls can't go in.

390
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,150
I know. I'm a freshman.

391
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,120
I just want to find someone there.

392
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,390
No. You can't break the school rules.

393
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,190
Just two minutes.

394
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:48,880
Why don't you listen to me?

395
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,270
Just two minutes.

396
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:49,880
No way.

397
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,510
Stop this or I'll call the security office.

398
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,880
Zhou Siyue

399
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,390
Zhou Siyue, I've come here for you.

400
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,550
There is a girl downstairs in the boys' dormitory,

401
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,840
chasing her love.

402
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,360
Really? What a love story!

403
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,720
Zhou Siyue

404
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,790
The secret hidden in the bottom of my heart

405
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,430
was carefully

406
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,600
sealed in a dusty box by me.

407
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,190
But one day the box will be opened again.

408
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,430
I thought I had forgotten everything,

409
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,550
only to realize that I never really let it go.

410
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,670
Zhou Siyue

411
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,000
Ding Xian

412
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,000
Zhou Siyue

413
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,720
Happy to see you.

414
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,000
I called you, but you didn't answer. I sent you messages and you didn't reply, either.

415
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,240
I thought you wouldn't see me again.

416
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,640
I've changed my phone number. I didn't tell you.

417
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,670
I want to say something to you.

418
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,190
Okay.

419
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,550
I like you.

420
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,760
Have you ever liked me?

421
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:05,480
Ding Xian

422
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,720
I don't want to be in a relationship right now.

423
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,510
It's getting late. You may go back now.

424
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,270
Work hard in the future

425
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,910
and don't come to me again.

426
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,910
We made an appointment to go to Huaqing University together.

427
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,910
And I worked so hard to try to follow your steps.

428
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
I made it.

429
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,880
I just want to know

430
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,640
whether you've liked me or not.

431
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,720
Liked or not.

432
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,390
Does it matter?

433
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,600
Ding Xian

434
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,840
Now we both have our own lives.

435
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,120
So what?

436
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,030
Zhou Siyue

437
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,910
Do you know my secret?

438
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,000
It's getting late. I've got to go.

439
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:45,790
Hi,

440
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:48,199
I want to ask

441
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:51,230
whether the patient in Bed 2 of Room 318 has paid the bill.

442
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,469
Wait a minute.

443
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,080
Bed 2 of Room 318, right?

444
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,920
Not yet.

445
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,880
Are you his family member?

446
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,750
You'd better pay the bill as soon as possible.

447
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:03,880
This can't be delayed.

448
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,600
Okay.

449
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:45,510
Hello?

450
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,640
Siyue, where are you?

451
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,080
Your father is ill.

452
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,400
What?

453
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,270
Now I cannot

454
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,750
even protect my families.

455
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,470
How can I be qualified to protect her?

456
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,710
Hi, dad.

457
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,950
Xianxian is so excellent.

458
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,790
You are a student of a century-old top university.

459
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,310
Have you visited the campus?

460
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,840
I'm too busy to

461
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,440
look around.

462
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,990
Hold on. You mother wants to talk to you.

463
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,030
Xianxian, have you arrived at your dormitory?

464
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,550
No, not yet.

465
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,400
I'll be there later.

466
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,550
It's near noon. Why don't you go to your dorm first?

467
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,680
What are you up to?

468
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,200
I should have gone with you.

469
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,510
Okay, mom.

470
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,840
I'll call you tonight.

471
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,080
I've got to go.

472
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,080
Don't forget to send me some photos.

473
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
Okay, mom.

474
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,950
Don't worry.

475
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,310
It was too late to get there today.

476
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,310
We'd better go earlier next time.

477
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,030
How is grandpa doing recently?

478
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,790
I heard that the winner of the gold medal in the Computer Department

479
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,200
is our direct senior.

480
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,400
What's his name?

481
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,790
It's you.

482
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:36,950
We are just talking about

483
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,470
whether our roommate is you.

484
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,880
Good for you.

485
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,600
Everyone in Class One knows you.

486
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,400
Here. Sit down.

487
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,600
No, you can sit.

488
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,400
Sit down. I'll stand here. I'm trying to lose weight.

489
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,120
Well, I'm Lou Feng.

490
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,080
I'm Ding Xian.

491
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,230
Nice to see you.

492
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,750
This is Ban Jiayu.

493
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,990
This is Xu Shasha.

494
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,990
You was dragged away by him, wasn't you?

495
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,550
I heard that the boy you like

496
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,680
is in Computer Department.

497
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,440
And he's super handsome.

498
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,120
Why haven't I heard of him before?

499
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,360
You don't know that.

500
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,550
I'll introduce the basic information to you.

501
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,550
In our department, there are two popular students.

502
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,600
One is Dong Zhengfei.

503
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,710
The other is

504
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,080
your Zhou Siyue.

505
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,160
No kidding?

506
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,080
I've heard about Dong Zhengfei

507
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,230
before the school starts.

508
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,950
But Zhou Siyue,

509
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,710
I have no impression on him.

510
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,510
Let me finish.

511
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,880
They have

512
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,470
something in common though.

513
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,550
They have totally different dispositions.

514
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,790
One is like fire

515
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,990
while the other is like ice.

516
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,030
You've just mentioned a robot...

517
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,950
Robot competition.

518
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,750
The award ceremony of the robot competition will be held tomorrow.

519
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,640
I think the winner will be Dong Zhengfei

520
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,640
or Zhou Siyue.

521
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,470
You are so noisy.

522
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,080
Never mind.

523
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,080
It's okay. I'll go with you tomorrow.

524
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,310
Start.

525
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,310
The end of the world.

526
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,400
The autumn sky is clear and the air is crisp.

527
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,120
Students from all over the country come to schools.

528
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,950
It's time to welcome new arrivals again.

529
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,400
A large number of freshmen

530
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,950
enter the university with their dreams.

531
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,640
Our reporter also followed the students...

532
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,310
No.

533
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,600
It's okay.

534
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,880
As we all know, embracing a long history, Huaqing University

535
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,790
is well-known in China

536
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,550
and it has always been the palace of knowledge

537
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,360
in the eyes of many students.

538
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,270
The Computer Department and Mathematics Department...

539
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,120
Here.

540
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,510
Eat an apple.

541
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,360
Is everything okay

542
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,550
in school?

543
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,160
Everything is okay.

544
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,470
Just rest assured and take good care of yourself.

545
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,640
That's good.

546
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,750
Don't be so tired like this.

547
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,840
You should take study as your priority.

548
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,990
Don't come here too often.

549
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,510
I'm fine.

550
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,310
Siyue is here.

551
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,640
You have left for quite a while.

552
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,200
Are you lost again?

553
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,440
Could you please think something better on me?

554
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,400
Have you found the cashier?

555
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,360
Of course.

556
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,510
Your mother is

557
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,080
qualified enough for handling all these.

558
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,680
Don't worry about this stuff.

559
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,640
Just study hard

560
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,680
and get the quota for going abroad settled.

561
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,990
Mr. Ye has told us

562
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,030
that you stand a great chance.

563
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,880
It's too early to talk about this.

564
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,920
It's not too late to think about it after dad gets well.

565
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,550
Then I'll go back to school now.

566
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,550
Call me if you need me.

567
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,840
Will you come this evening?

568
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,790
I'm kind of busy these days.

569
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,270
I'll come again on weekends.

570
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,790
You study so hard

571
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,510
and do several jobs.

572
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,270
Remember to have meals regularly.

573
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,510
Okay, I will.

574
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,080
I have to go now.

575
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,120
Siyue

576
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,510
Take good care of yourself.

577
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,360
See you.

578
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:20,400
Winning teams of the 2012 robot competition.

579
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,120
Please appoint representatives to the stage to get the awards in turn.

580
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,470
Let's welcome Li Minghao

581
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,080
and Liu Zhenghui.

582
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,950
The team from

583
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,880
the Department of Automation won the first prize.

584
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,990
Welcome

585
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,440
Dong Zhengfei.

586
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,920
Now, let's warmly welcome Professor Ye

587
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,080
to give them the awards.

588
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,360
He is just a representative to receive the award.

589
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,230
It's a team award.

590
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:55,510
Look at him.

591
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,640
It seems that he is receiving a personal award.

592
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,270
You are just jealous.

593
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,710
If you prepare for it earnestly,

594
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,400
how could he get the award?

595
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,790
Let's go. It's about to finish.

596
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,160
I now declare

597
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,160
the competition a great success.

598
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,920
Please leave in order.

599
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,270
Excuse me.

600
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,120
Sorry, I don't add strangers on WeChat.

601
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,160
Don't get me wrong.

602
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:30,310
I just want to ask that

603
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,360
you are in the same class with Zhou Siyue, right?

604
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,030
I want to see him.

605
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:38,310
It's you.

606
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,270
You are still looking for him.

607
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,080
We are in the same class,

608
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,030
but

609
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,510
we are not friends.

610
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:47,160
Classmates don't always mean friends.

611
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,680
You have come to the wrong person.
